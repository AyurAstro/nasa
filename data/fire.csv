(WFIE) - A historic Evansville home is now in need of more renovations after the Pearl Cleaners fire last Wednesday.  Water damage after the fire is just one more change in a home with a long history of changes. It’s also an extra item on a long list of renovations for the new owner.  For almost her whole life living in Evansville, the Carpenter House has been on realtor Theresa Catanese’s radar.  “I have always loved this building, have watched it for years, said Catanese. “The woodwork and the details of this building I just loved.”  Catanese said more than anything, she loves the house’s history.  “This home was tied to the Underground Railroad, and legend has it, there was a tunnel going from the house to the Ohio River,” said Catanese.  Catanese said she has been acquainting herself with the history of the home and the many changes it’s gone through over the years.  The home has stood since 1848, and over time it’s been a house, a tv and radio station, and soon to be a realty office. In each transition, change is needed.  “We were just about to close on it,” said Catanese. “We actually closed on it the day after the fire.”  Catanese said they watched from the upstairs window as crews fought the Pearl Cleaners fire right next door. Water from fire hoses seeped into the basement from a pipe carrying telephone lines.  Catanese said they just dodged the costs to pump water out, but there’s still some signs of the flooding. She says they’ll just add that to their pile of renovations.  “It’s worth it,” said Catanese. “Every dollar I put into this is just wonderful. It’s a piece of history and we’ve got to keep that history.”  When asked about that tunnel, Catanese said she hasn’t found that yet, but if you happen to know more about it, feel free to speak up.  They suspect it’s probably been covered up at some point, and they’d love to make it a local attraction.  In the meantime, Catanese suspects they’ll spend most of if not more than the next year revitalizing the home.  Copyright 2023 WFIE.

Located in the Chemult Ranger District within a footprint already planned for prescribed fire treatment, this fire offers a strategic advantage to return natural fire to a fire-adapted landscape.  The Dillon Creek Fire is burning approximately 15 miles southeast of Chemult, Ore., south of the Silver Lake Highway and east of US Highway 97.  Fire suppression resources are currently on the ground preparing containment lines to allow the fire to renew the forest landscape on 400 to 3,000 acres of restoration project area.  Fire managers can use natural ignitions such as lightning to mimic natural fire in the right conditions. The abundance of green grass this spring and coming moisture at week’s end opens this window of opportunity to reduce the buildup of surface fuels and minimize future catastrophic fires.  This natural low-intensity fire provides ideal conditions for a modified suppression strategy. utilizing natural barriers and road features to achieve fire-fighter safety, fuel reduction, and forest renewal which enhances wildlife habitat and restores nutrients while reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire. This low-intensity fire will protect this area against future extreme wildfire growth.  Fire managers employ a variety of tactics to protect forests and communities from wildfire. The Dillon Creek Fire offers an opportunity to accomplish this goal with natural tactics.  The Dillon Creek Fire lies within the Klamath River Basin Project area. The Klamath River Basin was identified as one of 21 high-risk landscapes to receive increased funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment Act and the Inflation Reduction Act in January 2023. This landscape encompasses the entire Klamath River watershed across California and Oregon. An area shared by five national forests including the Fremont-Winema.  In January 2022, the Forest Service launched the Wildfire Crisis Strategy in coordination with states, Tribes, and other partners to address wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient. By prioritizing areas around communities most at risk and then increasing treatments across the whole landscape, these projects will help mitigate extreme wildfire and eventually result in sustainable healthy forests, resistant to extreme wildfire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtsYW1hdGhmYWxsc25ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvbmF0dXJhbC1maXJlLXN0YXJ0LW9mZmVycy1mdWVscy1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktZGlsbG9uLWNyZWVrLWZpcmXSAXhodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGFtYXRoZmFsbHNuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzL25hdHVyYWwtZmlyZS1zdGFydC1vZmZlcnMtZnVlbHMtcmVkdWN0aW9uLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWRpbGxvbi1jcmVlay1maXJlP2Zvcm1hdD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Highland’s administration has been meeting regularly with PCSD 25 administration and investigation/insurance/restoration/city officials to receive progress reports and determine a timeline for next steps. Everyone has been working tirelessly to get the school back up and running. While there continue to be many unknowns and hurdles to overcome, the following information details some tentative plans moving forward.  Where will school be held for Highland during the 2023-2024 school year?  The goal for next school year is to be back home at Highland holding school on a traditional schedule. At this time, we are cautiously optimistic and on track to meet this target; however, we will continue to communicate through the summer if any delays arise that may require an alternate schedule.  What are the plans to accommodate the classes and extracurricular activities displaced by the fire?  We are working hard to identify alternate facilities and confirm space availability large enough to accommodate band, choir, orchestra, welding, P.E., weights, food service, and extracurricular activities including dance, cheer, volleyball, basketball, and wrestling. Staff, learners, and parents should anticipate that these plans will most likely become the norm for at least the next 2-3 years. Any offsite locations for classes will include transportation considerations. There are several potential spaces being explored/confirmed either through community donations or rental agreements.  What is the status of the lower gym?  Work has begun to restore the lower gym with floor replacement and other facility cleaning and repairs. Having a functional gym space is key to our ability to accommodate P.E. classes and extracurricular activities throughout this years-long process of restoration and rebuild. The timing for completion of the project is dependent on multiple factors; however, we anticipate that the lower gym will be functional by the fall.  What is the status of the cleaning/restoration process at Highland?  Classroom/Facilities Cleaning: Up to 40 people have been actively cleaning classrooms and other school facilities. Cleaning should be completed this week. All ducts and HVAC systems must be cleaned prior to occupation of the school.

The timeline for having these items in hand is dependent on availability.  What is the status of PCSD 25’s plans for rebuilding Highland?  Please note: any plans moving forward are dependent on the outcome of the replacement value as determined by the insurance adjustment process. As the district seeks to repair the damage at Highland, the Pocatello/Chubbuck School District 25 Board of Trustees will invite community stakeholders to participate in sharing ideas and, ultimately, make a decision on where we go from here. We recognize that the challenges and opportunities associated with this task warrants exploring more than one option for consideration. The district’s first priority is to fulfill its obligation to provide a safe learning environment for learners and staff throughout each stage of the restoration and rebuilding process.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE CALL VOLUME HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE. THE CHANGEOVER OFFICIALLY HAPPENS JULY 1ST. THE FIRE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS IT’LL LIKELY BE FALL BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT ON HIRING  Advertisement Gretna Rural Fire Department to become Gretna Suburban Fire, will hire paid emergency personnel Share Copy Link Copy  The Gretna Rural Fire District will begin its search for paid firefighters.Sarpy County commissioners voted Tuesday to change the department from rural to suburban as the area continues to grow.The Gretna Rural Fire Department covers the area from the Platte River to the outlet malls and Gretna city limits through an interlocal agreement.That's 71 square miles.With more of that farmland turning to front lawns, the chief said it was time to bring on paid staff.Ryan Olson mows the lawn of his new home in Gretna, surrounded by others with for sale signs. It's part of a new development as the area grows.“My girlfriend used to live in Lincoln. I lived in Bennington. Gretna was about halfway,” he said.Olson said he says he understands the explosive growth.“They're putting a lot of new things out here, new schools, the new water park that's supposed to be going in as close to the outlet mall. So, I just think it's a nice area. People feel like they can raise their families out here,” Olson said.That same growth is the reason the Gretna Rural Fire District asked the Sarpy County board to approve a change to become the Gretna Suburban Fire District.“We're really going from a rural area, certainly in the last 20 years, to a more of a suburban area. So, we're covering a lot more. We have a lot more calls,” said Fire District attorney Jim Lang.The board unanimously approved it Tuesday.“It's monumental and I think it's a good move on the part of the rural and the city,” said Commissioner Jim Warren. “It allows us the opportunity to bring on paid staff as we continue to grow in Gretna."" Gretna fire Chief Rod Buethe said his staff will now budget for how many full-time staff to hire and what they'll be paid.“The last few years have been about a 10% a year increase in call volume. We've got interstate, we've got highway, we've got industry. So yeah, we see a little bit of everything,” he said.That change means the tax levy must change too. “Right now, we are the lowest levy for a fire district and Sarpy County at 4.2 cents. This will increase the levy because we have to pay the paid personnel, so that levy will go up,” Lang said.“The taxes now are actually pretty high out here for us. So hopefully, they won't go up too much more,” Olson said.The move will combine the current 55 volunteers and paid staff. The fire chief said residents demand top-notch service, and this change guarantees it into the future.""I think it's a good idea. You know, a volunteer service. Bennington used to have one, where I used to live, and they kind of did the same thing. I think it'll get people the help they need quicker,"" Olson said.The fire department said call volume has doubled in the last decade. The changeover officially happens July 1.The fire district attorney said it will likely be fall before any movement on hiring — or calculations on how much it'll cost homeowners.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtldHYuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ3JldG5hLXJ1cmFsLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC10by1iZWNvbWUtZ3JldG5hLXN1YnVyYmFuLWZpcmUvNDM5ODIyMzjSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXR2LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9ncmV0bmEtcnVyYWwtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXRvLWJlY29tZS1ncmV0bmEtc3VidXJiYW4tZmlyZS80Mzk4MjIzOA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2022-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Flint"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T01:52:30","FLINT, Mich. (WJRT) - Michigan State Police released their investigative report on a deadly house fire on Pulaski Street in Flint, which claimed the lives of two young brothers.  Police looked into the actions of two Flint Fire Department members, who did not find the boys during a search of the house nearly a year ago. A second search crew minutes later found the boys on the second floor in a bedroom.  Ambulances rushed the boys -- 2-year-old Zyaire Mitchell and 9-year-old Lamar Mitchell -- to an area hospital, where they died from their injuries a few days later.  The fire happened on May 28, 2022, in the 600 block of West Pulaski Street.  Michigan State Police would later start an investigation to see if there was any criminal negligence by the two firefighters who admitted they just missed the boys in their initial search.  ABC12 News obtained a copy of the investigative report from Michigan State Police through the Freedom of Information Act.  The case is closed and no decision on criminal charges has been made, but at least one experienced firefighter told the investigator and an assistant prosecutor that there was no misconduct by the firefighters.  The more than 300-page report goes over everything related to the fire.  A first search of the upstairs of the home by firefighters Danny Sniegocki and Michael Zlotek showed no signs of the boys. But in a second search, the boys were found in a room that Sniegocki and Zlotek admitted they didn't search, because they didn't realize the smaller room was there.  Both firefighters declined to do interviews with the MSP investigator.  Other interviews were conducted and the detective sat down with an assistant prosecutor and the Genesee County Emergency Manager at one point. As a trained firefighter, the manager reviewed all the admissible evidence and determined that there was not any gross negligence or misconduct by the two firefighters.  New details in the report include a Michigan State Police fire investigator ruled the cause of the fire undetermined, even though former Flint Fire Chief Ray Barton said the cause was electrical shortly after the fire.  The report also includes the father of the two boys, who gave conflicting statements when he arrived at the home after the fire. He first said he was at a store, then said he was playing basketball.  Police took him into custody for a time.  The report also indicates at least four dogs were removed from the basement, that there were canine treadmills with different types of medicine and vitamins for canine consumption.  A Flint firefighter stated in a battalion chief's report that he believed one of the dogs belonged to another Flint firefighter. That particular statement went on to say the conditions in the basement were borderline abusive to the animals.  Barton has confirmed in the past that a vehicle he once owned was in the driveway of the Pulaski Street home and the report indicates he knew the family who lived there.  Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said on Tuesday that he has not made a decision on whether to file criminal charges against the former Flint firefighters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9taWNoaWdhbi1zdGF0ZS1wb2xpY2UtcmVsZWFzZS1yZXBvcnQtb24tZGVhZGx5LXB1bGFza2ktc3RyZWV0LWZpcmUtaW4tZmxpbnQvYXJ0aWNsZV8yODFkYmY3Mi1mOWFlLTExZWQtOWJkNy05Mzk1ZTE2NjA3M2EuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Courtesy Dunstable Fire Department)  DUNSTABLE — Chief William Farrell reports that the Dunstable Fire Department and mutual aid partners extinguished a two-alarm structure fire in a large commercial building on Tuesday afternoon.  On Tuesday, May 23, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Dunstable Fire Department was notified by a 911 call of a fire with a possible explosion in a commercial facility at 41 Lowell St.  The first companies on scene found smoke and fire showing from the roof and exterior walls. Chief Farrell struck a second alarm to bring additional manpower to the scene.  There are no fire hydrants in the area, so companies had to stretch several hundred feet of hose line from a nearby pond to establish a reliable water supply. Crews initially attacked the fire from outside of the building, which was closed and not occupied at the time of the fire. Crews later gained access and attacked the fire from inside the structure until the building’s roof became compromised and in danger of collapse.  There were no reported injuries.  The building suffered extensive damage to its roof and attic space.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Dunstable Fire Department, with assistance from the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit attached to the State Fire Marshal’s Office.  Firefighters from Pepperell, Groton, Tyngsborough, Townsend, Westford, Ayer, and Hudson, Hollis and Nashua, New Hampshire provided mutual aid at the scene. PrideStar EMS also responded.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight In a hearing held by North Rhine-Westphalia’s Interior Affairs Committee on Monday, regional Interior Minister Herbert Reul revealed the details of a May 11 incident in the western German city of Ratingen that involved rescue workers and armed police units and left 35 people injured. Three rescue workers are still in a life-threatening condition and five others are being treated for serious injuries.  Police went to the 10th-floor apartment after being contacted by the building manager, who said that the 91-year-old tenant had not been seen in some time and that her mailbox was overflowing. Police said it was assumed there was a “helpless person” inside in need of aid.  After finding the door blocked by cases of bottled water, police smashed a glass pane in the door, cleared the obstruction and entered the apartment where they saw the man, 57, who turned out to be the tenant’s son.  According to authorities, one of the officers drew a sidearm and told the man to lie on the ground, but the man responded by spraying the officers with a flammable liquid — possibly gasoline — and setting them alight. The man then fled to the apartment’s balcony.  “Emergency and rescue services, some of whom were still burning, ran from the 10th floor to the street,” Reul told the committee. The police officer who first entered the apartment suffered burns on 80 percent of her upper body, the regional Justice Ministry said.  Advertisement  In a subsequent search of the apartment, investigators found the severely decomposed remains of a woman in a wheelchair. “It could be the 91-year-old mother of the accused. An autopsy on her body revealed no signs of trauma other than a fracture in her lumbar vertebrae. It was probably a natural death,” the ministry official told the committee. The identity is still to be confirmed via a DNA sample.  A 73-year-old man also was found dead in another apartment in the building. It was not clear whether the cases were connected, and investigations of both deaths were opened.  The suspect had a criminal record consisting of minor assault charges in disputes with neighbors and had been fined three times but did not pay the fines. An arrest warrant was issued for him in March, but no one answered the door when police went to inform him of it. A note was left for him in the mailbox.  After the discovery of documents criticizing coronavirus vaccinations and a large supply of food with distant expiration dates, police concluded that the suspect could be part of the anti-vaccine scene and one of those preparing for some kind of doomsday catastrophe.  Authorities said there was no indication that the suspect’s attack was politically motivated or that there was any connection to the extremist Reichsbürger case, an alleged far-right conspiracy to overthrow the state that made headlines in Germany last year.

Units are fighting the fire from multiple angles including the interior and the roof of the structure.”  Deputy Fire Chief Danny Cardeso said extinguishing the fire was difficult due to the layout and area of the storage facility “as well as the amount of stuff contained within these storage units.”  The fire brought out a massive first responder presence.  Firefighters could be seen fighting the fire from multiple angles, breaking down a wall at the back of the storage facility and also focusing on the roof to get the fire under control.

The village Board of Trustees approved purchase of the trucks earlier this month. According to their resolution, the ladder truck will cost $1,977,122 and the engine will be $981,861. The volunteer portion of the fire department is chipping in $250,000 as a down payment and the rest will be financed through Community Leasing Partners.  Fire Chief Joshua Myers told the OBSERVER the department was looking to get new trucks even before he started his job as chief in April 2022.  “This is something that started before I was even hired,” he said. “Things get old and when you talk about fire engines, the one fire engine we’re replacing is 32 years old. It’s just become a maintenance disaster for us.  “It’s the same thing with the tower ladder, which was purchased used. We’ve had nothing but problems with it over its life with Fredonia,” Myers added.  The chief said it was important to get the trucks approved in May, because as of June 1, each truck will cost an additional $100,000. Approving it in May saved village taxpayers’ money, he said, and he thanked the Board of Trustees for doing so.  “It’s not like going to buy an SUV. This stuff is expensive,” he said. “It’s got a 25-year life span so we’re talking about a long-life investment.”  It will be a while until the vehicles are in the fire department’s service — Myers estimated 22 to 24 months.  Fredonia’s purchase of firefighting vehicles comes just weeks after the Dunkirk Common Council approved two new trucks for the city fire department. Like Myers, their chief, Mike Edwards, said the new equipment was badly needed to replace unreliable old vehicles.  For Myers, it’s a simple equation: “Someone calls 911, they expect us to come. We can’t have equipment break on us.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVydG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvMjAyMy8wNS9mcmVkb25pYS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtZ2V0dGluZy1uZXctdHJ1Y2tzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-04-10","Not Discerned","{""FortWorth"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T23:37:32","FORT WORTH (CBSNewsTexas.com) – Fort Worth fire crews have started rolling out again on some lower priority medical calls, a change requested after concerns a new prioritization system from the MedStar ambulance system may leave some people waiting too long for assistance.  The fire department will receive notification now for more than 30 additional situations, determined by a medical dispatcher. They include certain calls for allergies, burns, diabetic problems, overdoses and falls.  Fire Chief Jim Davis has also given his staff freedom to determine if fire response is needed on any 911 calls that roll over to the department, allowing them to dispatch a fire crew depending on the circumstances, time of day and location.  Adding fire personnel back to the calls comes after an April update to the city council on a new prioritization plan from MedStar. Designed to save resources for the most urgent calls, it reduced the number of calls in that category by 30 percent, and improved response time by about 30 seconds.  The Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association said at the time the change caused a dramatic drop in the number of calls for some fire stations. Some firefighters also began noting calls where patients were waiting for an ambulance to respond, while nearby fire stations were unaware of the call, or conditions changed during the wait and the call became a higher priority.  ""We have identified 10 or 12 call types that really seem to make sense we move the pendulum back toward the middle,"" Davis said.  An analysis from the Office of the Medical Director determined it might add back about 45 calls a day city-wide that firefighters would respond to.  That analysis also found that from 2019 to 2022, less than 1% of the type of calls added back, have needed a critical, life-saving intervention.  Sherman Dedrick, the director of governmental affairs for the Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association Local 440, said the adjustment was a start, but he expected more calls may need to be added to the list.  ""To those citizens, it's an emergency, and they deserve to get someone there in their time of need,"" he said.  Faster treatment on a non-priority call, he said, may prevent it from escalating or from needed a paramedic response at all.  The reprioritization for calls doesn't prevent fire departments for any city in the MedStar system, from going on any calls they want to go to.  Davis said reports were being reviewed daily and that he expected the response process would continue to be refined.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3RleGFzL25ld3MvZm9ydC13b3J0aC1maXJlLWNyZXdzLXJlc3VtZS1qb2luaW5nLW1lZGljYWwtY2FsbHMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3RleGFzL25ld3MvZm9ydC13b3J0aC1maXJlLWNyZXdzLXJlc3VtZS1qb2luaW5nLW1lZGljYWwtY2FsbHMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alijah McKenzie, 7, and Addyson Marshall, 5, died earlier this month after a fire at their home on the morning of May 11. Their mother, Asia McKenzie, said she believes an electrical issue sparked the fire at her home on Strand Lane.  “I was already having some electrical problems in my unit that I had expressed with CMHA (Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority),"" McKenzie said.  She said her daughter plugged her laptop into the wall and blew a fuse, resulting in a fire.  ""It cut all the electricity off inside the house immediately,"" she said. ""I didn't know where it was coming from because it was pitch black.""  McKenzie said she did everything she could to get her four children out of the house.  ""I felt helpless. I kept running back in, and kept running back in,"" she said. ""And every time I had to come back down the steps, I felt more and more helpless because I know that they were in there looking for me to come and rescue them.""  She was able to get two of her kids out safely. The other two were rescued by firefighters and taken to the hospital, but died a week later.  McKenzie and the children's grandmother, Shawnez McKenzie, said they have received an outpouring of support from the community. The home on Strand Lane is draped in balloons, flowers and stuffed animals in memory and Alijah and Addyson.  Provided by Shawnez McKenzie Addyson and Alijah McKenzie  The mom said both of her kids were incredibly special.  ""Alijah — he was one of those charismatic boys,"" she said. ""He had dimples and he can walk into a room and just smile, and everybody looks. He's always been a sweet little boy.""  Addyson, she said, was the same way.  ""Everybody loves Addison that encountered her,"" McKenzie said.  ""But very sassy — very, very sassy,"" Shawnez McKenzie added. ""I call her big little sister because she ran the household.""  The two said they knew Addyson was smart from a very young age. Shawnez McKenzie said she knew she was going to be very special.  ""I think what bothers me the most … we won't see what she would've become,” Shawnez McKenzie said.  ""She definitely would've changed the world,"" Asia McKenzie concluded.  The two siblings also had a special bond, with their grandmother calling them ""the dynamic duo.""  ""It's fitting almost, to say that they're together,"" Shawnez McKenzie said. ""They wouldn't have it any other way.""  In the aftermath of this tragedy, the McKenzie family is now taking it one day at a time.  ""I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy,"" Shawnez McKenzie said. ""Not only is she losing one, she’s losing two.""  The two said it's been difficult to see judgments and misinformation circulating about the fire on social media.  ""There’s all kinds of things out there. There’s things saying she was not home. Yes, she was home. And if some people would just have some compassion for her, I think it would go a long way,"" Shawnez McKenzie said.  But the love and support from friends, family and even complete strangers have made a difference.  ""I just want to say thank you to the city for showing so much love and appreciation for children that you’ve never met,"" Asia McKenzie said. ""I love my city. You always know when to show out. It's not been easy, but it's been comforting to know I have this support.""  The family also commended teachers and staff at Winton Hills Academy for going above and beyond to show their support in the days following the fire. They said staff went to both Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Columbus Hospital to assist the family.  There will be a joint funeral service for the two children this upcoming Saturday.

Firefighters received a report of a grass fire that was threatening several buildings at the intersection of Northeast Hillside Drive and Northeast Wheatland Drive at about 12:30 p.m., the fire department said.  Strong winds spread the fire to buildings, which prompted the Pullman Fire Department to call for help from Whitman County and Moscow fire crews, the department said.  While fighting the fire, an overhead power line fell and landed on a fire truck, causing sparks and minor damage, the department said. Avista cut the power to the line, and the truck was able to function normally.  The unit that the family of six was staying in was badly damaged by smoke and water. They're being assisted by the Red Cross, the fire department said. The adjacent unit was also damaged, but not as badly, said Mayor Glenn Johnson, who also serves as the fire department spokesman. It was unclear if residents of the adjacent unit were able to return, he said.  Another building nearby also received some heat damage, but residents were able to return after the fire was extinguished, the fire department said. Five vehicles and a boat were also damaged in the fire.  Three people were treated by firefighters for smoke inhalation but none was taken to the hospital. It was not clear if they were residents in the duplex, Johnson said.

Harold Bumgarden was on his way to deliver food and passed by an apartment building, which he noticed was on fire. He stopped and immediately began alerting residents to get out of their homes.  The delivery man said God put him in the right place at the right time.  “And there was a lady sitting outside the apartment and I asked her, I said, ‘Do you know your apartment’s on fire?’ she said, ‘Yes, I’ve got a fire extinguisher inside.’ I said, ‘That’s not going to help.’ So, I put it in park, and I ran to the apartments, started knocking on everybody’s door telling them to get out. As I was doing that I told the lady to move away from her apartment because I didn’t want no explosions,” Bumgarden said.  Sulphur Fire Chief Dan Selph confirmed the blaze started when a woman tried to smoke while on an oxygen machine.  “She was lighting her cigarette with a candle she had lit in her residence, and it ignited and was accelerated by the oxygen therapy she was using. She removed that from her person and threw it on the ground and it caught the apartment on fire,” said Selph.  He said the woman admitted it to their fire investigator.  Residents of the apartments say they likely would have perished if not for Bumgarden.  “If that DoorDash guy had not knocked on our door, we’d probably all be dead right now. It was about 15 seconds later the whole place was full of smoke. All I did was grab my cat and my guitar and I ran out there. That’s all I had time to take,” said resident Trent Stroupe.  Resident Albert Schultz agreed.  “We would have been dead from the smoke. It was a fast fire. It was hot,” Schultz said.  But Bumgarden said he’s no hero.  “I’m not the hero, God’s the hero. He put me here for a reason,” he said.  And, he said, if there’s a lesson from the fire: “Don’t smoke with an oxygen mask on.”  Fortunately, officials say the woman was not injured when the fire erupted. Residents said a kitten in the woman’s apartment apparently died.  Sulphur officials told us this is not the first time a fire started when someone smoked while using oxygen.

"fire","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T21:33:14","National Guard officials are gearing up for what they anticipate will be a hectic year mobilizing troops for disaster responses. Right now, more than 8,000 service members are deployed supporting domestic missions within the United States as storms and wildfires become more powerful and frequent due to climate change.  The bulk of those thousands of soldiers are National Guardsmen, many of whom are already combating wildfires in California and Colorado and preparing for Super Typhoon Mawar, a massive storm that local officials say will be ""catastrophic"" and is expected to smash into Guam.  Guard officials held a press conference Tuesday in which senior officers updated the press on issues facing the force, with preparation for natural disasters taking center stage. The issue has become central to the Guard's mission.  Read Next: VA Claims Backlog Expected to Grow to 400K, Largely Due to the PACT Act  ""Planning and preparing for disruptions to critical infrastructure from hostile actors or climate change is key to developing resilience in the homeland,"" Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the National Guard's top officer, said last year.  On Tuesday, officials said calls to the Guard for help are only growing.  ""The demand for the Guard for domestic activities has increased. It's safe to say that, in the post-Katrina environment, the goal is to not be late,"" Brig. Gen. Jonathan Beddall, who oversees the Guard's domestic response missions, told reporters Tuesday. ""The repetitions and sets become more frequent and refined so we can respond more quickly.""  Hurricane Katrina in 2005 served as a moment of change for the military, and particularly the National Guard, in how troops could be utilized in noncombat emergencies. The hurricane, one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, claimed some 1,800 lives.  Fifteen years later, the Pentagon would be needed in another massive response: The COVID-19 pandemic effectively deployed the entire National Guard -- tasking soldiers with manning hospitals, delivering food to low-income communities, and administering COVID tests and vaccinations. The Guard would immediately transition into responding to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection to protect the U.S. Capitol after rioters attempted to violently keep then-President Donald Trump in power after he lost the election.  Those increased responsibilities placed on the Guard in recent years come as the force has reduced in size since the peak of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Governors saw the Guard's response to the pandemic and have subsequently been increasingly using the force to respond to protests and even missions outside the military's typical portfolio, such as filling in for a substitute teacher shortage and driving school buses.  But the underlying cause of more missions within the United States is climate change. Rising temperatures are making storms more violent and frequent and set the conditions for wildfires, both of which have ramped up in recent years and are expected to continue becoming even more frequent and disastrous through the next century.  Wildfire season is when the conditions are most ripe for out-of-control fires to spread in the wilderness and sometimes into residential areas. That season used to be about five months long, most of that being in the summer, but grew to seven months in the 1970s, starting earlier in the spring and lasting through a chunk of fall, according to the Department of Agriculture.  Likewise with hurricanes, the season for powerful ocean-based storms starts in June and extends into late November. Experts have warned that hurricanes have become more extreme and frequent over the past 40 years, a troubling trend that's only expected to ramp up.  ""We have three storms coming in. We have a hurricane in the mid-Atlantic that's a strong Category 5. We have another Category 3, growing into a Category 5, crossing the Virgin Islands and [making] landfall in Puerto Rico, and we have a late season storm building in the Gulf of Mexico which can become very, very large, very quickly and cross into New Orleans,"" Maj. Gen. William Prendergast IV said Tuesday, referencing future hurricane models.  -- Steve Beynon can be reached at Steve.Beynon@military.com.

You didn’t want to inhale any of the grayish particles that surrounded you. But ash is strong stuff. It adheres to your skin, finds its way into your nasal passages and clings to your clothes as stubbornly as cheap Christmas tree tinsel. Ash — whether on a hearth or in an urn — beckons you to remember what once was and taunts you because it will never be again.  In his absorbing new book, “Built From the Fire: The Epic Story of Tulsa’s Greenwood District, America’s Black Wall Street,” Victor Luckerson combs through layers of soot and ash, the physical and psychological residue of the Tulsa race massacre, which continues to haunt the city’s Black community more than a century after it occurred.  Over the course of two days in the spring of 1921, Tulsa’s Greenwood district was destroyed and hundreds of its residents were killed. Heralded as a model of Black entrepreneurial success and self-determination in the Jim Crow era, Greenwood became a target of violence when a rumor spread that Dick Rowland, a Black teenager, had sexually assaulted a white woman in an elevator. A show of force by Greenwood men to prevent Rowland from being lynched escalated into an all-out attack on Black Tulsans by white vigilantes, who in some cases had been handed arms by the police. As Luckerson recounts, “More than 1,200 houses were leveled, nearly every business was burned to the ground and an unknown number of people — estimates reach as high as 300 — were killed.”  Luckerson, a journalist based in Tulsa, adeptly takes us through Greenwood’s history, resisting the impulse to glorify its founders or endorse the idea that more Black-owned businesses can repair the ravages of racial capitalism. Instead, he introduces a bevy of figures who, seeking escape from the post-Reconstruction South, went to Tulsa in the early 1900s and helped establish Greenwood as the “Eden of the West.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L2J1aWx0LWZyb20tdGhlLWZpcmUtdmljdG9yLWx1Y2tlcnNvbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Steps to Stay Safe this Summer  As we head outside to enjoy the sunshine and warm weather this summer, the Red Cross offers 20 steps you can follow to stay safe.  Do your plans include a road trip? With more people on the roads, it’s important to drive safely.  1. Be well rested and alert, use your seat belts, observe speed limits and follow the rules of the road.  2. If you plan on drinking alcohol, designate a driver who won’t drink.  3. Avoid distractions such as cell phones.  4. Use caution in work zones. There are lots of construction projects underway.  5. Turn your headlights on as dusk approaches or during inclement weather. Don’t overdrive your headlights.  Drowning can happen quickly and silently. Unless rescued, it could take as little as 20 to 60 seconds for a drowning person to submerge.  6. Prevent unsupervised access to water, provide constant, active adult supervision and know how to swim.  7. Swim in an area with lifeguards.  8. Designate a “water watcher” whose sole responsibility is to keep a close eye and constant attention on everyone in and around the water until the next water watcher takes over.  9. Don’t just pack it, wear your life jacket — always on a boat and if you are in a situation beyond your skill level.  10. Reach or throw, don't go! In the event of an emergency, reach or throw an object to the person in trouble and tell them to grab on to it. Don’t go in! You could become a victim yourself.  Summer is a great time for a picnic. Be careful grilling, which causes 10,000 home fires every year.  11. Wash your hands, utensils and workstation before preparing the food.  12. Separate uncooked meats, poultry and seafood from ready-to-eat foods like salads, fruits, vegetables, cheeses and desserts. Use separate plates and utensils to prevent cross-contamination.  13. Always supervise a barbecue grill when in use and never grill indoors. Keep the grill out in the open, away from the house, deck, tree branches or anything that could catch fire.  14. Make sure everyone, including pets, stays away from the grill.  15. Don’t leave food out in the sun. Keep perishable foods in a cooler with plenty of ice or freezer gel packs.  Camping is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the U.S. Being prepared for emergencies is critical when you’re headed to an area with limited access to phone services and help.  16. Know the ability level of the people in your group and the environment around you. Plan accordingly.  17. Pack a first aid kit to handle insect stings, sprains, cuts and bruises and other injuries.  18. Sprains and falls are some of the most common misfortunes travelers may face. Dehydration is also a danger. Take a Red Cross first aid and CPR/AED course and download the free First Aid app so that you will know what to do in case help is delayed.  19. Share your travel plans and locations with a family member, neighbor or friend.  20. Bring nutritious food items and water, light-weight clothing to layer and supplies for any pets.

"fire","2019-05-18","Not Discerned","{""CleElum"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T04:43:00","The current shelter, carried by all wildland firefighters, was designed by the U.S. Forest Service in 2002.  Example video title will go here for this video  SEATTLE — Wildfire smoke from Canada covering the skies of western Washington in May is a stark reminder of the change in recent years in wildfire behavior.  As we head into the 2023 wildfire season, elite current and retired firefighters and wildland fire experts tell the KING 5 Investigators the federal government needs to develop a better version of the equipment meant to save firefighter’s lives in acute emergencies – the fire shelter.  Fire shelters are portable, tent-style blankets, considered the last resort for firefighters who become trapped by flames, without a safe route out. The current shelter, carried by all wildland firefighters, was designed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in 2002. There have been some modifications, but the shelter has essentially remained the same for two decades.  Washington and California wildland firefighters interviewed said the federal government should get serious about developing a better shelter, especially because climate change has created fire seasons that are longer and more intense.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, “human-caused climate change” led the number of large wildfires in the western United States to double between 1984 and 2015.  “You have to think about all the technological advancements in the world in the last two decades,” said a 40-year veteran wildland firefighter from California. “You think about even our telephones and how far they’ve come, so why don’t firefighters have something more advanced?”  “I love the United States. I love the fire service, but we are not where we need to be (with shelters),” said retired smoke jumper Jason Ramos of the Winthrop area who fought fires for 33 years.  Ramos has been a vocal advocate for better life saving equipment for people on the front lines. In 2016 he wrote a book, “Smokejumper,” that criticized the limitations of the current shelter.  “There’s no excuse for a piece of safety equipment not doing what it was designed to do – every time,” wrote Ramos in his book.  According to the USFS, the 2002 shelter referenced by Ramos, known as the new generation shelter, offers greater protection from the original design from the 1960’s. The new generation shelter “will provide improved protection from radiant heat and flames,” wrote Forest Service Equipment Specialist Tony Petrilli in 2003.  But according to government documentation, the adhesive holding the layers of the shelter together begins to break down at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Wildfires at ground-level burn between 1,800 and 2,000 degrees.  “Over 500 degrees and the shelters are nothing more than glorified tin foil,” said a retired Washington state smoke jumper with four decades of experience who asked not to be named. “Many wildland firefighters are young college students who work in the summer. They aren’t well trained and don’t have the experience to really understand the limitations of our current shelter.""  Representatives from the USFS said their wildland firefighters are trained to know fire shelters are not survivable in every situation.  “All wildland firefighters are trained that carrying a fire shelter should never be considered a justification to take on risk. Instead, wildland firefighters are trained to evaluate, mitigate, and manage hazards through developing risk-based firefighting strategies. Wildland firefighting has inherent dangers, but the Forest Service's core value of safety and the agency's focus on evaluating and mitigating hazards is part of our risk management culture,” wrote Wade Muehlhof of the USFS National Press Office in a statement.  Research by the KING 5 Investigators shows approximately 50 firefighters have died attempting to use their fire shelters since 1990. Approximately half died using the original shelter, including four firefighters working on the Thirty Mile Fire in eastern Washington in 2001. The other half died using the new generation version. That number includes 19 elite firefighters who died trying to use their shelters after getting trapped on the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona in 2013.  Map: Firefighter deaths involving shelter deployment  “For the extreme fire conditions we work in nowadays, you see the fuels, you see the fire activity. Do you want to make operational decisions thinking that shelter’s going to save you? I would not bet on that,” Ramos said.  A deadly wildfire in 1994 inspired research that eventually led to the new generation shelter. That year, 14 firefighters from Oregon and Idaho, armed with the original shelters from the 1960’s, lost their lives on Storm King Mountain in Colorado.  Two months after the tragedy a California-based aeronautical engineer, Jim Roth, started researching ways to build a shelter than the one designed in the 60’s. His brother, 29-year-old Idaho smokejumper Roger Roth, was among the fallen on Storm King Mountain.    “Here it is, almost 30 years later, but I feel like it was yesterday,” said Roth. “I was very, very angry. How he could be taken away at such a young age? I just thought ‘OK, show me, show me (God), what do you want?’ And that’s when the lightbulb went on and I said: ‘OK, I get it.’ That’s when I realized (with my background) I can (create a better shelter).”  Roth traveled the world, collaborating with other scientists, gathering data on thermodynamics, fire behavior, and material tolerance. He altered his entire life’s purpose – to create a shelter survivable in any condition. To carry out his vision, Roth began a company dedicated to his brother: Storm King Mountain Technologies.  “I didn’t do anything with fire until I lost my brother. And it totally changed my life,” Roth said.  After Roth launched his project to improve on the old shelter, researchers at the USFS did as well. By 2002 Roth had designed a prototype that could withstand a heat load of 1,800 degrees. The Forest Service came up with a design that started to break down at 500 degrees. With both versions on the table, a panel of government officials chose the government version.  “It ended up being a political decision. And they went with the Forest Service fire shelter,” Roth said. ""It's still inadequate. It's not made to handle these environments that we (now) see in wildfires.""  Officials from the USFS said their design was lighter in weight, easier to open, and had a tougher outer foil shell, especially during windy conditions.  “(The SKM design) showed significant delamination of outer foil during (extended) flame exposure,” wrote scientists at the time.  Forest Service representatives also said the SKM design showed more damage when “shaken vigorously to ensure they would hold up to deployment and turbulence.”  From the beginning, fire shelters have saved lives. According to the Forest Service, the old-style shelter prevented 300 injuries and saved 300 lives between 1964 and 2009.  Between 2004 to the present, the Forest Service says the new generation shelter has prevented 114 injuries and saved 61 lives.  In 2008, three Forest Service firefighters were saved while working on the Indians Fire in Central California. The men became trapped and disoriented in the chaos of a fire tornado. They thought there wasn’t a way out.  “I looked at the pavement and thought this is it, this is it for us,” said Engine Captain Roberto Moreno.  Moreno said he knew it was time to deploy their shelters. They threw their shelters over their heads and walked out of the danger zone backward. They were burned, but alive.  “(It) was a big relief (to have the shelter’s protection). At that time, I was able to breath. It was cool underneath the fire shelter, so we just turned around and just started walking back with (them over our heads),” said Moreno.  “Yes, they’ve saved some lives, I’m not arguing that. But why are we not having the best?” said Ramos, the retired smoke jumper. “We want to be varsity. Why are we giving firefighters some JV gear?”  In 2014 the Forest Service launched a fire shelter review project. They worked with 23 different organizations on the effort, including engineers from NASA. Forest Service representatives said hundreds of materials were tested during the five-year review. In the end, government officials decided to stick with the 2002 design, saying “the current fire shelter model continues to provide the most practical amount of protection given tradeoffs of weight, volume (bulk), durability, and material toxicity.”  Currently, there is no organized effort to improve the 2002 shelter, but Forest Service representatives said they will always listen to and pursue new ideas.  ""NTDP (the National Technology and Development Program) continues to evaluate materials, material combinations, adhesives, and shelter designs, always working towards the goal of making a better fire shelter for firefighters,” wrote Muehlhof of the USFS.  Jim Roth said in 2023 the shelter he developed in the 1990’s is now out of date due to advancements in materials. He said a re-design is necessary, which would take research, development, and input from the best minds possible.  “That’s the only thing left in life that I have to do, is develop that fire shelter,” Roth said. I’ve been working on it for 30 years. I’ve done it once before. I can do it again. I’m not getting any younger, so now’s the time to really make it happen. I want to get a fire shelter that works in every wildfire into the hands of the firefighters who are putting their lives at risk.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW5nNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2ltcHJvdmVkLWZpcmUtc2hlbHRlcnMtd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29ucy1tb3JlLWRlYWRseS8yODEtNzY2NmU1OTgtZjc0Mi00MWM2LThjMTgtNDk0ZGRhODZiYWEx0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2ltcHJvdmVkLWZpcmUtc2hlbHRlcnMtd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29ucy1tb3JlLWRlYWRseS8yODEtNzY2NmU1OTgtZjc0Mi00MWM2LThjMTgtNDk0ZGRhODZiYWEx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A cause for the fire was not identified, but “company officials are conducting a thorough investigation into this incident,” Stephens said.  Within two hours, emergency crews had managed to contain the fire and were working to extinguish it, Garvin County Undersheriff James Richardson told The Oklahoman. Two refinery employees were injured and flown by helicopter to a hospital for treatment, Richardson said.  Stephens did not disclose the severity of the employees’ injuries or their conditions, but said “all other employees have been accounted for.”  Garvin County Emergency Management director Dave Johnson said during a news conference that the area is safe.  ""There's no threat to the community; there's no issue outside of the refinery,"" Johnson said. ""The part (of the refinery) that was impacted and secure is shut down, but the rest of the refinery is safe and running.""  Johnson said nearby U.S. Highway 77 and a section of railroad were shut down briefly as a safety precaution, but both were being reopened.  The refinery is a small crude oil refinery that stores waste produced during refining operations, according to Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality records.  DEQ spokesperson Erin Hatfield told The Associated Press the agency is investigating the fire and potential hazards, but was immediately focused on making sure the fire is extinguished.  The Oklahoman previously reported several explosions at the refinery between 2006 and 2012.

"fire","2023-07-09","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T21:13:20","WATERVILLE — The independent senior living complex that caught fire Monday, resulting in the death of a 65-year-old man and displacing 48 people, did not have a sprinkler system because the safety measure wasn’t required when the building was constructed in 1971.  Ronald Kennerson died in the fire, according to Lt. Thomas Pickering with Maine State Police.  “I can confirm that FMO (Office of State Fire Marshal) is still investigating to determine the cause of the fire, but there is no evidence or indication of foul play,” Pickering said in a statement Tuesday evening. “The building did not have a sprinkler system.”  He said there was no further comment.  Diane Townsend, executive director of the Waterville House Authority, which owns and manages the seven-story, 50-unit building on Elm Street, said earlier Tuesday that a sprinkler system was not required when the building was constructed 52 years ago.  Townsend said each unit has a metal, well-sealed fire door to help prevent fire spread.  “The other thing is, the building was built as a whole block of cement rooms stacked on top of each other,” Townsend said Tuesday. “The whole thing is essentially cement. That’s the other reason we fared as well as we did.” She was referring to the fire’s not spreading more than it did.  Advertisement  Built with federal Housing and Urban Development money and dedicated in 1972, the building remained unoccupied on Tuesday, as there was smoke and water damage throughout the structure, Townsend said. The local fire and code enforcement departments will determine when people can move back in, and a company called ServiceMaster is assessing what needs to be done to make it habitable, including whether the units can be dried out, how much cleaning is needed and whether Sheetrock needs to be removed, according to Townsend. She said the building is insured.  Kennerson lived on the fourth floor. The building has eight units on each floor, from floors two through seven, and two handicapped accessible units on the first floor, where there is also a community room, according to Townsend.  The fire marshal’s office worked with Waterville police on the fire investigation. Waterville fire Chief Shawn Esler said Tuesday that his department is not taking part in that investigation and he had not yet received a report from the fire marshal’s office.  Firefighting foam that was used to battle the fire seeped into the public water system, leading the Kennebec Water District to issue an advisory Monday warning people not to consume public water. The advisory was lifted Tuesday after testing showed the water system was free from contamination. A backflow prevention device was placed in a wrong location when the building was constructed and that allowed the foam to spread into the water system.  Related Water advisory lifted as officials say public water in Waterville area safe to consume again  “What we have in place is what we’ve been told to have in place,” Townsend said. “We haven’t been approached about changing anything.”  Esler said the fire department expects a fire suppression system to perform as such, and firefighters expect that it is separated from the public water supply. Not knowing the suppression system wasn’t separated from the water supply, crews put about a gallon of foam into the system to help suppress the fire, he said.  Advertisement  He reiterated a statement by Roger Crouse, general manager of the Kennebec Water District, that the water contamination was not the fault of the fire department. Esler said if the department had done something wrong, he would have been the first person to say so. He said the department feels badly about the situation.  “There is some perception out there that we made a mistake or we caused this, and that’s simply not true,” Esler said. “It’s an unfortunate circumstance that occurred.”  He said the department views the water situation as a serious event and “we will work hand in hand with the water district to make sure that this doesn’t happen again.”  About 35 firefighters responded to the scene from area towns, but initially, not enough firefighters were present to be able to rescue everyone in the building, according to Esler. “I’m not really grandstanding for staffing, but I think a daytime emergency certainly played a factor here,” he said.  The majority of those who are members on Waterville’s call force work other jobs during the day in other communities and can’t get to the scene, he said, adding that he thinks that’s a factor for all fire departments that rely on call firefighters and volunteers.  Townsend said some building tenants are staying with family, and Best Western was able to get all the others into one hotel in Augusta, which was critical to making sure they get the help they need. They will be housed there for at least five nights, she said.  Advertisement  Townsend said Waterville Public Schools provided a bus to take the tenants to Augusta and Delta’s wheelchair transport drove a couple of tenants who needed it.  “I can’t say enough about everybody who has been involved,” she said, citing fire and police officials, Delta, Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, Best Western and her own staff, which has “really stepped up. I’m really proud of them.”  She said churches have been providing clothing for displaced tenants and other people are providing personal necessities.  Townsend said people have been asking if the building insurance covers the contents of tenants’ apartments and she wanted to emphasize that it does not. Tenants may buy renters insurance for a small sum and officials tell them that when they move in, she said. She said the cost for such insurance is minimal — one tenant with the insurance said the cost is about $6 a month.

According to officials, the fire broke out at a home on Lafayette Street Tuesday at around 3:05 a.m.  Officials tell News 12 the seven occupants self-evacuated from the home as first responders arrived.  A total of 60 firefighters from nine different departments were on the scene and officials say the fire was under control within 90 minutes.  ""The fire was heavily involved, blowing out all the windows of the structure…almost impossible to get anybody inside to try to affect a rescue,"" said Mike Uttaro, Nassau's chief fire marshal.  Officials tell News 12 a body was located inside the home. The victim was later identified by family as 60-year-old Kashmira Patel.  According to the family, the home's occupants were in town from India for the funeral of another family's patriarch who died last week. Patel was the daughter of the male family member who recently died.  The family says all those who were hospitalized due to the fire have been released.  ""We are just all devastated. In shock. Obviously, we didn't expect this. Waking up to screams that everybody needs to get out. It's just horrifying,"" said survivor Bhumi Patel.

""We are living in one of the best countries in the world, the United States of America, and we are with these services from the fire department and police department,"" said Tarun Patel. ""There's nothing to do to run over?""  Fire officials say the heavy fire and smoke conditions made the second-floor collapse, making it impossible for firefighters to get inside.  Uttaro says there were other challenges, including a downed live power line blocking the front door and a malfunctioning fire hydrant nearby on Herricks Road. He says firefighters were forced to tap into another hydrant further down the block.  ""It does seem like an eternity, especially with a loved one inside and out hearts go out to the family, but again, the fire department, the police department did everything humanly possible that they could,"" Uttaro says.  The cause of the fire has not been determined.

"fire","2019-07-03","Not Discerned","{""WestSeneca"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T21:20:39","Maybe you’ve seen them on social media or in neighborhood backyards. Smokeless fire pits like the Solo Stove are hot, so to speak. But how smokeless are they, really?  Consumer Reports put some of the bestsellers to the test to find out which ones make building, tending to, and cleaning up a backyard fire easier and safer.  Popular backyard fire pits—often called smokeless fire pits—like the Solo Stove conjure up images of a roaring outdoor fire sans smoke.  Consumer Reports just tested seven of them. Here’s a quick takeaway.  It’s a misnomer to call them smokeless; they’re less smoky. You will always have some smoke; that’s the nature of burning wood.  But the way these fire pits are designed, there’s less smoke once the fire really gets going, especially when compared with a traditional campfire.  In its tests, CR started lots of fires, noting how fast each fire pit lit and how effectively it burned.  For the ones that did well in the ratings, you can have a small fire or a large one, they start quickly so that they’re out of the smoky phase sooner, and they burn wood completely so that there’s not a lot of clean up afterward.  Consumer Reports found the Solo Stove left behind lots of wood, and cleaning it up wasn’t as easy as with some of the other fire pits.  The top performer was the Cuisinart Cleanburn Fire Pit, which starts around $249.  Yes, the kitchen appliance brand, Cuisinart! It’s fast to light and it burns wood more thoroughly than any other model tested, so there’s less waste and less mess.  If you want to skip chopping and lugging around firewood, the Inno Stage Smokeless Fire Pit for $79 burns wood pellets instead.  And while it’s not as easy to clean as the other two fire pits, the Blue Sky Outdoor Living Peak Smokeless Fire Pit PFP2416 for about $215 can burn pellets or logs.  And remember, no matter what type of fire you’re enjoying, keep it safe.  Place your pit on an uncovered, hard flat surface at least 20 feet away from anything flammable.  CR says avoid placing any fire pit on your deck.  The heat could cause wood to catch fire or melt composite decking materials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXRlc3RlZC1zbW9rZWxlc3MtZmlyZS1waXRz0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94Nm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy90b3AtdGVzdGVkLXNtb2tlbGVzcy1maXJlLXBpdHMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s because the town has seen hundreds of water main breaks in the past couple of years.  As a result, town officials are putting a stop to using hydrants until a solution is found.  “We’ve put in an emergency order to not use the fire hydrants at this time,” said Town Supervisor Scott Allen.  He says the town has seen about 300 water main breaks in the last four years. In the last few weeks, there have been more than a dozen.  “It’s a lot of water main breaks for the town and a lot of cost to the town,” he said.  Allen says the order, sent to local fire departments, will help prevent further water main breaks and keep water flowing to residents and businesses.  “I actually received the letter yesterday, but was notified a week, week-and-a-half ago about the issues with the water main,” said Northpole Fire Chief Chris Hanlin.  He says using the hydrants could make a tough situation much worse.  “We flow so much water out of it if there’s a hole somewhere in it, it’ll collapse the pipe and they’ll have to replace the whole line,” he said.  Chief Hanlin says town of Pamelia residents shouldn’t be concerned about the lack of fire hydrants. He says the Northpole Fire Company typically takes its 2,000-gallon tanker to every call.  “When we respond to a working fire, vehicle fire, structure fire, we usually take our tanker anyway, so it’s really not any different for us. We just carry our water with us as opposed to getting it from the hydrant,” he said.  The town is currently undergoing a $22 million project to replace and add water lines. But the area where some of the breaks have been concentrated isn’t part of that project.  Allen says the town will work to get the hydrants back online, but he doesn’t know when that will be.

Walker said no injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is under investigation by the Office of State Fire Marshal.  The fire started in the barn and made its way into the house, Walker said. Wind gusts blew the flames across Route 17, which also caused a brush fire.  “It jumped (Route) 17 and started a fire on the other side,” Walker said. “The wind was blowing it hard.”  At nearly 5 p.m., Walker said crews were still finding hot spots to put out in the house.

A passerby called Jackson Fire after seeing flames coming from a residential building, said Cpt. Joe Smith.  Heavy flames and smoke were pouring out of the home’s windows as police and fire crews arrived at the scene, Smith said.  A resident who had managed to escape the burning building spoke with firefighters. Due to a slight language barrier, fire crews were unsure if any of the man’s roommates were still in the home, Smith said.  “Crews did an aggressive interior search and ended up not finding anybody -- the people believed to be inside were not there,” Smith said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for about three hours, Smith said.  Smoke and fire damage throughout the house was significant, Smith said, adding the building will not be inhabitable for some time. It is unknown if the residents are seeking help with the American Red Cross.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Smith said.

The match will be the first-ever competitive meeting between the two teams, with an Open Cup Quarterfinal berth on the line. Kickoff is set for 8:00 p.m. CT.  Tune-In  Austin FC Outlook  Austin picked up a pair of statement wins last week, earning a 2-1 road result over Seattle and a 1-0 home victory against Toronto. The Verde & Black have moved back above the playoff line as the team finds itself in its best run of form so far this season, with a 3-1-1 record across its last five games in all competitions.  Gyasi Zardes was a driving force behind the six-point week, scoring the winner in both matches. The team, anchored by the center back trio of Julio Cascante, Alex Ring, and Leo Väisänen, held Toronto to zero shots on target and just 0.21 xG on Saturday. Aleksandar Radovanović also impressed in his first Austin FC start in Seattle, winning 100 percent of his aerial duels.  With attention now turning to the Open Cup midweek, Austin will once again need contributions from the entire squad as it prepares for its sixth match in 19 days. Left back Adam Lundkvist is just one of several players who have stepped up during that busy stretch.  Lundkvist picked up an assist in Austin’s Round of 32 Open Cup match against New Mexico United, then set up Ethan Finlay’s opener against Seattle. While it doesn’t show up on a stat sheet, his initial cross created the chaos that led to Zardes’ game-winner vs. Toronto, and his thunderous volley earlier in the match was close to flying in and becoming a goal of the season candidate.  If Austin are victorious on Wednesday night against Chicago, Head Coach Josh Wolff’s side would find itself three wins away from lifting the Open Cup.  Chicago Fire FC Outlook  Though Austin and Chicago have no matchup history between them, the Fire are one of MLS’ most historic clubs, having joined the league in 1998. They’ve also won the Open Cup four times, including twice when Josh Wolff was a player there in 1998 and 2000.  To reach the Round of 16 in this year’s edition of the competition, the Fire defeated fellow Windy City side Chicago House AC 3-0 in the Third Round and St. Louis City SC 2-1 in the Round of 32. In league play, the team had a rocky start to the season which saw the departure of Head Coach Ezra Hendrickson.  Frank Klopas replaced Hendrickson and won his first two games in charge, though those victories were followed by a loss at Charlotte and a home draw with Atlanta. In all, Chicago has been a different team home and away, going unbeaten through 10 home matches across all competitions but with just three total points from five games on their travels.  Former Liverpool and Bayern Munich man Xherdan Shaqiri is undoubtedly the biggest name on the Fire’s roster. MLS veteran Kei Kamara leads the team with four goals though, and Kacper Przybylko is another one to watch for up front.

"fire","2020-05-25","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:00:00","MARINA, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management is issuing seasonal fire restrictions effective Thursday, May 25, for public lands managed by the Central Coast Field Office, primarily located in western Fresno, Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties, due to dry conditions and wildland fire danger. These seasonal restrictions are in addition to the year-round statewide fire prevention order, issued on April 28, 2020. This seasonal fire order will remain in effect until further notice.  On average, human-caused wildfires make up 95 percent of all wildfires in California. Records show recreational target shooting has sparked more than half the wildland fires within the Central Coast Field Office boundary in the last decade. Many of these wildfires occur close in proximity to roadways, communities and recreational areas, posing considerable threat to public safety. Taking individual responsibility to reduce wildfire risk, while recreating on public lands, around homes and communities, before a fire occurs can help keep property, the public and firefighters safe.  “Due to drying conditions, significant dead and dying grasses and high fire danger, it has become necessary to implement additional fire restrictions,” advises Central Coast Field Manager Zachary Ormsby. “We ask for your cooperation to help minimize fire potential. These proactive measures are put in place to protect public land visitors, communities, adjacent private lands, and natural resources from the risk of wildfire.”  An increase in wildfire severity is expected based on forecasted climate scenarios, as well as an expansion of wildfire season over much of the western United States. The following restrictions will remain in place until the fire danger subsides:  No Campfires, briquette/charcoal barbeques, or stove fires are allowed outside of agency-provided fire rings or barbeques at designated developed recreation sites.  No Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, or a developed campground with a three-foot diameter area clear of brush and all flammable materials.  No welding or operating acetylene or other torch with open flame.  No motorized vehicles or tools powered by internal combustion engines off designated roads or trails.  No target shooting, except with a state of California hunting license and in accordance with California hunting regulations. The use of any steel-jacked, steel core or incendiary ammunition of any caliber is prohibited. Visit www.wheretoshoot.org for alternative recreational target shooting locations. Exploding targets or metal used for recreational shooting is prohibited.  As always, possessing, discharging or using fireworks or pyrotechnic devices are prohibited across Bureau of Land Management lands. Additionally, a valid California Campfire Permits is required to operate a stove or fire on these public lands.  HELP PREVENT FIRES  Residents and visitors are reminded to help prevent human-caused fires:  Make sure all campfires are dead out! Drown it and stir around the fire area with a shovel to wet any remaining embers and ash. If it’s not cool, it is not out.  Be sure to maintain proper tire pressure for all vehicles, ensure adequate tire tread, and check brakes for overheating. Do not drive or park on brush or grass. Do not drag chains while towing.  Motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and chainsaws require an approved spark arrestor.  Remember the use of steel-core ammunition, although legal while hunting, can greatly increase the chance of a wildfire if ricocheted off objects such as rocks.  Anyone found guilty of violating a fire prevention order may be fined not more than $100,000 and/or face imprisonment for not more than 12 months. Restitution for total fire suppression and damage costs incurred may be borne by the trespasser.  To learn how to prevent wildland fires, visit online at www.readyforwildfire.org.

The Last Resort: A Chronicle of Paradise, Profit, and Peril at the Beach by Sarah Stodola  Published in June 2022  The 2023 book that has most influenced how I think about higher education is Bryan Alexander’s superb Universities on Fire. (See my review here). Alexander’s book persuaded me that we must look at every higher education trend through the lens of an accelerating climate emergency.  It is from the perspective of Universities on Fire that I approached The Last Resort.  Most Popular Stories Most Popular  Travel and society writer Sarah Stodola approaches the question of the future of the beach resort in much the same way that Alexander approaches the future of the university. She understands the fate of oceanfront tourism to be inextricably bound up with sea-level rise, extreme heat and intensifying weather events.  The beach resort is both a victim and perpetrator of climate change. A beach resort is changed and perhaps destroyed when rising ocean levels erode beach sand away. The intensification of hurricanes and other tropical storms bring wind and flooding capable of decimating oceanfront hotels.  As Stodola points out, resorts require that customers travel to the place of manufacture. Unlike universities that have opportunities to digitize some of their services, moving teaching, learning and accreditation to online education platforms, a resort can’t go digital.  A theme of both The Last Resort and Universities on Fire is that hotel owners and academic leaders have done too little to prepare for the likely impacts of climate change. The attention of the resorts and the universities remains overly focused on near-term challenges, too often leaving the work of climate resiliency for tomorrow.  The problem with waiting is that all indications point to an acceleration of the negative impacts of climate change. Extreme heat, weather and flooding will not worsen linearly but instead along some accelerating curve of destruction.  Where beach resorts contribute the most to climate change is through the carbon impact of airplane travel. Global tourism means international flights.  The Last Resort is a fun combination of travel writing, environmental reporting and sociological analysis. Stodola flies all over the world, including to Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, Mexico, France and many other countries, to report on what she finds at the resort. She purchases carbon offsets to assuage her guilt for producing all this jet travel–related carbon.  The impact of air travel on climate change is also discussed in Universities on Fire. Alexander argues that universities and academics should be more mindful of how and when they choose to travel. Where possible, we should replace flights with digital connections, or at least try to take the train when possible.  The Last Resort is full of suggestions for how beach-side hotels can design their physical structures and guest services to minimize ecological damage. The book also shows why most resort operators fail to take these steps, mainly due to poor government policies and misaligned incentives.  Reading The Last Resort may provide academic leaders with some sideways inspiration for thinking about universities and climate change.  Pair Universities on Fire and The Last Resort together, and now we have the potential for some creative conversations.

"fire","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T01:01:00","CHARLESTON, W. Va. (WSAZ/Gray News) - A homeowner in West Virginia has filed a lawsuit against a water company after firefighters reportedly encountered low water pressure at nearby fire hydrants that led to the destruction of their home.  WSAZ reports the fire in question occurred at a house on May 5. Firefighters arrived roughly five minutes after the initial call. However, crews didn’t gain control of the flames until about four hours later.  According to the lawsuit, the fire hydrants near the home were nonfunctional and failed to deliver enough water pressure to fight the fire.  The homeowner said they lost personal belongings and the family dog in the fire.  “[The homeowner] was forced to endure those consequences when his home burned to the ground while firefighters scrambled around the neighborhood for hours desperately searching for a fire hydrant with water supply,” the lawsuit reads. “[The homeowner] and neighbors looked on in dismay as firefighters scoured the neighborhood, trying – but failing – to get water out of the three hydrants.”  The lawsuit claims American Water Company failed its legal and contractual duties to deliver sufficient water pressure to the fire hydrants.  According to the lawsuit, the homeowner seeks to hold the water company accountable for failing to maintain adequate water pressure.  In a statement, water authorities said the three hydrants were installed on 4-inch water mains and have since been out of service.  According to WSAZ, state law changed nearly 30 years ago, requiring all hydrants to be installed on 6-inch water mains with larger lines allowing for the water flow needed to fight fires.  In 2017, the water company added a surcharge to customers’ bills for infrastructure improvements.  In media releases, the company stated that specific amounts of money would be used for upgrades and replacement of fire hydrants.  According to the complaint, the house destroyed in the fire was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Since the fire, the water company has reportedly covered the non-functioning fire hydrants with garbage bags.  Copyright 2023 WSAZ via Gray Media Group, Inc.

"fire","2023-07-03","04:00:00","{""SanAntonio"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T16:06:26","SAN ANTONIO – A fire that caused heavy damage to a vacant West Side home early Tuesday morning is part of a disturbing and dangerous trend, according to San Antonio firefighters.  The trend involves houses and buildings that somehow have gone up in flames even though they had no working utilities. In some cases, they’ve threatened or damaged other people’s properties and potentially put fire crews in danger.  RELATED: Vacant house on West Side goes up in flames in early-morning fire  In the latest case, San Antonio police officers who happened to be in the area first noticed the fire in a home located in the 700 block of S. San Augustine. They called for fire crews shortly after 4 a.m.  “Our first engine crews, they reported a fully involved structure. We could actually see it from a ways off,” said Battalion Chief David Prado with SAFD.  Firefighters quickly knocked down the fire, but not before it caused major damage to the house. Prado says it is possible it had been smoldering for some time before anyone noticed it.  “No utilities to the structure, so it was vacant,” he said. “There were squatters going in and out. There’s evidence of activity.”  Arson investigators spent some time going through the home, looking for evidence of what caused the fire.  Prado says it appears someone may have had a hand in starting it, either by accident or intentionally.  “We’ve been seeing a lot of vacant structures that are actually catching fire,” he said.  Just last Thursday, some of the same fire crews were called to put out a fire in a vacant house in the 800 block of Poplar Street.  RELATED: Fire investigators looking into reports of ‘squatters’ seen inside home that burned  At that scene, Prado told KSAT 12 News he also suspected someone who didn’t belong had gotten inside and started the fire. It caused heavy damage to the home, which had stood in that location for nearly 100 years.  During the past month, there also have been several other fires throughout the city that have started mysteriously in similar structures.  One of them in a vacant apartment building, located in the 6800 block of Pecan Valley, sent up smoke and flames across the city’s Southeast Side.  In most cases, the damage has been limited to property.  However, firefighters fear they could put human lives in jeopardy.  They urge everyone to report any suspicious activity they may notice in and around any vacant structures.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9maXJlLWluLXZhY2FudC13ZXN0LXNpZGUtaG9tZS1wYXJ0LW9mLWEtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXRyZW5kLWZpcmVmaWdodGVycy1zYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Winn announced the graduation of 20 recruits from the Academy's Call/Volunteer Recruit Firefighter Training Program this evening. The graduates received certificates of completion at a ceremony held at Department of Fire Services’ Bridgewater campus.  The graduating firefighters represent the fire departments of Acushnet, Dighton, Freetown, Hanover, Lakeville, Norwell, Onset, Plympton, Rehoboth, Swansea, and West Bridgewater.  “First responders are on the front lines of any crisis and these newest firefighters are needed now more than ever,” said Academy Director Winn. “The rigorous training they’ve completed provides them with the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary to protect their communities safely and effectively.”  Video of the ceremony will be posted tomorrow at the Department of Fire Services’ YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/dfsosfm.  The Call/Volunteer Firefighter Recruit Training Program is unique in that it delivers a standard recruit training curriculum, meeting national standards, on nights and weekends to accommodate the schedule of firefighters in suburban and rural areas. Making the training more accessible means more firefighters can participate and allows them more time to practice training skills with instructors.  The MFA, a division of the Department of Fire Services, has offered the program since 2003. About 3,000 call and volunteer recruits have graduated since then.  Today’s Firefighters Do Far More than Fight Fires  Today’s firefighters train for all types of hazards and emergencies. They are the first ones called to chemical and environmental emergencies, ranging from the suspected presence of carbon monoxide to Fentanyl overdoses or a gas leak. They may be called to rescue children who have fallen through the ice or locked themselves in a bathroom. They rescue people from stalled elevators and crashed vehicles. They must test, maintain, and utilize equipment such as self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), hydrants, hoses, power tools, and apparatus.  At the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy, they learn all these skills and more, including the latest science of fire behavior and suppression tactics, from certified fire instructors. They also receive training in public fire education, hazardous material incident mitigation, flammable liquids, stress management, and self-rescue techniques. The intensive program involves classroom instruction, physical fitness training, firefighter skills training, and live firefighting practice.  Students receive classroom training in all basic firefighter skills. They practice first under non-fire conditions and then during controlled fire conditions. To graduate, students must demonstrate proficiency in life safety, search and rescue, ladder operations, water supply, pump operation, and fire attack. Fire attack operations range from mailbox fires to multiple-floor or multiple room structural fires.  Graduates have completed 240 hours of training on nights and weekends. Upon successful completion of this program, all students have met the standards of National Fire Protection Association 1001. In addition, they have the ability to become certified to the level of Firefighter I and II and Hazardous Materials First Responder Operations Level by the Massachusetts Fire Training Council, which is accredited by the National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualifications.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3MuZ292L25ld3MvMjAtbG9jYWwtZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXJzLWdyYWR1YXRlLWZyb20tZmlyZS1hY2FkZW150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was at a third-floor window that firefighters saw smoke and flames coming from the Nottingham Apartments when they arrived a little after 1 a.m. Tuesday.  Dan Ahonen, the owner of the building, explained how he found out about the fire (My son called and said,) ”Dad, we got a fire, it’s really a fire, he said. Ok, I’m on my way.”  The owner said it was a studio apartment that burned and was rented by one man. Five other people needed to be rescued, using the ladder truck, as they couldn’t exit because of the smoke and heat.  Battalion Chief Joe Tribbey says on a secondary search of the building some people were found who had slept through the alarms. “The fire alarms were working,” said Tribbey. “We did have some people who slept through those alarms. On our secondary search, we found two more people that had slept through in an apartment two apartments away from the fire.”  Tribbey says the fire alarm system helped alert the residents. One tenant, Valerie Sweeney, whose apartment is on the second floor, was back at the building this afternoon to retrieve a special pillow she needs because of a recent surgery. Sweeney said, “I was sound asleep and sleeping in a lounge chair, or a recliner because of my surgery and just heard a bang, bang, bang and jumped, and they’re just yelling it’s a real fire you need to get out, get out now.”  The fire department was called back to the scene Tuesday afternoon when insulation in the wall of the burned-out room was smoking. An 8 x 10 hole was cut in the roof and the smoking insulation was doused with foam.  Smoke and water damage forced all residents of the 35 apartments in the building to find alternate housing last night. However, the owner had some good news about when they might be able to return. Ahonen said, “Hopefully by the end of the week if things go right we can get 34 of the 35 people moved back in and then one apartment is charred, so that one’s gonna be a gut job.”  The Fire Department estimates the fire resulted in about $150,000 in damage.

The concept of backburning is a well-known firefighting technique, but doing so from a helicopter is something we don't often see. It could, however, be a bigger part of Cal Fire's fight in the future.  A prescribed burn is nothing new to Cal Fire or residents in certain parts of Calaveras County.  ""It's a way that we can light fire on our terms as opposed to an out-of-control wildland fire,"" said Matt Harrison with Cal Fire.  This is something we don't often see.  ""We're providing some training for aerial ignition and our ground folks in fire operations,"" Harrison said.  The unit is training pilots with an added application to their helicopters: a helitorch that can be used to backburn the area.  ""It is a great tool to get us into areas that we don't otherwise have access to,"" said Emily Kilgore of Cal Fire.  It is an application that can be helpful in the future of firefighting.  ""It's just a matter of the right tool at the right time with the right application,"" Harrison said.  Don't expect to see it in every fire. The planning for such use can take days and for specific conditions.  ""There is some criteria that has to be met ahead of time and a plan put in place,"" Kilgore said. ""So there's several days of planning before they can use helicopter ignition.""  It's a tool in the belt as fire season this year has the potential to still be dangerous.  ""Things have dried out later than last year. In California, eventually, everything is going to dry out. It's just a matter of when.  Heading into this summer, the agency wants people to remain vigilant. Just because there was a lot of water over the winter doesn't mean the risk level is zero.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jYWwtZmlyZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXJlZHVjaW5nLWZpcmUtcmlzay1mcm9tLXRoZS1haXIv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jYWwtZmlyZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXJlZHVjaW5nLWZpcmUtcmlzay1mcm9tLXRoZS1haXIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-12-01","Not Discerned","{""Marshalltown"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T05:06:10","Marshalltown Fire Chief David Rierson and Lt. Nick Hanus came before the city council on Monday night to share their annual report for 2022, offering some highlights from the previous year and renewing a call for increased staffing in the future.  For the fourth straight year, the MFD saw a higher number of requests for service, which, Rierson added, was the sixth time in the last years it had increased.  “It’s not a trend that is strictly a Marshalltown thing. It is an issue that’s nationwide. In speaking with other fire chiefs in the state of Iowa, they’re seeing 15 to 20 percent increases in their calls, so it’s not anything that’s new to us,” Rierson said.  He then segued into discussing a slew of suspicious fires set in 2021 and 2022 and noted that two second degree arson arrests had been made along with additional trespassing charges. In those cases, intent to burn could not be proven, but the individuals were proven to be on the properties where the fires occurred.  “It wasn’t everything. It didn’t solve all the arson cases that we had, but I think we sent a message that we weren’t gonna tolerate it and that we were going to address it as best as we could,” Rierson said.  The report also broke down where the calls for service in 2022 came from by quadrants, with the northwest section of the city from Olive Street north and from Center Street west far and away accounting for the highest number. Of the total calls, 80 were fires, and among those, about half were building fires.  According to Rierson, 43 of the fires were unintentional, three were arson and three were intentional. The rest were either “undetermined” or “acts of nature.” Although the number of total calls for service was again up, the number of actual fires went down slightly from 2021 to 2022. The fire loss in 2022 was estimated at $449,000, and the value of those properties was about $2.6 million. He estimated the department saved about $976,000 worth of property.  The chief reported a 17 percent increase in the number of overlapping calls, with 841 in 2022, making up about 25 percent of all of the calls for service. An overlapping call simply means the department is responding to more than one request for service at the same time, with as many as three calls sometimes occurring at the same time.  “That trend has gone up almost every year for the last four years, and I can’t stress how important it is for us to look at ways to resolve those issues because, in the end, it could mean the difference between somebody getting a firetruck to their house to put out a fire or not,” Rierson said.  He shared an example from last week when firefighters were on an EMS call, and they couldn’t send an ambulance. Ultimately, the patient was transported in the back of a police vehicle with an EMT taking care of them.  One positive note Rierson highlighted in the report was a 47 percent increase in the number of building inspections in 2022 — a total of 308 compared to just 164 in 2021. The department also continued a partnership with a private company to inspect sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers at businesses. In 2022, there were 726 inspections completed, and 61 — around nine percent — were noncompliant.  After wrapping up some of the highlights, Rierson opened the floor for questions, and Councilor Gary Thompson sought clarification on what the noncompliance meant, both for the building inspections and the system inspections contracted through the private company.  “It could be that a hood system wasn’t clean or it didn’t have its annual inspection or the fire extinguisher wasn’t serviced. For sprinkler systems, it could have been that it hadn’t had its annual inspection tests or, every five years, they’re required to have the internal components inspected. It could have been that they hadn’t had a five-year inspection as well,” Rierson said. “When it comes to building inspections that we do, a lot of times it’s just simple stuff. An exit sign isn’t working. The emergency lighting isn’t working, just simple things like that.”  Hanus, who serves as the president of the firefighters union, had a chance to comment and thanked the members of the council who have visited the station, inviting more to do the same.  Nonetheless, he spoke of a concerning trend.  “I guess brass tacks (is) we need more help. I know nobody has a magic bullet. I know that there are some solutions we can work through to get us some more people. The increase in calls is real,” Hanus said. “My guys are getting tired. I hate to be that plain about it, but if we can find a way to spread this load out, it’ll be better for everybody involved… We’ve had such an increase in medical calls that it takes away from our ability to respond to fires, which is ultimately what we’re here for.”  According to Hanus, other cities are often responding with twice as many firefighters as Marshalltown. A roster provided as part of the report showed the MFD currently has 18 full-time firefighters, three lieutenants, three captains, Rierson and Deputy Chief Christopher Cross on staff along with Fire Marshal Josh Warnell, Chaplin David Shearer and Administrative Assistant Maria Ramirez.  “I will say the people I work with, and I’m happy to work with, are some of the best people in the world. But we’re playing a numbers game, and I would hope we don’t get caught,” Hanus said. “I’m not up here to ask you to hire 10 more people tomorrow because I know that’s not the reality, but we can all work together to try and figure out a way to increase the staffing. It’s gonna be better for everybody involved.”  ——  Contact Robert Maharry at 641-753-6611 ext. 255 or rmaharry@timesrepublican.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwdWJsaWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy90b2RheXMtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3JpZXJzb24tc2hhcmVzLTIwMjItZmlyZS1yZXBvcnQtd2l0aC1jaXR5LWNvdW5jaWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2020-09-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T21:55:00","As raging wildfires in western Canada put Wyoming and the surrounding region under a blanket of smoke, it raises the question of whether the Cowboy State also may face a monster wildfire season. Probably not, experts told Cowboy State Daily.  “Long-term forecasts do not indicate any significant anomalies for Wyoming, so a normal fire season is expected,” said Laura McConnell, a fire communications specialist for the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region.  Rapid growth of greenery now could turn into tinder for forest fires later, said Aaron Voos, spokesman for the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest.  “There is the possibility that lots of moisture now could lead to rapid growth of fine fuels and the potential for that to become wildfire fuel later,” he said. “That is all very dependent on whether our wet/cool weather pattern continues or changes, and the rate of snowmelt.”  The Wind River Mountains have been hazy because of smoke from wildfire in Canada. (Cowboy State Daily Staff)  Summer Could Be Rainy  It should be a wetter summer as the overall weather trend shifts from a hot, dry La Niña pattern to the milder El Niño, said meteorologist Don Watzel of Cheyenne’s Day Weather Inc.  And in the short term, some rain and cooler temperatures could “scour out” the lingering smoke from fires in Canada, he said.  That smoke caused air quality alerts in Montana and Nebraska, but none so far in Wyoming, Watzel added.  A buildup of greenery during the spring that dries out over the summer can make for a bad wildfire season, but grazing can mitigate it, said retired forester and wildland firefighter Karl Brauneis of Lander.  “The question of increased forage as it might contribute to an extreme fire season always comes up in years where we have a wet spring,” he said. “I have never seen that play out except in areas that exclude livestock grazing.”  2020 Mullen Fire Was A Whopper  Wyoming had a nasty fire season three years ago, particularly the Mullen Fire in the Snowy Range Mountains near Laramie.  That fire ignited in September 2020 and scorched nearly 177,000 acres.  Likewise, the current fires in western Canada sparked under unusually hot, dry conditions, Watzel said.  “Last week, they were running temperatures 15 or 20 degrees above normal for that area. They were hitting the 80s,” he said, adding that western Canada is expected to cool off and get some rain soon, which might help quench those fires.  Higher Temps, But More Rain  Meanwhile, it might start to get toasty in Wyoming over the summer, although that should be balanced out with ample rain, Watzel said.  “The seasonal outlook for June, July and August, not only for Wyoming, but the Rocky Mountains in general, does call for slightly higher-than-normal temperatures,” he said.  There could be windows of time between rainstorms when things dry out, meaning dry lightning strikes could cause forest or grassland fires, he said.  McConnell agreed that more rain than the region has gotten the past couple of summers could help dampen the fire season. Rainfall should return to “normal” levels, at least in parts of Wyoming.  “Near normal precipitation was reported over the mountains of Wyoming and Colorado maintaining the strong snowpack,” she said. “Eastern Colorado and eastern Wyoming saw deficits of 1 to 2 inches of moisture, which maintained abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions.  “The overall impact through this outlook period is for normal temperatures in May to transition to above-normal temperatures to the (Rocky Mountain Region) for the summer, with near-normal expectations for precipitation,” she added.  Management Is The Key  Brauneis said that based upon his experiences as a firefighter, he’s an advocate for forest and rangeland management through grazing, controlled burns and other means.  “I have been on fires where the range resource has not been managed and extreme conditions existed. In California, I once observed an official standing in waist-high forage talking about the extreme fire season due to the increased forage. The solution was easy — turn out the cows, the sheep and the goats,” he said.  “I believe the official was more interested in obtaining additional budget dollars for his agency through fear then understanding the actual impacts to the land by excluding range management,” Brauneis added. “This is why I believe that a good fire management officer must first be grounded in resource management.”  Mark Heinz can be reached at Mark@CowboyStateDaily.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY293Ym95c3RhdGVkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi93eW9taW5nLXNlZW1zLWhlYWRlZC1mb3Itbm9ybWFsLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLWV2ZW4tYXMtYmxhemVzLXJhZ2UtaW4tY2FuYWRhLWV4cGVydHMtc2F5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""I was already standing out there for 30 minutes while the fire was going on and to find out it was a chemical fire the whole time ... I was, like, dang, should I have worn a mask?"" Connor McNamara said.  Turner said the Texas Legislature has made it hard for cities, including Houston, to be in the know when it comes to potentially dangerous chemicals.  ""(HFD) Chief (Samuel) Peña, for I think two or three sessions in a row, has asked the Legislature to make it a requirement for businesses, or those with chemicals, to identify, at least to the fire departments, what those chemicals are,"" Turner said. ""We do need added notification of when people are storing chemicals, especially in close proximity to where people live, or quite frankly, where other businesses are.""  The City of Bellaire said it provided support to HFD and also notified residents about the shelter-in-place order.

Woody was named to lead the Fire Academy last February.  ""We've got a lot of things that are happening there. We're kind of trying to revamp our reputation within the community and within the state,"" Woody told Rotarians.  Step one in those efforts has been rebuilding the Fire Academy's (AFTA's) relationship with SAU-Tech, through which AFTA provides training and college credit.  ""We're massaging what has historically been a poor relationship with the college... It's just one of those things that's been there for whatever reason and we haven't really relied on each other the way we could, to the fullest extent,"" Woody explained.  The relationship between SAU-Tech and AFTA is mutually beneficial, Woody said. Firefighters who train at AFTA earn college credit, which boosts SAU-Tech's enrollment numbers. SAU-Tech also helps provide for AFTA's technological needs.  ""We've even changed our fire trucks; our logos have SAU-Tech's on them,"" Woody said. ""That is a mutually positive relationship that benefits us both in a lot of ways.""  AFTA is currently working to expand curriculum. Currently, 39 courses that can go toward certification are offered there, and Woody said the school is working to add some additional non-certification classes.  ""We still have one of those few jobs where you can do everything right and it still kills you, so we've got to make sure we get out lots of relevant and current information,"" Woody said.  And starting in the 2023/2024 school year, high school students will be able to begin training at AFTA for future careers in the fire service.  ""This is going to enable them to immediately enter the workforce,"" Woody said. ""It's a three-way partnership, a true partnership, between the school district, the local fire department and SAU-Tech. They're going to earn college credit; the fire department has to be involved because they need the equipment, the truck, the gear; and then the school has to coordinate with the parents and move kids from Point A to Point B.""  AFTA is a premier fire training facility, Woody said, and barely missed out on being the site of the National Fire Academy.  ""Beautiful campus, nice dorms, great curriculum, instructors from all over the country – but no hands-on classes at the National Fire Academy. We have all of those things,"" Woody said.  AFTA's capabilities are so sought-after that even the Department of Defense selected its bid to train service members. Woody said instructors from AFTA will travel to Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Okla. next month to provide training. He hopes to win more DoD training bids in the future, he said.  ""That's a really big deal, because that could be a sustained revenue source,"" he said.  Woody said AFTA currently operates with about 20 employees on a $2 million annual budget. Enrollment has increased steadily since 2021, when AFTA served 12,123 students in 1,600 classes. In 2022, enrollment jumped to 17,800 students, and this year, AFTA is on pace to deliver classes to ""well over"" 20,000 students across about 1,800 classes.  The Fire Academy, in addition to serving paid fire departments, also serves volunteer fire departments, and Woody said he's hoping to grow the Academy's capabilities there as well.  Woody is currently waiting to hear back on a grant he requested that would purchase mobile props to provide off-campus training to volunteer firefighters. Approximately 96% of firefighters in Arkansas are volunteers, he said.  ""So we can take a burn building to the local fire department so they're still in service to make their calls with their equipment and their people to protect those areas,"" he explained.  But to continue growing, AFTA will need additional funding. Woody said he has submitted a capital budget proposal of $8 million to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that he's awaiting word on.  ""It's critical to the present and future of the Fire Academy that we increase that revenue,"" Woody said. ""I told somebody a while ago, the sky and our budget are the limit to what we can get done at the Fire Academy because we have such a great team.

She’s two months pregnant, and now, we’ve got nowhere to live.”  Investigators say it appears the fire started outside a three-story commercial building before the flames jumped to the former Howard House—-a vacant 30-room, 15-thousand-square-foot building dating back to before the Civil War.  “I saw a dumpster over here, and it sounded like maybe somebody had crashed into a dumpster, cause it was like a hollow sound,” said Dave Scarbrough who lives across the street from the fire, “and then after that I basically started seeing more people and then the smoke started pouring out the back.”  In all, nine people living in the apartments have been displaced and one firefighter suffered minor injuries.  RELATED: American Red Cross helping families after Cecil County fire  While the fate of the historic Howard House and Hotel is uncertain, it’s the future of those victims, which now takes priority.  “The Red Cross gave us $500 on a card to get a hotel room and clothes and stuff, but that’s about it,” said McDaniel.  “That isn’t going to take you far?” we asked.  “No. Not at all,” McDaniel responded, “The motel costs $120 a night.

But it’s something.”  Damage from the fire to the two buildings is estimated at $1.5 million.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYXIybmV3cy5jb20vbG9jYWwvMy1hbGFybS1maXJlLWRhbWFnZXMtZWxrdG9uLWxhbmRtYXJr0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud21hcjJuZXdzLmNvbS9sb2NhbC8zLWFsYXJtLWZpcmUtZGFtYWdlcy1lbGt0b24tbGFuZG1hcms_X2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A press release from Bloomington Fire Department spokesperson Frank Friend said crews were dispatched at 7:55 p.m. to a reported building fire at 3 Snow Lane.  BFD said a fire engine and ambulance crew made it to the scene in less than 5 minutes, and found smoke and fire showing from several windows of a single-wide mobile home. Another two fire trucks, one engine, a second ambulance and a battalion command vehicle from BFD responded too, with additional assistance from a Normal Fire Department engine and battalion vehicle.  Firefighters encountered several points of fire, Friend said. He noted part of the floor burned away, the structure was thick with smoke and crews attacked with an extra hose line through the back door.  The main part of the fire was put out no more than 20 minutes after crews arrived, Friend said. He said two people were home at the time and they safely evacuated. Both are displaced and the homeowner did not have insurance.  Friend said the mobile home was extensively damaged and cause of the fire is being investigated. He also said the American Red Cross was contacted to assist the residents.  Ameren Illinois and Nicor Gas responded to secure utilities, and City of Bloomington Building Safety was asked to secure the property. Most crews left the scene within 90 minutes, but the first-arriving engine and ambulance remained to put out hot spots.

(WFLA) — The American Red Cross is assisting nine families, 23 people total, after a fire at a Lake Wales apartment complex, the organization said Monday.  The fire occurred Saturday morning just after 2:30 a.m. at the Quails Bluff Apartments. Crews battled the fire until around 8 a.m. Nobody was injured.  “Me and my brother were in the back and we smelled something, thought somebody was barbecuing. We came around and we came outside and saw the smoke was really thick,” said Nicote Graham who lives in a nearby apartment.  Graham said he dropped his phone and ran to help, not even stopping to put on shoes before knocking on doors in the building that was on fire.  “It was kind of like second nature when you see something, like if you see somebody reaching for something on a shelf, you go help them like it’s kind of second nature. You see people, it’s a fire. Anything could happen,” he said.  According to an official with Lake Wales Fire Rescue, crews evacuated six units with people inside.  Two units appeared to have people living in them, but they were not home.  “It looks like someone took a bite out of the roof. Terrible, man,” said Graham.  Lawrence Hodge was about to clock out for work and head home when he got a call from his mother who was in the apartment with his young children.  She told him there was a fire.  “It was like, whoa. It was very, very scary,” said Hodge.  Hodge said his unit sustained smoke and water damage.  He was able to remove some clothes and medication for his child but cannot return for good yet.  “I can rebuild myself but for the kids, there’s some things I need to get out of there,” said Hodge.  While he has received help from several organizations, including the American Red Cross, Hodge said Quails Bluff Apartments has not provided any help or guidance.

Jaramillo says Asaya is her hero and saved multiple lives Saturday afternoon when he ran back into their burning house to get his siblings.  On Monday, Asaya Chaves walks through his front yard, pointing out the rooms of what used to be his home.  “This was the living room, that is where JJ was playing,” Asaya said holding his 2-year-old brother’s hand. “If you see back there, that back room, that’s my room. That is where I first smelled the smoke.”  Asaya explained he knew exactly what to do in the situation because of a lesson he learned at school.  “One day firefighters came, and they told us what to do and stuff like that, and the firefighters said if you smell smoke get out the house. I smelt that exact same smoke, so I told my grandma let’s get out there it’s a fire,” Asaya said.  Asaya’s grandma, Anna Jaramillo, was the only adult home at the time with her four grandkids.  “It was hard, but Asaya was the one that had it, he did, he took the kids out, the youngest ones and said ‘Grandma get out hurry,’ and we got Santi out,” Jaramillo explained.  But his 2-year-old brother, JJ, and 7-month-old sister, Armani, were still inside. So, Asaya ran back into the burning house before the firefighters arrived on scene.  “I got Armani out because she is little, and then I got JJ out, and after I got out everything started blowing up! Boom, boom, boom because the fire got to my grandma’s oxygen tanks and the second I got out of there everything started blowing up,” said Asaya.  The 9-year-old said it was like a scene from an action movie.  “When the firefighters came up, they seen me coming out with JJ, and after I came out they started running all the hoses and running around the house,” Asaya said.  “They saw him bringing the babies out, and they asked him ‘how did you know to do that?’ And he told them from school, and they told him you are a little hero,” Jaramillo said with tears of pride in her eyes.  The family moved into the house only a month ago, but now all that is left is charred wood and burnt toys scattered through the yard.  “It’s hard we have nothing left, but you know what that’s OK, we have each other, we are still here, we didn’t lose anybody. We can always replace everything else, but you can’t replace a life, so I’m really, really thankful for being here,” Jaramillo said wiping tears from her eyes. “I’m thankful for my grandson.”  Jaramillo says next week they were going to celebrate her daughter’s and granddaughter’s birthdays with a BBQ in the yard of their new house, but now they are working on a new plan.  If you would like to donate to the family, they have set up a Spotfund account.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvYi5jb20vbmV3LW1leGljby85LXllYXItb2xkLWJveS1zYXZlcy1zaWJsaW5ncy1mcm9tLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUtaW4tc2FudGEtZmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Officials say a portion will have to be completely torn down.  Investigators believe this could be arson.  “It just looked like a ball of fire,” said Frances Wolfe.  Wolfe was babysitting on Saturday evening when officers came banging on the door telling her to get out. When she came outside, she saw the old Granville Elementary School engulfed in flames and smoke billowing from the windows.  “We got evacuated at 6:30 p.m. and I know they didn’t leave here until almost 11 p.m. and then they were back yesterday,” Wolfe said.  Eight fire departments worked for several hours to battle the fire before getting the flames out.  “I just stood there for a minute and said, ‘Whoa, This is a wall fire, this one will go on the wall,’” said Fire Chief Tom Hartley Jr.  The historic school was built in 1910, with an addition added in 1916.  “I went to kindergarten here,” Hartley said.  While it was empty at the time of the fire, it was rich with history and design. We asked the chief if the building will be torn down. He said that’s up to the owners.  “The right side of it has to be torn down. The stairs are gone, the roof is gone,” Hartley said.  “I’m glad it is out, and I am just glad nobody got hurt,” Wolfe said.

Despite record snow packs across the state, the OSU researchers agree that fire season could last longer this year and start later as well.  Although they say there aren’t any specific concerns for Southern Oregon, state climatologist and professor Larry O‘Neill said the larger snow packs will have an affect on our region.  “Many of the snow tell sites in the southern Oregon Cascades are projected to melt a little later than normal,” O’Neill said. “That’s basically a function of how many snow there was this year. So that tends to push back the start of fire season a little bit.”  As fire season rapidly approaches, it’s only a matter of time before the Oregon Department of Forestry’s fire danger level goes up.  “We start fire season June 1st at the very latest every year just because we live in such a fire prone environment,” ODF Southwest spokesperson Natalie Weber said in April. “So fire season won’t start later than June 1st.”  ODF Southwest said in the last several years, fire season began much earlier, starting in May.  O’Neill said the biggest difference going into this fire season compared to last year is the precipitation.  He said the its warmer and dryer now, than it was after record spring rain in 2022.

A fire was reported on the first floor, displacing three people. A 49-year-old man was found dead inside the building, Gardner said.  Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the fire and whether the building had working smoke alarms, Gardner said.

(WKRG)— Dirt flew in the air as the Summerdale Fire Department broke ground om their new fire station 1 that is located at the intersection of CR-32 and CR-73.  Myles Bishop, Fire Chief of Summerdale fire department, says this has been a long time coming.  “We have been waiting a long time,” Bishop said. “There have been a lot of people before us and we are just so excited that we have got to this point and can’t wait until the dirt starts moving.”  The current Summerdale Fire Department is over 50 years old and is out of date. Bishop says there are some additions coming to the new station.  “It’ll have a drive through base, so when they are coming in for a call, they can drive straight on through the doors, go around and hit 73 to get to the call, and then we are going to have bunk rooms, showers that our other station does not have,” Bishop said.  Bishop also said the location of the new fire station was chosen for a reason.  “It’s central between 59 and beach express,” Bishop said. ‘We have four corners of county roads that we can get in and out, it’s just a primary location that we need.”  Bishop said the fire station should be ready for move in and operation by this time next year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrcmcuY29tL2JhbGR3aW4tY291bnR5L3N1bW1lcmRhbGUtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tbmV3LXN0YXRpb24v0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tyZy5jb20vYmFsZHdpbi1jb3VudHkvc3VtbWVyZGFsZS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtYnJlYWtzLWdyb3VuZC1vbi1uZXctc3RhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Kittery"", ""Maine"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T19:24:32","Identifying the person who died in a Kittery hotel fire could be difficult and time-consuming.  After the Days Inn was destroyed by fire and a body was found in the rubble, investigators said no one had reported a person missing. The hotel’s records were lost in the fire and the innkeeper had not kept a guest list as required, factors that investigators said made it more difficult to determine if everyone staying there was accounted for.  The medical examiner’s office said Monday that the body has not been identified and any information about the person’s identity will come from the state fire marshal’s office. A spokesperson for the agency did not respond to a phone call or email Monday requesting an update on the investigation and an interview with the fire marshal’s office.  “The process of identification can be arduous, and takes cooperation with the investigating law enforcement agency as they are the ones checking for previous law enforcement interactions, possible next of kin and talking with people who may have known the deceased person,” Lindsey Chasteen, administrator of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said Monday.  It’s unclear how long it will take officials to release the identity once it is confirmed.  Related One person found dead in rubble of Kittery hotel fire  Investigators have released no new information since late last week when they announced that the body had been recovered. They have not determined a cause and have not said if they believe the fire is suspicious.  Advertisement  The medical examiner uses several methods of identification, starting with visual identification. If the deceased person is recognizable, they try to compare it to a driver’s license or identification photo. If that doesn’t work, they look to identifying marks such as scars or tattoos. But for burn victims, there may be no identifying markings visible depending on the severity of their burns, Chasteen said in an email.  If the medical examiner’s office has a tentative identification and a known dentist, they will attempt to use dental records to confirm a person’s identity. Many times, Chasteen said, a person’s dentist is not known, so the medical examiner will attempt a DNA comparison with a parent, child or male relative.  Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien said Monday that there have been no issues at the fire scene since the remaining hot spots were extinguished last week. Any updates about the cause of the fire will come from state investigators, he said.  The fire at the Days Inn on the Route 1 Bypass broke out around noon on May 17 and spread quickly through the wood-frame building. Kittery police helped evacuate people from the hotel as firefighters arrived and tried to check rooms that may have been occupied. Within minutes, the fire grew intense and the focus shifted to an exterior attack to contain the flames.  Related Fire destroys Days Inn hotel in Kittery  The hotel, which was valued at $1.7 million by the town, did not have a fire suppression or sprinkler system. There were working smoke alarms in the building.  It was built in 1956, according to town records, and was not required to have a sprinkler system, which state law requires for all hotels built since 1992. Older hotels are required to have approved smoke, heat and fire detection systems.  The victim’s body was pulled from the rubble of the building on Thursday afternoon. O’Brien said last week that the body was in the most badly burned part of the structure, but the building was too damaged to tell if the person had been in a room or hallway. The victim was not found in the area that firefighters had tried to reach before being pushed back by intense flames.  Investigators say the hotel owner, Kamlesh Patel, has been cooperative.  Patel on May 5 filed for a review of his proposal to demolish the hotel and replace it with a 107-room, four-story building. If those plans are approved by the Kittery Planning Board, the building will be required to have a fire suppression system.

"fire","2023-05-28","02:00:00","{""RedHook"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T18:22:53","RED HOOK — A large fire tore through Migliorelli Farm along Budd Corners Road early Friday morning, taking out a 20,000-square-foot barn housing equipment, supplies, hay and more. Firefighters from 12 local companies worked for nearly nine hours to put the fire out. No one was injured and one baby raccoon was rescued.  “When you go there, it’s like going to a funeral,” Ken Migliorelli, the farm’s proprietor, said. “I got a phone call at 2 a.m. from the fire department. By the time I got there, it was in a blaze.”  Several days later, it’s not yet clear what started the fire. Migliorelli has been meeting with Dutchess County investigators and said that so far, he does know that whatever happened wasn’t his fault — a big relief.  “The investigator was there; we were both scratching our heads. Where the fire started, there was no equipment and minimum electric. We are thinking it came from another source. We are having a meeting with my electrician, too,” he said.  Migliorelli Farm is one of the largest regional farms, stretching across 650 acres throughout Red Hook and Tivoli. This particular location has been a farm for over 100 years, though not in Miglorielli’s name. “That was the farm my uncle purchased in 1969. I acquired it not too long ago,” he said.  Migliorelli has never experienced anything like this blaze before, though it’s the sort of thing any farmer worries about. He learned in the past few days that the original barn on this property actually burned down before, in 1954.  “It’s one of these old barns with beams and all that. What was there was built in 1955,” he said. A big wooden structure filled with apple bins, hay and firewood is “perfect for a fire,” he lamented. The electricity had been upgraded to new panels five or six years ago.  “You always take precaution to prevent things like this,” Migliorelli said.  Late May is the busy season on any regional farm, and the aftermath of the fire has been chaotic. The fire didn’t hurt any crops, just the equipment needed to tend to them. Migliorelli said his farmers are putting in the first big planting of tomatoes and preparing to plant peppers and eggplants.  “The normal farm activity has to continue,” he said. He has heard from some people who assumed he would shut down after the fire. “I was like, we can’t. The show has got to keep going.”  Migliorelli has also heard from what feels like the entire community — “150 texts from friends, colleagues and other farms,” he said. His voicemail is full. A GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Katherine Hardeman, a friend’s daughter, asked for $75,000 and is currently at $86,000 and climbing.  While Migliorelli Farm is a large operation locally, farming isn’t a lucrative business. “Most farmers are land rich and bank poor,” Migliorelli said. “You never have enough insurance to have enough. That could put you out of business itself.”  What insurance he did have will help, but not enough to replenish supplies and equipment, Migliorelli said. Not to mention rebuild demolished structures. A building as large as the one that burned houses a lot of forklifts, farm implements and other necessities.  Farmer friends are offering needed supplies, equipment to borrow, as well as advice. Another farmer who went through a similar ordeal last year has been sharing thoughts on dealing with insurance companies. And the GoFundMe response has been huge — loyal donors offering everything from $10 all the way up to a handful of $1,000 donations. Rhinebeck Farmers Market and Falcon’s Fields, a local beef farm, both gave $1,000, while Hudson Valley Garlic Growers as well as Scenic Hudson pitched in $500. The donor list is a who’s-who of a region eager to help, including chefs, restaurants, markets and longtime clients.  “I am pretty entrenched in the community here,” Migliorelli said.  Migliorelli is now or has been in the past involved with several Red Hook committees and is a longtime proponent of conservation easements of farmland. He has worked with Dutchess County farmland protection groups as well as planning boards. All of these people are showing up for him now in his time of need. “It almost feels like ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ kind of story,” he said. “One of my sisters just flipped me $25,000.”  Migliorelli is grateful for the help as he continues to farm and wade through the post-fire chaos. He’ll be relying heavily on the community this growing season, too, to purchase his well-known and loved vegetables and fruits at his farm stands in Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Mount Tremper, and at farmers’ markets in New York City.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2h1ZHNvbnZhbGxleS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvbWlnbGlvcmVsbGktZmFybS1maXJlLXJoaW5lYmVjay0xODExMjE0My5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  A sign at the Arthur ""Smokestack"" Hardy Fire Station in Baltimore displays the number of fatal fires and the total of people killed. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun )  On the side of every Baltimore firehouse, a white sign adorned with flames presents a stark record: 10 people dead in fires already in 2023.  The count serves as a reminder of how lethal fires can be, a reality that city and state officials seek to emphasize since Maryland experienced more deaths in the first quarter of this year than in the same period each year for the past two decades.  Advertisement  It’s typical to see more fatal fires in the winter months when people use heaters and other appliances to stay warm. However, 31 people in Maryland perished in fires from January to March, double the number during the same period in 2022 and an acceleration of the rate in a state that has averaged 64 fatalities a year in the past decade.  Twelve other deaths from the first three months of 2023 await confirmation by the medical examiner’s office of whether they were due to fires, meaning the total could reach 43 fatalities. The total includes building fires and fires in car crashes.  Advertisement  “Forty-some people in the first three months, that’s a huge, huge discrepancy for us,” said Maryland State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci.  Maryland’s population was smaller in 2004, the last time 40 or more people died in the first quarter of the year. Geraci wrote a letter March 30 to Marylanders, warning of the dangers of house fires, in hopes of slowing the disturbing trend.  The state saw some respite the next month, with only one death in April. At least four deaths, including one in Baltimore City, have occurred so far in May.  Geraci, a 50-year fire veteran whose office investigates arson and other fire crimes as part of the Maryland State Police, believes more people are dying in part because modern furniture burns more quickly and spreads flames faster. Furniture made of synthetic materials can combust and contribute to flashover fire, when all items in a room simultaneously ignite.  “You got a sofa that’s a solid brick of gasoline sitting in your living room because it’s all plastic,” Geraci said. “It’s all synthetics. It’s not the cotton-based materials that we saw when your parents and my parents had their homes.”  Maryland State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci talks about a fatal fire in Edgewood in May 2019. (Matt Button / The Aegis / Baltimore Sun Media Group)  Driving the high number of deaths in 2023 are eight fires that took multiple lives, including a West Baltimore fire that killed three children, ages 1, 2, and 7, in March. Baltimore fire investigators still are investigating the cause but found issues with a smoke detector. Chief Khalilah Yancey, a fire department spokesperson, declined to specify the issue, citing the open investigation.  That fire’s devastating toll weighs on Geraci, who considers it his responsibility to prevent such tragedies.  “It’s hard to tell people when they show up, ‘Your mom and dad didn’t make it out of the house,’” said Geraci, who placed his head in his hand and briefly cried at the memory while sitting in his office on a recent afternoon.  Advertisement  “It’s a failure for us. It’s a failure for me. Either we didn’t get the message to them, or they didn’t receive the message,” about how to keep a fire from starting or how to escape a burning home, he said.  Nationally, the rate of fire deaths has increased over the past decade. Residential fires are the leading cause of fire death, and modern houses burn faster than ever, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.  A sign at the Arthur ""Smokestack"" Hardy Fire Station says “Number of fatal fires this year: 7” and “Number of fire deaths this year: 10.” Thirty-one people have died in fires from January to March. The state average is 64 deaths each year. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun )  The speed at which blistering flames and thick, toxic smoke spread leaves only two to three minutes to escape a home after an alarm sounds, according to the National Fire Protection Association. That window is significantly smaller than in previous decades, when people had about 15 minutes to get out.  Many fatal fires involve houses that don’t have working smoke alarms. Two Anne Arundel County men, one a wheelchair user, died in separate house fires within three days this month. Both houses lacked a working smoke alarm.  People with physical disabilities and people who hoard are common victims of fires. An 82-year-old man died May 11 in Dundalk after an electrical failure in his mobility chair started a fire. Baltimore County Police officers tried amid intense heat and heavy smoke to rescue the man from the second floor of his house before firefighters arrived but were unsuccessful.  Two people died this year trying to save other people or personal items from their burning homes.  Advertisement  “If your house is on fire and you go back in, you’re not coming out alive,” Geraci said.  Some of the most common causes of fires are cooking, such as when someone leaves a stove on, and electricity, like when an overloaded extension cord heats up and sparks. Other leading causes are cigarettes and other smoking materials and heating appliances, such as space heaters placed too close to flammable items. Deaths can be caused by infection from burns and from inhaling smoke, which damages the heart and lungs and results in cardiac arrest.  An early morning house fire in West Baltimore killed three children. (Dillon Mullan / Baltimore Sun)  Fires in Baltimore pose a unique danger as more than 14,000 buildings are vacant. Fires in vacant houses, sometimes caused by people living inside, spread quickly to neighboring units and can be treacherous for firefighters. In early May, a towering plume of smoke and fire consumed five houses in West Baltimore. Four were vacant and marked as “Code X-rays,” a designation given to unstable buildings that are too dangerous for firefighters to enter.  Baltimore consistently has the highest number of fire fatalities in the state, followed by the populous counties of Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s, according to data from the fire marshal’s office. Seven Baltimore residents died in 2022, and at least six of the nine people killed in 2021 residential fires were in buildings without working smoke alarms, three of which were vacant, according to the most recent annual data.

Citywide, firefighters knock on doors weekly to check and replace smoke alarms for free. After the three children died in the Rosemont fire, crews descended on the neighborhood the next day to install alarms and conduct safety inspections.  Advertisement  Acting Baltimore Fire Chief Dante Stewart said the department is focusing fire prevention efforts on older adults and young children, who are the most vulnerable. Fire officials hold a monthly fire safety class, visit retirement homes to raise awareness of risks, and teach children under 18 who are caught setting fires about the dangers of arson.  Safety messages soon will be advertised on Charm City Circulator buses and posted on social media. City residents can call 311 to have fire crews install an alarm or perform a home safety inspection.  All new Maryland residences are required to have sprinklers, which are triggered by heat and extend the amount of time people have to escape.  Geraci warns that people are too complacent about fires starting in their own homes, which he believes has contributed to an uptick in deaths. He wants them to think ahead.  “You can imagine when the smoke is back down to the floor and you can’t see your hand in front of your face. It’s like, ‘Oh hell, what am I going to do?’” Geraci said. “You’ve got to be ready for it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vbWFyeWxhbmQvYnMtbWQtY2ktbWFyeWxhbmQtZmlyZS1kZWF0aC1pbmNyZWFzZS0yMDIzMDUyMi1rMnMzdHN3YWNyaHlycGFxaWg1b3pxY3Q0cS1zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In one of its latest budget adoptions, the board opted to close three fire stations in Concow, Berry Creek and Stirling City through the winter months because of financing viability. In the meetings following the decision, many residents aired grievances and noted the distance between their communities and the next nearest fire stations.  In April, the board asked that staff come back with a report on how many calls for service came in last winter. The report is expected to go over the number of fires, medical calls and response times.  According to the related agenda report, the total number of calls between the three stations during the 2022/2023 winter months was 157.  Based on reports from the county, each station costs about $197,000 per year to staff and operate.  Other business  Along with discussing these numbers, the board is also set to look over the following items:  The board will continue going through project proposals to potentially be funded by American Rescue Plan Act money. With the remaining $3.5 million, the board will be choosing from eight new proposals, totaling $3.34 million.  An information presentation will be given on the county’s current ground ambulance service contract with the Sierra-Sacramento Valley Emergency Medical Services Agency, which has been the county’s sole provider of these services for a decade.

Climate models show that such large-scale blazes are getting more frequent and more fast-spreading, in part due to the climate crisis raising temperatures and causing even more extreme summers with drier conditions.  Governmental authorities and other bodies have worked to prepare for the 2023 wildfire season, clearing underbrush and other overgrown flora that could provide fuel for brush fires.  A 2017 government report advised establishing a single supervisory body to oversee a coordinated nationwide effort to implement fire prevention measures in all Israel’s forests, irrespective of who owns or manages them. The recommendation has never been implemented.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2hvbWVzLWFuZC1wYXJrLWV2YWN1YXRlZC1hcy1sYXJnZS1maXJlLXNwcmVhZHMtbmVhci1wZXRhaC10aWt2YS_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc29maXNyYWVsLmNvbS9ob21lcy1hbmQtcGFyay1ldmFjdWF0ZWQtYXMtbGFyZ2UtZmlyZS1zcHJlYWRzLW5lYXItcGV0YWgtdGlrdmEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All but one of the victims were Indigenous girls, officials said Monday.  “This is a horrific incident. It’s tragic. It’s painful,” President Irfaan Ali said, adding that his government was mobilizing all possible resources as he requested help from the region to identify the remains of 13 bodies.  The fire broke out at about 10:50 p.m. Sunday in the dormitory building of a secondary school that serves remote, mostly Indigenous villages and is located in the border town of Mahdia, a gold and diamond mining community about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the capital, Georgetown, the government said in a statement.  Deputy Fire Chief Dwayne Scotland said ""the fire was maliciously set” and began in the building's southwest corner. However, Police Chief Clifton Hicken said “initial investigations suggest that it was maliciously set."" He also said that while the girls' dorm had five doors, iron grill work trapped the students inside.  Authorities did not provide further details and did not share what evidence, if any, points to arson.  “This is the saddest day of my life as president. I wish it had not occurred,” Ali said.  A total of 59 girls usually reside in the dorm, but only 56 were in the rooms when the fire began because three of them went home for the weekend. Thirteen girls and a small boy died at the dorm, while five died at Mahdia Hospital, the government said.  Of those injured, six children were flown to Georgetown and 17 remain hospitalized in Mahdia, officials said.  Officials initially said 20 students were killed but later updated the toll to 19, with several others injured. National Security Adviser Gerald Gouveia said the figure was revised after doctors revived a very critical patient that “everyone thought was dead.”  “When firefighters arrived on the scene, the building was already completely engulfed in flames,” Guyana’s Fire Service said in a statement. “Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the relatives and friends of those young souls.”  Officials said two children remain in critical condition and four have severe injuries.  “Firefighters did manage to rescue some 20 students by breaking holes in the northeastern wall of the building,” the department said.  The school serves mostly Indigenous children aged 12 through 18, Gouveia said. He said it was too early to speculate what might have caused the fire, adding that heavy thunderstorms in the area posed a challenge to those responding by air.  “It was a battle for us,” he said. “The pilots were very brave, very determined.”  He added that the government and emergency responders “made a gigantic effort” to save as many people as possible.  Ali said officials were contacting parents and mobilizing psychologists to help those affected by the fire.  “I cannot imagine the pain right now of the parents,” he said. “This is a major disaster.”  The opposition party, APNU+AFC, issued a statement saying it will seek a thorough investigation and thanked people in the small community for helping authorities rescue children who were trapped.  “We need to understand how this most horrific and deadly incident occurred and take all necessary measures to prevent such a tragedy from happening again in the future,” opposition lawmaker Natasha Singh-Lewis said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9ueXMvd2F0ZXJ0b3duL2FwLXRvcC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZmlyZS1yYXplcy1zY2hvb2wtZG9ybWl0b3J5LWluLWd1eWFuYS1raWxscy1hdC1sZWFzdC0yMC1jaGlsZHJlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to emergency radio traffic, the home’s occupants called 911, reporting smoke inside the residence, believed to have been caused by electrical wiring. Several crews responded to the area.  Four people were in the home at the time of the fire. They were advised by 911 dispatch operators to evacuate the home.  The first firefighters to arrive reported no flames visible. However, heavy smoke was coming from the eves of the roof, prompting additional crews to be paged to the incident.  Firefighters located heat coming from the attic in the garage. After removing some of the ceiling, they found the fire smoldering in the attic’s insulation and were able to extinguish it.  The homeowners told firefighters, they were cooking something in a toaster, when the power went out. They then started smelling smoke.  Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly with only minimal damage. They were also able to keep it from spreading into the rest of the home.  The fire is suspected to have started in the garage. The homeowners had told first responders, they had bought an electric vehicle and had placed a charger inside of the garage.

It actually resulted in 11 deaths in 2021.  Prevention is the focus of two training events this week. The first was held earlier tonight at the “Asbury Fire Protection District.” It’s thanks to “Specialty Risk Insurance” — which donated the equipment to the “Asbury Fire Protection District.” Officials with the “National Education Center for Agricultural Safety” will be on the road the next two weeks to train departments in rural communities across the Midwest.  When an adult falls into a grain bin, firefighters now have the capability of rescuing the person with a grain rescue tube. The tube is made of metal panels that piece together, making a circle around the trapped person. Rescue personnel then place an auger in the grain surrounding the person – to extract the grain. The person is then able to free themselves by pulling themselves out – or receiving help from first responders.  Asbury’s new equipment will also benefit 6 neighboring departments.  “Our department alone, which is a very small volunteer department, we cover 45 square miles of area, so, and all the other departments cover large areas, and there’s darn near a grain bin every, probably about every square mile, there’s at least one-grain bin. And the bins are getting larger and larger as time goes by,” said Tim Bartley, Volunteer Firefighter, Asbury Fire Protection District.  “We walk through how we set the tube up, then we actually put it into practice. We fill our trailer with about 120 bushels of grain. We actually physically sink people into the grain with an auger. The very thing we’re going to teach ’em not to do. We’re gonna simulate them having an accident. We’re gonna sink them down to their waist, and then the fire department is actually gonna go in there, use their rescue tube, and rescue them,” said Brian Freese, National Education Center for Agricultural Safety.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Vyc3RhdGVzaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamFzcGVyLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzL3RoZS1kYW5nZXItb2YtZ3JhaW4tYmlucy10aGlzLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtaGFzLW5ldy1yZXNjdWUtZXF1aXBtZW50L9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Vyc3RhdGVzaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamFzcGVyLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzL3RoZS1kYW5nZXItb2YtZ3JhaW4tYmlucy10aGlzLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtaGFzLW5ldy1yZXNjdWUtZXF1aXBtZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KPTV) - It’s been nearly four years since a brush fire in Northeast Portland broke out in an empty field and now the man who was accused of starting the fire was sentenced to two years in prison.  Allen Singerhouse pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree arson for a fire he started at his camp near Northeast 85th Avenue and Siskiyou Street back in August of 2019. The wind that day blew flames south towards Northeast 84th Avenue and Russell Street. Thick black smoke could be seen all around Portland. The fire destroyed businesses, cars, and a townhouse. Singerhouse was arrested a few months later and charged with arson. He apologized for his actions in court Monday.  “My poor decisions destroyed property and put innocent lives in danger of the homeowners and the firefighters in general,” Singerhouse said. “For that, I’m truly sorry.”  But after bailing out of jail, the court and prosecutors recognized his determination to turn his life around. Prosecutors said between then and now, he broke free from his addiction to meth, got a job, and became an influential member of his local church.  “The fact that he has been out of custody for an extended period of time and has gotten himself into treatment, gotten himself sober, and now becoming a valuable member of society, we have given him a very unusual offer for a fire of this magnitude,” The prosecutor said.  Judge Christopher Ramras also acknowledged the work Singerhouse has done over the last few years to get his life back on track.  “When we first met well over a year ago, when we had the first settlement conference, my recollection even then, you we actively engaged in treatment,” Ramras said.  No victims were present in court Monday, nor did they make a statement. But FOX 12 did speak to Freddy Ryan, Manager and Trainer of Grand Avenue Boxing Club. The gym was one of the businesses destroyed in the fire. He stood in the empty lot where his business once stood, recounting the destruction of the place he used to work.  “It was gone,” Ryan said. “They started demolishing the building. It was an unsafe building. We did our best to maintain it but you know, nothing you could do.”  Ryan said even after all these years trying to rebuild the gym, he never wanted to see Singerhouse go to jail.  “We’re not looking for vengeance,” Ryan said. “We’re looking for a little bit of redemption.”  Singerhouse was sentenced to two years in prison with five years of probation. There is also a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence on hold. But that would only be activated if Singerhouse fails to maintain a job and stay sober. He is also ordered to pay more than $160,000 in restitution to the victims. But Singerhouse said he’s dedicated to keep his life on the right track.  “I believe my actions warrant more than just an apology but a living amends that I will work through and continue to do by living an active role in my community, in my recovery community, and those about my life affecting them for the greater good,” Singerhouse said.

We want to rest,” Nicholas Gomez, who was displaced, said, “but we have to keep going.”  SEE ALSO: Downtown Portland apartment building damaged by fire partially collapses  Some residents say they’ve felt left in the dark through all of the hardship.  Tuesday, for the first time since the devastating fire which displaced more than 100 people a week ago, PF&R says a fire investigator will be entering the building.  “I’m sure they’re going to uncover somethings,” Gomez said. “I have no doubt.”  Gomez said he’s been having a hard time since the fire because he wasn’t able to grab his wallet or other necessary and crucial identifying documents.  “I basically have to try and get help from different programs, but not all of them are willing to help without ID.”  SEE ALSO: Devastating downtown Portland fire survivor recounts terrifying morning  He hopes an investigation may deem the building safe to enter and allow him to search through his old home for things that could help him.  “There’s just a lot of people who were financially struggling and they want answers too.”  Gomez has an online fundraiser if you’d like to help him through this difficult time in his life.

Police said they were supporting the bereaved families and arresting the rioters — but faced questions about whether officers' actions contributed to the fatal crash. Two teenage boys, ages 15 and 16, died in a crash involving an electronic bicycle in the Ely district of the Welsh capital on Monday evening, police said.  The South Wales force said “large-scale disorder” broke out after officers were called to the scene.  Chief Superintendent Martyn Stone said the force had received video footage showing a police van following an e-bike in the area minutes before the crash. But he said there were no police vehicles on the street when the crash occurred.  He said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigates deaths in which police may be involved.  Scenes livestreamed on social media Monday night showed dozens of people, many wearing hoods or ski masks, milling around while others threw objects and shot off fireworks at a line of police officers with riot shields blocking one end of the street.  A fire was burning and a helicopter could be heard hovering overhead. Shortly before midnight, a car was set on fire and burned fiercely, while a second vehicle was overturned and set ablaze.  The mayhem continued into the early hours of Tuesday, and at one point police officers were stationed outside Ely Police Station after suggestions it could be targeted.  Stone said 15 officers were injured, with 11 needing hospital treatment. He said police had made “a number” of arrests.  Resident John Urquhart said tensions rose in the area when police failed to tell local people what had happened.  “There was no attempt to communicate with the crowd and they showed nothing but disdain for the community and acted like we didn’t deserve to know what happened on our own doorstep,” he said.  “There was nobody going through the crowd. Crucially, I think the police really needed people to be out talking to the community and putting their minds at ease.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uYy90cmlhZC9hcC10b3AtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL2NhcnMtc2V0LW9uLWZpcmUtaW4td2Vsc2gtY2FwaXRhbC1hcy1wb2xpY2UtZmFjZS1sYXJnZS1zY2FsZS1kaXNvcmRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Flames tore through multiple units at an apartment complex on Sunday morning, displacing 14 adults and 4 children.  FRESNO, Calif. (KFSN) -- A series of fires had Fresno crews stretched thin over the weekend.  The fires put a strain not only on first responders but also on the Red Cross.  An apartment fire off McKinley and Maple avenues is one of the fires that kept firefighters busy in the last 72 hours.  The flames tore through multiple units Sunday morning, displacing 14 adults and 4 children.  ""These incidents are very devastating to those that are involved and impacted by the fire. We as a fire department, we do everything we can to try and salvage whatever personal belongings that we are able to salvage from the apartment or the home,"" said Christine Wilson with the Fresno Fire Department.  Central Valley Red Cross Executive Director Laura Wilson says her team had a very busy weekend, helping nearly 80 displaced families throughout the region.  ""This weekend is heavy. This weekend in the four years that I have been here (was) one of the busiest weekends that I can recall for our team,"" Laura explained,  Helmet camera video shows another apartment fire on Robinson Avenue in Central Fresno Saturday night.  Several others, from grass fires to vacant structure fires, have been keeping crews on the run at all times of the day.  Now, as temperatures heat up, the department has dispatched its CERT volunteer teams as additional resources to support the health and safety of firefighters  ""Wearing our fire gear adds about 15 degrees more in temperature. That places a huge factor in our rehab protocols and safety. We make sure our firefighters are rehabbed appropriately,"" Christine said.  The Fresno Fire Community Emergency Response Team, or CERT, provides support in a number of ways at the scene of a fire.  That includes helping firefighters rehabilitate with shade and water to prevent heat-related illnesses.

Rural fire districts rely heavily on the services of volunteer fire fighters, a resource pool that has dwindled noticeably in recent years.  ""Mohawk Fire, like most rural fire agencies, and really over 50% of the fire service in general in this country are volunteer fire fighters,"" said Mohawk Valley Fire Chief Steven Wallace.  Wallace's department serves roughly 4,500 people over a 27 square mile district around Marcola. He says they receive close to 500 calls a year.  Wallace's volunteer base has been cut in half over the last decade, going from over 40 volunteers in 2012, to under 20.    ""We've seen our volunteer numbers dropping routinely over the last ten years,"" Wallace said. ""It definitely sped up during the COVID-19 pandemic.""  The primary issue stems from a lack of incoming volunteers, according to Wallace, and burnout has only caused more and more people to leave.  ""Burnout becomes a bigger issue when we have lower numbers, which helps drive people out the door,"" Wallace said. ""[During] the summer, it becomes very difficult with the heat. People get wore out quicker. They get tired easier, so we need to have enough people to keep accomplishing the mission, but as well as not hurting anyone in the process.""  Just last week, Wallace and the Mohawk Valley Rural Fire Department responded to a house fire in Marcola. The fire would take hours to get under control with hotter temperatures and a small number of volunteers.  It ended up being a two-alarm fire, requiring help from other local fire departments.  ""Most fire districts are expanding their mutual aid agreements, because all of us are experiencing shortages in staffing,"" Wallace said. ""Even the paid departments are seeing a shortage of people applying for jobs.""  To rectify this, Wallace and his department have begun reaching out over social media, going to high schools, and trying to increase their reach to bolster these numbers. Wallace adds that the Oregon Fire District Directors Association has created a retirement account for volunteers, as well as offering residency programs where these volunteers can live at a fire station for free while they train.  One of Mohawk's volunteers, Jerry Oglesbee, says that had he started volunteering sooner, his career path might have been different.  ""If I would have done this when I was 20, this would have been a career for sure,"" Oglesbee said. ""Now it's a hobby, and I tell people that, it's a hobby. I enjoy it, I love it. I don't know, if they told me I couldn't do it, what I would do.""

"fire","2022-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:36:12","Fires affected some 1.8 million hectares in Argentina in 2022.  Many of the country’s 2022 fires occurred in the country’s northern Chaco region and were largely caused by industrial agriculture coupled with drought conditions, according to Indigenous residents and researchers.  The arid Gran Chaco is the second-largest forest in South America after the Amazon, and extends across 110 million hectares and portions of four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia  Experts said deforestation of Argentina’s Chaco is affecting Indigenous communities’ access to resources.  “We couldn’t see the sun for a whole month because of the clouds of smoke. For an entire month, between October and November (2022), we didn’t see the sun,” said David Sarapura, from the Indigenous Kolla Tinkunaku community in Argentina.  “It was awful,” Sarapura said, “the older people told us that fires like this had never happened before. Even airtanker planes couldn’t be used to fight the fire because there was no visibility.”  A similar situation occurred in General José de San Martín, another of the departments located in the province of Salta, near Orán.  Satellite data from the Global Forest Watch (GFW) monitoring platform began registering deforestation alerts associated with fires on Oct. 1, 2022. According to a report by Greenpeace Argentina, which includes data from the National Fire Management Service (SNMF), forest fires affected around 95,000 hectares of forests in Salta province in 2022. Nationwide, fires affected some 1.8 million hectares.  In mid-December, rainfall slowed the spread of the fire, although it still burned in some places. By the beginning of 2023, there were still some areas with fire, but very few, Sarapura said.  “Last year, Salta had a significant number of fires. It is a growing problem and one that has persisted over the last three years thanks to drought,” said Hernán Giardini, Coordinator of Greenpeace Argentina’s Forests and Climate Change campaigns.  Giardini says it is unusual for a large number of areas to catch fire in Salta. This is especially true for the Yungas forest, a mountainous area.  Giardini said Argentina has been experiencing a severe drought, which caused “many outbreaks of fire to spread.”  Since 2019, much of Argentina has been experiencing droughts, with 2022 12.8% drier than average and ranking among the 14 driest years since 1961, according to a report from Argentina’s National Meteorological Service.  Another report published by the meteorological service in February 2023 suggests that extreme temperatures at the beginning of the month were mainly concentrated in Patagonia, but from Feb. 6, heat moved from south to north.  Giardini said that 95% of Argentina’s forest fires are caused by humans, explaining that some are intentional, while others are accidental or caused by negligence.  “When I say accidental, I mean everything from a poorly extinguished barbecue or cigarette butt through to burning pasture for regrowth, a practice that in times of drought can lead to fire spreading easily,” Giardini said. “Areas are burned after a clearing, or are burned just to avoid having to secure a deforestation permit.”  The other 5% of the fires, Giardini continued, are caused by lightning storms that strike the middle of the forest and ignite a fire that spreads easily in the dry season.  “It also happens sometimes in areas that are difficult for the fire service to access, and it gets more challenging in the mountains,” Giardini said.  But Giardini cautioned that it’s not always possible to determine the cause of a fire.  “We were on the ground with communities helping them to fight the spread of the fire, the causes of which are not yet known,” Giardini said.  “If you ask the older people, our grandparents, they will tell you that climate change has occurred dramatically in a short space of time. This includes a lack of water, the disappearance of some species, and the movement of wild animals from one place to another,” Sarapura said. He added that until recently, jaguars would never have been seen in areas above 2,500 meters of altitude; but, over the last few years, due to with fire activity, they have been spotted at 3,000 meters.  Sarapura, a member of the Indigenous Kolla Tinkunaku community, said that many species of wildlife fled because of the fire, but others were burned to death.  “We have jaguars (Panthera onca), tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira), black squirrel monkeys (Saimiri vanzolinii). There are a lot of animals, because this region is one of the most populated with wildlife in the whole of Argentina,” Sarapura said.  “Without their natural habitat they had to migrate to other areas in order to survive,” he added. “Let’s hope that this year is not as dry, because if it happens again it will wipe out the entire forest. For the time being, some trees have been left standing.”  Ana Álvarez, President of the Chaco Argentina Agroforestry Network, explained a large, forest-dependant Indigenous population inhabits Formosa, Chaco and Salta—three provinces in the Argentine Chaco region.  Álvarez said deforestation in Salta province is affecting Indigenous communities’ access to resources, and is being driven by industrial agriculture.  Álvarez explained that the region’s agriculture boom began in the 1970s and intensified at the beginning of the 21st century as soy and other commodity crops prospered due to temporary increases in rainfall. .  “It was then that the entire region first opened up to crops, mainly soy, but also beans, corn and sugarcane,” Álvarez said.  But the aridity the Chaco is known for eventually returned. Álvarez said that in order to stay profitable, many crop growers became cattle ranchers and expanded pastureland by clearing forests.  The Gran Chaco is the second-largest forest in South America after the Amazon, and extends across 110 million hectares and portions of four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. The ecoregion is home to some 3,400 plant species, 500 bird species, 150 mammal species and 220 reptile and 100 amphibian species.  Argentina’s Forest Law was passed in 2007 after a petition spearheaded by civil society garnered 1.5 million signatures, putting pressure on the National Congress to act. Through this law, which requires all provinces to implement Territorial Planning of Native Forests (known by its Spanish-language acronym, OTBN), deforestation was prohibited in almost 80% of forested areas. However, some land-use plans, such as those affecting Salta and Chaco provinces, were modified by their provincial governments, leading to a reduction in areas where clearing is prohibited. The law also ordered that the OTBN be updated every five years, but not all provinces have complied with this.  “Since the Forest Law was enacted, some 400,000 hectares of forest have been lost in the Chaco province —close to half a million. If we zoom out and talk about the entire Gran Chaco, in the 13 years from 2004 to 2017, seven million hectares were lost. This figure includes Paraguay and Bolivia, but a large part of these seven million hectares is in Argentina,” said Italian physicist Ricardo Tiddi, a member of the citizens’ platform Somos Monte.  “There has been so much clearing in Argentina that there are almost no wildlife corridors left for animals to move between the Argentine Gran Chaco and the rest of the Gran Chaco in other countries,” Tiddi said.  Lecko Audencio Zamora, Indigenous peoples’ rights activist and member of the Wichi people, lamented the spread of soy in the region.  “They have always preached that [soy cultivation] brings health and progress,” Zamora said, “but in reality, for Indigenous peoples, it has brought the opposite; land evictions, more poverty, more hunger and less health.”  This is a translated and updated version of a story that was first reported by Mongabay’s Latam team and published here on our Latam site on March 9, 2023  Banner image: A community member from Orán grieves over the devastation caused by forest fires.

A massive fire tore through Manila’s historic post office building overnight, slightly injuring seven people and razing the nearly 100-year-old landmark in the Philippine capital, police and postal officials said Monday.  The fire started before midnight Sunday in the basement of the Neoclassical five-story building and was brought under control Monday morning more than seven hours after it began, firefighters said.  An investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire and the damage, officials said, adding that seven people, mostly firefighters, sustained minor injuries or were overwhelmed by thick smoke.

Crews searching the rubble of a massive construction fire in North Carolina on Friday found the bodies of two people that firefighters couldn’t reach before the flames became too intense.  Authorities didn’t identify the victims, but officials said two workers were missing after the Thursday fire on the site of a new apartment building in the upscale South Park neighborhood of Charlotte.  No one else was injured in the five-alarm fire, including more than 90 firefighters and a worker trapped for a time on top of a crane as a fire engine sprayed water on the metal to keep it from collapsing.  “I’ve never ever seen a fire of this magnitude,” said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings, a 31-year veteran of the force. ”It’s devastating, heartbreaking.”  Investigators think the fire started about 9 a.m. Thursday in a trailer used to spray insulation into the building’s walls, Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said.  The chief said they aren’t sure exactly what set off the blaze and haven’t been able to do a thorough investigation of the trailer.  “Obviously, the building’s still in a state where it is not safe for all of our members to go in,” Johnson said.  The massive fire sent huge red flames and dense black smoke into the sky. At least two small crews of firefighters had to make mayday calls and be rescued from the fast-moving blaze, including one who could hear the cries of the trapped people on the sixth floor but couldn’t see them through the smoke, Johnson said.  “They were going by sound, trying to get to them but were unable to get to them before conditions changed,” Johnson said. “They had to call a mayday.”  The firefighters did rescue 15 workers inside the building, including the crane operator. Firefighters delivered protective clothing to him until he could climb down to safety, Johnson said.  Photo: Firefighters at the scene.

More children ages 1-4 die from drowning than any other cause. As valuable as the device itself, is the education that will be provided by County Fire personnel at the time of delivery and install. Fire staff will teach the household best practices to prevent drowning, including the basics of swimming and water safety, supervising closely, installing fences that fully enclose pools, and for added measure, installing a pool alarm. As a last resort, knowing CPR could save a life. County Fire can help with this too! Interested individuals will be referred to any one of County Fire’s free CPR courses in the community.

(WLUC) - A fire destroyed a building at 209 Calumet St. on M-26 in Lake Linden Sunday night, however, no people were injured.  The Lake Linden Fire Chief says the fire happened near the corner of Calumet St. and 2nd St. Firefighters first responded just after 11:00 p.m. Sunday. It was described as an explosion by multiple callers.  “I was standing outside, about a block away,” said Lake Linden Resident Kim Taunton. “When I heard a loud boom, and then I saw a puff of smoke, and then I saw it light up with flames, so I ran out into the road, and I saw the fire on the garage.”  Taunton says there was a total of three separate explosions as it covered the garage. Once the garage caught fire, it quickly spread to the neighboring building.  “The garage was fully engulfed in flames, the stairwell to the building was fully engulfed in flames, and then the fire was on the roof of the big building here that’s now knocked down,” continued Taunton.  The fire chief described it as a very intense fire, with over 400,000 gallons of water used to put out the fire.  The first floor of the building is a former dentist’s office, with an apartment in the upper half. People who live on the second floor were out of town Sunday night, but a cat died in the fire.  The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department, Lake Linden Village Police, and eight or nine agencies from surrounding areas also responded. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  “There’s no indications right now of a natural gas leak or anything like that until the fire marshal can take a look at it and kinda make a determination of it,” said Lake Linden Fire Chief Andrew Kotila.  The state fire marshal is expected to visit the scene this week.  The scene was first cleared by 5:30 a.m. Monday. The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department returned at 6:00 a.m. and left again by 8:30 a.m. Some smoke may still be visible, but the fire chief says it’s just leftover steam.

The Kirkman Street restaurant posted a note on social media about the fire, saying the restaurant is temporarily closed, but will “soon reopen with even more passion to come back together as a family again.”  The post shows ashes in the outdoor area of the restaurant.  “I wake up every day with a passion to serve you. This place is my first home. It’s our home,” owner Gus Garden said in the restaurant’s post. “This morning I woke up to a call from the Lake Charles Fire Department. ‘Don’t tell me this,’ I told them when they gave me the news. This is not the news I want to give you, but it is what’s happening now.”  Garden initially believed the fire to be an electrical issue, but according to Lake Charles Fire Prevention Bureau Captain Brandon Spooner, surveillance video shows otherwise.  “[The video shows] a person, probably about 120 pounds, five-foot-three or -four, entering the rear fence gate of the business, walking directly to the window, setting the liquid accelerant on the window and lighting it on the window sill,” Spooner said. “It ignited immediately. They turned around and walked off pretty calmly.”  “They did have their face covered, they knew where the cameras were, they knew how to get into the premises, they didn’t try to break in, they didn’t pull any doors. They didn’t try to do anything but set the place on fire,” he said.  The owner and investigators are now looking into previous employees who may fit the description of the person in the video.  Garden said the first call came in around 2 a.m. from his alarm system provider, telling him the building had lost connection with the panel and there was no power. Soon after, he got a call from the city that his restaurant was on fire.  “Firefighters were here, and they were already cleaning, making sure that everything was down,” Garden told us earlier today. “The fire kind of started on the roof and worked its way down, you know, affecting this side of the bar.”  Area 337 has been serving Latin cuisine to the community for just over two years, and Garden hopes to continue.  “I’ll keep my attitude positive,” Garden said. “I’m gonna relocate a couple of my employees. I got a bunch of support from different restaurant owners in town, and we take care of each other. That’s why Lake Charles is Lake Charles.”  The community is holding a benefit for Area 337 at Crying Eagle on Friday, June 16.  Copyright 2023 KPLC.

A fire destroyed their home on Mothers Day.  BENSON – Ryan and Stephanie Oswald had the most memorable Mother’s Day ever.  Saturday night was like any other Saturday night. The two children Izbel, 10, and MacKoy Oswald, 12, fell asleep on the couch. Except for the howling wind everything seemed to be uneventful.  At 3 a.m., however, a fire destroyed their chicken coop, spread to the garage then torched the house and everything inside of it.  In the early morning hours Ryan woke up to a whooshing sound like something hitting their Benson home.  “I heard a loud thud hit the house. It could have been a limb of a tree or our trampoline. It also sounded like there was a sound of a fire burning. I wasn’t sure,” Ryan said. “When I opened the door, I saw the flames were 10 to 20 feet high from the burning garages. I started screaming to get everyone out of the house.”  They only had minutes to evacuate everyone and their pets before the fire consumed everything they owned. He said the fire probably started when wind hit the heat lamps and they blew over in the chicken coop and it caught fire. The fire jumped to the garage next, then on to the house.  The winds were reported to be in the 50 to 60 mile per hour range that night.  “My phone records show that I called 911 at 3:25,” Stephanie said. “Ryan saw the fire, he told me and I grabbed the phone on my way to get my elderly mom home out of the house.”  Stephanie’s mother had stayed the night and she was the closest to her so she got her up and the kids were sleeping on the couch. They got everyone out of the house, including most of their pets and moved their cars to a safe space.  “After moving the cars and getting the pets out of the house we had about 10 minutes before it jumped to the house,” Ryan said. “It was the saddest thing I’d ever seen.”  When the neighbors heard them screaming and saw the flames they came to help.  “We didn’t have time to get anything out of the house,” she said. “We did manage to get five of our six pets out of the house. We’re still missing a cat.”  They called the fire department, but they had to go around the flood zones. Smithfield Fire Department showed up first. When they got there the house had just started to burn. The fire was throughout the attic and the west side of the home was on fire. Four fire departments were on the scene but too late to save the house.  “There we were in our robes with no shoes on watching the fire take everything,” Stephanie said. “We had original pictures of family members that went back generations and school pictures of our kids all gone.”  The wood frame house was first built in 1949 and had at least two additions. The older wood accelerated the fire and it didn’t take long for the fire to engulf the home.  “I had both of my grandfather’s flags, genealogy, huge framed pictures of my great, great grandfathers, my husband’s grandmother’s pictures, family history and lot of other priceless stuff,” she said. “Everything we saved, is gone.”  After all the destruction and lost family history they are still grateful they all got out safe.  “We feel very lucky and blessed,” Ryan said. “We are grateful to the community, church, employers, neighbors and friends that they have stepped up to help us,” he said. “People have been coming out of the woodwork to help us. It is a very humbling experience.”  Next door neighbor Jim Seamons and his family jumped to help evacuate the Oswald family and helped get grandma out of the house and their cars out of the way. There were four different fire departments at the scene that came to help.  “I look back at that day and there are so many things that could have happened that could have been worse,” Ryan said. “We are lucky to have all of us here.”  The front of the house is still standing but inside behind the front door was badly burnt and the detached garage was reduced to rubble. A fire restoration company has fenced the area off.  “We had nothing. The neighbors gave us shoes for our feet and shirts for our back,” Ryan said. “We are indebted to those who helped us.”  The Oswalds plan to rebuild in the same location when all the ruble gets cleaned up. There is a GoFundMe account set up on social media to help the family.  Cache Valley Daily does not guarantee that the funds deposited into the account will be used for the benefit of the designated beneficiaries.

"fire","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:57:20","Get In-Depth Insights and Exclusive Content Delivered Direct to You.  Over the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, fire departments across the United States responded to roughly 347,000 home structure fires per year. That data, courtesy of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), underscores the significance of home fire protection measures.  Smoke detectors are a key component of fire protection, but there’s much more homeowners can do to protect themselves, their families, their belongings and their homes from structure fires.  ROUTINE INSPECTIONS  Smoke detectors can only alert residents to a fire if they’re working properly. Battery-powered smoke detectors won’t work if the batteries die. Routine smoke detector check-ups can ensure the batteries still have juice and that the devices themselves are still functioning properly. Test alarms to make sure the devices are functioning and audible in nearby rooms. Install additional detectors as necessary so alarms and warnings can be heard in every room of the house.  HIRE AN ELECTRICIAN  Electricians can inspect a home and identify any issues that could make the home more vulnerable to fires. Ask electricians to look over every part of the house, including attics and crawl spaces. Oft-overlooked areas like attics and crawl spaces pose a potentially significant fire safety threat, as data from the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) indicates that 13% of electrical fires begin in such spaces.  AUDIT THE LAUNDRY ROOM  The laundry room is another potential source of home structure fires. NFPA data indicates around 3% of home structure fires begin in laundry rooms each year. Strategies to reduce the risk of laundry room fires include leaving room for laundry to tumble in washers and dryers; routinely cleaning lint screens to avoid the buildup of dust, fiber and lint, which the NFPA notes are often the first items to ignite in fires linked to dryers; and ensuring the outlets that washing machines and dryers are plugged into can handle the voltage such appliances require. It’s also a good idea to clean dryer exhaust vents and ducts every year.  LOOK OUTWARD  Though the majority of home fires begin inside, the NFPA reports that 4% of such fires begin outside the home. Homeowners can reduce the risk of such fires by ensuring all items that utilize fire, including grills and firepits, are always used at least 10 feet away from the home. Never operate a grill beneath eaves, and do not use grills on decks. Never leave children unattended around firepits, as all it takes is a single mistake and a moment for a fire to become unwieldy.  SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF  Hair dryers, hair straighteners, scented candles, clothes irons and holiday decorations are some additional home fire safety hazards. Never leave candles burning in empty rooms and make sure beauty and grooming items like dryers, straighteners and irons are unplugged and placed in a safe place to cool down when not in use.  Fire departments respond to hundreds of thousands of home fires each year. Some simple strategies and preventive measures can greatly reduce the risk that a fire will overtake your home.

The battery-powered truck, a nonsalable test vehicle, was in storage when the fire started, according to the company Monday.  “Emergency protocols were followed, and the Lordstown Fire Department was called to the scene,” according to a statement from Lordstown Motors. “No one was injured, and the company will investigate the cause of the fire.”  Firefighters were called just after 7:30 p.m. to the Hallock Young Road plant and left about two hours later, according to a report.  Messages were left Monday with Lordstown fire Chief Travis Eastham seeking more information were not returned.  In January 2021, a developmental version of the Endurance burst into flames on its first-ever road test in a suburb of Detroit. The fire destroyed the truck.  Foxconn acquired the massive factory last year for $230 million, allowing new Lordstown Motors’ leadership to further transition the company from manufacturing toward EV development and engineering. The company, however, has experienced troubles lately.  Lordstown Motors has issued three recalls of the truck, its flagship vehicle, since limited production began in November. The company also announced in February it stopped production temporarily due to supplier parts issues that led to the recalls. Production resumed in April.  Now, Lordstown Motors finds itself grappling with Foxconn over future funding in a $170 million equity investment agreement the companies signed in November and trying to find a way to pump up the company’s poor-performing stock price.  Without Foxconn closing on a common stock purchase worth about $47.2 million and other obstacles in Lordstown Motors’ way, the company has stated in regulatory filings it could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  The dispute with Foxconn started with an April 21 notice from the Taiwanese technology and electronics company it believed the EV maker was in breach of the investment agreement because of a delisting notice the company received from Nasdaq.  Lordstown Motors has stated in regulatory documents the discussions with Foxconn are at an impasse, however, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said recently the company remains “open to continued dialogue to find the best solution for each other.”  On Monday, Lordstown Motors stockholders at their annual meeting were expected to vote on a path to try to cure the sagging stock price through a reverse stock split. Doing so would consolidate the company’s existing shares into fewer shares with the intended result of a higher price.  Details were not available Monday but are expected today.  The company has 180 days to come back into compliance with Nasdaq’s rule. The stock closed trading at 30 cents per share Monday, up 9.2 percent from Friday.  rselak@tribtoday.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbmR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9sbWMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzLWNhdXNlLW9mLXRydWNrLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s insane.”  Goulet said her friend is “completely distraught” by the news, and hopes the worst-case scenario is that the wedding will be held outside in a tent — but her friend wants what she paid for.  “She wants it here, she wants it inside. She wants everything she paid full price for,” she added.  Goulet stopped by the venue to get a look at the damage herself.  “The main areas looked fine, but the whole kitchen side was all burnt and I could smell smoke,” she said.  In a statement, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Golf Association said Kirkbrae is using all of its resources to ensure the facility is “safe and operational sooner than expected.”  However, it’s unclear what the expected timeline is and just how many events this is impacting.  Goulet said her friend did get a phone call from the venue soon after the fire on Monday, and they told her they hope to have some answers Tuesday.  Workers were inside the venue all day Monday trying to get things back to normal, and they’ll be back first thing Tuesday morning. The power is back on in some parts of the building, 12 News has learned.  Meanwhile, other local venues are offering help. Jerry Garcia, the general manager of Agawam Hunt in Rumford, told 12 News they’re “more than willing” to assist in accommodating displaced events, if feasible.  “The club market is relatively small and we all need to help each other where we can,” Garcia said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS93ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnRpZXMtaW4tbGltYm8tYWZ0ZXIta2lya2JyYWUtY291bnRyeS1jbHViLWZpcmUv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3ByaS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtdmFsbGV5L3dlZGRpbmctcGFydGllcy1pbi1saW1iby1hZnRlci1raXJrYnJhZS1jb3VudHJ5LWNsdWItZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2021-10-11","Not Discerned","{""ArroyoHondo"", ""NewMexico"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T22:33:49","A Santa Barbara Canyon  Recovers from Fire and Rain  The Miraculous Survival  of the Arroyo Hondo Preserve  By Sally Isaacson | May 23, 2023  The view to the west of Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Credit: Sally Isaacson  On October 11, 2021, I learned that Arroyo Hondo Preserve, where I work, was in the path of the Alisal Fire. I rushed to the canyon and saw the fire, with huge billowing smoke clouds, driven by fierce winds, racing downhill from the mountains to the Pacific.  The fire coming over the preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Within a few days, we realized the huge impact the fire had upon the preserve. For all the many visitors who had enjoyed the immense biodiversity of Arroyo Hondo over the years, the scorched earth left from the fire may have seemed like a hopeless tragedy. But for me, as a botanist, I knew this was the beginning of an exciting time watching how this beautiful canyon would recover.  Fires in Mediterranean climates such as ours are well-documented. We know that many native plants and animals are especially adapted to survive recurrent wildfires. What I could not know at the time was what a variety of intense weather conditions Arroyo Hondo would experience in the next few years. The following is the tale of how a resilient regional ecosystem responded to devastating fires and torrential rains.  The Lay of the Land  The mud flows at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  The preserve remained closed until May 2022; however, staff and a few dedicated volunteers continued to work. At first, I walked the trails, photographing the scene: smoking trees with deep cavities carved into their trunks, some burned down through to their roots. Others had open windows where fire had burned right through their trunks. Most trees had been scorched, some turned into curious sculptures, but what we didn’t know was which ones had actually been killed.  Hillside sycamores | Photo: Sally Isaacson  The scene, recently painted in autumn greens and golds, was now a monotonous expanse of blacks and browns. On the steepest slopes, clad with the oldest chaparral, the fire burned hottest. Only charred shrubs remained. Gray ash covered the bare, baked soil. When we tried to climb up a slope, the soil slid out beneath us.  The surface was so fragile that we wondered what would happen when it rained. But long before any rains, green fern fronds, blades of grass, and even mushrooms began pushing up through the blackened leaf litter.  The old adobe and the barn also survived intact. Cattle and sheep had recently grazed the front part of the canyon, and this, combined with fire crews who bulldozed the surrounding area, saved the buildings.  A smoking tree trunk at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  At first, all was eerily silent. What animals would survive such an inferno? But soon we saw signs of life: A big rattlesnake slithered over the blackened earth, and the canyon’s resident deer herd, looking thinner than a few weeks before, began to quietly return. We speculated that they had sheltered in the orchard where the paths between the trees were clear of brush.  Fresh tracks of foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and at least one mountain lion reassured us that other animals had survived, though we found a number of rodent skulls and the remains of a coyote. Almost all of the stick-pile nests of the big-eared woodrats had burned up, and we wondered how many of their residents had survived, though we saw some tree squirrels that had sheltered in the tallest sycamore.  Big hawks roosted in the trees watching for prey. And once we were surprised to see a blackened bush covered with bright, tiny, yellow things — a flock of goldfinches. What joy to see color returning to the canyon.  Showers and Flowers  The seedlings sprout at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Despite years of drought, the winter of 2022 brought renewed hope for a wet season. We had two significant storms. With those rains, and the lengthening days as spring approached, came an almost miraculous awakening of plants, many of which we worried had been killed. Bay trees that had appeared dead sprouted madly from their bases, and most of the oaks and sycamores soon had new leaves along their branches. Ferns, which had not waited for the rain, were now flourishing in their special spots.  With spring came special wildflowers: delicate red fire poppies, blue large-flowered phacelias, pale yellow whispering bells, cream-colored ear drops, and others that are rarely seen except after fires. Other plants produced more flowers than usual, probably due to nutrients from the ash as well as absence of shade from surrounding plants. We saw luxuriant giant stream orchids, unusually abundant golden stars, mariposa lilies, and a host of others.  Fire Poppy | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Along the stream, the pools were covered with ash, yet fish, at first, could still be seen. But that changed after the two rain storms of that winter (2021-2022).We often talk about devastation caused by wildfires, but it is really the combination of fires plus the floods that follow that cause the greatest changes to ecosystems.  Although those rains were unusually high along the coast, the burned mountains above received much more precipitation. Ashy mud soon covered a flat area below the slopes. Floodwater, carrying gravel, rocks, and branches, changed the creek habitat. Pools were obliterated, and the creek bed became wider and flatter.  Our rare turtles, frogs, and newts survived, but the entire population of rainbow trout and/or steelhead vanished from Arroyo Hondo Creek. This creek is known to be an important steelhead spawning stream, and we do not know how long it will take before the rare Southern California steelhead return.  The big floods of this winter (2022-2023) have further changed the course of the creek. Much fine sediment has been washed out, and the creek bed is now lined with big clean cobbles and boulders. New pools are forming, and these should provide good habitat for aquatic animals. The water is sparkling and clear, and it flows fast to the ocean. A big pool has formed at the estuary once more, and we hope for a pair of mature southern steelhead to enter this pool from the ocean, swim upstream through the man-made fish passage under Highway 101, spawn, and repopulate the stream.  The ever-changing Arroyo Hondo has given us all, visitors and scientists alike, an opportunity to witness the natural recovery of a resilient ecosystem after fire and flood — a uniquely Californian recovery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL2Etc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1jYW55b24tcmVjb3ZlcnMtZnJvbS1maXJlLWFuZC1yYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The low- to moderate-intensity fire is burning in grass and pine needles and has grown to approximately 193acres.  “We are applying a confine and contain strategy on this fire and allowing it to play its natural role in this fire-adapted ecosystem,” said Agency Administrator Elizabeth Toney. “We’re seeing really excellent fire effects, burning surface fuels in pine understory, consuming dead grass and dead and down logs.”  Fire weather conditions so far this season are much less volatile than this time last year, given the wet summer, fall, and winter of the past 11 months, as well as unseasonal rains that fell over the area last week. Recent and ongoing fuels sampling shows that trees and shrubs are holding enough moisture that they are not yet available for burning.  There are limited values at risk will be protected as appropriate if fire reaches pre-identified management action points. Pass Fire produced low-lying smoke that settled overnight Sunday into the Indian Creek and the Gila River drainages, impacting the Gila Cliff Dwelling National Monument, area campgrounds, and residential areas near Gila Hot Springs.

"fire","2023-09-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:40:39","Over the Labor Day holiday in 2020, with east winds picking up toward the end of a long, hot and dry summer, Leland Ohrt was dispatched to a home not far from his own, where a tree branch had fallen on a powerline and started a small brush fire. Ohrt was Mill City Fire Chief, a VFD chief in a small town in western Oregon’s Cascades; he hosed down the fire, then drove over to Schroeder Road, where another tree branch had fallen over another powerline and was still arcing sparks into the dry fuels below. Ohrt couldn’t stop the sparking, so he hosed the utility lines with water until they exploded and de-energized themselves.  Those two incidents initiated a frenzied 48 hours for Ohrt, acccording to an OPB report today, and he was later recognized for his efforts to save Mill City as the fires destroyed thousands of homes down the Santiam Canyon and across other parts of western Oregon.  Chief Ohrt saw Pacific Power’s utility lines start those fires, but he took the stand last week to defend the utility company in a class action trial against Pacific Power. He told a jury in Multnomah County Circuit Court that he immediately blew off attorneys who’d sent him paperwork in the weeks following the fires — lawyers who were trying to contact fire victims.  “I threw all that paperwork away,” Ohrt said. “You could tell right off the bat they were going to go after Pacific Power for this.”  Ohrt’s testimony highlighted a key aspect of the defense Pacific Power’s corporate owners, PacifiCorp, expect to lay out in the coming weeks of the trial: Most of the wildfires in the Santiam Canyon started not from their powerlines, but from embers of the Beachie Creek Fire. Even in places where powerlines did start fires, PacifiCorp’s attorneys contend that people fighting those fires quickly got them under control.  The defense follows what has been several weeks of plaintiffs’ attorneys alleging that PacifiCorp acted negligently by keeping its lines energized during the Labor Day fires, even though they had plenty of warning from weather officials and state government about fire danger. The decision to keep the power on contributed to fires spreading out of control, according to the plaintiffs and their attorneys.  Ohrt though, under questioning from PaficiCorp’s lawyers, pointed to another culprit: the U.S. Forest Service. Ohrt has more than 45 years’ experience with Mill City’s volunteer fire department, but he does not have any experience fighting wildfires.  Weeks before the Santiam Canyon fires, a lightning strike started the Beachie Creek Fire — northeast of Gates in the Opal Creek Wilderness. Forest Service officials said then that steep terrain made it difficult to get crews to the site to contain the slowly growing fire. According to Ohrt, though, letting the Beachie Creek Fire smolder allowed it to throw embers into the Santiam Canyon when winds picked up on Labor Day.  An excellent “storymap” about the Beachie Creek Fire is [HERE].  “The U.S. Forest Service was supposed to be fighting that fire,” Ohrt said in his testimony.  Late in 2020 Linn County had to sue the Forest Service to get fire documents.  The Type 3 IC at the time knew that air support was critical, according to a USFS review of the fire, but he also recognized that the fire was burning in an old growth stand, meaning there was a multistory canopy with abundant down logs, duff, moss, and fuels. He knew that getting firefighters on the ground to dig deep for hotspots was the only way to successfully contain the fire.  “Everyone assumes that if you hammer a fire with aerial resources, it will go out, but that’s not the case. There needs to be boots on the ground working in tandem with aircraft. There are hidden hotspots, sheltered from aerial attack, under big logs and deep roots that have to be dug out.”  ~ unnamed Type 3 Incident Commander  Whether jurors in the case find PacifiCorp responsible for the wildfires in the Santiam Canyon will likely be influenced by which attorneys’ experts they find more believable. Oregon State University professor John Bailey, for example, testified that there was no way the Beachie Creek Fire could have thrown embers far enough before midnight on Labor Day 2020 to start fires near the town of Gates. Bailey, who teaches fire management and has been studying forestry since the 1980s, said he used topography data, recorded weather conditions, and fuels analysis to estimate where the Beachie Creek Fire could have thrown embers ahead of its front to start new fires. He said strong east winds that night would have — at most — lit spot fires north of Gates and other residential areas in the canyon.  PacifiCorp’s attorneys, on the other hand, had atmospheric sciences professor Neil Lareau of the University of Nevada testify, and he said the extreme weather conditions that night did indeed throw firebrands miles ahead of the Beachie Creek Fire. Lareau explained to jurors how he used satellite data from the fire to determine when plumes of debris burst from the fire and cast embers thousands of feet aloft. He said those plumes matched up with on-the-ground reports of spot fires in the Santiam Canyon. Bailey, by contrast, said embers thrown by fires can rarely travel more than a mile — a far shorter distance than needed to start the fires Lareau claimed originated from the Beachie Creek Fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2lsZGZpcmV0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9wYWNpZmljLXBvd2VyLWxhd3N1aXQtbWF5LWNvbWUtZG93bi10by1maXJlLWJlaGF2aW9yLWV4cGVydHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","{""Bakersfield"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:00:00","BAKERSFIELD, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management will issue seasonal fire restrictions for public lands managed by the Bakersfield Field Office effective Thursday, May 25, due to dry conditions and high wildland fire danger. These seasonal restrictions are in addition to the year-round statewide fire prevention order, issued on April 28, 2020. This seasonal fire order will remain in effect until further notice.  The BLM-managed public lands affected by these fire restrictions are in eastern Fresno, western Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties, as well as the Carrizo Plain National Monument, Keysville Special Recreation Management Area, Lake Isabella and San Joaquin River Gorge.  “Due to dry conditions, significant dead and dying grasses and high fire danger, it has become necessary to implement additional fire restrictions,” advises Bakersfield Field Manager Gabriel Garcia. “We ask for your cooperation to help minimize fire potential. These proactive measures are put in place to protect public land visitors, communities, adjacent private lands and natural resources from the risk of wildfire.”  The additional restrictions include no campfires, barbecues, or open fires, in or outside of developed campgrounds. Portable stoves with gas, jelled petroleum, or pressurized liquid fuel are allowed with a valid California campfire permit available free at all BLM, U.S. Forest Service and Cal Fire offices, or at www.readyforwildfire.org/prevent-wildfire/campfire-safety/.  On average, human-caused wildfires make up 95 percent of all wildfires in California. Many of these wildfires occur close in proximity to roadways, communities and recreational areas, posing considerable threat to public safety. Taking individual responsibility to reduce wildfire risk, while recreating on public lands, around homes and communities, before a fire occurs can help keep property, the public and firefighters safe.  The following restrictions will remain in place until fire dangers subside:  No Campfires briquette/charcoal barbeques are allowed . Stoves/grills are allowed only with a valid California Campfire Permit.  . Stoves/grills are allowed only with a valid California Campfire Permit. No Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a developed recreation site, or in an area at least three feet in diameter barren of all flammable materials.  No welding or operating acetylene or other torch with open flame.  No motorized vehicles or tools powered by internal combustion engines off designated roads or trails.  No use of any steel-jacketed, steel core or incendiary ammunition of any caliber, except with a state of California hunting license and in accordance with California hunting regulations.  As always, possessing, discharging or using fireworks or pyrotechnic devices are prohibited across Bureau of Land Management lands. Additionally, a valid California Campfire Permit is required to operate a stove or fire on these public lands.  HELP PREVENT FIRES  Residents and visitors are reminded to help prevent human-caused fires:  Make sure all campfires are dead out! Drown it and stir around the fire area with a shovel to wet any remaining embers and ash. If it’s not cool, it is not out.  Be sure to maintain proper tire pressure for all vehicles, ensure adequate tire tread, and check brakes for overheating. Do not drive or park on brush or grass. Do not drag chains while towing.  Motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and chainsaws require an approved spark arrestor.  Remember the use of steel-core ammunition, although legal while hunting, can greatly increase the chance of a wildfire if ricocheted off objects such as rocks.  Anyone found guilty of violating a fire prevention order may be fined not more than $100,000 and/or face imprisonment for not more than 12 months. Restitution for total fire suppression and damage costs incurred may be borne by the trespasser.  To learn how to prevent wildland fires, visit online at www.readyforwildfire.org.

In 2022, fire agencies also reported 6,536 natural vegetation fires which resulted in more than $3.2 million in loss. These fires can grow into large wildfires.  More than 1,500 wildfires were reported in Washington State, burning over 173,000 acres according to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center (NICC).  Last year the SFMO responded to 14 mobilization incidents in which the largest was the Vantage Highway Fire that burned 26,490 acres, and mobilization costs were estimated to be in the excess of $8 million for 2022.  Residents are urged to plan and practice wildfire safety by preparing your property now to reduce the chance of embers and flames igniting material on or near your home.  Homeowners can take the following actions to create a defensible space and protect their home:  Clear fallen leaves, pine needles, branches, and other debris from roof valleys and gutters. Remember to use extra caution when working on ladders whenever accessing your roof or gutters.  Remove any flammable materials on the ground around your home, deck, porch, or patio out to a minimum of 5 feet. This includes any mulch, dead leaves or pine needles, shrubs or other plants and materials for construction projects. Wood piles should be kept at a minimum of 30 feet from your home or other structures.  Make sure trees are limbed at least 10 feet up to reduce the likelihood of a fire getting into the tops of trees.  Plants that are within 30 feet of your home should be well-watered and spaced to avoid fire moving from plant to plant.  Grass and weeds should be mowed to a height no more than 2 to 3 inches.  Keep all vegetation, including grass hydrated.  Whenever possible, use fire-resistant materials for any home improvement projects.  Attic and garage vents should be screened with 1/8-inch metal mesh material, or a fire resistive vent design should be used, to prevent ember penetration during the windy conditions of a wildfire.  Prepare your community by working with your neighbors. Remember, ignition of one home within a neighborhood will threaten other homes so encourage all neighbors within wildfire risk areas to work together to reduce the community risk.  Create a Wildfire Action Plan to prepare your family for evacuation at a moment’s notice.  An evacuation plan should include alternate routes out of the area and prepacked essentials including medications, family records, credit cards, a change of clothing, and enough food and water for each household member for up to 72 hours.  Create a family communication plan that designates an out-of-area friend or relative as a point of contact to be a single source of communication among family members in case of separation.  Be aware of family, friends, or neighbors who have disabilities who require assistance and additional lead-time in order to prepare for a disaster.  Remember to prepare a plan for pets and other animals.  If there is a wildfire alert system available in your area, consider signing up to receive notifications.  When told to evacuate, go promptly and safely. If you feel unsafe at any time during a wildfire, do not wait for an evacuation order – leave immediately. Do not return home until directed by emergency personnel.

The non-injury blaze was reported just after 2 p.m. in the area of the Ramona Expressway and North Warren Road, according to the Riverside County Fire Department. It was 20% contained as of 7:50 p.m., the department said.  Multiple engine and hand crews were sent to the location and encountered flames burning along barren hillsides, propelled by southwesterly winds.  Several Cal Fire air tankers and water-dropping helicopters from nearby Hemet-Ryan Airport made runs on the brusher through the afternoon.  As the flames moved west, they approached a residential area abutted by dairy farms, leading fire personnel to implement mandatory evacuations in the neighborhood bounded by Cottonwood Avenue to the south, Upperline Avenue to the north, Beech Street to the west and Warren Road to the east.  At 5:45 p.m., flames were within 100 feet of houses on Upperline, and Cal Fire air tankers were summoned to drop retardant and strengthen defensive lines, according to reports from the scene.  An evacuation warning was issued to residents and agricultural operators within the area bounded by Cottonwood to the south, Esplanade Avenue to the north, Beech to the west and Warren to the east.  An evacuation center was opened at Tahquitz High School, located at 4425 Titan Trail in Hemet.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (CN) — After years of massive, destructive wildfires, California and much of the American West may see a shorter and more manageable wildfire season thanks to an extraordinarily wet winter.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the state has only just begun to see a historic snowpack melt into streams and rivers, and the flows could be high for many weeks. The agency's Southern California coordination center reported in a briefing Monday that most of California has seen below normal temperatures since Oct. 1. These conditions have helped about 68% of the state exit drought conditions within three months — a feat that would have required two or three wet years otherwise.  A map of California precipitation levels since October 2022. (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)  Julie Kalansky, climate scientist and program manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said that Northern California and central Sierra reservoirs have mostly reached or exceeded average water capacity levels. Southern Sierra reservoirs remain much below normal levels but are expected to approach historically high levels once all of the snow melts.  The wet winter and lingering snowpack may also translate to fewer wildfires. The Southern California coordination center reported that California typically experiences about 62 significant fires over more than 308,000 acres each year. But experts anticipate fewer than 100,000 acres will burn this year — a rare event.  Gina McGuire Palma of the agency's Great Basin coordination center said that coming out of extended drought years, soil moisture does improve as snow melts, subsequently priming grass growth. Once grasses begin to “cure” or dry out, expected to begin by sometime in July, is when the active season is really expected to kick off.  “We’re expecting quite a bit of fine fuel growth,” Palma said. “That will kind of delay our start to our real active fire season. We're definitely looking at a shorter (fire) season at least.”  Once monsoon season arrives during July, thunder and lightning activity could spark fires. This will coincide with normal fire risk for lower elevation areas, as grasses dry out. However, few mountain fires are expected thanks to the impressive, ongoing snowpack.  The state has invested $2.7 billion into reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires by managing forests and bolstering manpower. Governor Gavin Newsom said this month that California added 37 additional fire crews statewide in 2022, alongside more helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. California is the first state in the nation to fly night firefighting operations, completing the first-ever operation last year.  In August 2020, Newsom signed the Shared Stewardship Agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, mapping out a 20-year strategy to achieve wildfire resilience and forest health. This commitment included a goal of jointly improving 1 million acres of California’s forest and wildlands annually by 2025.  Cal Fire treated approximately 110,925 acres across more than 600 projects last year in preparation for the fire season, surpassing the state goal to treat 100,000 acres by 2025. During the current season, more than 420 fuels reduction projects have been completed, treating about 43,065 acres.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLXByZWRpY3RlZC10by1iZS1zaG9ydGVyLWFuZC1sZXNzLWludGVuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As those at the center of the extraordinary story told it to CBS News, Joe Hollins and his wife have been experiencing homelessness and happened to be camped out near an apartment which caught fire early on Thursday in Phoenix. Hollins became aware of the emergency when he heard screams coming from the apartment.  “All I see is a lady pull open the window, and she’s screaming, ‘Please help me, please help me,’” he recalled in an interview which CBS aired over the weekend.  Hollins immediately ran up to the window of the woman, Claudia Jimenez. According to Jimenez, the blaze was blocking the front way out of her apartment, and she was trapped inside with her two daughters and two dogs as flames and smoke spread throughout the place.  So Hollins told Jimenez to drop her children to him, according to what Jimenez said to CBS.  “He was like, ‘Yes, throw your daughters out. I’m going to catch them, I’m going to get them’,” Jimenez recounted to the network.  Jimenez first dropped her one-year-old, Valerie. She then did the same with her eight-year-old, Natalie, and the family’s two dogs. One by one, Hollins safely caught them.  Then, when it was time for her to leap out the window and away from danger, fear gripped Jimenez and she froze in place, she and Hollins recalled.  “She was scared she was going to fall,” Hollins told CBS. “I was like, ‘I got you, don’t worry’.”  Trusting Hollins with herself as she had done with her girls and her pets, Jimenez soon jumped and landed safely in his arms.  Local firefighters later arrived to extinguish the flames consuming the apartment. Jimenez and others in the apartment building lost virtually all of their possessions in the fire, the cause of which remains under investigation.  Nonetheless, community members have been trying to raise money and collect donations for Jimenez, her loved ones and other victims of the fire.  Jimenez, meanwhile, was just grateful that she and her family were able to walk away from the fire physically unharmed.  A teary-eyed Jimenez told CBS that she would “for ever be thankful” for Hollins’s intervention in her hour of need.  “He was my angel,” Jimenez said to CBS. “Because of him, we’re here. We’re alive and my daughters are safe.”  Hollins said that he only listened to an instinct everyone has in them when he stepped up for his neighbors.  “Anybody would,” Hollins said. “Those are children [who were with Jimenez].”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzIzL2FyaXpvbmEtdW5ob3VzZWQtbWFuLXNhdmVzLXdvbWFuLWZyb20tZmlyZdIBWmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzIzL2FyaXpvbmEtdW5ob3VzZWQtbWFuLXNhdmVzLXdvbWFuLWZyb20tZmlyZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But for multi-family complexes, such as apartments and condos, it's an even bigger undertaking.  To prepare local landlords and property owners, Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue hosted its annual Landlord Training Program on fire safety. This year, the agency partnered with Hillsboro and Clackamas Fire, teaching landlords and property owners what they need to know about fire safety. This training is one way to help streamline communication between the Red Cross, fire agencies and landlords.  “We’re more than 20 years strong on this program,"" said Piseth Pich, the public information officer for Hillsboro Fire and Rescue.

The training covered everything from fire inspections to fire behavior, ordinances, legislation and safety recommendations.  Linda Lavelle is a property owner in the area and said she's attended these sessions for several years. She says she knows firsthand how much damage a fire can do.  We had a fire in one of our complexes. The manager knew how to respond, which was to break the fire extinguisher box. He got into the apartment, but the people were standing around a fire.

Collaboration with property owners is crucial, she said.  ""We want to make sure the landlords are looped in. Especially in a multi-family fire, it’s usually affecting more than one resident or home. We want to get the correct information in terms of residency. We need contact information to verify who is who and who else might be affected, such as if someone's of town,"" Mora said.

"fire","2023-05-20","18:00:00","{""LePallet"", ""PaysDeLaLoire"", ""France""}","2023-05-21T22:16:26","The Good Moves  Generally speaking, Fire Spin is the gold-standard for Fire Type Fast Moves. It’s the move of choice for many of the top Fire Type attackers, and it definitely deserves the title given its solid stats. However, it's not the top Fire Type Fast Move, as Fire Fang tends to out-pace Fire Spin most of the time. Despite having a lower base power and lower energy generated per use, Fire Fang’s speed allows it to have a higher DPS and an energy generation that’s just slightly below Fire Spin, so Pokemon with access to both will tend to stick with Fire Fang. Moving on, we come to a doozy of an attack; Incinerate. This Fast Move has the highest base power of any Fast Move in the game, to the point where it’s actually stronger than a few Charged Moves. It’s also got very high energy generation per use, ranked 2nd in the game alongside Gust, Ice Fang, Present, and Splash, and surpassed only by Volt Switch. So how could this monster of a move possibly fall below Fire Spin and Fire Fang? It can because it holds one other record currently; the slowest Fast Move in the game. Executing a single Incinerate takes 2.3 seconds, which is more than double the execution time of Fire Spin, so it actually tends to fall behind a bit in terms of actual performance. Oh, and forget dodging when you’re locked into a Fast Move that lasts an eternity to fully execute. Incinerate is best utilized by bulky attackers like Ho-oh that can tank hits and keep firing back, and even then it’s best classified as “usable” as it is substantially weaker than the big-two, but it’s still enough to make some Fire Type attackers acceptable. Honestly, it BARELY gets a pass here, and primarily because it’s one of the moves that finally made Ho-oh decent.  For Charged Moves, we have to start with V-Create, the signature move of Victini and the strongest Fire Type Charged Move in the entire game to date. This attack mixes power and flexibility, making it the move that any Fire Type would want, but its extremely limited distribution means we probably won't see it take the top ranks any time soon, or rather at all. Next up is Fusion Flare, which is the move that really put Reshiram back on the map. Again, this is a move with pretty limited distribution, so it's unlikely to spread far beyond what we have now, but it's still objectively great. Following that is Blast Burn, the signature move of all Fire Type starters. It's another genuinely powerful move and is strong enough to make many starters viable despite lower stats. After Blast Burn is Sacred Fire+, which is a great move for anyone lucky enough to have a good Apex Shadow Ho-oh. Next up is Weather Ball Fire, which is a strong and versatile move.... that basically no Fire Types actually learn. And then we come to Overheat, which is the gold-standard of the type. It's the strongest Fire Type Charged Move with general distribution, making it the move of choice for a great many Pokemon. After that are Blaze Kick and Mystical Fire, which are great moves... but they have to directly compete with Blast Burn on the only two Pokemon that can currently learn them, so they're not going to see much utility in practice. We follow that up with the other move that finally brought Ho-oh out of the abyss, the basic version of Sacred Fire. Despite being weaker than the + variant, it's still a solid move that.. is actually pretty close to Flamethrower in practice. And speaking of, we finish up this side of the list with Flamethrower, which is the borderline move of the type. Flamethrower is the Fire Type equivalent to moves like Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, and is just good enough to keep Pokemon like Heatran from falling into total obscurity. It's not a good move, but it's serviceable.  The Bad Moves  When it comes to the bad Fast Moves, we come at last to Ember. And… It's pretty unremarkable. Its overall attack profile is pretty unappealing, and it just doesn’t have many saving graces. Honestly, an argument can be made that it’s better than Incinerate due to the fact that it only has a slightly lower DPS, but at least it’s possible to dodge with it. But Ember didn’t help to save Ho-oh from obscurity, now did it? And just when you thought that we'd hit the bottom of the barrel, Hidden Power (Fire) is here again. And as usual, it's really underwhelming. You roll the dice for this move, and if you happen to get it on a Pokemon that may actually want it, it generally won't be enough to push said Pokemon into viability.  The Charged move list starts with Fire Blast. Despite being iconic in the main series, this move got a bad treatment in Pokemon Go, and is one of the moves that Pokemon genuinely don't want to see in their moveset. From here, we have Fire Punch, Flame Burst, Heat Wave, Flame Wheel, and Flame Charge, all of which are disappointing moves for any Fire Type. ""But wait!"", I see some of the more eagle-eyed readers already getting ready to type. ""You've missed a couple of Charged Moves on the list!"". Well, these moves weren't missed so much as reserved a special place in this section just for them! First is Techno Blast (Burn), which is a great move that gets relegated down here due to the lack of Pokemon that ever have a chance of utilizing it. And second is Sacred Fire++, strictly because no Ho-oh should ever, ever have this move! Seriously; do not purify your Apex Shadows! In no way is having ""++"" on the move able to compete with the sheer power Shadow Boost combined with a single ""+""!.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXByZXNzLmdnL3Bva2Vtb25nby90eXBpbmctcmV2aWV3LW92ZXJ2aWV3LWZpcmUtdHlwZXMtcmFpZHMtcG9rZW1vbi1nb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Freetown Fire Chief Harrie Ashley said the building was over 200 years old and did not have power.  “There’s no power to it, so we’re kind of suspicious of what happened here at this point,” Ashley said.

(CBS 58) -- Twenty-four hours after a massive structure fire in Washington County Sunday, May 21, fire crews remained on the scene throughout the day Monday, putting out hot spots.  The fire broke out just after 7 p.m. Sunday night in the Town of Polk at the Oak Creek Wood Products manufacturing company, just off of I-41.  Fire officials said the fire started on a pile of mulch, spread to a bed of wood pallets, eventually reaching two storage buildings and a nearby grassy area.  Fire officials said the wood content inside the building accelerated the flames.  ""It’s a very fast-moving, very high fuel content fire, which spread very, very fast,"" said Brad Schaefer, assistant fire chief, Slinger Fire Department.  The fire called for more than 40 fire departments from six different counties. Most of the firefighters on scene were volunteers.  No fire hydrant was near the manufacturing company. Millions of gallons of water were shuttled in from neighboring towns throughout the day.  ""It's something we address, we practice for, we train for every day, so it doesn’t hinder our operation, it just makes it a little more challenging,"" said Schaefer.  The fire chief went on to say, while the flames have died down, smoke might still be seen across the area for the next couple of weeks.  ""There will be hot spots they'll be dealing with for quite some time,"" said Chief Schaefer.  Fire officials said no one was in the building at the time of the fire and no one was hurt.

(WKBN) — A local volunteer fire department is asking drivers to be more cautious around fire trucks after an accident cost the department thousands of dollars — and could have cost a driver their life.  A few months ago, Hempfield Township Volunteer Fire Department training officer John Kirchner was headed to a brush fire when a driver crossed the center line on a narrow road, coming at Kirchner head-on.  “I literally had a second to make a decision,” Kirchner said.  And that decision saved a driver’s life.  “Even if we were both doing 35, that’s a closing speed of 70 miles an hour,” Kirchner said. “Somebody would have been seriously hurt, or possibly killed or both of us.”  Courtesy: Hempfield fire department  Courtesy: Hempfield Twp. fire department  Instead, he swung into a ditch, saving their lives — but creating $95,000 in damage to their only engine, which they don’t expect to get back for months.  Even with insurance — the cost wasn’t easy for a volunteer department without a fire tax.  “With a small volunteer department like this that we rely on, majority of our funding is through donations. It is getting very, very hard to keep doing business, keeping trucks on the road,” Kirchner said.  “We know how much we get from our fund drives, our membership drives, stuff like that, our fundraising, and we set our budget,” Chief Dave King said. “This was not in the budget. Trust me.”  The Hempfield department was able to buy an engine from Slippery Rock for about $25,000. It was still without an engine for about a month, putting strain on the department, which serves around 4,000 people in mostly rural areas with little access to hydrants.  “You hope you can make the initial hit and get it knocked down while you’re waiting on other resources to get there,” King said. “We’re shy a thousand gallons of water. We’re shy our attack lines.”  During that time, King said the accident has also put strain on the many departments in northern Mercer County they serve mutual aid for.  Both firefighters said they’re just glad no one was hurt in the incident, but they have a message for drivers: Pay attention on the road.  “We may be going to your family member if your loved one needs help,” King said. “Give us a little bit of room.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtc3RpbGwtcmVjb3ZlcmluZy1hZnRlci1jcmFzaC10YWtlcy1vdXQtb25seS1lbmdpbmUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tibi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2ZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1zdGlsbC1yZWNvdmVyaW5nLWFmdGVyLWNyYXNoLXRha2VzLW91dC1vbmx5LWVuZ2luZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Page by page, the Conway Fire Department turned up the heat.  “The best-looking guy goes on the cover,” Conway firefighter, Justin Adlong said.  Their funding efforts are becoming a challenge after struggling with other methods like Fill the Boot, which is a way for the fire department to give back to the Faulkner and Perry County communities.  “Everything’s cashless nowadays and so we will stand outside at like the Conway Commons or target all that area and you will see us holding a boot just asking for money and every year that number is going down,” Conway firefighter, Blake Brents said.  The Conway Fire Department uses the money from the fundraiser to support around 650 kids in both counties with toys, clothes, and food for Christmas.  This year, as a way to help increase funds they decided to create a calendar, the last one was made about 20 years ago.  “At first everybody was like, I don’t know if I want to be in it, so we had a couple of guys back out but if we keep this going I think people will realize it’s a good thing,” Brents stated.  Firemen Blake Brents and Justin Adlong talked about the community response and how it has been well received through town.  “It’s been a big hit so far,” Brents stated. “I think we have raised 7-8 thousand dollars so that’s a big help,” Adlong said.  As the flames grow higher, and the room gets hotter, they hope this calendar will be something that will help elevate some of the financial stress around the holidays.  “If we start now, we will be able to fund this year’s Christmas without having to rely on that money out there collecting the boot as much,” Brents said.  All proceeds go towards Fill the Boot, and they will still be doing that on top of calendar sales.  If you would like to purchase one of the $25 calendars you can visit this link or you can go to the Central Fire Station in Conway to pick one up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jb253YXktZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhlYXRpbmctdXAtdGhlLXdheS10aGV5LWZ1bmRyYWlzZS1mb3ItdGhlLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ib290LWRyaXZlL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jb253YXktZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhlYXRpbmctdXAtdGhlLXdheS10aGV5LWZ1bmRyYWlzZS1mb3ItdGhlLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ib290LWRyaXZlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire started around 3 p.m. outside an apartment in the building on Sheffield Avenue.  Residents ran outside in shock but said what shocked them even more was when they watched back the footage from their Blink camera.  ""Like, I really wouldn't wish this on anybody, not even my worst enemy and I don't even have any,"" said resident Katiana Ciceron after her Blink camera captured the incident.  In the video, a man is seen walking up to her family's apartment door, dousing it with liquid and setting it on fire.  ""It was shocking because I've never seen somebody with that kind of intention,"" Ciceron said. She was not home at the time, but her mother was.  A neighbor alerted Ciceron's mother about the flames.  No one was hurt, but the damage was already done.  ""Soot and blackness throughout the third floor. The whole entire third floor is damaged,"" said Arthur Warren, president of the Resident Association for the Long Island Baptist Houses. He said the fire just reveals long standing issues that management has ignored.  ""Basically, people coming in and wandering in the building all times of night,"" Warren specified.

""Him again at 4:04 a.m. Same outfit,"" she said while pointing out to a Blink video on her cellphone.  Council Member Charles Barron visited the building. He said funds have already been allocated to fix doors in NYCHA complexes across the city, but it is not that simple.  ""NYCHA, that whole management thing with NYCHA and getting things done in a timely fashion, is always a challenge,"" Barron said.  News 12 reached out to NYCHA to see how it will move forward when it comes to security inside the building. NYCHA referred News 12 to the fire department.

(WMTV) - The Madison Fire Department is reminding residents how to properly discard cigarettes after two smoking-related fires last Thursday.  Madison Fire officials responded to two separate fires Thursday, both of which were caused by improper disposal of cigarettes.  Shortly after 3:30 p.m., firefighters were dispatched to 4322 Melody Lane after a report of a smoke-filled home and a burning ashtray. According to MFD, the tenant was smoking on her balcony before she discarded the cigarette in a plastic container she used as an ashtray.  The tenant left for nearly two hours, and upon her return, noticed charring on the outside of the building. She put out the fire before crews arrived but was temporarily displaced from her home due to the damage.  At around 11 p.m., firefighters were dispatched to 9321 Glencoe Drive for an apartment deck fire. Officials determined the fire started in a plastic planter full of old cigarette butts. The fire did not spread past the planter box, according to the fire department.  MFD is emphasizing how smoking-related fires can spread quickly if cigarettes ignite building siding and other flammable materials, especially if there are no automatic fire sprinklers in the area. Fire officials are encouraging residents to keep the following tips in mind:  Dispose of cigarettes in a non-flammable container, such as an ashtray or metal coffee canister.  Put cigarettes out completely by pouring water on the ashes and butts.  Empty ashtrays frequently to avoid butts piling up and catching on fire.

Example video title will go here for this video  PORTLAND, Ore. — Many people are still without a home after a fire destroyed the May Apartments on Southwest 14th and Taylor Street Tuesday morning. Fire crews are now using new technology to try and figure out the cause — by using a drone.  Jeff Pricher, the Scappoose Fire Cheif, says more agencies are working to get their Federal Aviation Administration commercial drone license and he’s helping them along the way with a two-week program.  ""We are taking our students from an entry-level and teaching them to be professional pilots,"" said Pricher.  Pricher is leading a two-week aviation course at Powell Butte Nature Park. Teaching state government and land management agencies alongside law enforcement and fire officials how to fly drones and obtain their FAA commercial drone license and more.  ""[It] teaches them aeronautical decision-making, crew resource management, and safety management systems which are the pillars of a successful aviation program,"" said Pricher.  Scappoose Fire has been flying drones since 2015. Since then, it has created its aviation program — a first of its kind in Columbia County.  After the two-week program, some students will go through additional training to obtain an additional certification that will allow them to fly up to 1,200 feet across the entire state of Oregon compared to the 400 feet FAA limit.  ""Our goal is to build a trust climate with the crew aviation community as well as the public so they don't think we're out here playing with toys,"" said Pricher.  This past week, Pricher assisted Portland Fire with a drone to map out a 2D and 3D picture of the scene to help investigators pinpoint where the May Apartments fire started.  ""And then, we're going to do some very specific photos to help enhance one of the areas of interest that the fire investigators have,” said Pricher.  Scappoose Fire nor Portland Fire were able to share the 3D picture obtained of the May Apartments on Friday due to the ongoing investigation.

A person answering a phone at a business listing for Patel said the owner was unavailable and declined to comment further.  Kittery issued violation notices for code problems at the hotel several years ago, O’Brien said. He said every issue that was found was corrected.  The hotel did have fire alarms but did not have any sprinklers. The cause and origin of the fire remain under investigation.  Kittery Fire Chief David O'Brien, who had said he was extremely hesitant to send his firefighters into the building, sat down with NBC affiliate News Center Maine on Friday to talk about how challenging it was for crews.  ""They did everything they possibly could; everything. Bar none, they did everything,"" O'Brien told News Center Maine. ""And we sent two people into a building we shouldn’t have, but we got them out instantly. They knew the decision-making process.""  One of those firefighters was Phil Posa, who recalled feeling the intense heat as they entered a corridor in the building and having to make a difficult choice to pull out.  ""You could tell that nobody was gonna be able to have survived in that area,"" Posa told News Center Maine. ""The conditions were just very poor.""  O'Brien estimates that nearly 2,000,000 gallons of water were dumped onto the two-story hotel, News Center Maine reported. He said he hopes Wednesday's fire will be the largest that his young firefighters ever have to face.  The chief also noted that it was the first fatal fire that some of his crews were dealing with, noting there would be help for them.

News4's Mauricio Casillas reports.  No one inside the buildings was hurt, but a firefighter did suffer injuries that were not life-threatening.  “I feel very bad, you know, because it was hard for me to buy this property and now when I see the way it is right now inside, I don’t want to go inside,” said Jose Diaz, who owns the building.  Karen Serpas, a worker inside the Mariachi Restaurant and Bar, recorded video of the flames.  “It was full of smoke, and we all ran out,” she said.  Raul Lopez, who owns the restaurant, said he has about 15 employees who are now temporarily out of work.  Ambzam Misgina, a business owner who is about to open a restaurant a few doors down, said he was shocked when he heard the news but was thankful it wasn’t worse.  “Wow, I was so nervous. I thought the entire building was on fire, but thank God it’s saved and the fire department is close by, so it was good luck for us,” Misgina said.

Karen Abbott, who lives next to where the fire started, said she’s noticed people starting fires behind the vacant church a few times and has had to call the fire department before.

Advertising Read more  More than 80 fire trucks were sent to the decades-old landmark after the blaze broke out late Sunday, the Bureau of Fire Protection said.  Thick, black smoke billowed hundreds of metres into the sky as flames gutted the neo-classical Manila Central Post Office that overlooks the Pasig River.

Yesterday, police said the toll was fewer than 10, with five bodies recovered so far from the damaged building in Wellington.  Loafers Lodge on May 20, 2023. [Photo: WSWS]  An unnamed man is in custody after appearing in court on Friday charged with arson. Police say more severe charges could be added. Many questions remain about how the fire was started and how it spread.  What is clear is that the hostel, which housed nearly 100 people in 92 rooms on four storeys, was a death trap. It had no sprinkler system, which firefighters say would have saved lives, and only one functional exit. Fire alarms were reportedly faulty, with some residents saying that they only went off in part of the building, and others saying there were so many false alarms that residents had learned to ignore them.  When the fire broke out just before 12:30 a.m. on May 16 on one of the upper levels, it spread rapidly, making it impossible for many residents to reach the stairwell to escape.  On Saturday, the World Socialist Web Site spoke with Simon Hanify, who had lived in a small room on the first floor of Loafers Lodge for about four months. He said the front door had been “sealed shut for about a month; someone kicked it in.” A notice said: “Door broken, use side entrance.”  Simon Hanify outside Loafers Lodge in Wellington, May 20, 2023. [Photo: WSWS]  During the fire, some people who could not reach the stairwell to the side entrance were forced to jump onto the roof of an adjacent building. Others were rescued from the Loafers Lodge rooftop by a fire truck ladder.  Describing the night of the fire, Hanify said an initial alarm had gone off at 10:30 p.m. Police say someone had set fire to a couch, which was then extinguished. When Hanify heard the second fire alarm two hours later, he checked and realised there was smoke in the building. Then, he said, “I went around, smashing on all the doors saying: ‘Get out, this one’s real.’ I’ve talked to other people [who say] the alarm didn’t go off on other floors.”  On the third floor, one resident said “he opened his door and he just hit the floor. There was a black wall of acrid smoke, real nasty, poisonous smoke. He crawled to the stairwell.”  Hanify said if someone had not lived in the building long and didn’t know their way around, it would have been very difficult to escape. Several residents “are mentally ill or medicated, or infirm, or old, and they wouldn’t have stood a chance.” He hoped that those killed had “died of smoke inhalation in their sleep without knowing about it” instead of being trapped and knowing they could not escape.  Most of the people made homeless by the fire have been moved to temporary accommodation, and Hanify has been allocated a public housing unit. He praised the Downtown Community Ministry, which has been helping him.  Many have lost everything they owned in the fire, Hanify explained. “I did hear from someone that most things on the first floor should be okay, and they’re secure,” but items cannot be retrieved “until they’ve got rid of all that asbestos and the water that carried it all through the building.”  The building’s residents included meat workers, hospital workers, retired people, people with disabilities, and a number of people recently deported from Australia.  Hanify, who had been homeless before getting a room at Loafers Lodge, said: “I’ve lived in a few [similar places]. We call it the last resort. It’s where you go when you’ve got nowhere else and the only alternative is a tree or the concrete.  “I was really grateful when I first got in there, because sleeping under a tree in the mud is not that comfortable. I was grateful at first and then the bedbugs started eating the f..k out of me. I have all these scars. There was an infestation of bedbugs.” The property managers had heat-treated his room twice to try and kill the bugs, but they kept coming back.  In addition, Hanify had been concerned about the leaking asbestos roof. “I’m a roofer by trade,” he explained. “They’ve had exposed asbestos with seven panels cut out because there’s a leak from the roof. The water was dripping down into the rooms and they even allowed new tenants in without fixing the roof leak.” He said he believed there should have been “a total re-roof.”  Hanify had observed people doing repair work on the roof leak without protective clothing or masks. “It makes me sick. I don’t want to point fingers but I’m disgusted,” he said.  Because of contamination from asbestos-laden smoke, businesses next to Loafers Lodge remain closed to the public.  Hanify was charged $280 a week for the room, including power. Others were reportedly charged as much as $320. “Do the maths for 92 rooms—and they can’t even put a sprinkler system in or replace the roof,” he said.  Building professionals have raised concerns about the fact that Loafers Lodge was able to pass a building warrant of fitness inspection, carried out earlier this year for the Wellington City Council.  An anonymous building inspector told Newshub on May 17 that if a building fails an inspection, the owner can “easily” find another inspector “that is a bit more lax or… not as skilled and get it passed, because the system allows for that. Something needs to be done about this [because] it’s absolutely criminal.” Without changes, he predicted that there would be more tragedies.  According to the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ), some countries require sprinklers in buildings four storeys and above, whereas in New Zealand they are required only for buildings more than 10 storeys high.  Labour Party Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he had asked the Housing Minister to “look particularly at issues of building regulation to see if there’s anything we should be doing at this point.”  This morning, however, Radio NZ reported that laws to strengthen fire protections for high-density infill housing—including townhouses and terraced housing—had been “stymied” just days before the Loafers Lodge fire. On May 4, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment withdrew proposals to raise fire resistance ratings for walls and protections to limit the risk of fire spreading, because of disagreement from some figures in the building industry. Cost was reportedly a factor in the decision not to proceed with the changes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZWNrei1tMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Wednesday, all four fire chiefs of the county imposed a total fire ban that Algonquin Highlands Fire Chief Mike French says is part of an effort to protect local resources and the environment. The ban will be in effect until Wednesday at least.  ""It was a really hard decision, and that's why we wait until last minute, but we had to do it for the protection of our force and our community.""  Starting last weekend and into Monday, French says local firefighters responded to at least 15 fire calls — many more than what's he says is usual.  Fines of hundreds of dollars  One particular fire on Monday took over seven hours and dozens of firefighters to contain — something that severely restricted their ability to respond to other calls. Luckily, no injuries were reported.  ""It is taxing on our community because if there would have been another medical fire call that came in anywhere within the county during that time period, the fire departments weren't in a position to respond to anything,"" said French.  The ban, which encompasses the Municipality of Dysart et al, Township of Minden Hills, Township of Algonquin Highlands and the Township of Highlands East, means all open fires, campfires, fireworks and lighting charcoal barbecues are prohibited.  While the news might be a disappointment to visitors looking to spend the weekend in nature, French says it's important they heed the warning.  Those who choose to light fires despite the ban could be charged hundreds of dollars for each vehicle that's sent to respond to an intentional fire call, he says.  Authorities hope cottagers heed warning  All of the approximately 200 firefighters in the county are volunteers. Right now, several of them are deployed to assist in containing the Alberta wildfires, French says. Given the volume of calls coming in and the number of people available to answer them, he says there's no choice but to impose a ban.  At one point, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry came in to help, French says.  Fire bans are usually only imposed once a year near the end of summer, French says, to protect the county during extreme fire conditions.  But because of the ""fluke"" dry conditions, high heat and lack of rain over the past two weeks, the chiefs had to act, he says.  Minden Hills Coun. Pam Sayne had a fire scare of her own this week.  Firefighters were called to battle a blaze near Black Lake in Minden Hills on Monday. The fire scorched parts of councillor Pam Sayne's cottage property. (Submitted by Pam Sayne)  Sayne says she spotted the smoke on her cottage through her security cameras while she was away. While nearby cottagers called for help, she says it was still a close call — her property and several others could have burned down Monday.  ""They were very lucky it stayed close to the ground,"" said Sayne.  Sayne says around this time of year, the county starts to swell with seasonal cottagers and visitors. As a cottage country destination, they know to expect the influx in people, and try to raise awareness on fire safety through signs and on social media.  ""A lot of people don't understand how fire works in rural areas. It can be quite frightening, so it's good just to pay attention,"" she said. ""Rules are there for a reason.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS90b3JvbnRvL2hhbGlidXJ0b24tY291bnR5LWZpcmUtYmFuLTEuNjg0Njg5MdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42ODQ2ODkx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Read more                KINSHASA, May 20 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo security forces fired tear gas and fought running battles in the streets of the capital Kinshasa with anti-government protesters demonstrating on Saturday over alleged irregularities in voter registration.  The protesters are also angry over the rising cost of living and prolonged insecurity in the east of the country, where armed militias and rebel groups have killed hundreds and displaced over a million.  Around a dozen protesters were detained by security forces just after the start of the demonstration, which was called for by opposition leaders.  A video shared on social media showed a shirtless youth being kicked, repeatedly bashed with a helmet, and dragged along the ground by several men in uniform. Reuters could not authenticate the video.  Police spokesman Sylvano Kasongo told Reuters that three policemen had been detained for violence against a minor during the demonstration. He added that 27 police officers were injured during the clashes.  Congo's human rights minister Albert-Fabrice Puela, in a statement on Saturday, condemned the violence by security forces against demonstrators and the minor, and called for an investigation.  Congo is due to hold a general election on Dec. 20 when President Felix Tshisekedi is expected to seek a second term.  But political tension is on the rise in the world's leading cobalt producer, with some opposition candidates complaining of delays and alleged irregularities in a voter registration drive.  Four opposition leaders including Martin Fayulu, who came second in the 2018 presidential election, and Moise Katumbi, a millionaire businessman and former regional governor who is expected to run in 2023, called for the protest on Saturday.  ""It's sad, you see, they are firing tear gas. Just before, it was real ammunition,"" Katumbi told journalists near the protest venue.  Fayulu said by telephone that his vehicle was surrounded by security forces who continued to fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators.  ""The electoral register is not reliable and we'll not compromise on this issue,"" Fayulu added.  Congo's electoral commission is expected to publish voter registration data on Sunday.

Said Murekezi, 42, is charged with second-degree arson, second-degree burglary of a religious building and fifth-degree drug possession in the fire Wednesday at the Oromo American Tawhid Islamic Center in St. Paul.  The center was last used as a mosque in 2021 and was currently being used as office space.  The arson was one of at least six acts of vandalism or arson against mosques in Minnesota this year and prompted Muslim and government officials to call for the state's residents to stand in unity with Muslims.  A probable cause statement said Murezeki was released from jail 36 hours before the fire. Court records show he has several past convictions, including one for arson at the Dorothy Day Center in St. Paul in 2020. He has also undergone several mental health evaluations.  Investigators said Murekezi was on probation for first-degree criminal damage to property and had previously broken windows at a Catholic church in Minneapolis this year and an Islamic community center in Minnetonka in 2021.  The probable cause statement said Murekezi, who had no listed home address, admitted that he broke into the mosque the day before the fire and slept there overnight.  He said he was upset that Muslims and Americans who are homeless were not being helped by the building or the government. He also told investigators that if he had not been caught he would have burned another mosque or church, according to the statement.  Court documents don't list a current attorney for this case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hL3N1c3BlY3QtaW4tbWlubmVzb3RhLW1vc3F1ZS1maXJlLWFkbWl0cy1zZXR0aW5nLWl0LXRvLXByb3Rlc3QtaG9tZWxlc3NuZXNzLWFmZmlkYXZpdC1zYXlzLS83MTAyMTAxLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3N1c3BlY3QtaW4tbWlubmVzb3RhLW1vc3F1ZS1maXJlLWFkbWl0cy1zZXR0aW5nLWl0LXRvLXByb3Rlc3QtaG9tZWxlc3NuZXNzLWFmZmlkYXZpdC1zYXlzLS83MTAyMTAxLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  WASHINGTON D.C., DC — A condo building in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of D.C. has been deemed uninhabitable after a Friday night fire destroyed the roof deck, according to DC Fire and EMS.  The blaze started at 8:30 p.m. in the five-story apartment building located on Adams Mill Road. Twenty five units and 100 fire personnel were on scene.  ""It was confined to the roof deck, so that was fortunate. Everyone in the bottom floors could safely evacuate,"" said D.C. Fire and EMS Public Information Officer Vito Maggiolo.  Maggiolo says the structure of the building was not damaged, but fire investigators determined it was unsafe for around 40 residents that live in the building to return.  Saturday evening, residents were seen carrying out their belongings as repair crews assessed the damage.  ""We saved this building twice,"" said Maggiolo to WUSA9 referring to the Oct. 1 2007 four-alarm fire that started near the top floor of the same building.  WUSA9 reporting from the incident indicates that the blaze started at around 1:00 a.m. and quickly spread. A lack of water pressure complicated efforts for fire crews attempting to extinguish the flames.  In both fires, no residents were injured.

What You Need To Know The Grafton Fire Department invited the community in for an open house Saturday    They hope the event leads to more recruits    Grafton is a call fire department, meaning you aren't required to respond to every call if you're at work or out of town    More information on applying can be found on the town's website  Lieutenant Eric John is in charge of recruiting for the department, and hopes its first ever open house leads to some new hires down the road.  ""It's definitely been more difficult than it was in the past, I think the more advanced training we're requiring is making it tougher for a lot of people to put the time and energy into it,"" John said. ""We've probably only started recruiting less than a year ago now, we've had some success with a few members and hopefully with the open house we'll see a few more.""  While the department is never short-staffed to the point where it can't respond to an emergency, like many local departments, it would be nice to have some extra hands around.  Grafton works as a call fire department, meaning you don't have to respond to every call, just the ones you can get to.  “If you’re at home having dinner with your family, you get up and go to the call, but if you’re out of town or at work you don’t have to respond to the call,"" John said. ""It’s kind of whenever you can respond you respond, there’s no commitment you have to make every call.”  And despite the more rigorous training involved in becoming a firefighter nowadays, there's still new recruits coming in. Andrea Sivakova signed on in January.  “I’ve been an EMT for about five years and I love helping people, I live very close to the station here so I was like ‘Why not become a firefighter?"" Sivakova said. ""I always wanted to be one.”  Sivakova is preparing to take the four month fire academy course, but she also sees the benefits of events like Saturday's open house being part of the job.  “It’s great to see little kids come around, have fun, look at the firetrucks,"" Sivakova said. ""Show them all around inside, explain what each truck does and what they go through.”  For more information on becoming a Grafton firefighter or to fill out an application, visit the town's website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vbWEvd29yY2VzdGVyL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9ncmFmdG9uLWZpcmUtaG9sZHMtY29tbXVuaXR5LW9wZW4taG91c2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Even through rainy weather, the Middle Creek Volunteer Fire Department hosted “Ride 4 Rescue” to raise money for rescue operations.  Participants young and old strolled through the trails.  “We’ve had people from all over the different states coming out and supporting with donations. We greatly appreciate the community,” volunteer Patricia Bentley said.  In an area that has dealt with flooding, water rescue equipment has become a crucial part of emergency response.  “The water rescue is gonna be one of our main focuses with this,” volunteer Joshua Ratliff said.  “We have low line creek areas on route 114. I’d say every spring and fall, the department is out helping people,” Patricia Bentley added.  Whether it is fire or flooding, volunteer fire departments are often the first ones to receive a call to respond.  So, access to more equipment is important.  “Normally if there’s a medical cause. If there’s someone in a car accident. Any 911 emergency. Normally we’re gonna be notified first to be there,” Joshua Ratliff said.

(WTOC)- Two fires in Bluffton on Friday left several people displaced, in what the Bluffton Fire Department says is an unusual number of devastating fires for them to see in just one day.  Stephen Combs, the public information officer with the Bluffton Township Fire District, says, ”[Friday] was really quite an unusual day for the Bluffton Township Fire District. We don’t typically see a lot of fires in our area.”  On this particular day, Bluffton firefighters found themselves responding to two fires. The first was in the Woodbridge subdivision in Bluffton, and started around 9:00 in the morning. Flames were visible from the kitchen and attic when crews from multiple stations arrived.  Steven McNulty, who saw the fire, says, ”They were like a well-oiled machine here. There were probably about six or seven firetrucks. Everybody knew their role. They were on it. It was just pretty impressive to watch.”  The people that lived in the home, as well as their pets, were able to get out safely. The victim of the second fire, however, did not.  Not twelve hours after the first fire, Combs says crews were dispatched to a medical emergency, but when they arrived, they found a home visibly on fire. Multiple stations were sent to Cherry Point Road, including some that had responded to the Woodbridge fire earlier in the day.  One man inside the home was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, after calling out for help while still inside the home.  Combs says, ”These types of situations are very taxing mentally. It’s not just a single incident, but a lot of times it’s that compounding effect where you have multiple incidents back-to-back. And we have resources in place for our firefighters to discuss those stressors that they might experience on a daily basis.”  Fire investigators believe that both fires were caused by unattended cooking.  Combs says these situations are a good reminder of the importance of keeping safe while cooking.  “The majority of house fires that we see that start in the kitchen are a result of unattended cooking on the stove, so we just want to encourage people that if you have to leave the kitchen, please turn the stove off so you don’t leave things that could catch fire.”  Combs also adds that people should be sure to check their smoke alarms, keep a fire extinguisher in your kitchen- and under no circumstances should you throw water on a grease fire, because it only makes it spread.

But a partial collapse of the 1912 building and other risks are still being evaluated by Portland firefighters ahead of this weekend’s Portland Timbers and Thorns matches, leading to multiple street closures three blocks southeast of Providence Park.  As of Saturday morning, roads around the burned apartment building are still closed. This includes Southwest 14th Avenue from Salmon to Yamhill streets, and Southwest Taylor Street from 13th to 15th avenues.  The Timbers face Minnesota United at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, and the Thorns host the Chicago Red Stars at 2 p.m. Sunday. Barring additional guidance from Portland Fire & Rescue, the aforementioned roads are expected to be closed through the weekend with no through traffic or parking allowed, so plan your trip to both matches accordingly.  There should be no additional impact to the parking or traffic situation around Providence Park, a PTFC spokesperson said.

The change, the city says, is expected to save money and shorten response time for emergencies.    The project is fully funded by federal American Rescue Act Plan dollars.

It was a wild night in the Windy City as two red cards were shown, one for each side, and six goals were scored in a match that went back-and-forth. Andrew Gutman, wearing the captain's armband for the first time, and halftime sub Giorgos Giakoumakis were the goal scorers for Atlanta United as the visitors played Chicago Fire to a 3-3 draw to secure a result on the road.  The Fire went down to 10 men in the 26th minute with the match scoreless, and Atlanta United immediately took advantage. The sequence started when pressure from Atlanta United forced a giveaway that was recovered by Miguel Berry. On the dribble, the striker was clipped from behind, resulting in Chicago midfielder Federico Navarro's second yellow card of the night. Navarro was shown a red card then exited the match, leaving Chicago with 10 men on the field. Atlanta United was awarded a direct free kick right near the edge of the 18-yard box, taken by Thiago Almada. His low, driven shot was initially blocked by Chicago goalkeeper Chris Brady but Gutman cleaned up the rebound to put the visitors on the board 1-0 in the 29th minute.  “Right place, right time,"" Gutman said. ""I kind of had a feeling that Thiago might go back post. And whenever you go back post, the only thing the keeper can do with the way he hits it is kind of push it, so I just tried to position myself there and it fell right to me and I just had to tap it in.”  Chicago answered on a corner kick in the 42nd minute. Xherdan Shaqiri at the right corner flag curled the ball near post with his left foot. Atlanta United goalkeeper Quentin Westberg got his hands on the ball, but the block ricocheted off the back of his center back Juanjo Purata, who was in the area trying to make a clearance with his head. The bounce trickled over the goal line for an Atlanta own goal that equalized the match 1-1.  Chicago Fire, with just 10 men on the field, scored their second goal in the 49th minute. Chicago striker Kacper Przybyłko posted up inside the box, positioned with his back to goal. He brought down a pass with his chest that midfielder Maren Haile-Selassie could run onto. Haile-Selassie's one-touch strike was driven low and evaded Westberg's diving attempt. The home team took their first lead of the night.  ""It came from a throw-in and we’re not ready for that throw-in. And then it’s so easy. It’s so simple. A throw-in, a long switch, received with the chest inside the box, no pressure at all and then no closing down the opponent, no blocking shots which is something that we message very often. So, frustrated with that one,"" Atlanta United head coach Gonzalo Pineda said.  Atlanta United answered right back with a goal in the 55th minute to make it a 2-2 match. Winger Derrick Etienne Jr. pivoted to move the ball from one side to the other, feeding it to to Ronald Hernández on the right. The fullback, who made his second consecutive start Saturday, crossed the ball long all the way to the far post. Gutman was there to head it down to Giorgos Giakoumakis, who had entered the match at halftime as a substitute for Berry. The striker knocked it home for his seventh goal in 10 MLS appearances.  Then, Giakoumakis broke the 2-2 deadlock for his brace on the night. Almada, who was played quickly from Gutman, fed the striker a through ball. Giakoumakis cut to avoid Brady coming off his line and scored with his left foot. The flag came up, so the striker was initially ruled offside on the play. However, VAR overturned the initial call and the goal was allowed, which gave Atlanta United the go-ahead goal in the 64th minute.  The final 20 minutes of the match were played even with 10 men on each side because Atlanta United's Luiz Araújo also received a second yellow card. The red card came in the 71st minute, and Araújo will miss Atlanta's next match against Orlando City.  A wild night in the Windy City ended with the equalizer from Chicago Fire in the 89th minute. Miguel Navarro sent a left-footed cross to the far side that trickled through a crowded box to Haile-Selassie. The midfielder tapped it to Georgios Koutsias who was able to poke it past Westberg and even the match 3-3.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0bHV0ZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmRyZXctZ3V0bWFuLWdpb3Jnb3MtZ2lha291bWFraXMtYnJhY2UtYXRsYW50YS11bml0ZWQtMy0zLWRyYXctY2hpY2Fnby1maXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He seems to be saying that 15 tons of wood framing enclosed within a house was a major cause of the fire.  Cal Fire and various fire departments have very stringent requirements for building houses in rural fire prone areas. These requirements are designed to protect the houses from wildfire. They have been developed by trained fire engineers. While houses contain wood framing, they also contain large amounts of plastics, and multiple other flammable materials. Most new houses are also sprinklered to protect the interior of the house. They do not protect the exterior.  The fire started near federal lands that were totally overgrown with huge fuel loads that were supposed to have been cleaned up. Once the fire reached that, it created its own winds and roared to Paradise. Ponderosa Pine trees near homes did not help matters and further fueled the fire. For Mr. Roddy’s edification … one large Ponderosa can weigh 15 tons … and when exposed to fire can be a wonderful torch.  Wood framing is preferable to most others. It is preferable in earthquake zones. It is protected by fire retardant outside materials. As people and governments have added multiple restrictions, codes, and requirements to building houses, they are rapidly raising the costs above the average person’s income and accomplishing little in many cases.  — Frank Solinsky, Chico","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbGV0dGVyLXdvb2QtZnJhbWluZy1ub3QtdG8tYmxhbWUtZm9yLWZpcmXSAVFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljb2VyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2xldHRlci13b29kLWZyYW1pbmctbm90LXRvLWJsYW1lLWZvci1maXJlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2017-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Waco"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T22:49:00","Waco Fire Station No. 4 could find a new home on La Salle Avenue by 2027 as the Waco Fire Department looks to upgrade its 63-year-old facility near Baylor University. Design is also coming along for the planned Station No. 15 on Panther Way, meant to improve Waco’s response times at the southwest edge of the city.  Waco Fire Chief Gregory Summers said Station No. 4’s current facility at 1002 Speight Ave., built in 1960, is a small and outdated building on a lot with little room for expansion. The property — with about 3,500 square feet of living area and 4,000 square feet of paved area, according to the McLennan County Appraisal District — is too small to upgrade to meet the growing department’s needs and only has room to house one firetruck, he said.  “We have to move it off that property because the property is not big enough to update like we need to update for a present-day fire station,” Summers said.  The new station is planned for a lot on La Salle Avenue between Eighth and Ninth streets that the city bought from Baylor last year. Summers said it would have three bays able to house vehicles for the multi-company operation, with room for a fire engine, ladder truck and a third company vehicle. The three-bay setup is similar to the proposed design for Fire Station No. 15.  Also in line with current designs, Station No. 4 will upgrade to Jack-and-Jill bathrooms to support separate living quarters for male and female firefighters, Summers said.  “It’s not new in the fire service, but the older your fire stations, less likely they are gender-friendly,” he said.  Each new station will be equipped with large washing machines made to extract carcinogens from firefighters’ gear, which Station No. 4 does not currently have the plumbing capacity for, he said.  A request to start the design phase will go to city council late this year, with selection of a design firm slated for April or May of next year, according to a presentation Summers gave to the council last month. The project has a preliminarily budget of about $7 million, with substantial completion slated for 2027.  The building on La Salle Avenue will sit next to the former Cen-Tex Hispanic Chamber of Commerce site, which Council Member Alice Rodriguez said is still occupied by the owner, Cen-Tex Community Projects Inc. She said she likes the mission revival-style architecture presented last month, with stucco walls and a tower, to keep the consistency of the look of buildings in the La Salle Avenue corridor.  Summers said the fire department does not have plans for the existing facility on Speight Avenue and he is not yet sure if it will house other city operations or if it will be sold.  “At this point I don’t know what those plans are, but there’s nothing that we can do with it in its current location or condition that it’s in,” he said. “And it’s not a bad fire station. It’s just outdated.”  Fire Station No. 15  Summers said Station No. 15 at 10905 Panther Way, next to a city water tower along Ritchie Road, will take priority over Station No. 4’s relocation, given a lack of coverage in the area.  He said the new facility is almost out of its design phase.  The closest fire station to the new location is No. 14 in Speegleville or No. 11 on Imperial Drive. Taking Imperial Drive to Hewitt Drive is a straight shot into the area that Station No. 15 would cover, but response times vary and lag from their goal of 6 minutes, depending on traffic, Summers said.  “The response time for Station 11, which are more than likely to be the first station to get there, is anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes, and it varies … depending on traffic, the time of day,” he said.  “We have not had an issue. I don’t anticipate us having an issue in getting there, but if we’re going to cover the city like it needs to be covered, then we need to make sure we have adequate protection.”  The area near Hewitt and Woodway has seen rapid residential growth in recent years, including the 1,000-home Park Meadows subdivision.  The new location was chosen with input from the Insurance Services Office, a third-party entity that ranks fire departments based on their performance on a 100-point scale, Summers said. The ISO assesses how prepared a community is to respond to fires and determines where fire stations are needed. Its ratings affect property insurance rates.  “When they looked at our city, they identified that we need a fire station out here,” he said. “And so we began to look at putting that into the budget process to make the city aware of where we need a fire station.”  The department as a whole is scored out of 50 points, looking at how many firefighters the department has, how many trucks it has, what kind of equipment it has and the amount of training done monthly. For 40 points ISO scores the department’s water supply, and 10 points are allocated for dispatch.  Waco scored about 97 points, sitting in the highest rank, Class 1, Summers said.  Station No. 15 should have a finalized design this month, with a request for proposals going out for contractors next month and construction starting by the end of the year. The department is looking to move into the new facility in early 2025, he said.  According to Summers’ presentation to the city council, the construction project’s budget is $5.46 million.  Summers said the department has started the hiring process for firefighters to staff Station No. 15, seven already hired and working in Waco with five more on the way in October. When the station opens it will be fully staffed with trained firefighters, and promotions for a captain, two lieutenants and three drivers will come from within the department, he said.  Taking salary, benefits and uniforms into account, hiring one firefighter costs about $93,000, totaling some $1.1 million to staff the new station, Summers said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3dhY290cmliLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2dvdnQtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzL3dhY28tdG8tYnVpbGQtMi1uZXctZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9ucy1pbi00LXllYXJzL2FydGljbGVfMDQwNDNiNTYtZjU5YS0xMWVkLWE4MWEtZWZjMmU3Y2U5M2ViLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2019-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T02:20:00","As Gov. Gavin Newsom seeks to raise his national profile, local news organizations are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain responses from his administration.  Example video title will go here for this video  SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The silence from Sacramento echoes into the hills of California’s wildfire country where 70,000 people affected by man-made disasters are still waiting to receive settlement money from PG&E.  A lack of answers about their plight – being paid low-and-slow in a PG&E bankruptcy settlement California Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered, blessed, and bolstered – adds to growing scrutiny of how the Newsom administration handles tough questions and provides answers to pressing issues.  As Newsom assumed office in January 2019, the power monopoly filed for federal bankruptcy protection to settle damages with 70,000 victims of 24 different wildfires.  PG&E was a major donor to Newsom’s 2018 campaign. Just 30 hours after he became governor-elect in November 2018, PG&E sparked the deadly Camp Fire leading to 84 felony manslaughter convictions against the company.  ""He doesn't care,” said fire survivor Carol Cassel. “Isn't the governor supposed to be for the people of the state that he lives in?""  After Cassel escaped the deadly Butte Fire in 2015, Cal Fire investigators found PG&E at fault.  But settlement talks were frozen by the bankruptcy, which PG&E declared after starting fires that killed more than 100 people in 2017 and 2018.  The survivors of all of the 2015-2018 fires settled by PG&E were lumped together in the bankruptcy plan, to be paid from a new entity: the Fire Victim Trust.    Nearly three years after PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in 2020, no fire survivors have been paid in full.  They’ve been warned not to expect to receive their full settlements.  “The state should ensure fire victims are treated fairly and fully compensated,” Newsom’s own task force on the crisis declared in 2019. “Any reorganization plan should not disadvantage current and future wildfire victims.”  FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY  ABC10 has lodged 12 interview requests with Newsom since he was governor-elect, all of which have been rejected or ignored.  In 2021, the governor walked away when asked at a news conference about the shortfall to fire survivors.    It’s not a problem isolated to this issue. The Newsom administration has made a habit of avoiding interviews and comments on stories.    “It's just making it impossible sometimes to do this job,” said reporter Alexei Koseff, who recently reported on the lack of press access in Governor Newsom’s administration for nonprofit news site CalMatters.    “It is a strange position to be in as a reporter, because you never want to make yourself the story,” Koseff said. “But this has been a growing issue for the press corps over the past few years.”  Koseff chronicled a shift away from granting in-person interviews with the governor and state agency officials, urging reporters to submit questions by email instead.    His report also noted multiple occasions when staffers “physically blocked journalists” from approaching Newsom.    ABC10 aired footage Saturday of Newsom staffers using their bodies to block its journalists from asking the governor questions after a March news conference.  “The governor is not obligated to answer our questions,” Koseff said. “But to physically block reporters at an event from even trying to do their job… it's beyond simply ignoring a question then it becomes obstruction.”  QUESTIONS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND MAKING IT RIGHT  With the governor evading questions and refusing to provide answers, the frustration and anger from the victims and their families continue to mount.  In an investor call, PG&E recently announced plans to restart dividend payments to shareholders in the second half of this year.  This means PG&E plans to resume paying profits to Wall Street while its fire survivors go without full payment.    ABC10 wanted the governor to answer two main questions: How is this outcome fair? And what is he prepared to do to help get the survivors paid?  They are questions survivors want to be answered.    ""No one should be making any extra money until those victims have been paid for,” said Steve Bradley, whose grandmother Colleen was one of PG&E’s 84 manslaughter victims. “I know legally there is no way to hold them to that standard, but it is the right, moral thing for them to do.""    PG&E’s dividends had reached $1 billion annually prior to the Camp Fire.  Before PG&E’s federal criminal probation for its San Bruno felonies expired, a federal judge banned the monopoly from paying dividends as a way to protect public safety. He found PG&E had paid billions in profits to investors, some of which should have been spent on maintaining a safe power grid.  QUESTIONS AND NON-ANSWERS  In an exchange of emails with Newsom deputy communications director, Alex Stack -- who promised on-camera in March to help get answers to our questions -- the administration received and rejected our 12th request for an interview with the governor about PG&E.    In April, we finally had the opportunity to ask the governor the two questions during a press conference the governor called to talk about protecting abortion access:  ABC10: “Governor, PG&E on its most recent earnings call said it was going to go back to paying a dividend later this year. Meantime, the 70,000 wildfire victims are still waiting on their payments. They’re being told not to expect to be paid in full. I’m curious to know whether you think that’s fair and why. But more importantly, after your administration said that ‘the state should ensure fire victims are treated fairly and fully compensated…’ what do you plan to do to try to get those victims to 100 percent of what they’re owed?”    NEWSOM: “Well, we’re here talking about the pending, looming fire that’s in front of us. I appreciate the question on PG&E. That’s well established territory in terms of the public comments we’ve made and the work we did collectively, not only this administration but in partnership with the legislature. I don’t know about the dividends call at PG&E and I’ll have to get back to you on that.”    ABC10: “Why is it fair that they pay their shareholders but not their victims?”  NEWSOM: [Ignores question]  With neither question answered, we emailed Stack to ask the governor to get back to us on that.    Stack replied with a line the governor’s office has sent ABC10 on multiple occasions before: “No governor in California history has done more to hold PG&E accountable.”    The statement, which appears in its entirety below, goes on to describe the bankruptcy process. It does not answer the two questions: Does Newsom think this treatment of PG&E’s victims is fair? And does he plan to help them?  EMPTY BULLY PULPIT  Some fire attorneys asked the governor for a state loan to help pay the victims. It went nowhere.  “PG&E created that debt. They need to pay that debt,” said Bradley, who doesn’t want the state to pay.  If PG&E has enough money to pay dividends, he says the company should pay.  He wanted to hear the governor say that. He wanted to hear Newsom speaking from his bully pulpit as the chief executive of the state, which governors frequently do.  “He could call out PG&E, he could mention the payment to the shareholders, to put public pressure or public shaming on them,” said Sacramento State University Political science professor Kristina Flores Victor.    The governor’s response makes it clear he’s not planning to use his bully pulpit for the fire survivors.  “It seems like ‘we've already dealt with this,’” she added. “Whatever political energy has been expended on this topic is done.”  Newsom has raised his national profile, frequently booking interviews with national outlets about hot-button issues.  But some of the issues the California press wants to ask about: homelessness, problems with state programs, or the bailout of PG&E.  “They don't get him the good headlines. They maybe get him the bad headlines,” Koseff said. “You can understand the strategy, right? Say nothing, and perhaps the story will go away. And sometimes it does. That's what makes it an effective strategy and that's why people continue to do it.”  A CALL FOR COMPASSION  For Carol Cassel and thousands like her, the story won’t go away.  It’s her life.  She finally has a real roof over her head. She bought a house from friends who sold it below market value.  “I wanted to emphasize this isn't because of PG&E. We're not home because of something they did to make up for what they did,” Cassel said. “This is because I have good friends and there are good people in this world.”  She’s received 60 percent of her PG&E settlement. Fire survivors are being held at 60 percent as the trust liquidates shares of PG&E stock used to fund their claims.  The Fire Victim Trust acknowledges victims won’t be made whole in the end, but won’t say by how much.  Some projections forecast that victims will only get 80 percent of their money. Survivors have also asked Congress for help. On top of paying lawyers’ fees out of their settlements, they must also pay federal income tax on them.  Cassel would like to pay only 80 percent of her PG&E bill, but knows she can’t.  “Would we get away with that? They would come after us until the day we died,” she said.    Survivors also have a bone to pick with Congress. Efforts by members of California’s congressional delegation, a majority of which accepted campaign funds from PG&E after the company became a convicted felon, have fallen short of winning tax relief for these 70,000 survivors.  If she gets less than 100 percent of her settlement, Carol will struggle harder to keep the roof she finally has over her head.  She sums up what she wants to hear from Governor Newsom in one word: “Compassion.”  “When you're in that position, you can change the world, you can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem,” she said. “Where's your humanity?”    MORE FROM FIRE - POWER - MONEY: www.FirePowerMoney.com    EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a complete, unedited statement received via email from Alex Stack in Gov. Newsom’s communications office, responding to our questions:    No governor in California history has done more to hold PG&E accountable. The Newsom Administration worked with the Legislature to ensure that PG&E could not exit bankruptcy without first entering into a settlement agreement with fire victims, while also protecting ratepayers from rate increases. That settlement had to be approved by both the bankruptcy court and by a vote of the fire victims themselves, with the help of their lawyers and financial advisors.  Regardless of the settlement terms approved by the court and fire victims, the state is supporting communities hardesthit: providing additional relief for communities devastated by wildfires, including property tax backfills for schools, stabilizing finances of local critical infrastructure, debris and tree removal, and more.  Additionally, the state held PG&E accountable by forcing the company to make fundamental changes by passing strict new safety requirements, creating new protections for PG&E customers, getting PG&E shareholders to pay billions for safety improvements, and more.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FiYzEwLW9yaWdpbmFscy9uZXdzb20tdW5kZXItZmlyZS1hbnN3ZXJzLXBnZS1maXJlLXZpY3RpbXMtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1tb25leS8xMDMtYTU2YTY4MjItN2ZkZS00OGFlLTkwMDAtMTA3YmFlMzE3MmJi0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzEwLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FiYzEwLW9yaWdpbmFscy9uZXdzb20tdW5kZXItZmlyZS1hbnN3ZXJzLXBnZS1maXJlLXZpY3RpbXMtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1tb25leS8xMDMtYTU2YTY4MjItN2ZkZS00OGFlLTkwMDAtMTA3YmFlMzE3MmJi?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Jen Osborne/The New York Times)  EDMONTON, Alberta — As acrid smoke filled the air, turning the sky around her sleepy hometown, Fox Creek, Alberta, a garish blood orange, Nicole Clarke said she felt a sense of terror.  With no time to collect family photographs, she grabbed her two young children, hopped into her pickup truck, and sped away, praying she wouldn’t drive into the blaze’s menacing path.  “This feels like a Canadian Armageddon, like a bad horror film,” said Clarke, a 37-year-old hair stylist, standing outside her truck, a large hamper of dirty laundry piled in the back.  Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times  In a country revered for placid landscapes and predictability, weeks of out-of-control wildfires raging across western Canada have ushered in a potent sense of fear, threatening a region that is the epicenter of the country’s oil and gas sector.  Climate research suggests that heat and drought associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires.  Amid frequent fire updates dominating national television news broadcasts, the blazes have also helped unite a vast and sometimes polarized nation, with volunteers, firefighters and army reservists from other provinces rushing in to lend a hand.  Roughly 29,000 people in Alberta have been forced from their homes by the recent bout of wildfires, though that number has been cut in half in recent days as fires subsided.  Clarke said her family had been staying in cheap motels since they were ordered about a week ago to evacuate. But she and her boyfriend were unemployed and money was quickly running out.  “I don’t know if I’ll have a home to return to,” she added Thursday, sobbing.  The fires have produced such thick smoke that during recess, children in some towns have remained in their classrooms rather than risk smoke inhalation outside. Dozens of residents left in such a frantic panic that they left pets behind.  On Highway 43, a long stretch of Alberta highway peppered by small, evacuated towns, the thick layer of smoke blanketing the road on Thursday conjured the feeling of a dystopia.  Story continues  With helicopters hovering and dropping water, police cars with flashing lights blocked parts of the highway as fires approached the road. Residents trying to return to homes they hoped were still intact commiserated as they were forced to turn back.  Fires have broken out throughout western Canada, including British Columbia, but hardest hit has been neighboring Alberta, a proud oil and gas producing province sometimes referred to as “the Texas of the North,” which has declared a state of emergency. More than 94 active wildfires were burning as of Friday afternoon.  British Columbia was the site in 2021 of one of Canada’s worst wildfires in recent decades, when fires decimated the tiny community of Lytton after temperatures there reached a record 49.6 degrees Celsius, or 121.3 Fahrenheit.  Not since the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic buffeted the region has the area been so overcome by apprehension, accompanied by the all-too familiar need to wear masks outside. Only this time, residents say, a silent killer has been replaced by something more visceral and visible.  So far, no deaths have been reported. But in Alberta, Frankie Payou, a firefighter and 33-year-old father of three from the East Prairie Métis Settlement in Northern Alberta, was in a coma with severe injuries after being hit in the head by a burned tree. His home was also destroyed by a fire.  The bulk of the fires are in the far north of the province, home to many Indigenous communities, dealing a heavy blow to people who depend on the land and natural resources.  At a sprawling evacuation center in Edmonton, Ken Zenner, 61, a father of eight, two of whom are members of the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, said he and his family had been evacuated from the town of Valleyview. He worried how they would get by.  Families that have been displaced for a cumulative seven days are eligible for government-provided financial support, according to provincial regulations. But Zenner said he didn’t qualify because he had only been evacuated for six days.  “Indigenous communities have been underfunded for years and now we are seeing the consequences,” he said.  The rest of the country is mobilizing to help. Some 2,500 firefighters are battling the fires, among them 1,000 from other provinces. Joining them are wilderness firefighters from the United States.  The fires have even affected Alberta’s largest city, Calgary, where residents this week said they sat down for breakfast only to see and smell pungent smoke entering from cracks under their front doors.  Environment and Climate Change Canada said the air quality index for the city Wednesday afternoon was at 10+, or “very high risk.” Canadian health authorities have warned the smoke could cause symptoms ranging from sore and watery eyes to coughing, dizziness, chest pains and heart palpitations.  In Alberta, the blazes have brought back bad memories of 2016 when a raging wildfire destroyed 2,400 buildings in Fort McMurray, Alberta, the heart of Canada’s oil sands region with the third-largest reserves of oil in the world.  Alberta is Canada’s main energy-producing province and the United States’ largest source of imported oil and the fires have compelled some companies to curb production.  As flames bore down on wells and pipelines, major drillers such as Chevron and Paramount Resources together shut down the equivalent of at least 240,000 barrels of oil a day, according to energy consulting firm Rystad Energy.  For now, the disruptions affect only a small proportion of the country’s total oil and gas output. Still, they underscore how the production of oil and gas, the main driver of climate change, is also vulnerable to increasingly dire consequences of a warming planet.  Some say the fire may help galvanize Canadians about the perils of climate change. “The smoke from forest fires has an in-your-face impact affecting millions of Canadians that makes it harder to ignore,” the CBC, the national broadcaster, observed this week.  The human toll of the fires will reverberate for weeks to come. Christine Pettie, a business manager for a logging cooperative in Edson, a rural town about two hours west of Edmonton, said residents were still shellshocked after being evacuated.  She and her husband left in such a rush that he forgot his insulin medicine. They were fortunate that their home remained standing.  Still, Pettie said, the experience “definitely shook me to my core.”  c.2023 The New York Times Company","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2FuYWRpYW4tYXJtYWdlZGRvbi1zZXRzLXBhcnRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tMTQwNzAyMTAyLmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL25ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvY2FuYWRpYW4tYXJtYWdlZGRvbi1zZXRzLXBhcnRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tMTQwNzAyMTAyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WHSV) - The Swoope Volunteer Fire Company tried a different way to raise money on Saturday. The Dice Run fundraiser was a big deal since the fire company remains 100% volunteer.  Organizers explained how the Dice Run worked. Motorcyclists paid an entry fee to ride through a course with checkpoints. At each checkpoint, dice were rolled. The winner was determined and prizes were awarded at the last checkpoint.  Swoope Fire raised at least $2500 from a donation, but the big turnout made them confident they will have the money to get what they need.  “We use it for many different things, and then we had to look at bills... that we have to pay. Our firetrucks cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, so it’s very important that we have money to be able to get out the door and go to calls,” Swoope Volunteer Fire Company Deputy Chief Ben Piner said.  Collaborators of the Dice Run said this event needed to happen so Swoope Fire can get the thank you they deserve in the best way possible.  The fundraiser was a year in the making, so many people could be in for a good safe ride.  “It was a great ride. We had good weather; got cloudy a few times over but never did hit any rain, and I won two prizes on the ride so even better. Supporting the fire department is a great cause. When I saw they were doing a run, I want to be part of it so here I am,” Waynesboro -Based Biker Corey Lewis said.  Motorcyclists came from near and far just to show that they were Swoope strong.  “It’s about love, and it’s about our community and doing what’s right and making sure that people have someone there when they have an emergency; that we can take care of them,” Deputy Chief Piner said.  Multiple attendees hope Swoope Fire has events like this regularly.  Copyright 2023 WHSV.

"fire","2023-04-10","Not Discerned","{""Dimmitt"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T01:47:00","LUBBOCK - State investigators have determined a fire and explosion at a Panhandle dairy farm was an accident and started with an engine fire in a manure vacuum truck that was cleaning part of the barn.  The April 10 fire at South Fork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, about 66 miles southwest of Amarillo, killed nearly 18,000 cows and left one person injured. A report from the state fire marshal's office found there was ""no intentional act to cause a failure"" but did not determine the cause of the engine fire.  The findings, which were first reported by the Associated Press, noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn, and a dairy manager told investigators it had also previously burned. Investigators found burn marks near the engine compartment that were consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.  Investigators and the dairy manager waited until the next day to make entry into the facility because of the limited visibility at night when the fire started, the threat of the building collapsing and injured cattle wandering.  Investigators note in the report that the structure had only been in use for two and a half years and that the 17,500 cattle housed in the dairy were milked around the clock. Investigators also allowed dairy workers to move injured cattle out and reassured them it would not hinder the outcome of the investigation.  The Animal Welfare Institute, which tracks barn fires, said it was the deadliest barn fire involving cattle since 2013. Investigators with the Texas State Fire Marshal's Office previously stated the fire began as an accident, and the explosion was the result of flammable liquids, including liquid fuel, hydraulic oil and other materials ""expanding rapidly."" The investigation into the fire is now closed.  The Texas Tribune previously reported that the massive dairy operation was authorized by the state to more than double the number of cattle allowed on-site in 2019, from 11,500 up to 32,000. The state also authorized the facility to increase its manure production by more than 50% in the same permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Dimmitt, located in Castro County, has a population of 4,200 residents. The county is the second-highest milk-producing county in the state and has more than 59,361 cows.

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Inverness"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T02:34:17","Marin County fire Chief Jason Weber says the chance of a major wildfire during the early part of this summer has been greatly reduced by the persistent rain this year.  However, he said, “We can’t let our guard down.”  During a briefing on preparations for the 2023 fire season before the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, Weber displayed maps that illustrated expected fire risk in June, July and August.  “The good news is there is no red on the maps,” he said. “In previous years we did see a lot of red and potential for significant and above-normal fire occurrence.”  Weber noted that 1995, the year of the Mount Vision fire, was also a very wet year in Marin. The Mount Vision fire burned 12,000 acres and destroyed 40 homes in Inverness.  Weber said all the rain Marin has received has stimulated the growth of annual grasses.  “If you’ve been out hiking, you know the tonnage per acre is really significant,” Weber said. “You’re looking at oats that are 6 feet tall.”  By fall, when hot dry winds typically ramp up fire danger, those green grasses will be dry and highly flammable.  Weber said the good news is that the county has taken a number of steps to protect itself since the Mount Vision fire. It has increased the number of fire crews clearing vegetation and boosted home inspections, and it is building shaded fire breaks around population centers.  Approximately 33,000 home inspections were conducted in Marin last year to determine if homeowners are creating defensible space around their homes by clearing away combustible materials. Weber said removing all vegetation within 5 feet of homes is “super important.”  Some Marin jurisdictions collaborate to do the inspections while others, such as San Rafael and Novato, do their own. Until now, Marin jurisdictions had resisted the idea of issuing citations to residents who don’t clear space, despite a 2019 Marin County Civil Grand Jury report recommending the enforcement action.  Quinn Gardner, a San Rafael emergency manager, said it’s a new day in the city. Inspectors have issued more than 200 citations.  “We did our first big round of citations two weeks ago,” Gardner said. “If they correct the issue before the next citation, we won’t charge them. The folks have about three or four weeks before we issue them another citation.”  The initial fine is $250. For violators who don’t comply, he said, “eventually fines can increase to thousands of dollars and people could be charged abatement costs.”  A limited number of grants to help defer associated costs are available through the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority.  The shaded fire breaks being created remove some understory trees and vegetation while retaining tree canopies so they can continue to provide shade to help preserve the moisture content of potential ground fuels.  Work began about a year ago on a 38-mile shaded fuel break that will extend from eastern Corte Madera to Fairfax. So far, 14 miles of the break have been completed. The buffer will eventually run along the backyards of about 1,700 parcels and span 1,300 acres.  An even larger shaded fuel break that will encompass Novato is expected to begin this summer. The break will be 300 feet wide and 60 miles long, skirt 5,200 residences on the city’s outer edges and cover 3,000 acres. A matrix of fuel breaks already exists in San Rafael, southern Marin and western Marin.  Supervisor Mary Sackett said, “We do hear concerns when we talk about fire breaks.”  Sackett asked Weber to speak to that issue as well as public concerns about how the biomass created by vegetation management is being disposed of.  Weber said some people worried that the fire breaks would result in the clearcutting of large areas. He said that is not the case.  “We’re working with biologists and ecologists to make sure we’re doing this holistically,” Weber said, “not just from a fire prevention perspective.”  Weber said the public is also curious why the fire department is leaving biomass on the ground at sites where it is being chipped instead of hauling it away. He said this approach is more effective at sequestering carbon dioxide.  Bill Carney, who serves on the steering committee of the Marin BioMass Project, said, “That is one of the options, which is often very cost effective.”  A $500,000 study is underway to estimate the amount of biomass being created in the county and research options for its best use. It is funded by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research and led by the Marin Resource Conservation District.  Weber said another major concern he is hearing from residents is how the new state housing mandate will affect their ability to evacuate in case of a major wildfire.  In January, supervisors rejected a Planning Commission recommendation to tighten regulations on accessory dwelling units in the wildland-urban interface and very-high-fire-hazard-severity zones.  On Tuesday, however, Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters noted that state housing officials have granted the city of Portola Valley permission to continue restricting accessory dwelling units in fire hazard zones.  “It might be worth touching base down there,” Moulton-Peters told Weber.  A study that evaluates every road in the fire authority’s jurisdiction for its evacuation risk is nearing completion, Weber said.  Following the meeting, Mark Brown, executive officer of the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority, said he couldn’t predict when that study will be made public.  Brown said it might never be feasible to release the full report because information in the study could affect the property values and insurance rates of residents along the studied roads.  Brown said the county has a “very solid and comprehensive” evacuation plan in place that was created in 2016. He added that for many residents there are no evacuation options, because there is only one road in and out of their neighborhoods.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluaWouY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbWFyaW4tZmlyZS1jaGllZi1uby1tYWpvci13aWxkZmlyZS1yaXNrLW9uLWhvcml6b24v0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFyaW5pai5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9tYXJpbi1maXJlLWNoaWVmLW5vLW1ham9yLXdpbGRmaXJlLXJpc2stb24taG9yaXpvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With the front door blocked by the blaze, she and her two young daughters were trapped, and all she could do was call for help.

Even before the firefighters arrived, help came from an unlikely place.

""All I see is a lady pull open the window and she's screaming 'Please help me, please help me,'"" Hollins said.  Hollis got under the window, Jiminez said, and told her to drop her two children to him.  ""He was right underneath and he was like 'Yes, throw your daughters out, I'm going to catch them, I'm going to get them,"" Jiminez recalled.  First went one-year-old Valerie.

Firefighters began battling a fire at about 4:30 a.m. that heavily damaged the facility warehouse on Royalton Street.  An Eyewitness News viewer submitted a video near Elm Street that shows soot on the side of High Tech Finishing's warehouse.  A tweet by the Houston Fire Department at 9:20 a.m. said no injuries had been reported. It asked people to avoid the area due to heavy traffic.  The Houston Fire Department said the business works with highly volatile chemicals. Because of that, air quality and water runoff readings prompted a shelter-in-place issued at 10:35 a.m.  HFD Chief Sam Peña said the alert was issued as a result of ""particulates that may exist in the air.""  ""We did expand it to a mile-and-a-half radius. We might expand it too far but we want to go beyond. We can always bring it closer,"" Pennington said.  It was lifted later at about 2:08 p.m.  ""We responded to a fire in a kind of factory,"" HFD deputy chief James Pennington said.  As the team got to work fighting the flames, resident Jonathan Castanenda was getting ready for work.  ""I came out at about five in the morning and saw all the firefighters and ambulances. I could see like black smoke, and there was a weird smell in the air,"" Castanenda said.  ""It was a busy night for our personnel last night. This was the second fire (at a different location) that happened around the same time. This fire came in as an automatic alarm a little after four o'clock in the morning"", Peña said. ""We did issue a shelter-in-place warning for a mile and a half.""  Officials said additional readings were conducted to ensure the safety of the air quality.  The source of the fire is still under investigation. Fire officials have turned the scene over to private contractors who specialize in chemical clean-ups.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Crews searching the rubble of a massive construction fire in North Carolina on Friday found the bodies of two people who firefighters couldn't reach to save before the flames became too intense.  Authorities didn't identify the victims, but officials said two workers were missing after the Thursday fire on the site of a new apartment building in the upscale South Park neighborhood of Charlotte.  No one else was injured in the five-alarm fire, including more than 90 firefighters and a worker trapped for a time on top of a crane as a fire engine sprayed water on the metal to keep it from collapsing.  ""I've never ever seen a fire of this magnitude,"" said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings, a 31-year veteran of the force. ""It's devastating, heartbreaking.""  Investigators think the fire started about 9 a.m. Thursday in a trailer used to spray insulation into the building's walls, Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said.  The chief said they aren't sure exactly what set off the blaze and haven't been able to do a thorough investigation of the trailer.  ""Obviously, the building's still in a state where it is not safe for all of our members to go in,"" Johnson said.  The massive fire sent huge red flames and dense black smoke into the sky. At least two small crews of firefighters had to make mayday calls and be rescued from the fast-moving blaze, including one who could hear the cries of the trapped people on the sixth floor but couldn't see them through the smoke, Johnson said.  ""They were going by sound, trying to get to them but were unable to get to them before conditions changed,"" Johnson said. ""They had to call a mayday.""  The firefighters did rescue 15 workers inside the building, including the crane operator. Firefighters delivered protective clothing to him until he could climb down to safety, Johnson said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2NoYXJsb3R0ZS1maXJlLXR3by1wZW9wbGUta2lsbGVkLXNvdXRocGFyay1tYWxsLzEzMjc2MzMyL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2FtcC9jaGFybG90dGUtZmlyZS10d28tcGVvcGxlLWtpbGxlZC1zb3V0aHBhcmstbWFsbC8xMzI3NjMzMi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ball reports that the Plainville Fire Department has extinguished a 2-alarm fire at a YMCA pool clubhouse Saturday night.  The clubhouse building, at the YMCA Family Pool Club at Park Terrace located at 5 Berry St., was a total loss. The building was under renovation and is a popular swimming spot for local residents and families.  At approximately 5 p.m., Plainville Fire responded to 5 Berry St. for a report of a structure fire. Upon arrival, there was heavy fire showing from the clubhouse building.  Chief Ball struck a second alarm to activate mutual aid from surrounding communities to help put out the flames. Firefighters from North Attleborough, Wrentham, Norfolk, Foxborough and Cumberland, Rhode Island, arrived on scene, in addition to ambulances from Walpole and Mansfield.  Plainville Fire used multiple tanker trucks and ran hydrant lines to help put out the flames. It took approximately an hour-and-a-half to fully knock down the fire.

Cause of the fire is suspected to be a heating lamp being used to warm baby chicks, firefighters said. No injuries were reported.  At approximately 4:10 a.m. Saturday, Columbus firefighters responded to 2676 Central Ave. after one of the home’s occupants awoke to an odor of smoke within the single family home, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  A female occupant told firefighters that the smell of smoke led to the discovery of a small fire located within an enclosed breezeway leading from the home to the garage. When firefighters arrived, they found the home had been evacuated but flames had grown to the point of engulfing the breezeway in flames with fire extending into the residence, Wilson said.  Firefighters attacked the fire from the exterior of the home before transitioning into the interior. As crews battled flames, additional firefighters conducted a search of the home. Firefighters located a cat inside the home and removed the pet to the exterior of the home. Firefighters said the cat ran to a neighboring yard and appeared to be unharmed. The interior search concluded the home was clear of occupants. Firefighters battled the flames from approximately 30 minutes before the fire was marked under control, Wilson said.  Homeowner Diana McGrady told firefighters that she was sleeping, when her niece woke her up to report that the home was on fire, Wilson said. She and her niece quickly escaped the home and called 9-1-1. McGrady told firefighters that in the area where the fire was located, there were baby chickens that were situated under a heating lamp.  Columbus Fire Department investigators believe an extension cord was used to power the heating lamp. As firefighters and investigators worked at the scene, McGrady and her niece escaped a light rain after Columbus Police Department officers offered a patrol car as refuge from the elements.  Firefighters collected a few salvageable items from the home including shoes, shirts and pants, as the occupants had escaped with only the clothing they were wearing. Firefighters also located a cell phone and two pairs of reading glasses from within the heavily-damaged home. Firefighters believe the home and contents may be considered a total loss estimated at approximately $200,000, Wilson said. McGrady told firefighters that the home is insured.  Due to the damage, the family was displaced and is being assisted by the Salvation Army. The fire investigation is ongoing at this time.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include Duke Energy, CenterPoint Energy, Columbus City Utilities, Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2NlbnRyYWwtYXZlbnVlLWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWJ5LWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Video: The Washington Post)  Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  First Shell, then Marathon, then Valero. In the last three weeks, major fires have broken out at these companies’ oil refineries and chemical plants in East Texas, leaving one dead and over a dozen injured. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight The blazes in Deer Park, Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi follow a years-long string of explosions, fires and toxic releases in a region where oil refining and chemical production is highly concentrated, often close to residential neighborhoods. And while some residents have grown accustomed to the incidents, others are alarmed by how frequently they are hitting home.  “I have grown up here and watched neighborhoods near the refineries become too toxic to live in and people forced to leave their homes due to the toxicity,” Kristina Land, a resident of Corpus Christi, told The Washington Post.  On Wednesday, a fire broke out at the Valero West Refinery in Corpus Christi, sending smoke plumes into the sky and prompting emergency responders to mobilize. The cause of the fire is yet unknown.  Land, who is 45 years old, was in her home 20 miles from the refinery when she saw the black smoke on the horizon. She had to go on social media to find out what was happening.  Advertisement  She blames local officials for not encouraging more transparency.  “Our local government doesn’t ever want us to know how bad [the fires] really are, so we never truly know,” Land said. “They just sweep everything under the rug and never talk about it again.”  Refineries in the Lone Star State are regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which did not make officials available for an interview, but issued a statement.  Victoria Cann, a media specialist for TCEQ, said the three recent fires appear to be unrelated, “but investigations are underway into the cause, response, and clean up actions associated with each incident.”  She said the agency responded to each of them by deploying staff with monitoring equipment as appropriate and has “conducted surveillance to assess potential impacts to the local community.”  Advertisement  The first of the May refinery fires happened two weeks ago.  On May 5, heavy gas oil, gasoline and light gas oil ignited at Shell’s Deer Park chemicals facility in Deer Park, which sent 9 workers to the hospital. The plume from the fire, which occurred right outside of Houston, was visible for miles.  The fire, which started at 2:59 p.m., blazed on and off for days — after being reignited multiple times — before crews could completely neutralize it nearly three days later.  Emergency crews responded to the fire less than 19 hours after the TCEQ hosted a hearing to expand the Intercontinental Terminal Plant — a plant near Shell which blanketed the area with high levels of benzene, a chemical linked to cancer, in 2019.  Environmentalists say the accidents keep happening because the oil industry has little fear of penalties from regulators.  Advertisement  “Without a change from industry … communities are going to continue to feel the effects of these chemicals being spewed out by these facilities,” said Cassandra Casados, the communications coordinator at Air Alliance Houston.  A week after Shell’s fire was contained, a new plant fire erupted in Texas City, under 40 miles away, erupted. Galveston’s Marathon Petroleum confirmed that the fire caused the death of one employee and sent two others to the hospital. Emergency crews extinguished the fire — caused by a failed pump seal — in under four hours, according to city officials.  This is the second fatal incident to occur at Marathon’s Galveston Bay refinery this year. In March, a contract worker died after being electrocuted at the refinery.  Air monitoring at the state and facility level for all three sites is ongoing to determine the exposure risks to harmful levels of chemicals. Officials at the refineries and in nearby communities said the fires were not cause for concern:  Advertisement  “There is no danger to the nearby community,” Shell Deer Park said in a post following the incident.  Texas City Emergency Management stated that there was no need for a shelter in place following the fatal fire and that there was no threat to residents.  Valero’s west refinery did not warrant any “action from the community,” the city of Corpus Christi said in a news release.  Over the last several years, the Environmental Integrity Project — a D.C. based watchdog group — has monitored refinery fires and emissions, in East Texas and elsewhere. Too often, local officials minimize the impact of these incidents and issue “all is well statements,” said Eric Schaeffer, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who directs the watchdog group.  Black plume smoke is usually indicative that fine particulate matter — too small to see generally — is lingering in the air, according to Schaeffer. When refineries catch fire, the chemicals from the plumes aren’t contained to the site: They drift into residential areas.  “You’re going to have a lot of pollutants released,” Schaeffer said of these incidents. “That’s probably the biggest concern for the residents.”  GiftOutline Gift Article","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9jbGltYXRlLWVudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvcmVmaW5lcnktZmlyZXMtZWFzdC10ZXhhcy1wb2xsdXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A collector of fire extinguishers, Jessy is passionate about fire safety and sharing his knowledge with the community.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  Do you know how to keep yourself and your family safe in case of a fire? Summit County graduate Jessy Dorton does — and he’d be more than happy to share his fire safety knowledge with anyone who asks.  After graduating with the class of 2022, Jessy has continued his education at Summit High School through the district’s transition program that allows students with special needs to build social and life skills through age 21. Ever since elementary school, he has had a deep interest in fire safety — and fire extinguishers in particular.  “We want to keep people safe,” Jessy said. “And that’s what we do. Keep people safe.”  Since 2020, Jessy has helped with fire drills and completed monthly inspections of fire extinguishers at the school. On Thursday, May 18, the school and local fire agencies hosted a special ceremony to thank Jessy for his work, allowing him to deploy several fire extinguishers on an active fire in a burn barrel behind the school.  “That really made my day,” Jessy said as a smile spread across his face.  A cloud forms as Jessy Dorton uses a fire extinguisher to put out a flame in a burn barrel at Summit High School on Thursday, May 18, 2023. Local leaders organized the demonstration as a way to say thank you to Jessy, who has helped promote fire safety at Summit School District and beyond.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  Surrounded by friends, school employees and fire officials, Jessy wore a firefighter’s protective gear, complete with the signature firefighter helmet, as he sprayed the extinguishers on the flames.  “‘P’ you pull the pin out, and it breaks the seal,” Jessy said. “‘A’ is for ‘Aim at the base.’ You squeeze the handle, and then you sweep at the base, not the flame. That’s what you do. So the acronym is PASS: Pull, Aim, Squeeze and Sweep.”  Now, Jessy said, he’s prepared if there is ever a real life situation where he might have to use a fire extinguisher.  “Grab the nearest one and — boom! I’m going to be right on it,” he said.  Jessy — who is also involved with the Special Olympics and is a strong athlete in skiing, track, bowling and golf — has been deeply interested in fire safety and fire extinguishers for most of his life, according to his grandfather, Chris Dorton.  At home, Jessy has a collection of about 20 fire extinguishers and, almost no matter where he goes, he’s on the lookout to make sure the fire extinguishers are up to date and in working order, Dorton said. Once, Jessy found an expired extinguisher at the middle school and, another time on a vacation, he discovered an empty fire extinguisher at a hotel that the local fire inspector had just inspected, his grandfather said.  “He’s got a sharp eye,” Dorton said, adding, “People on the spectrum often have grand obsessions.”  Dorton noted the Netflix series “Atypical,” a heartfelt comedy that follows Sam, a teenager on the autism spectrum who has decided he is ready for romance. In the TV show, Sam’s obsession is penguins, Dorton said. For Jessy, it is fire extinguishers and fire safety.  Jessy Dorton smiles and begins to give a thumbs up to a crowd that gathered to celebrate him and the work he’s done for fire safety across Summit School District. Officials organized a demonstration to allow Jessy to use a fire extinguisher to put out a controlled flame at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  Kelly Finley, a counselor at the high school, said that as students returned to the classroom after the COVID-19 pandemic, Jessy was apprehensive about coming back and wanted to make sure that everything was safe. So the school got him involved with Brandon Smith, the district’s safety and security manager.  “He absolutely can tell you everything you need to know about fire safety,” Finley said. “How to use a fire extinguisher properly. How to evacuate properly. How to have a plan. He could be a spokesperson for Red, White & Blue or Summit Fire (& EMS).”  Every month, Jessy would inspect the fire extinguishers at the high school with Smith. Since December, Jessy has taken on more responsibility and has started inspecting the fire extinguishers himself. He even gets to pull the fire alarm during fire drills.  “He’s my safety buddy for sure. It’s been a lot of fun,” Smith said. “This year, I kind of gave him the freedom when he has time in school to check (extinguishers) on his own, and then I come by and take a look. He does a great job. He does it exactly as it should be. Checks everything all the time. Sometimes he checks them twice.”  Summit County Sheriff’s Office School resource officer Patrick Finley said, “Jessy is awesome.”  Jessy Dorton stands with fire, law enforcement and school officials after successfully putting out a controlled fire with an extinguisher at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  “He’s such a visible presence in the school. He’s such a great, likeable person. He loves to talk with us, and he educates me on fire extinguishers,” Finley said.  “Hopefully we can build a relationship between Summit Fire and Red, White & Blue so that when he does get out of school, they can find him something that he can help out with,” he added.  After a day deploying fire extinguishers, riding in an ambulance and a fire truck, and showing off his fire safety skills in front of his friends and peers, Jessy said he now wants to share his knowledge of fire safety with the community.  Every home should be equipped with smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms and home fire extinguishers, according to Red, White & Blue Fire Inspector Will Newton. As Jessy will tell anyone who asks, Class ABC fire extinguishers are best for at home.  Those portable fire extinguishers work well when the fire is confined to a small area, such as a wastebasket, and is not growing, Newtown said. Extinguishers should be used once everyone else has left the building, the fire department has been called and only if the room is not filled with smoke, he said.  Jessy added that it is important to know where the nearest fire extinguisher is and for families to have an escape plan and designated meeting area outside the house that everyone knows.  Jessy Dorton prepares to use a fire extinguisher during a demonstration at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  “If it’s a real life situation — you have a little fire and you need to use (an extinguisher),” Jessy said. “You would have someone call 911, pull the fire alarm and then I would have adult supervision with me using the extinguisher.”  But fire extinguishers can only do so much, so it is important to get out early if the flames get too big, Jessy said. Keep fire extinguishers close to an exit and keep your back to a clear exit while deploying it for an easy escape, if the fire cannot be controlled.  “If the fire is too big, you would close the door behind you, get everyone out safely,” Jessy added, “then still call 911 and have someone activate the alarm system and let’s get out of there.”  It’s best to know how to use a fire extinguisher ahead of time, in order to be prepared to use it in an emergency, Jessy said. Every year, families should review their fire plans, test fire alarms and check that fire extinguishers are up to date and in working condition, he said.  But the most important thing is always to stay safe, Jessy said. If fire alarms are going off, he said, “You just get out.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW1taXRkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9zdW1taXQtY291bnR5cy1qZXNzeS1kb3J0b24ta25vd3MtaG93LXRvLXJlc3BvbmQtaWYtdGhlcmVzLWEtZmlyZS1hbmQtaGUtd2FudHMtdG8tc2hhcmUtaGlzLWZpcmUtc2FmZXR5LWtub3dsZWRnZS13aXRoLXRoZS1jb21tdW5pdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Video from a building in the 200 block of New Dorwart street shows the car swerving left and right in front of a gold van headed southeast on New Dorwart Street toward the intersection of Saint Joseph Street at 3:55 p.m. After swerving in front of the van multiple times, the driver of the car steps out, pulls a handgun from their waistband and fires at least four bullets into the driver side of the van.  The van begins backing up the one-way street, unable to swerve around the car, while the gunman, of slender build and wearing a black hoodie and sweatpants, begins running east on New Dorwart. At one point, the handgun falls from the gunman’s pants, but they pick it up and keep running before meeting back up with the red car, now driven by a passenger who was in the car. The car turns north on what appears to be either Poplar or South Arch Street.  The driver of the van, who is believed to be in his 50s, traveled to a hospital. According to city police Chief Richard Mendez, the man did not have life-threatening injuries.  Multiple witnesses appear on the video footage, including a girl with a backpack running from the scene. City police are investigating and do not yet have anyone in custody.

GEORGE — Bees from a local honey company came dangerously close to going up in smoke as a truck caught fire Friday in a field that houses the bees.  St. George Fire Capt. John Taylor said they were quickly called to the fire and found a Mazda truck engulfed near the hives in a dry field on West Monterey Drive.  “There was a single vehicle on fire, fully engulfed near the beehives, and we had some exposures with the grass and next to this wash right here as well,” Taylor said. “We made an initial attack pass attack, and we used foam and that knocked to out pretty quick.”  Taylor said firefighters were able to protect the beehives, field and wash from catching on fire. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time, he said.  The owner of the bees, Melvin Taylor, said he feels fortunate that only two days prior, he had received permission from the city of St. George to have a controlled burn. Otherwise, he said he could have lost so much more. All of his 100 hives appeared to be spared.  “So by my truck sitting where it was, we got enough water on it before the fire department got here,” Melvin Taylor said. “And if the weeds hadn’t been burned a couple of days ago, the whole thing would have just went up. The St. George Fire Department has been good to me.”  At almost 75 years old, he started his Taylor Honey business in Santa Clara, Utah, when he was 14. Currently, his son Jared and his grandson help out with the company. Taylor Honey works with local farmers like Sterling’s Fruit and Vegetables and Frei’s Fruit Market.

"fire","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Florence"", ""Toscana"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-20T00:09:16","NORTHAMPTON — The city’s fire chief, Jon Davine, has ordered the Bombyx Center for Arts & Equity to cease all its indoor music events until an automatic sprinkler system is installed in the center’s sanctuary, where concerts are held.  The order comes a week after the department’s fire prevention officer, Capt. Mark Curtin, came to the Florence center unannounced and, after inspecting the sanctuary, told Bombyx Executive Director Cassandra Holden he was ordering all indoor music events immediately shut down.  According to a letter that Davine sent Friday to Holden, Curtin, who was accompanied by Kevin Ross from the city’s Building Department, came in response to “noise complaints from neighboring properties.”  Davine said an inspection of the sanctuary and a review of aspects of live music presentations, such as the occasional sale of alcohol, led him to determine that Bombyx is considered a nightclub — and as such must have an automatic sprinkler system in place for safety reasons, under a state law known as Section 26G ½.  In his letter, Davine said he is prohibiting all events “that constitute a nightclub, dance hall, discotheque, bar or similar entertainment purposes inside the premises” until a sprinkler system is installed and then inspected by the Fire Department.  Davine’s order followed a meeting Thursday between Holden and other Bombyx staff with officials from a number of city departments. Alan Wolf, chief of staff for Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra, characterized that meeting both as an effort to determine if Bombyx was operating safely and to find a way for Holden “to be able to keep doing what she’s been doing.”  “We all want [Bombyx] to succeed,” Wolf said.  In the letter Davine sent to Bombyx officials, the fire chief’ noted his decision can be appealed to the Massachusetts Fire Safety Commission and Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Board.  Thursday’s meeting also followed a tumultuous week for Bombyx staff, who in an interview with the Gazette, and in a letter they sent to city officials, said they were bewildered by Curtin’s order because they had previously shared all their plans with city building inspector Jonathan Flagg and city planner Carolyn Misch — both of whom had approved what they’d done, Bombyx said.  In an email Friday to the Gazette, Holden wrote that after getting Davine’s “cease and desist” order, she and other staff are “Talking with our lawyer later this afternoon. Mapping out a path forward. We can share something this evening or tomorrow morning.”  The Bombyx Center is located in Florence’s historic Congregational Church, whose parishioners continue to use the sanctuary. The center is also home to the Beit Ahavah Reform Synagogue and the Cloverdale Preschool, while numerous other local groups, such as the Young@Heart Chorus, use the facility on a regular basis.  Since taking over management of the property in the fall of 2021, the Bombyx Center, a nonprofit group, has also opened the facility for art exhibits, public talks, educational workshops and other events, including private functions such as memorial services.  At the same time, especially since the worst of the pandemic ended in late winter 2022, Bombyx has become an important part of the local music scene, offering concerts most weekends and during the week that range from jazz to folk to blues to classical music, as well as a variety of international music.  Just in the coming week, the center has shows scheduled for this weekend and May 26-27 that will need to be moved or postponed; some might be able to move outdoors to the center’s lawn. Tonight’s (May 20) show, by indie pop musician Brian Fennell, who performs under the name SYML, has been moved to Race Street Live at Gateway City Arts in Holyoke, and the May 21 concert, by the classical music ensemble Balourdet Quartet, has been shifted to St. John’s Episcopal Church in Northampton.  A two-day music event called “Collider! Fest” that had been scheduled for Bombyx May 12-13 was canceled last week following the initial shutdown order from Curtin.  Earlier this week, Bombyx staff told the Gazette they view their operation as more akin to 33 Hawley, the downtown space operated by the Northampton Community Arts Trust. “We’re a community arts and cultural center that also hosts live music,” said Elizabeth Dunaway, head of Bombyx’s board of directors. “We’re not a nightclub.”  However, Davine cited audiences of over 300 people at some Bombyx concerts, and wheels added to church pews that enable some of them to be moved to allow space for dancing, as factors that do make the center fall under the definition of a nightclub.  Yet Wolf acknowledged a strange discrepancy in the state’s laws that exempts religious institutions from needing sprinklers. Under that standard, he agreed, 300 parishioners could be in the Bombyx sanctuary, a choir could be singing with accompaniment by a string quartet, and they’d be in compliance with the law.  In a statement, Sciarra said the safety of people attending events in Northampton “is of utmost importance,” and as such she agreed with the fire chief’s decision.  And while praising Bombyx for its programming, the mayor said the center’s responsibility was “to adhere to all safety codes … and it appears that city regulators and Bombyx’s own consultants informed them about the necessity of fire safety equipment to function as a music venue.”  However, Sciarra also said she wants to help the center finance the installation of a sprinkler system, in part by allowing them to repurpose a $79,000 city grant that Bombyx received for other renovations.  Wolf said the center may also be able to tap some Community Preservation Act funds in the city for a sprinkler system, since the Florence church is a historic building that dates to the 1860s.

After dropping three straight in MLS, Atlanta United bounced back and dominated Colorado Rapids 4-0 at home behind four different goal scorers. The performance landed Brooks Lennon and Luiz Araújo on the midweek MLS Team of the Matchday. Meanwhile, Chicago Fire went on the road to Bank of America Stadium on Wednesday. The Fire held a 1-0 halftime lead only to concede twice in the second half and fall to a confident Charlotte FC.  Series History and Last Meeting  Atlanta United leads the series with a 7-4-1 all-time record against Chicago in MLS regular season play. Last time these two teams faced each other was just a few weeks ago for the One Planet match on April 23. Atlanta United held a 1-0 lead for most of the match, then gave up a goal in the 90th minute. It looked like the match was headed toward a draw until an own goal from Chicago tilted the result Atlanta's way 2-1. Chicago had a different coach then (the Fire parted ways with Ezra Hendrickson on May 8) and are now managed by Frank Klopas.  Players To Watch  Brooks Lennon (Atlanta United) – His name wasn't on the score sheet Wednesday in Atlanta United's 4-0 win over Colorado Rapids, but the fullback played a part in a major way. Lennon contributed to two of Atlanta's four goals on the night, the third multi-assist game of his career, an effort the league rewarded by naming him to the MLS Team of the Matchday. Lennon ranks second on the team in assists (6) and second in MLS in chances created (32) behind only his teammate Thiago Almada.  Kacper Przybyłko (Chicago Fire) – The lone goal scorer for Chicago Fire in the last meeting between these two sides is a guy Atlanta United will want to keep an eye on.

"fire","1923-03-20","Not Discerned","{""WestUnion"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:01:49","Town officials hosted NextEra company brass, NYS Department of Public Service  By Andrew Harris  A second public meeting that focused on the March 2023 wind turbine fire in the Town of West Union wasn’t as heavily attended or as contentious as the first. The little town hall was nonetheless still full of residents who were curious, disgruntled, impacted, and worried about the aftermath from the fire.  About a dozen landowners attended the regular monthly meeting of the town board, three representatives from NextEra Energy, and a representative from the New York State Department of Public Service(DPS.) Landowners were there for an update on the clean up effort from the fire, NextEra was there to update and answer questions (as best they could.) The DPS ecologist was on hand to answer questions from the regulatory perspective, mostly questions about agricultural cleanup from the fire, but also lots of questions about noise pollution from the wind turbines.  After Town Supervisor Randy Heckman finished running through the standard town board meeting business, he opened the floor to NextEra which owns and operates the Eight Point wind farm.  Company officials explained that the process of cleaning up debris from the fire was about three weeks from completion. They also announced that the entire tower would be taken down early next week with a controlled demolition.  This raised some questions about why, when, and with what means. NextEra explained that because the tower was four hundred feet tall, simply replacing the turbine was not practical. The company plans to drop the massive tower early in the week of May 21 but indicated the event would not be publicly announced for safety concerns. Local fire departments will be notified and a large horn will be blasted in the minutes before the demolition.  Explosive charges will be used to drop the tower and NextEra intends to have that wreckage removed within the aforementioned three-week timeframe. If the demolition causes damage to the land, NextEra explained they would remediate and repair such damages. The main concern being oil and due to structural and safety concerns, the company can’t be sure that all the oil in the unit burned off during the fire.  NextEra revealed some of the details of the fire, details that make this not just a rare event in general, but one full of happenstance.  According to NextEra, the turbine was not operating at the time of the fire and two maintenance workers were doing work inside the structure at the time of the fire. Those employees were able to safely vacate the structure according to the company. While the unspecified cause seemed to be electrical, the company said that no investigation into potential arson or criminal activity has been conducted. They also stated that the fire was not caused by the maintenance work being done when the fire started, it was caused by a random electrical issue.  Another interesting point that NextEra explained was that the undetermined cause, was located in the base of the structure, not in the turbine that burned. This massive wind turbine caught fire while it was non-operational, because of a electrical issue housed in the base of the tower. The NextEra representatives were very honest about their lack of technical expertise and directed all detailed questions to the number provided to find the proper NextEra department(see below.) .  Concerning the nature of the debris which fell from the burning tower, which was blown over a mile away by the wind, NextEra reported that laboratory analysis was complete. That analysis stated that the material, even after being burnt, was non-toxic to humans and may simply cause minor skin irritation if handled, just like house insulation. After a question from the residents, NextEra admitted that no analysis was done to confirm if the material is toxic to livestock. Many of the concerns about the fallout are from farmers who are concerned about future land quality, feed/hay contamination, animal health, and economic losses.  Residents asked if the destroyed tower and turbine would be replaced and NextEra confirmed that a new wind turbine structure would be installed on the same site in the future. When pressed about the root cause of the fire, and the potential for more fires, NextEra stated that they had isolated the component that wasn’t working properly and tested that component in all the other turbines in West Union. NextEra reported that all other turbines were working normally and that the incident remains a, “rare and random” event.  Since the April town board meeting, NextEra has had staffing changes and has consolidated all of the previously provided phone numbers into one. If residents, landowners, or farmers have questions or need to file a claim for damages with NextEra call this number:  607 661 4369  The New York State Ecologist from the Department of Public Service was on hand to explain to residents and landowners how to provide documentation to the state regarding the incident. A dedicated website is and has been available as a resource, a place to make a complaint, and read all the documents related to the “Five Point Wind” farm in West Union. Here is a link to that site.  https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/CaseMaster.aspx?MatterCaseNo=16-F-0062  The DPS Ecologist also spent a large amount of time talking about another major issue with the wind farm in West Union: Noise pollution from the wind turbines.  That is another story for another day. Clearly the noise from the wind turbines has had a serious impact, perhaps even more of an impact than the fire.

ND Highway Patrol says it happened just before 2:30 p.m. near exit 50, ½ mile south of Hickson/Oxbow exit. Officials say a semi driver was southbound on I-29 when he lost control in a construction zone.  Officials say the driver, 69-year-old Efrain Duran of McAllen Texas, hit water barrels and concrete barriers before the semi tipped on its side and caught on fire. He was cited with ‘failure to maintain a single lane’.  Officials say Duran was able to get out thanks to witnesses on the scene. He was not hurt, and no one else was either. The fire destroyed the International and trailer, which was hauling automotive parts.  Still no word on what caused the driver to lose control. Highway Patrol is investigating.

Make fire safety a top priority when working in the yard, riding all-terrain vehicles or building an evening bonfire.  “Humidity is low, so the environment is drying out fast,” , said Jeff Vasher, fire specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. “A fire can take off with very little warning in these kinds of conditions, especially if it’s windy at all.”  Before burning yard debris or lighting any fire, check Michigan.gov/BurnPermit to make sure weather conditions allow for safe burning.  People cause most wildfires  Nine out of 10 wildland fires are caused by people, and yard waste burning is the top cause of wildfires in Michigan.  Here are tips to keep your outdoor activities fire-safe:  – Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  – Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  – Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  – Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  – Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.  – It’s illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  – Use a burn barrel with a screen on top to burn paper, leaves and natural materials.  Fire safety information, including a map of the daily fire danger rating, is available at Michigan.gov/FireManagement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5cHJlc3MubmV0L29waW5pb24vZWRpdG9yaWFsLzIwMjMvMDUvZHJ5LXdlYXRoZXItYm9vc3RzLWZpcmUtcmlzay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The children - 5-year-old Addyson and 7-year-old Alijah - were both moved overnight from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to the Hamilton County morgue, coroner’s officials say.  Cincinnati firefighters pulled the girl and boy out of the second story of the burning apartment on Strand Lane in Winton Hills early the morning of Thursday, May 11.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation, a city spokeswoman said Friday.  “Our entire community mourns for Alijah and Addyson, their families and loved ones, and all of Winton Hills in the wake of this unfathomable tragedy,” Mayor Aftab Pureval said in a statement to FOX19 NOW.  “I want to thank our Cincinnati Fire Department and first responders for their bravery under incredibly difficult circumstances, and I know this loss is deeply felt throughout the city.”  Four children in all and their mother were inside when flames broke out. The mother and two of the children self-evacuated but Alijah and Addyson were trapped upstairs, according to the fire department.  When crews arrived, they found “heavy fire blowing out the front first-floor windows of an end unit two-story townhouse,” according to a fire department news release.  Firefighters “initiated a rapid attack on the fire with handlines on the first floor while simultaneously advancing crews to the second floor to search for the reported children. Both children were found and quickly removed.....” the news release states.  Addyston was without oxygen for 10-12 minutes and had no brain activity, according to the latest post on a Go Fund Me page for the family.  Alijah was burned on 30% of his body, lost oxygen for 10-12 minutes and had no brain activity, reads the latest post by the children’s grandmother.  [GoFundME created to help family from apartment fire]  The children’s grandmother’s Go Fund Me post indicates it is accidental.  “The fire started when one of the children plugged up their laptop, and the fuse blew, we are assuming this is an electrical fire,” the Go Fund Me post states. “They have lost everything. I want to thank CFD for rescuing my grandkids - when everyone is trying to get out of a burning building, you courageously go in, and there’s not a thank you big enough to express my gratitude.  “I want to thank Winton Hill Academy staff for your donations and for coming to assist my family at the Cincinnati hospital and Columbus hospital. We can’t repay you enough for your kindness. And just so we are clear, Asia, the mother, saved her own kids, despite local news coverage. It’s cruel and traumatic to say the least, to report anything. The police and fire reports tells the tell.”  Cincinnati Public Schools confirmed in a statement the children attended Winton Hills Academy.  “Cincinnati Public Schools is saddened that two students were injured in a fire at an apartment building near Winton Hills Academy. The District’s Crisis Response Team is at school today for students who need additional support.”  Damage at the apartment complex was estimated on the day of the fire to be $110,000.

The concrete shell of the building has been tested for strength and all is good, and an architect has been hired to draw up the initial plans for the redo, Robbins said.  As for the businesses that were displaced, two have reopened next door to each other in the 1700 block of N. Roosevelt Boulevard.  Dr. Carter Weber and his dental practice, Southernmost Smiles, is now adjacent to Gandara Kitchen Tile in the former Oppenheimer Eye Clinic location. Dr. Weber had been keeping patients updated on his Facebook page and as of February announced that the new office was nearly complete.  It is now fully operational.  Robbins, who owns Barrett Printing and Local Awards — two businesses that were inside Flagler Center — also moved his operation to 913 Eaton St., the home of Southernmost Signs.  “I bought Southernmost Signs, which is still in its same location at 913 Eaton St.,” he said. “But I also moved the other two businesses to that location and are up and running.”  Many of the businesses destroyed by a fire at Flagler Center in September 2022 have reopened in new locations, or their staff is working remotely. An architect has been hired to begin the rebuild. MANDY MILES/Keys Weekly  Robbins added that employees of Barnes Alarms are working from home, as are most staff of Ward & Meyers accounting firm, although they have rented a small office at 3706 N Roosevelt Blvd., in the plaza next to McDonald’s, Robbins said.  “Curry Printing is still in business and handling jobs out of their homes and in conjunction with their son’s printing business out of town,” Robbins said. “Island Refrigeration moved into the old Dion’s corporate offices at 638 United St., and Melissa Munoz of Bone Island Chiropractic is sharing office space with fellow chiropractor Steve Oropeza in Luani Plaza on Kennedy Drive.”  The cause of the fire was undetermined, but is thought to have started in a “chaseway,” or area between the two floors that contains miles of electrical wiring, Robbins said.  The damage is estimated to be $12.8 million, according to reports from the Key West Fire Department and fire and insurance investigators.  The fire started before dawn on Sept. 28, while Hurricane Ian fanned the flames with 50 mph winds and flooded nearby roads.  “High hurricane force winds quickly spread the fire from west to east, through the utility chase that ran the entire length of the structure,” wrote Key West Fire Department shift commander David Zarate in his report. “Once the roof began to show distortion and the eaves began to sag, I changed from offense to defense and ordered all (firefighting) personnel out of the structure.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va2V5c3dlZWtseS5jb20vNDIvZmxhZ2xlci1jZW50ZXItbW92ZXMtYWhlYWQtd2l0aC1yZWJ1aWxkLWFmdGVyLWZpcmUtZGlzcGxhY2VkLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtZmluZC1uZXctbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

That pad, at SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas, took a beating during the first-ever test flight of a fully stacked Starship vehicle — the most powerful rocket ever built — on April 20.  The immense power of Starship's 33 first-stage Raptor engines blasted out a crater beneath the pad that day, sending chunks of broken concrete flying through the dusty air.  Related: Relive SpaceX's explosive 1st Starship launch in incredible photos  SpaceX blasts a water-cooled steel plate with a Raptor engine in this still from a video that the company posted on Twitter on May 19, 2023. The plate technology is being developed to strengthen the ground beneath SpaceX's Starship orbital launch mount in South Texas. (Image credit: SpaceX via Twitter)  A day after the highly anticipated test flight, Elon Musk tweeted that SpaceX was already working on a way to prevent or minimize such damage — ""a massive water-cooled, steel plate to go under the launch mount.""  Such efforts had begun three months prior, the billionaire entrepreneur said. The plate system wasn't ready in time for the April 20 launch, but SpaceX went ahead with it anyway, assuming that the concrete beneath Starship would survive a single liftoff. That turned out not to be the case, as we saw on April 20.  The steel-plate work has continued apace since then. Indeed, the company recently tested a prototype plate against the power of a single Raptor.  SpaceX tweeted out a 20-second video of the test on Friday (May 19). When the steam clears at the end of the clip, the plate appears to still be in one piece — no mean feat, considering what it was up against.  ""One hell of a plasma beam!"" Musk tweeted on Friday, in a reply to the SpaceX tweet.  One hell of a plasma beam! https://t.co/y8uOTeFlsDMay 19, 2023 See more  SpaceX is developing Starship to launch astronauts to the moon and Mars, and to take over most, if not all, of the company's spaceflight portfolio down the road. NASA is a believer in the vehicle, choosing it as the first crewed lunar lander for its Artemis moon program.  The April 20 test flight aimed to send Starship's upper stage most of the way around Earth, culminating in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. That didn't happen, however; the vehicle's two stages failed to separate as planned, and SpaceX ordered the prototype to self-destruct high over the Gulf of Mexico a few minutes after liftoff.  SpaceX is building multiple Starship vehicles at Starbase and aims to launch the next one soon. Musk said recently that the next Starship flight could occur within the next month or two — provided the steel-plate system is ready by then and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration greenlights the mission.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9zcGFjZXgtc3RhcnNoaXAtc3RlZWwtcGxhdGUtcm9ja2V0LWZpcmUtdmlkZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

James Roger Carpenter Jr., 54, sought judicial diversion in the case as an alternative to jail at a hearing in April, when prosecutors deferred to Circuit Court Judge Andrew Freiberg on what Carpenter's punishment should be, according to court documents. Freiberg denied Carpenter's motion for diversion and handed down the sentence earlier this month.  On Feb. 10, 2022, authorities were dispatched to Little Lambs on Waterlevel Highway at 11:41 a.m. on a report of a fire. Twenty-seven children and four staff members were moved to a nearby building, authorities said at the time in a news release. There were no injuries in the fire.  While first responders were getting the children out of the day care, they noticed open beer containers in a room at the facility, authorities said. When they questioned Carpenter, he told authorities he had multiple alcoholic beverages while working at the center that day, according to the release.  Carpenter was arrested and charged with child neglect, but when the case came before General Sessions Judge Sheridan Randolph, the charges were dismissed because the day care was ""not in custody"" of the children, officials said at the time.  District Attorney Stephen Crump presented the case to the Bradley County grand jury, and new charges were issued against Carpenter in an indictment containing 27 counts of reckless endangerment and one count of reckless burning, the Chattanooga Times Free Press previously reported.  According to court records, Carpenter admitted to drinking beer and small ""airplane"" bottles of liquor while he was in charge of the children, and to smoking in the day care in the area where the fire started. Freiberg in his May 11 ruling found Carpenter was impaired and said he had a history of criminal convictions and criminal behavior.  Carpenter's actions placed the 27 children at the day care at serious risk of bodily injury or death, Freiberg ruled in issuing the three-month sentence.  According to court documents, Carpenter is to report May 28 to the Bradley County Jail and will be given credit for the time he spent in jail in February and April of 2022 while being held.

That cloud dropped from firefighting aircraft is a fire retardant called PHOS-CHEK, a sign of relief for firefighters trying to increase containment lines on the ground. The widely used chemical that helps slow the spread of flames is produced at a factory in Rancho Cucamonga east of Los Angeles.  PHOS-CHEK essentially turns dry brush and other fire fuels into something non-flammable.  But why is it pink?  Get Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.  ""We tested every color in the rainbow, and the pink was by far the most visible. And, it's pretty,"" said Melissa Kim, vice president of research and development at Perimeter Solutions.  The bright color allows firefighters to see where the PHOS-CHECK has been dropped and where it hasn't. Ground crew can then create fire lines around it, potentially saving lives and property.  ""If you can't see it, then it's essentially not effective,"" Kim said. ""The purpose is they're flying in high smoke, low visibility with winds. The pilots have to get it right the first time. This job doesn't offer many second chances.""  A resident near the San Bernardino County community of Highland captured this dramatic view of a fire retardant drop from a firefighting air tanker as it soared over the Mart fire. The tanker flies behind a spotter plane before dropping its payload of red Phos-Chek, a fire retardant, to slow the fire's spread. The Mart fire broke out Tuesday June 27, 2017.  The product was created about 60 years ago. The recipe is a guard secret, but the main ingredient is phostphate, basically fertilizer that can be stored for many years. The phosphates react with vegetation to prevent it from catching fire.  The recipe has gone through some changes, including a formula that won't leave a permanent stain on hillsides, homes and cars.  The Rancho Cucamonga company produces PHOS-CHEK as a powder that's then delivered anywhere around the world. The urgent nature of wildfires means shipments of the 2,000-pound bags must be ready to go.  Sacks of PHOS-CHEK ready for shipment at Perimeter Solutions in Rancho Cucamonga.

""So we are always on alert, always on call 24-7.""  After the sacks are delivered, to air attack bases, the powder is mixed with water and loaded into firefighting aircraft.  ""So all the aircraft you see dropping retardant, this is what they're dropping,"" Sanchez said.

Officers say they got the upstairs tenants to leave and tried to talk with the man, but he hung up the phone multiple times.  During the negotiations, officers say they saw flames on the first floor along with smoke.

With summer right around the corner, it's time to get outside and spend the night out under the stars. There's really nothing better than gathering a few friends and hanging out around a campfire late into the night after a big adventure together. It's also the time of year to remember some basics with Smokey Bear to prevent a cozy campfire turning into a dangerous wild fire. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, in 2022, nearly 70,000 wildfires burned approximately 7.6 million acres of land nationally. There is, of course, the golden rule of never leaving a campfire unattended, but here's a few other things to think about.    Our very own Amy Jane David out there to remind you to make safe choices with fires this summer. | TGR photo.      1. DO NOT build a campfire if the campground, area or event rules prohibit them. Sometimes digging of pits may be prohibited due to archaeological or other concerns.  2. Always choose a site at least 15 feet from tent walls, shrubs, trees or other flammable objects.  3. Choose an open, level location away from heavy fuels such as logs, brush or decaying leaves - these can unexpectedly catch a spark and quickly lead to an out of control fire.  4. Take wind, and its direction, into account when choosing the site. Choose a spot that’s protected from gusts.  5. Always put out your fire completely. Let wood burn to ash if possible, and pour water over the fire or bury it with sand until the hissing sound stops. Remember, if it’s too hot to touch, it’s too hot to leave.  There are babes in the woods. | TGR photo.

New Zealand police Friday lowered the confirmed death toll from a Wellington hostel fire from six people to five, although they said they still haven’t finished searching the dangerous four-story building.  The reduced toll came as a man charged with two counts of arson in connection with the fire made his first court appearance. The 48-year-old suspect, whose name has not been released, was not required to enter a plea and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance June 19.  If found guilty, the man faces a maximum of 14 years in prison on the charges. Police said they’re treating the case as a homicide investigation and could add more serious charges later.  Advertisement  Police Inspector Dion Bennett did not offer an explanation for why authorities had reduced the death toll after having put it at six since Tuesday, hours after the fire ripped through Loafers Lodge.  But Bennett did say that police have still not been able to search all areas of the building after parts of a roof and a floor collapsed in the fire and created piles of debris.  “The scene examination in itself, and in the third floor in particular, is quite dangerous,” Bennett told reporters. “And there are still parts we can’t cross.”  He said that urban search-and-rescue teams had been working with police to prop up sections of the floor as police inched forward with their examination. He said police had removed four bodies and hoped to remove the fifth soon.  The man charged with setting fire to a couch and to the lodge wore a black hoodie in court, waved his arms about and tried to fire his lawyer, local media reported.  Lawyer Douglas Ewen later told the Associated Press that the man remained his client. The judge granted the man temporary name suppression, a routine practice in the New Zealand legal system.  Police had earlier said there was a couch fire at Loafers Lodge about two hours before the larger fatal fire. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The deadly fire ripped through the building about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or jumped from windows.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers, which are not required in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.

Richie Revis kicked open the front door and found an unresponsive elderly female lying on the floor.  Cpl. Revis pulled the woman from the burning home to safety, and found out there was another person inside the home.  Police said officers tried going into the home via multiple different entrances but because of the flames weren't able to go further into the house.  Indian River County Fire Rescue responded to the scene and transported the female victim to a hospital, where she is recovering from her injuries.  Unfortunately, after the fire was extinguished, police said they searched the home and crews found a male resident had died in a bedroom.  Friends and neighbors said the two people were 90-year-old Grace Follett and her 60-year-old son, Charlie Follett.  A close friend, Ron McCullough, told WPTV Charlie and Grace Follett lived their with their dog, and that the dog likely didn't make it out either. He also said Grace Follett was flown to a burn unit in Miami.  “She was lucky to get out of here, wasn’t she? She was lucky,"" said McCullough.  McCullough said Charlie Follett was a great chef, and incredibly intelligent. He also said he was a great friend to him and to others, and would be extremely missed.  ""He was a good guy. All his friends, me, we really hate it [that he was killed],"" said McCullough.  The fire is one of several devastating structure fires to hit the Treasure Coast this year.  According to Indian River County Fire Rescue, since 2022 there have been 21 structure fires in the county, resulting in one fatality.  In St Lucie County, there were 102 structure fires, resulting in three fataliies.  In Martin County, there were 285 structure fires, resulting in zero fatalities.  ""I'd say the top causes of fires in Martin County, and in home fires specifically, are cooking, electrical fires, as well as open flames, smoking, even heaters, those are all major concerns,"" said the Martin County Fire Rescue Community Relations Liaison Cory Pippin.  According to the National Fire Prevention Agency, that rings true across the State. The top five causes of house fires are, in this order:  Cooking Heaters Electrical Smoking Candles  Indian River County Fire Rescue's Bureau Chief Bill Herrington said the Dolphin Avenue fire is still under investigation.  However, fire officials across all three counties urged people to be prepared.  ""It takes less than 30 seconds for a small flame to turn into a major flame, and then a fire, and then your house can be engulfed in flames in minutes,"" Pippin said.  Some ways you can prepare yourself and your family include:  Making sure you have working smoke detectors  Have an evacuation route planned  Plan a spot for the family to meet once you do evacuate  Make sure all exits are not blocked  Remember to Stop, Drop and Roll  If you are in the home with flames and heavy smoke, drop to the floor and crawl to avoid the heavy smoke, which can be just as dangerous as flames.

Each fire was caught quickly by occupants, but one household was temporarily displaced due to fire-related damage.  At 3:36 p.m., east side firefighters were dispatched to 4322 Melody Lane for a report of a home full of smoke and an “ashtray” burning. A tenant explained to firefighters she had been smoking on the balcony prior to leaving home approximately two hours earlier. Prior to leaving, she put her cigarette out and placed it in a red plastic coffee container she used as an ashtray. Upon returning home around 3:30 p.m., she found charring on the outside of the building, signaling a fire that spread from the plastic container. She threw water on the fire, and there was no active flames when fire crews arrived, but Engine 8 did cool hot spots with water. The occupant and her son were temporarily displaced due to damage related to the fire.  At 11:04 p.m., west side firefighters were called to 9321 Glencoe Drive for another fire on the deck of an apartment. Engine Co. 12 arrived to find flames showing from an exterior patio and the resident of the apartment unit was in the process of extinguishing the fire. The fire originated in a plastic planter, where firefighters noted an accumulation of used cigarette butts discarded among plant soil and other organic material. There was no fire extension beyond the planter box. The patio was made of poured concrete, limiting the spread of fire.  Both incidents serve as a reminder about the importance of discarding smoking materials in proper receptacles. Smoking-related fires have the potential to spread quickly when coming in contact with exterior building siding and other materials, especially if the patio or balcony is not protected by automatic fire sprinklers.

Detectives identified the troubled man who dared to steal the fire rescue truck in North Miami Beach — after finding an opportunity during a fire rescue training exercise — as Aljenard Lekambrick Hanna, police said.  After the swift heist at fire station 32, at 358 NE 168 St., surveillance video shows Hanna driving northbound on Interstate 95, just as commuters were stuck in traffic, police said.  While speeding through the streets of northern Miami-Dade, Lekambrick crashed into a parked Opa-locka Police Department cruiser, but it was empty, so no one was injured, according to police.  Aljenard Lekambrick was in the custody of the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office on Friday, records show.

The Florida Highway Patrol was also among the agencies involved. The frantic pursuit ended on the Turnpike. A witness recorded a video of Hanna’s arrest north of the Boynton Beach exit.  Local 10 News went to Hanna’s northwest Miami-Dade home to learn more about what would prompt him to allegedly steal the vehicle when a woman living there charged at a Local 10 News photographer.  Another relative told Local 10 News reporter Roy Ramos that Hanna suffers from a mental disorder, which likely led him to commit the crime.  “What I have to say is focus on mental health. I don’t know what that was, but I know he is under mental duress,” she said.  Records show Hanna was in the custody of the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office on Friday morning after corrections officers booked him shortly before 2:40 a.m., and he was facing a charge of grand theft of emergency medical equipment, which carries a $25,000 bond.

In the Montecito Ennisbrook open space, about 200 sheep have arrived off of Highway 192.  Montecito Fire Wildland Specialist Nic Elmquist said, ""what the sheep are doing are targeting that dry grasses which would be the most ignitable to embers.""  Bite by bite, the area becomes less of a fire threat. This program is run by the Cuyama Lamb company which has a protective dog on site to scare away other animals.  A low power electric fence is set up to keep the sheep in check. Cuyama Lamb says multiple sites in several fire prone locations are full of sheep now.  Company foreman Cristian Arambula said, ""so we have a thousand sheep total so we are bouncing throughout the areas throughout the day."" They are also at Elings Park and recently worked in an area by the Santa Barbara Bowl.  And this is a lot quieter than the sound of several weed wackers doing the same work.  Funds have been allocated specifically for these types of projects to reduce the threat of a fire another day.  Elmquist said, ""the Santa Barbara County Fire Safe council was awarded a grant for about $2 million. That's about 25 projects. This is the first one we are implementing. It will be about 3000 acres over the course of three years."" Funding comes from the Cal Climate Investment and it is managed by Cal Fire.  Wildland fire specialists say a key part of fire protection is early prevention.  Elmquist said, ""what we try to do is get ahead of it, get ahead of the problem and try to do fuels reduction.""  The work is along a popular hiking trail and those who come through on foot are impressed with the early fire season efforts.  Hiker Rachel Fiero said, ""keep it from getting into neighborhoods. This is a great idea. This is where we should be putting our efforts.""  There's plenty to eat and this group of sheep is expected to go through the grass and low lying vegetation at a rate of about an acre a day.  Elmquist said, ""we are thinking three weeks to a month in this particular area, the plan is just about an acre they call them paddocks, and starting up here and then move them south.""  Already in just a couple of days, there's been a big change, even with the additional grasses after the heavy winter rains.

Smokeless fire pits like the Solo Stove are hot, so to speak. But how smokeless are they, really? Consumer Reports put some of the best-sellers to the test to find out which ones will make building, tending and cleaning up a backyard fire easier and safer.  Where there's smoke, there's fire - or is there?  Popular backyard fire pits like the Solo Stove - often called smokeless fire pits -conjure up a roaring outdoor fire, sans smoke.  Consumer Reports just tested seven of these types of fire pits. The quick takeaway:  ""It's a misnomer to call them smokeless. They are less smoky, but they're not smokeless … you will always have some smoke,"" said Bernie Deitrick with Consumer Reports.  That's the nature of burning wood but the way these fire pits are designed, there is less smoke once the fire really gets going -especially when compared to a traditional campfire.  In its tests, CR's Bernie Deitrick started lots of fires noting how fast each fire lit, and how effectively it burned.  ""The ones that did well in our ratings, you can have a small fire in them or a large fire in them, they start quickly, so that they are out of the smoky phase sooner and they burn the wood completely so that there's not a lot of clean up afterwards,"" Deitrick said.  Consumer Reports found the Solo Stove left behind lots of wood, and cleaning it up wasn't as easy as some of the other fire pits.  The top performer -- a Cuisinart -- yes, the kitchen appliance brand, Cuisinart! It's fast to light and it burns the wood more thoroughly than any other model, so there's less waste and less mess.  If you want to skip chopping and lugging around firewood, this Inno Fire Pit burns wood pellets instead.  And while it's not as easy to clean as the other two fire pits, this Blue Sky can burn pellets or logs.  And remember, no matter what type of fire you're enjoying, keep it safe!  Place your pit on an uncovered, hard flat surface -- at least twenty feet away from anything flammable.  CR says to avoid placing any fire pit on your deck. The heat could cause wood to catch fire or melt composite decking materials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb25zdW1lci1yZXBvcnRzL3RpcHMtYW5kLXRyaWNrcy1mb3ItYS1zbW9rZWxlc3MtZmlyZS1waXQvMzI2MTY5NC_SAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvY29uc3VtZXItcmVwb3J0cy90aXBzLWFuZC10cmlja3MtZm9yLWEtc21va2VsZXNzLWZpcmUtcGl0LzMyNjE2OTQvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For the second time in a decade, the 34-year-old is now starting over.  “Ten years ago, when I was in my early 20s, I struggled with addiction and homelessness,” he told The Oregonian/OregonLive. “I’m certainly fearful that this catastrophe might wipe away all the positive progress I’ve made since.”  Firefighters evacuated more than a dozen people and at least two dogs after the blaze started around 10 a.m. Tuesday. Its cause is unknown at this time, but the blaze appears to have started on the third floor of the Goose Hollow apartment building and jumped to the fourth, fire officials said. There were multiple explosions throughout the 42-unit building. Fire investigators said they were aware of rumors floating around about the cause of the fire, including that it could be arson, but said they “can’t confirm anything right now.”  Wolf isn’t the only resident who was living at The May, located at 1410 S.W. Taylor Street, who was formerly unhoused.  Julie Showers, spokesperson for homelessness nonprofit Blanchet House, said there were at least two prior Blanchet House shelter residents living at the apartment on the day of the fire. Two others had also resided there but “luckily” moved out recently, she said. It is not clear how many other residents were formerly homeless. Wolf wasn’t one of the Blanchet House residents.  “Over the years we’ve had many residents move to The May because it was lower barrier, meaning they were accepting of low credit scores and imperfect background checks,” Showers said. Blanchet House does not partner with The May; it just so happened to be one of the buildings some of their former shelter residents could afford on their own, Showers said. Wolf said he paid $890 monthly for a studio.  Wolf said the building served an important function in the community, “offering housing for people that couldn’t afford the more expensive apartments in the area.” He said many people worked “very, very hard” to live there. The building was home to formerly houseless individuals, disabled residents and seniors on fixed incomes, he said.  “This is just about the worst thing that could have happened to most of them, and we now essentially have additional people who are homeless in our community,” said Wolf, who is currently staying at the temporary Red Cross shelter erected for fire victims. He said several dozen other former May residents are there too.  One of the former Blanchet House residents, John Judge, filed a lawsuit against The May Friday. Attorney Michael Fuller filed the suit in Multnomah County Circuit Court seeking $125,000 from The May’s owner for the loss of Judge’s possessions, emotional distress and the head injury Judge said he suffered after he tripped on a firehose on his way out. Valerie King, the wife of The May’s owner, said they had no comment on the litigation.  Judge lost items that once belong to his late mother and father, who both died during the pandemic. He lost his mother’s family Bible and wedding ring, a watch worn by his father while serving in Vietnam and family photographs dating back to the 1800s. While he expects to enter veterans housing offered by Portland homelessness nonprofit Transition Projects on Monday, it will likely take Judge much longer to move on from the trauma.  “It was the most horrible experience in my life,” he said. “All I have is the clothes on my back.”  Blanchet House director Scott Kerman worries about the psychological toll on residents. After doing the painstaking work to achieve housing only to lose it again, Kerman hopes that residents from The May don’t lose hope. And he hopes in addition to housing services, that there will be mental health resources made available to help residents cope with the trauma.  13 1 / 13 Southwest Portland apartment building partially collapses after fire  Wolf doesn’t yet know where he will live next, though the Blanchet House men’s shelter could be an option. He was told housing workers would visit the Red Cross shelter to help people navigate next steps, but he hasn’t seen them yet.  The fire highlights the challenges that low-income residents face in maintaining housing, Kerman said. A catastrophe such as a fire can more easily destroy someone living on fixed income and the psychological toll is likely to hit harder than for those who have a financial cushion to fall back on, he said.  The owner of The May had numerous hazardous condition code violations that he recently fixed, according to city inspectors who reviewed the repairs a day before flames devoured the building. The May is one of a dozen buildings owned by Larry D. Kelley, 72, through his company, SkyNat Property Management, business records show.  City staff found 10 code violations during a Dec. 15 inspection. The building didn’t have functioning emergency lights on the second and third floors and a series of “daisy-chained” extension cords were found in the main lobby, the case files show. The review also found damage to fire-resistant ceiling covers in the basement laundry room and a fire door that had been propped open on the fourth floor.  Fire inspectors visited the building the day before the fire and found that most of the violations had been rectified, though investigators noted that a different fire door was wedged open, an expired fire extinguisher in the basement hadn’t yet been replaced and another fire extinguisher on the fourth floor was missing a tool to break its glass enclosure.  Wolf, who lived on the fourth floor, said more could have been done to protect residents in the building.  “I really feel like the management company tremendously neglected us,” Wolf said. “We certainly know the fire department had red flagged us in December, but we also didn’t have any management on site for the past month.”  Kelley and building managers did not respond to requests for comment.  Wolf said someone began repeatedly pulling the fire alarm at The May in December. He estimated it happened at least 20 times since then, at times going off at 4 a.m. or around 2 p.m. when he was on virtual meetings working from home. Other residents also said the fire alarm was repeatedly pulled. Portland Fire & Rescue responded to 24 fire alarms at the building from November through mid-May, according to Lt. Laurent Picard.  “It got to the point where the fire department would take a little longer each time to show up with a truck to shut off the alarm and people stopped leaving the building when the alarm would go off and wouldn’t respond since they just assumed it was a false alarm,” he said. “Pulling the fire alarm is illegal and it was happening for five months, and they didn’t do anything about the issue.”  Initiating a false alarm that is transmitted to a fire department is a misdemeanor in Oregon.  — Nicole Hayden reports on homelessness for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

"fire","2023-07-03","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T18:51:23","The state Fire Marshal’s Office continues to investigate the cause of the fire that destroyed a Kittery hotel this week as the medical examiner tries to identify the remains found in the most badly burned section of the building.  Fire marshals will continue to work the scene to try to determine the origin and cause of the fire, State Fire Marshal Richard McCarthy said Thursday. His office, which is leading the investigation, did not release any new information Friday about those efforts.  McCarthy has not said if the fire is considered suspicious but did say there is no investigation of the hotel owner.  The fire ripped through the Days Inn on the Route 1 Bypass on Wednesday afternoon. It took hours and crews from 16 departments in Maine and New Hampshire to contain and put it out, and more than 24 hours for investigators to locate the victim.  The state medical examiner is trying to identify the victim, whose body was found around 2:15 p.m. Thursday. McCarthy did not know if the victim was male or female and no one has contacted authorities to report a missing person.  Related One person found dead in rubble of Kittery hotel fire  Investigators initially said two people might have been unaccounted for, but the second person was found safe and away from the scene. They now believe everyone who had been staying or working at the hotel has been accounted for, including four out-of-state workers who were living there while working at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  Advertisement  It was a challenge to determine how many people were in the building and who they were because the hotel owner did not keep a required guest log, Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien said Thursday. The hotel office was destroyed, as were any records not stored online.  Hotel Owner Kamlesh Patel has been very cooperative, O’Brien said.  In 2018 and 2019, the hotel was closed for a lengthy period of time after local officials put the building under a closure order until multiple code violations were fixed. Those violations included problems with the installation of propane-fired heating systems, alarm systems that weren’t functioning, fire doors that didn’t close and issues with access and egress, O’Brien said.  Those violations were all corrected and the hotel was issued a certificate of occupancy in 2019. The hotel had not been inspected in the last couple of years, O’Brien said.  The hotel, which was valued at $1.7 million by the town, did not have a fire suppression or sprinkler system. There were working smoke alarms in the building.  It was built in 1956, according to town records, and was not required to have a sprinkler system, which state law requires for all hotels built since 1992. Older hotels are required to have approved smoke, heat and fire detection systems.  Advertisement  The fire was the largest in town in decades and the first fatal fire there in about three years.  Fighting the fire was a challenge because the wood frame building was full of furniture and “lots of material to burn,” O’Brien said. Heavy winds fanned the flames, giving the fire a big start, he said.  “It is a firefighter’s nightmare with individual rooms and hallways and everything else,” he said. “Trust me when I say I was extremely hesitant when I sent my firefighters into the building to go make that initial primary search.”  During the first three or four minutes on scene, firefighters rushed into the building without a water line to try to get to a room that may have been occupied. They were almost there when the fire became too intense and they had to pull out, O’Brien said. He learned later no one was inside the room.  That part of the building is not where the victim was found, O’Brien said.  Now that the department’s work at the scene is over, attention will turn to helping the Kittery firefighters themselves. This was the first fatal fire for several young firefighters, O’Brien said Thursday.  “We will sit down, discuss it and have them understand that things like this happen and they did everything they could,” he said. Everyone will be offered counseling.  As investigators searched through the fire scene, firefighters were already busy dealing with other calls in town, including brush fires and car crashes, O’Brien said.  “We wake up in the morning, we move on and we continue,” he said.

"fire","2023-05-08","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T10:13:24","A string of four e-bike battery fires on Mackinac Island, including one that landed two firefighters in the hospital, has the fire chief investigating causes and risk to historic properties on the island.  The latest fire was Tuesday.  ""I'm tracking the origins of these fires and trying to come up with what kind of batteries they are, what condition they're in when they burn,"" Mackinac Island Fire Chief Jason St. Onge told the Free Press on Thursday. ""As of now, we can't find any direct correlation.""  So far, he said four known e-bike battery fires have occurred under different circumstances on the island:  In late July, a battery charging in a kitchen caught fire and put the homeowner and two firefighters in the hospital.  In the fall, an e-bike battery caught fire at a residence but it was contained without firefighter assistance.  On May 6, a bike that was not plugged in or charging ""burned up overnight in the yard"" of a resident, St. Onge said.  On Tuesday, a battery in a box, not plugged in, caught fire at a home. The smoke detector alarm went off at 6 a.m. and the occupants were alerted in time to remove the battery before the fire spread.  The fire chief met with island business owners in late April to warn them about the potential threat of electric bike battery fires, urging them to take action to reduce the threat to iconic buildings.  ""These are all lithium-ion batteries,"" St. Onge said Thursday, still mystified that people aren't more concerned about fire safety and battery risk near wooden structures on the historic island. ""It's like you're trying to convince me that it's OK to store gasoline in your house.""  When lithium-ion batteries and other high energy density batteries are charged too long, overused, damaged in any way, improperly stored, poorly made or incorrectly refurbished, they may cause fast-spreading fires, according to Consumer Reports and the city of New York websites.  It is essential people exercise extreme care with these batteries, St. Onge said. ""Let's be clear: You don't have four fires in 10 months and then just stop. You hope they do but it's not responsible to take that position. I can't run the fire department on hope.""  After a Free Press article published May 2, he said he received calls and emails and Facebook messages from fire chiefs around Michigan applauding his proactive approach to concerns fire officials have expressed privately.  ""The article raised awareness, in general, around the state,"" St. Onge said.  In a three-page letter dated May 8, and obtained by the Free Press, State Fire Marshal Kevin Sehlmeyer notified St. Onge of specific procedures for tracking and reporting lithium-ion battery fires that include property damage and injuries, whether or not the battery was charged, estimated percentage of battery charge at the time of the incident and whether the battery was portable or charging. Reporting protocols also include whether the batteries do not start a fire but create hazardous conditions such as arcing or shorted electrical equipment.  The email sent to fire officials, originated from the Michigan Department of Licensing & Regulatory Affairs, Bureau of Fire Services, noted that the data is being aggregated by the National Fire Incident Reporting System. Specific codes are required to assist with risk analysis.  Public officials are working to determine the breadth of the problem as micro-mobility devices such as e-bikes and scooters continue to grow in popularity.  Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau, told the Free Press, ""The nature of these fires and the growth of e-bikes sales makes it an absolute necessity that information is tracked and shared. We couldn't be more thankful for the attention our firefighters are paying to it.""  Mackinac Island, an international vacation destination which attracts hundreds of thousands during its main season of May through October, is known for its bicycles and horse and buggy carriage rides. Cars have been banned on the island for more than a century. But not motorized bicycles. And island bike rental shops continue to see a growing appetite for e-bikes, according to St. Onge.  Steve Brisson, director of Mackinac State Historic Parks, told the Free Press in early May that pedal-assist brings the island into compliance with laws protecting people with disabilities as interpreted by the courts.  On Tuesday, Consumer Reports endorsed the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, legislation in Congress to protect consumers from the risk of fire tied to lithium-ion batteries used in micro-mobility devices such as e-bikes and e-scooters. The bipartisan proposal sponsored by House members from New York would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to put into effect a consumer product safety standard for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micro-mobility devices, and for other purposes.  In New York City, which has seen a spike in e-bike use since the start of the pandemic in 2020, there have been five fire-related deaths involving e-bike fires out of 59 total e-bike related fires this year, NPR reported April 11. That doesn't include lithium ion battery fires involving scooters.

While these can create lasting memories with family and friends, it is essential to prioritize fire safety. Let’s review key fire safety tips and base regulations to so that you enjoy these summer activities.  According to the National Fire Protection Association, grilling-related fires peak in July (18%), followed by June (15%), May (13%), and August (12%). Gas grills were involved in an average of 8,900 home fires per year, with leaks or breaks being the primary issue. Charcoal or other solid-fueled grills were involved in 1,300 home fires per year. From 2014 to 2018, an average of 19,700 patients per year went to emergency rooms because of injuries involving grills. Nearly half (9,500 or 48%) of these injuries were thermal burns, with children under five accounting for an average of 2,000 or 39% of the contact-type burns per year.  Location:  - Ensure the area is clear of any flammable materials, such as dry grass, leaves, or overhanging tree branches.  - Position the barbecue or campfire at least 10 feet away from any structures, including your home, shed, or garage.  - Charcoal and gas grills, deep pot fryers, gas heat lamps, must not be used under overhangs or awnings.  Equipment:  - Inspect your barbecue grill for any damage, such as rust or cracks, before using it.  - Make sure your propane tank is in good condition and that all connections are secure. Check for gas leaks by applying a light soap and water solution to the hose and connections. If bubbles appear, this indicates a leak that needs to be addressed.  - For charcoal grills, use a charcoal chimney starter or an electric charcoal starter instead of lighter fluid, which can be dangerous.  - When using a fire pit or building a campfire, ensure it is surrounded by a non-flammable border, such as a ring of rocks or a metal fire ring.  Ohio EPA regulations for backyard campfires:  - Must be fueled with clean seasoned firewood, natural gas, or other clean burning fuel.  - Must not be used for waste disposal.  - Must have a total fuel area of no more than three feet in diameter, and no higher than two feet.  Grilling safety:  - Never leave your barbecue or campfire unattended.  - Keep a fire extinguisher or a bucket of water nearby in case of emergencies.  - Don't use gasoline or other flammable liquids to ignite or re-ignite the fire.  - Use long-handled grilling tools to keep a safe distance from the heat.  Backyard campfire safety:  - When you're finished using a propane grill, turn off the burners and the propane tank.  - For charcoal grills, close the vents and let the coals cool down completely before disposing of them in a metal container.  - For campfires and backyard fires, let the fire die down, then pour water or shovel dirt onto the embers until the hissing sound stops. Stir the ashes and continue adding water or dirt until the fire is completely out.  Educate:  - Discuss fire safety rules with your family and any guests who will be participating in your outdoor activities.  - Supervise children and pets at all times to ensure they maintain a safe distance from the fire.  As you enjoy the warm weather and outdoor activities, remember to prioritize fire safety. By following these tips and adhering to WPAFB regulations, you can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your property from the dangers of fire.

Example video title will go here for this video  MANCHESTER, Conn — Fire marshals have determined the cause of a fire that engulfed a multi-family home in Manchester early Friday morning, leaving 14 people without a place to live. The cause of the fire was determined to be the ""improper disposal of smoking material outside the structure.""  The home on West Street went up in flames around 4 a.m. Friday, all while those who lived there stood across the street, watching in shock. Roy Barlow said he just barely got out in time.  “I felt the heat; it was pretty immense. I went away from the building even further because the heat was so intense,” Barlow said.  Manchester Fire Chief Daniel French said it’s possible the fire started in a bush outside and then quickly spread to the rest of the house.  “You wind up with an intense need for manpower early on; this was an older structure. It had cedar siding under vinyl,” French said. “It had a lot of fire in the attic and outside and extended into the attic, through the whole building. A lot of people coming in early with access to water made a difference.”  One of the people in the home and a firefighter were taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.  Barlow was sleeping when he woke up to screaming, telling him to get out because his apartment was on fire.  “Grabbed the fastest shoes I could find and got out – but the fire was just on the other side of the wall where my room is,” Barlow said.  He said he still couldn't believe what happened, saying the past few years haven’t always been easy, but he has learned to manage difficulty.  “Even though I’m only four years sober, I’m wondering what it will be like being in a situation where you are all by yourself at your own devices,” Barlow said.  Barlow tells us his sobriety journey is what’s kept him motivated, and today he is not only grateful to be alive but is thankful for everything that’s happened in his life so far.  “I’m very lucky; I have a lot to live for. God put me in this world for something, and I’m doing very well with my life,” Barlow said. “There is a turnaround in all of this. I feel there will be a positive.”  The Red Cross is helping the fourteen residents find a place to stay while the fire and smoke damage is evaluated. The fire chief said the damage is extensive in spots, but some of the home may be saved.  Firefighters remind residents that Connecticut is in a Red Flag Warning, which is activated in dry conditions.  Jennifer Glatz is a digital content producer at FOX61 News.

Police publicly named the man, Charles James Perrin, 25, after he was booked into the Vanderburgh County jail Thursday on preliminary charges of arson and criminal mischief causing at least $50,000 in damages.  The Evansville Police Department and Evansville Fire Department worked alongside the Indiana Department of Homeland Security to investigate the Pearl Cleaners fire, which began sometime after 1 a.m. Wednesday.  More:Fire destroys former Pearl Cleaners site in Downtown Evansville  When Evansville fire crews arrived at 1:48 a.m., the building was almost engulfed, according to a probable cause affidavit authored by IDHS investigator Levi Sims. It eventually escalated into a two-alarm blaze.  ""The fire department was able to extinguish the fire; however, the building is a total loss,"" Levi wrote. ""The assessed value of the building is approximately $445,000.""  The Pearl Laundry Center, located at 428 N.W. 3rd Street, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 when it was known as the ""Pearl Steam Laundry"" building. Two years prior, the state added Pearl Steam Laundry to its registry of historical places.  Pearl Cleaners closed the location in 2018 and was the subject of a lawsuit one year prior, which alleged the laundry's decades-long use of cleaning solvents contaminated groundwater.  Investigators quickly zeroed in on Perrin as a potential suspect and, at a Thursday afternoon news conference, EPD Officer Mario Reid said Perrin voluntarily agreed to answer questions at EPD headquarters.  More:Evansville man arrested and accused of intentionally setting Pearl Cleaners fire  Perrin, who police believe was homeless at the time, reportedly admitted he ""knowingly and intentionally"" started the fire with a portable hand torch. According to the affidavit, Perrin used the hand torch to ignite ""combustible materials,"" such as a ""shopping cart filled with blankets.""  ""Mr. Perrin stated that he set the fire for self-gratification, as he got an adrenaline rush,"" Levi wrote. ""Mr. Perrin stated that he left and soon came back to admire his work.""  Perrin is scheduled to appear in Vanderburgh County Circuit Court at 1 p.m. for a probable cause hearing. A judge will review the probable cause affidavit and set a date by which prosecutors must file formal charges.  As of Friday morning, Perrin was still listed as an inmate in Vanderburgh County jail records.  From the Sports Desk:Girls can play baseball, too. Just ask Evansville Christian's Jacie Arnold  As for Pearl, the Evansville Building Commission will conduct a code enforcement inspection. After the building commission files its report, the fire department will ""determine what needs to happen next,"" Reid said.  According to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office, the building is owned through The Pearl Development LLC. Its registered agent is listed as Ryan Schulz: an attorney with Kahn, Dees, Donovan & Kahn.  The company, which had hoped to turn the historic building into commercial space, sent an un-signed news release after the Courier & Press reached out to Schulz Thursday: ""Our dream of revitalizing this iconic building and returning it to her former glory, (sic) is now ash.""

Prosecutors allege that just prior to the Wednesday morning fire at the Oromo American Twhid Islamic Center on N. Dale St., Said Murekezi, 42, can be seen on surveillance video entering the building through a window that he had broken the day before.  The Islamic Center had been using the facility as an office, but it has not been a place of worship since 2021.  St. Paul Police arrested Murekezi Wednesday evening in downtown St. Paul. According to the criminal complaint, he allegedly admitted to police in an interview that he broke into the Islamic Center on Tuesday and stayed overnight “looking for things inside to burn.”  Grow the Future of Public Media MPR News is Member supported public media. Show your support today, donate, and ensure access to local news and in-depth conversations for everyone.  Murekezi identified himself as Muslim and told investigators that he “burned the building as a form of protest because of other Muslims in the community having to sleep outside in the cold. He said that the building is not serving anyone, but the people need it,” according to the charges.  Murekezi also allegedly said that it was good he was caught, otherwise he would “torch another one,” or “a church.”  Investigators said that when police arrested Murekezi, officers found that he was carrying a substance that later tested positive for methamphetamine.  Police apprehended Murekezi after ATF agents requested help from a Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office unit that has access to facial recognition technology. Investigators matched stills from the surveillance video to other images of Murekezi, including a photo of him leaving the Hennepin County jail Monday evening, about 36 hours before the mosque fire.  Court and jail records show that Minneapolis-St.Paul International Airport Police arrested Murekezi on April 28 at the Terminal 1 light rail platform after spotting him walking inside a train tunnel, allegedly with a meth pipe.  Hennepin County prosecutors charged Murekezi with gross misdemeanor trespass on a critical public service facility and possession of drug paraphernalia, a petty misdemeanor. He was jailed for about two weeks before a judge ordered him released without bond on the condition that he stay away from the airport.  Other court records show that Murekezi has struggled with drug abuse, mental illness and homelessness. He pleaded guilty to arson last year for setting fire to a pile of clothing in his room at Mary Hall in St. Paul, a Catholic Charities facility that provides private rooms to unhoused adults.  The heat caused a fire sprinkler to be activated. Authorities say Murekezi initially denied firefighters access to his room and threatened to jump from a fourth-floor window. After serving a brief jail term, Murekezi was placed on a year of supervised probation, which began in November.  In restraining orders that she filed in recent years, Murekezi’s former partner alleged that he had threatened her and their teenage son. She said Murekezi texted her a photo of himself pointing a gun, and other family members had expressed concern that Murekezi had not been taking prescriptions to treat his mental illness.  Murekezi made his initial appearance in Ramsey County Court on Friday, where a judge set bond at $200,000 and ordered a mental competency evaluation. Murekezi remains jailed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvYmlhcy1tb3RpdmUtbm90LXN1c3BlY3RlZC1pbi1zdC1wYXVsLW1vc3F1ZS1maXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Scott Higgins died in a fire when a seal on a pump, near where he was performing maintenance at Marathon's Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, ruptured and created a blaze that engulfed him in flames.  ""He was burned to death at the plant,"" said attorney Tony Buzbee at a media briefing on Friday where he alleged safety conditions at the second-largest U.S. oil refining complex have not improved in a decade.  Higgins' family plans to file a gross negligence lawsuit against the oil refiner and other firms involved in the plant's maintenance, he said. Buzbee is seeking documents on the plant and maintenance, according to court filings.  ""Marathon, due to negligence and disregard for the well-being of everything but their bottom line has devastated me and my family,"" said Alyssa Higgins, a daughter of the deceased worker.  A Marathon spokesperson said the company is committed to determining the cause of the incident and has invested more than $1 billion on safety and regulatory upgrades since acquiring the facility.  ""Our OSHA recordable incident rate (ORIR) is better than the industry average. We remain committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety, and our goal is to eliminate injuries at our site,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""The safety of our workers and the community remain paramount.""  The company said this week it launched an investigation into the blaze but has not released any findings.  ""Scott always thought he might die at that plant,"" Buzbee said. ""He had talked to his daughters about it and his family many times. And the reason he talked to them about it is because that plant is very dangerous,"" Buzbee said.  ""This wasn't an unfortunate catastrophe,"" Buzbee said.  The facility has had a history of accidents under Marathon's ownership since 2013 and under its previous owner, BP Plc (BP.L), records show. A worker at the same plant was killed after he was electrocuted earlier this year, and in 2005, a vapor cloud released from an overflowing processing unit exploded, killing 15 contract workers and injuring 180 others.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Flagstaff"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T02:01:13","Officials kept watch on a storm system making its way across northern Arizona this week, just about a month before the monsoon traditionally starts for the area.  The storms, so far, have primarily impacted communities across Yavapai County stretching down across the central and eastern portions of the Mogollon Rim.  ""So far, we've mainly seen just your curb-to-curb flooding in certain parts of northern Arizona,"" which will likely continue through Friday, National Weather Service meteorologist Lamont Bain, in Flagstaff, said.  Rainfall at Flagstaff Pulliam Airport on Friday had already set a new daily record by 1 p.m., the weather service tweeted. The old record was 0.50 inch, set in 1957, while the new benchmark reached 0.57 inch on the day.  The potential for showers and thunderstorms will start winding down through the middle of the week, Bain said.  City officials in Flagstaff hosted two meetings this month to prepare residents for the potential for more flooding this summer after the community faced dozens of flood events last year. While officials emphasized the importance of readying properties and paying attention to emergency alerts, there is no clear way to predict what lies ahead.  Thinking ahead:After last year's floods, Flagstaff begins preparing residents for monsoon  ""I do think that we have to be a little careful about drawing comparisons between what we're seeing now and if that's going to necessarily be a preview of the monsoon,"" Bain said.  The monsoon is unpredictable by nature, Bain said, which is why meteorologists often hesitate to make firm predictions this far ahead of time.  ""Unfortunately, it's one of those things that we just kind of have to wait and see how it goes,"" he said.  While the current storm system might have no bearing on the monsoon, it could impact the traditional wildfire season. Because the rain rolled in during what is usually the area's peak fire season, the extra moisture will also likely delay the onset of the season, Bain said.  ""It will certainly keep the fire potential on the lower end of the spectrum,"" he said.  Bain also warned that this early rain could spark a green-up of the surrounding areas. If the traditional monsoon, which usually starts around the end of June, is also delayed, the vegetation could then dry out quickly and add to dangerous fire conditions.

Charlotte Fire’s investigation determined it began accidentally and started in a spray insulation foam trailer on the ground floor, Johnson said. Workers had shared that same information with Channel 9 on Thursday.  Construction worker Demonte Sherrill, 30, died in the fire, family members confirmed.  PREVIOUS STORIES:  Keith Suggs, the manager of Atlanta-based Prestige Windows and Doors, confirmed to Channel 9 that a second worker was killed in the fire. He said said both Sherrill and the other victim worked for him. Channel 9 is not naming the second victim at this time out of respect for the family.  Suggs said Sherrill was only on his third day of work at the site -- he started working for Suggs on Tuesday. Sherrill and the other man were the only two workers Suggs said he had at the site on Thursday when the fire broke out. The two were working to install doors.  Suggs told Channel 9 he was actually at the construction site Thursday but left before the fire started. He said both Sherrill and the other victim were on the sixth floor with their harnesses on.  The five-alarm blaze happened on Liberty Row Drive near Fairview Road.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""May"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:01:01","Here's a rapid-fire update on all 34 stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio we use for the CNBC Investing Club. Jim ran through each one of them Wednesday during the May edition of our ""Monthly Meeting."" Apple (AAPL): With the iPhone maker's business in emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India beginning to show momentum, our longtime ""own it, don't trade it"" mantra continues to look great. Financial features like Apple Pay should help with services revenue growth in the years ahead, too. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Jim said he's worried about overstaying his welcome in AMD, a company he's liked for many years under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su. That's a high-quality problem to have, though. The stock, up 60% this year, is nearing a 52-week high. Amazon (AMZN): The e-commerce and cloud giant is leaning into generative artificial intelligence (AI) to reignite its advertising business, which generated $9.5 billion in revenues in the first quarter. It's a promising plan. However, Jim suggested the Club may need to trim its Amazon position soon, strictly from a portfolio-management perspective. AMZN is nearing a 3% weighting in the Trust. Bausch Health (BHC): After the ""Monthly Meeting"" concluded, shares of the troubled pharmaceutical maker soared on a favorable ruling in the company's Xifaxan patent litigation. BHC stock jumped more than 41% at one stage to a session of $8.56. We're still trying to figure out the full extent of the court ruling, but it's news that could eliminate the possibility of a default, which brought the stock to $6. Xifaxan, which represents 80% of sales at BHC's Salix Pharmaceuticals unit, is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and overt hepatic encephalopathy. Bausch Health disappointed investors with first-quarter earnings and revenue when it reported earlier this month. However, the company at the time offered better-than-expected forward guidance. Caterpillar (CAT): Our focus is on the deluge of infrastructure spending coming in the U.S. over the coming years, and less on where dealer inventory levels sit in the next quarter, something Wall Street analysts talk a lot about. This allows us to be patient and see through short-term noise. Costco (COST): Costco continues to keep its prices low and its quality high, and traders who sell its stock on, say, weak monthly sales are usually proven wrong over time. Salesforce (CRM): CEO Marc Benioff has successfully fended off an unusual amount of activist pressure in the stock. Following the stock's big year-to-date run, we sold 100 shares on May 4. We're curious to see whether Salesforce can jumpstart Slack, the workplace-messaging app it acquired nearly two years ago for almost $28 billion. Coterra Energy (CTRA): Coterra's first-quarter results were downright impressive , given the steep decline in natural prices in recent months. Jim said he'd like to buy more if the stock fell below $24 per share, but suggested the oil-and-gas firm's robust buyback program may be putting in a floor. Danaher (DHR): Danaher is in a rough patch, but our long-term faith in management to execute and deliver efficiencies across its life-sciences businesses hasn't been shaken. To sell here would suggest management has lost a step. We don't believe that's the case, and Jim said he'd like to buy some additional shares. Disney (DIS): We're sticking with Disney, although our entry into the entertainment giant was a bit early. Simply put, the company's current market value is significantly lower than its franchise value, rooted in its vast intellectual property library. The odds favor that mismatch correcting over time. Estee Lauder (EL): The prestige cosmetics firm is dealing with a more volatile recovery in its Asia travel retail business than expected, leading to very disappointing guidance that's crushed the stock. But now it's priced in, and we want to use the weakness to buy more, betting on CEO Fabrizio Freda to deliver. Jim said buy EL and we added more shares to the Trust . Emerson Electric (EMR): The automation-focused industrial needs another quality quarter to shake off the overhang created by its initially hostile takeover of National Instruments (NATI). In the absence of that, Jim said we may bid adieu to Emerson. Ford (F): CEO Jim Farley did a fantastic job delivering in the automaker's latest quarter, and we like his decision to scale back Ford's business in China . The impact of Tesla's price wars on the overall electric-vehicle market remains to be seen, but it's a wrinkle we didn't see coming. Foot Locker (FL): We have low expectations for the sneaker retailer's earnings report Friday. It's still early into CEO Mary Dillon's tenure, though, and we maintain our optimism in her turnaround strategy. We'll look to add to our position, currently just a 1.5% weighting, on future weakness in the stock. GE Healthcare (GEHC): The medical imaging and diagnostics company joined our portfolio Wednesday . Jim said it was coming on the Monthly Meeting. Recently spun-out from General Electric (GE), we see an industry leader that's now better positioned to accelerate growth. Alphabet (GOOGL): We pared back our exposure in Google's parent company in early May, locking in big profits in the portfolio-management move. But Jim said he's optimistic about Alphabet's ability to serve as an AI-focused consulting firm of sorts for other companies, like it recently did with fast-food chain Wendy's (WEN). Halliburton (HAL): A steep drop in oil prices recently has dragged Halliburton down, too, prompting some investors to question whether a multiyear cycle of increased drilling investments is still in the cards. But the Biden administration refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and more visibility around economic growth would help oil prices pick back up. Honeywell (HON): The upcoming CEO transition, with the retiring Darius Adamczyk set to be replaced by COO Vimal Kapur on June 1, has seemingly kept a lid on the stock recently. However, that gave us a chance to upgrade the stock to a buy-it-here 1 rating Monday. Its exposure to aerospace and clean energy allow us to be patient. Humana (HUM): The health insurer Medicare Advantage offering is much-improved, leading the company to revise its membership estimates higher multiple times since the fall. It's also the kind of defensive stock that should be relatively resilient in any bad-news scenarios with the debt-ceiling fight in Washington. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Separating its consumer products division from its pharmaceutical and medical technology units was a good move for shareholders . But the ongoing talc lawsuit fight has been bad. A favorable resolution to the latest proposed settlement would bring the focus back to the fundamentals and unlock the stock. Linde (LIN): The well-run industrial gas giant is off its all-time highs, reached earlier in May, but the multiyear outlook for Linde remains very strong. Linde benefits from green hydrogen trends, as well as expanding semiconductor manufacturing. Eli Lilly (LLY): Eli Lilly's drug pipeline in diabetes and weight loss, as well as Alzheimer's is stellar, and why we believe it's the best large-cap pharmaceutical company out there. We're letting the stock ride for now, up 33% over the past three months, but acknowledge that we may have to book profits. Meta Platforms (META): The Facebook and Instagram parent has wisely used artificial intelligence to improve advertising efficiency on its platforms, and to boost engagement with short-form video feature Reels. Meta's ""year of efficiency"" is working, and Jim said the metaverse thankfully looks like an after-thought right now. Morgan Stanley (MS): It's been a turbulent time for financial stocks since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March and some others, but we continue to like Morgan Stanley's asset and wealth management pivot. If the sector comes back in favor, Jim said he expects the stock to climb to $90 per share from its current levels around $83 each. Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft has been riding the artificial intelligence boom that began late last year after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The tech titan, a key investor and partner with OpenAI, has rolled out a number of encouraging new AI-enabled features to its software. Nvidia (NVDA): Nvidia has become another ""own it, don't trade it"" stock. Its graphics chips are at the heart of the AI cycle. Jim said it's admittedly hard to know when Nvidia shares, up 105% year to date, may take a breather. Palo Alto Networks (PANW): CEO Nikesh Arora has done a great job turning Palo Alto Networks into a profitable, diversified cybersecurity company with scale as the industry consolidates. Despite the stock's recent weakness, it remains above our cost basis of $177.68, and we are hesitant to violate that. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD): Jim said he wants to buy more Pioneer, which will hand the reins to current President and COO Rich Dealy after year-end. Higher oil prices would certainly be a boon for Pioneer's stock price, but the company's high-quality assets in the Permian Basin are attractive on their own. Procter & Gamble (PG): Jim said P & G is primed for another strong move higher, similar to its advance that took it from the mid $130s per share to around $155 on Wednesday. If it slips back to around $150, Jim said he thinks P & G would be a buy. Starbucks (SBUX): Laxman Narasimhan, who took over as CEO in March, deserves time to settle into the job, especially given the difficult Covid reopening environment in China. Middle-class consumers in China may be pulling back on some spending, but we think the coffee chain's bet on the country, already its second-largest sales market, is the right one over time. Constellation Brands (STZ): The situation at Constellation has become a bit of a mixed bag, Jim said, with Modelo's growth remaining impressive while Corona has cooled a bit. However, we like owning the company, particularly due to its cash flow prowess. TJX Companies (TJX): The off-price retailer, which reported solid earnings Wednesday morning, is a buy here, Jim stressed. We expect solid results in the second half of the year. Wells Fargo (WFC): Wells Fargo is a buy, after it agreed to a settlement Tuesday to resolve another legal matter from it scandal-ridden past under previous managers. Its future looks brighter each time another regulatory hurdle is put in the rearview mirror, even though the Federal Reserve-mandated asset cap is still in place. Wynn Resorts (WYNN): Shares of the casino operator jumped 7% to roughly $110 each Wednesday after Barclays upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy, from hold, with a $135 price target. With Wynn's properties in both the U.S. and Macao humming, Jim said he'd consider using weakness in the stock to add to our small position.

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:24:00","The last few days the sunrises and sunsets here in Michigan have been fabulous. It looks like these dawn and dusk delights are going to continue off and on for quite some time.  The reason for the orange and red sunrises and sunsets is a lot of smoke in the sky drifting across North America. Western Canada has numerous wildfires going right now. These fires are actually producing a lot of smoke. You might think smoke in western Canada can’t make it to the skies over Michigan. The smoke easily makes it into our sky in just a couple of days. The fires are a few thousand miles away. The upper-air flow averages 100 mph. In 24 hours, the air can move 2400 miles. Western Canadian air can be over Michigan in just a day or two depending on the upper-level winds.  Smoke in British Columbia and Alberta shows up as faint, wispy white on the latest satellite images.  Why are the sunrises and sunsets orange and red? Sunlight is made up of all of the light colors. Remember a rainbow’s colors are the sunlight colors separated for us. The colors of a rainbow can be remembered by the name ROY G. BIV - Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet. Notice how the colors of a rainbow are grouped. The red, orange and yellow have long wavelengths. The green, blue, indigo and violet have shorter wavelengths.  The smoke particles are blocking some of the light coming from the sun. The colors that are blocked more easily are the short wavelength light colors of the blues and purples. This leaves us with a sunrise or sunset with red, orange and yellow colors.  Satellite shows the fires and smoke in western Canada on May 16, 2023  So will smoke be in our sky everyday? No. The smoke will come at us in waves. Storm systems and rainfall will do a good job of dragging the smoke down to the ground. After a storm system we may have a day or two of blue skies. The smoke will then build up again since westerly winds are the most common upper-air flow.  Until the fires go out, we will continue to have beautiful smoky sunrises and sunsets. There will also be some downsides to smoky skies. The daily forecast could be a little tougher. When a blob of this smoke moves over Michigan we almost get a cloudy sky. The smoke can actually lower the afternoon temperature by five degrees. Of course the smoke is pollution and can give us poor air quality more often.  Find a couple of lawn chairs and be ready for sunrise and sunset watching.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvb24tZmlyZS1zdW5yaXNlcy1hbmQtc3Vuc2V0cy1hcmUtaGVyZS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9vbi1maXJlLXN1bnJpc2VzLWFuZC1zdW5zZXRzLWFyZS1oZXJlLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Montgomery"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:01:00","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - After a long 22 weeks, 17 new firefighters graduated from what Montgomery city officials call the toughest fire training in the country.  “Firefighting is a demanding profession that requires a lot of sacrifices,” said Fire Chief Miford Jordan.  “You are not just becoming a part of something. You are becoming a part of the thing,” said Chief of Staff Chip Hill.  For 22 weeks, strenuous training prepared them for what can often become unthinkable.  “Sunday night, and Monday morning, what hit me and what I hope will hit you is how fast life could change,” said Hill.  The fire at a home on Gilmer Avenue was a tragic real-world lesson for the new firefighters. Two people were killed, and five firefighters were injured.  Keynote speaker Christian Dealba says the house fire was something firefighters see all the time.  “Firefighter Hartman has six years on the job here and was dragged out of the house fire unconscious and lifeless,” said Dealba.  “Captain Crenshaw also has been here for 22 years and has 3rd-degree burns from his shoulders to his hands he was also transported to UAB. His firefighter gloves were burned completely to his hands,” said Deabla.  Dealba says these firefighters will make a full recovery because of the extensive training they have received, having the best equipment possible thanks to city leadership, and with the help of the Montgomery police Department who also responded that night.  Graduates say they are now officially part of a new team, but they all rely on the teams that they have at home.  “The academy is physically and mentally challenging during the day, but at night time, you have many of the tasks you have to accomplish and couldn’t do it without the support of my family, my kids, and my wife,” said graduate Evan Quaco.

Ann Arbor fire crews were called to the 1200 block of Heather Way around 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, for a fire in an exterior wall of a home. When officers arrived, they found smoke in the residence and an active fire in an outside wall.  Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire. There were no injuries.  Although crews were initially confused at the placement of the fire, the department said on social media, video from a neighbor’s exterior camera showed contractors using a blowtorch to kill weeds along the house.  “It should go without saying that using a blow-torch to kill weeds next to a structure is an incredibly poor decision,” wrote the fire department on social media. “It was very fortunate the residence did not suffer greater damage, and there were no injuries.”  The Ann Arbor Fire Department was assisted by crews from Dexter Area Fire Department and Pittsfield, Scio and Ann Arbor townships.

"fire","2023-05-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:38:19","DARTMOUTH — Investigators believe that someone intentionally set fire to the Hawthorne Country Club building.  The Massachusetts Fire Marshal had been investigating after a fire destroyed the property’s clubhouse on May 7.  “Investigators believe this fire was intentionally set,” said Department of Fire Services Spokesperson Jake Wark in an email to The Light on Thursday.  Related  Wark added that it’s their policy not to release details on how suspicious fires begin, so he wasn’t able to provide more information about the country club fire. “This is to ensure that statements from witnesses and others aren’t influenced by facts or evidence they obtained from media coverage,” he said.  The agency is still seeking tips from witnesses. They can contact investigators directly at 978-567-3310 or through the Arson Watch Reward Program’s tip line, which offers rewards of up to $5,000 for information that helps detect or prevent arson crimes, at 1-800-682-9229.  No criminal charges have been brought as of Thursday afternoon, Wark said.  The country club at 970 Tucker Road in Dartmouth had been vacant since it closed in 2016. Recently, the family of fishing mogul Carlos Rafael acquired the property and entered an agreement to sell it to Toll Brothers, a national luxury home builder, for $3 million. But the deal hadn’t closed yet when the fire happened, and it’s not clear if the fire has had any effect on the agreement. Toll Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  Rafael has served time in federal custody for mislabeling fish and falsifying records. His son-in-law, realtor and contractor Jeff Hathaway, spoke to news outlets about Toll Brothers’ plans to turn the property into condos for seniors after the deal was first announced last month. Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  When investigators try to determine the cause of a fire, they look for the point of origin — usually the area with the most damage, Wark said. From there, investigators look for evidence of potential causes.  “Depending on the extent of damage, this may be easy, arduous, or impossible — and it can sometimes be ascertained only with heavy equipment and careful delayering,” Wark, the fire marshal spokesperson, said in an email.  The fire marshal has a dozen K-9s that can detect accelerants, and investigators may test samples from places where the dogs think they found something. Investigators also use witness accounts and video.  Wark did not provide any information on what specific evidence led investigators to rule the country club fire as a possible arson, but he said investigators hope to hear from anyone who has information on the fire.

This state-of-the-art facility, set to be a highly versatile training simulation platform, will provide firefighter and EMS students with a realistic training environment for various rescue scenarios.  “The Ohio Fire Academy has always been a nationally-recognized leader in firefighter training,” said Governor Mike DeWine. “We recognize the importance of providing our first responders with the most relevant and safe training resources. This new search and rescue house will ensure that our firefighters receive top-notch training on realistic simulation props, further enhancing their skills and safety.”  The two-story structure, spanning approximately 1500 square feet, will be a wood-framed, residential-style training building/home. It will feature removable systems designed specifically for forcible entry and search training, enhancing the authenticity of the training experience. The structure will be used for Fire and EMS classes, offering comprehensive training opportunities for aspiring firefighters and emergency medical personnel.  Electric utilities will be incorporated into the structure to facilitate lighting, emergencies, and training purposes.

ORIGINAL REPORT: 1 Marathon Petroleum employee dies in Texas City refinery fire, company says  Texas City police added that no shelter in place was needed and there was no threat to the community, but air monitoring was conducted as a precaution.

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Porto"", ""Norte"", ""Portugal""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:31:58","PORTO, Portugal – The opening morning of the Eighth International Wildland Fire Conference featured a range of civil leaders, fire managers, and scientific experts who helped circle the delegates around the dilemma of wildland fire: it is the problem and also (sometimes, but not always) the problem’s solution.  How a problem can be its own solution – the fire conundrum – is part of what drew some 1600 delegates from 90 countries to Porto, Portugal in mid-May.  The week-long conference included technical field trips on May 15 and the official opening May 16, followed by a keynote session labeled simply “The Problem.”  The opening included a videotaped welcome from António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, who cautioned that “We must keep global warming below 1.5 C” and if we’re to do so, he said, we must energize fire management that includes all voices, including indigenous leaders and communities. (And even though we must act to limit climate change, a UN World Meteorological Organization report this week has forecast a 66 percent chance we’ll reach the 1.5°C increase for a year during the next five years.)  The conference chair, Tiago Oliveira, board chairman of Portugal’s wildfire service Agency for Integrated Rural Fire Management (AGIF), opened with guidance: “We need to take out the emotional side of fire and replace it with the rational management of fire.” Yet he also reminded attendees of the emotional reality of wildland fire. “I am a survivor as many of you are and we are here to build a better future. To ask for help as I did in 2017” – when Portugal endured a storm of fires that killed 120 citizens and firefighters. An article in Scientific Reports suggests that the extreme fire season of 2017 may have been a prelude to future conditions and likewise events that are triggered by climate change effects. The immensity and challenge of these fires also led to the creation of AGIF.  “Every day that we are managing fires we are learning,” Oliveira continued. “We come here to build friendships in fire. The more friends we have in the world of forest fires the more successful we will be. And the world needs our contributions. The world needs less bad fire and more good fire.”  Gordy Sachs, chief of All Hazard and International Fire Support for the U.S. Forest Service and chair of the International Liaison Committee that planned the conference, reiterated the conference’s value globally. Statements from prior conferences [held every four years] influenced Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on climate, and the 2023 Conference will launch a key transition tool for international cooperation – the Landscape Fire Governance Framework – and will, like prior conferences, make each country and the world safer and more resilient.  Most of the opening, as is typical of international gatherings, offered the sort of civil and governance support that is key to implementing new frameworks. So it was heartening (if also disheartening) to learn from Antonia Cunha, president of Portugal’s North Regional Coordination and Development Commission, that he’s aware and concerned that 26 percent of carbon emissions in 2022 in the region was from forest fires.  Likewise, a commitment from Juan Cabandié, Environment Minister of Argentina, highlighted that his country needs to be more directed at planning and prevention. “We’re the eighth largest country in the world and 70 percent of our land at risk of wildfires,” he said. And to support its goals, Argentina has started its first monitoring system for entire country.  Duarte Cordeira, with Portugal’s Ministry of Environment, also returned the delegates to community. “We know that the best fire management is by the community members.

Christian Thomas Dahm, 45, faces one felony count of starting negligent fire that caused great bodily harm. He remained jailed Thursday.  The fire broke out at the fourplex about 11:30 p.m. Sunday in the 2600 block of Aspen Court off Glen Oaks Avenue and County Road D.  According to the criminal complaint, when responders got on scene, a townhome unit was fully engulfed in flames, which were spreading to adjoining units. Dahm’s father pointed at Dahm, who was on the back patio, and said, “He started the fire.”  Firefighters located Dahm’s mother inside her townhome unit. She had a pulse, but was struggling to breathe, and had slight burns. She was transported to Regions Hospital in critical condition.  Dahm told police he was in the garage working on his fishing pole over a car hood before the fire started. He said he was using an oil pan and lit a cigarette with a torch and then “all of a sudden, there was a fire,” the complaint states.  Meanwhile, Dahm’s father said he and his wife decided to check on their son before going to bed because they were concerned because they believed he was high on methamphetamine.  He said when he opened the service door to the garage, it appeared as though “everything exploded.” He saw his son run out of the garage.  A neighbor told police that she saw Dahm and his father pull into their driveway before the fire and that Dahm was “cursing and swearing” and making loud noises in the garage.  The fire spread from one townhome to another, where KARE 11 anchor Rena Sarigianopoulos’ parents live, and she wrote on GoFundMe that their home was destroyed.  Dahm’s mother remained in the burn unit at Regions Hospital on Tuesday, the complaint said. She was on a ventilator.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","1998-11-17","Not Discerned","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:14:16","Frank Klopas is Chicago soccer.  His teammates from the Fire’s Double-winning inaugural year of 1998 know it better than anyone. “We used to call Frankie ‘the Mayor,’” said Jesse Marsch, back then a young journeyman midfielder with a serious competitive streak. “We’d see the actual Mayor [Daley] in the airport and his whole entourage would come over and make sure they said hello to him [Klopas].  Born in Prosymna in Greece in 1966, Klopas made his mark on the city’s soccer scene long before MLS came to town. He emigrated to Chicago, won a championship with Mather High School, and signed straight up for the Chicago Sting’s final outdoor season before the original NASL folded – and then played several seasons for the Sting’s indoor team (MISL).    When the Fire launched as an expansion team in 1998, it was a no-brainer to bring Klopas – then in his early 30s – back home to help lead the city’s team in the emergent new professional top flight (MLS).  “It was near the end of my career,” said Klopas, who played in Greece with AEK and in the U.S. National Team in the lean years of American professional soccer between the old NASL folding (1984) and MLS emerging in 1996. “I was so grateful for the chance to go back and finish my career where it all started.  “It was so special to be able to play my last few years in front of my family and in my hometown – and also to have soccer back in the city.” he said about his return after two years with the Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City).  Made for the Big Moments  Klopas was built for the big occasions. He was an eager striker with a near-liquid stride and a keen eye for goal before injuries took their toll. His Chicago homecoming, in what were his autumn years, could have ended as a sentimental swansong – a simple and empty gesture. Instead, he etched his name again into the lore of the city’s soccer by scoring the golden goal, deep in extra-time against the Columbus Crew, that saw the Fire finish that first season with a rare League and Cup Double.    In addition to the unforgettable winner at Soldier Field, he also scored the first goal of that 1998 Cup run. It came at a very different venue in the city, Forest View Park in Arlington Heights, and against the semi-pro Chicago Stingers. “Those games are tough. Not easy at all. Those guys [the Stingers] were ready to go and they were hungry,” Klopas remembered of the game the Fire won 3-1 after trailing in the 85th minute and facing early elimination.  “It came down to little details,” he said of the comeback that began with him sneaking in at the near post and nabbing the equalizer. “In the end it’s down to us making a couple plays. And the rest is history.”  Klopas is quick to deflect attention away from himself and point out the true secret behind that famous 1998 team. “Some of our training sessions were harder than the games,” he said of the spirit a then-young Bob Bradley fostered in a squad that had a core of young Americans like Marsch and Josh Wolff – and a raft of eastern-europeans led by captain Piotr Nowak, Lubos Kubik and Jerzy Podbrozny.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1oZXJvcy1yZXR1cm4tZm9yLWN1cC13aW5uZXIta2xvcGFzLXRoZS1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-01","20:00:00","{""Gatineau"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:41:15","HULL − The state has said it will not count nearly 100 ballots cast between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday and has called into question the validity of the entire town election after a large house fire prevented potential voters from accessing the polls.  The six-alarm fire blocked traffic to Hull High School, the town's only polling place, for an hour and a half. The road reopened at 7 p.m. Monday, an hour before polls were initially set to close.  Hull officials made the last-minute decision to extend voting by two hours to accommodate those who wished to vote, and retroactively asked Plymouth County Superior Court to authorize the extension and permit the counting of ballots cast during that time.  On Wednesday night, the town was told the votes would not be counted and ""the court's decision also calls into question the validity of the election due to the unfortunate disruption of the voting,"" the clerk's website reads. ""The town is reviewing the decision and determining the next steps.""  The last frontier?Weymouth, Quincy struggle with slow redevelopment on Route 3A  More:The tide finally might be turning for one of Hull's last undeveloped waterfront lots  According to Hull Town Clerk Lori West's petition to the court, she and town attorney James Lampke consulted with the elections division at the secretary of state's office before they decided to keep the polls open for two hours beyond the scheduled closing time. Efforts to reach a judge for an emergency order afterhours on Monday were unsuccessful, the petition says.  The town told residents about the extension using an emergency phone system some residents were signed up for, as well as robocalls, social media and Hull Community Cable. West said the candidates, most of whom were at the polls throughout the day, were notified of the decision and were “receptive and understanding.”  ""Everyone involved in the process stepped up to the plate to do the right thing and make the best of an unusual situation,"" Lampke said.  West's petition says “80 or so votes” were cast between 8 and 10 p.m., enough to swing at least one race on the ballot.  ""Until the election results are finalized and certified by the town clerk, she cannot administer the oath of office to some of the candidates where the race was too close to call,” the petition reads.  Court calls for new election to count votes of 'disenfranchised' residents  The court decision by Judge Brian Glenny cites several reasons for calling the town election invalid.  He said there was no way to ensure that the town's efforts to broadcast the information reached every citizen who intended to vote. He also said police officers managing traffic around the fire did not know immediately that the polling hours were being extended. Those officers told people they were not be able to vote, and there is no way to know if those people found out later they could return to the polls.  ""There exists a very real likelihood that citizens were disenfranchised during the May 15, 2023, town election,"" Glenny wrote. ""In the view of the court, a new election is the only just remedy for the unfortunate circumstances.""  Rollins accused of leaking Quincy bridge inquiry: 'Don't say I never gave you anything'  Winter Street: Nonprofit proposes 34-unit building for 'extremely low-income' residents in Quincy  Fewer than 100 votes could swing Hull election  Candidates sought 18 seats on 13 different Hull boards and committees in Monday's election, but it appears only one was close enough to be swung by a difference of 80 to 100 votes.  In a race for a seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority board, Patrick Finn holds a 15-vote lead over Daniel Kernan. Another seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority was won handily by Adrienne Paquinn.  Tied closely to the results of the race is the fate of a 12.5-acre parcel of undeveloped land between a Weir River Estuary bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The land is one of the last parcels of open beachfront in Hull and has been the subject of several failed ideas over the years.  There is agreement among residents and the redevelopment authority that the land has untapped potential, but reaching consensus on exactly what and what not to do with it has proved more challenging.  The Hull Redevelopment Authority has most recently solicited input from residents on its plan to built 117 residential units, a 65-room hotel and retail space that adds up to 181,700 square feet of new buildings. Under the current draft, 68% of the property would remain open space.  Finn has expressed stronger support for the commercial development of the property than his opponent. Kernan supports an alternative plan that would emphasize developed open space, as does Paquinn.  This is a developing story. Please check PatriotLedger.com for the latest updates.

Zoraida Diaz, who's Afro-Latina, started the position last month after serving nearly two decades in the Oakland Fire Department.  Only about 6% of fire chiefs are women across the country. Diaz says when she started out it was never her goal to become a Fire Chief, but her passion for helping people led her to her purpose in fire service.  ""This is my dad. I have to acknowledge him because my dad, when I was going through the academy, he was with me for six and a half months. He would prepare meals for me to make sure that I was healthy the whole time that I was in the academy,"" said Diaz.  It’s been 19 years since Zoraida Diaz joined Oakland’s Fire Dept. On April 28th, she was publicly recognized as Chief of the Fremont Fire Dept. becoming its first woman and Afro-Latina to serve as Chief.  ""For me, I’ve always been driven. So, no one is going to stop me from being successful, is how I looked at it. Really, I was able to get the respect because I had the credibility of working every position but also who I was when I started in the academy, is who I’ve always been,"" Diaz said.  Fifty-five-year-old Diaz was born and raised in Harlem, NY with her siblings to Puerto Rican parents. After earning a master's degree, she worked as a social worker for over a decade and left New York to eventually settle in Hayward. Soon after, a friend from Oakland’s Fire Dept. introduced her to fire service.  ""Being a former athlete, I just looked at the teamwork and the camaraderie in that exercise, and I was like wow this looks like something I can do,"" Diaz said.  Diaz served as Deputy Chief for two years in Fremont before becoming Fire Chief. She now manages over 150 people and plans to hire a 14th company or fire crew, to expand the Dept.  ""We’re all engaged in doing research or identifying best practices on how we can better serve the community of Fremont,"" Diaz said.  After nearly two decades of service, Diaz says she’ll retire in three to four years to spend time with her family and travel with her fiancée Paula.  ""I weighed 115 lbs. I knew nothing about mechanical aptitude. I knew about the fire service. I was a social worker for 15 years, and I was 36-years old. So, I say to anyone who’s interested in pursuing a career in the fire service, that if I can do it, so can you,"" Diaz said.  Right now, there are six women serving as firefighters here in Fremont. Diaz says she also plans to hire three Division Chiefs and a Fire Marshall in the next 18 months.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eS1vZi1mcmVtb250LWFwcG9pbnRzLTFzdC13b21hbi1hbmQtYWZyby1sYXRpbmEtZmlyZS1jaGllZtIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eS1vZi1mcmVtb250LWFwcG9pbnRzLTFzdC13b21hbi1hbmQtYWZyby1sYXRpbmEtZmlyZS1jaGllZi5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fires that broke out in Lynn on May 12, May 13 and May 17 are being looked at by investigators with the Lynn Fire Department and the Massachusetts State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the state fire marshal’s office as “suspicious,” according to a joint statement from Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation and Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey.  Celino noted that red flag conditions – high winds, low humidity and very dry vegetation – leave the possibility for wildfires to happen.  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” Celino said in the statement. “Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  With the help of mutual aid partners, these fires were taken care of without any serious injuries or property damage to the area, Sullivan added.

They ask that anyone “who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods on these dates or has other information on the fires” to call the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or call the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225.

The department is teaming with Park and Rec to also bring a park and art space on this piece of land.  “We’re just trying to do things a little smarter,” said Fire Chief Tracy McMillion. “So it’d be a fire station, having a park there and also being a cultural hub of artwork and coolness all in one particular space.”  It’s not just about the green space, as more are built in the southeast part of the city – Chief McMillion tells NBC2 Fort Myers fire is trying to keep up with quick response times.  There are eight fire stations spread throughout the city; Most can get to a home or incident within 11 minutes.  For this part of Ward 6, response times jump to 12-15 minutes in neighborhoods like Marina Bay, Plantation Gardens, Arborwood, Legacy at Gateway, and others.  “We’re seeing a lot more call volume in certain areas that used to not have that,” said McMillion. “And that’s what we’re doing we’re trying to look for a fire, an emergency saturation, and so basically if one station goes out, we want to have the ability for another station to back them up with just a little greater time.”  The city would still need to purchase the land for more than a million dollars, which already sits in front of Fort Myers’ East Water Tank.

The fire reached four alarms at its peak, with 26 fire units from 14 towns responding.

Regulators had originally sought to fine the utility $155 million for two regulatory violations blamed in the fire that left four dead and destroyed more than 200 homes in Shasta and Tehama counties. The deal, as approved, will impose a $10 million fine and then specify that the $140 million balance be paid by shareholders to bolster record keeping and vegetation management in high fire risk areas.

Sign up for NBC Bay Area’s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.  CPUC Regulators alleged the tree that leaned onto the line, triggering the fire, had been earmarked for removal but wasn’t removed due to PG&E’s poor recordkeeping.  PG&E disputed that interpretation and challenged the regulatory findings. The settlement does not resolve the dispute, but does require PG&E to better track trees to ensure those marked for removal are identified by a signed and dated record that includes precise geographic data. The $140 million settlement will also pay for more training, improved data management and investments in local fire safety councils and other fire education efforts.  In a statement, PG&E says it’s “a different company today” under CEO Patti Poppe, and outlined various initiatives during her tenure, including reconfiguring its equipment and a ten year plan to underground 10,000 miles of its power lines. The company says it is “working tirelessly to make our system safer every day.”  As for the specifics surrounding the fire, PG&E says it has accepted Cal Fire’s finding that a tree which fell onto its power line was the cause of the Zogg fire, and has resolved many of the civil claims.  “This settlement agreement allows us to continue focusing our time, resources and efforts to continue to make our system safer now, rather than on a hearing related to events several years ago,” the utility said. “Our objective is to focus on continuing to make things better for our communities.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The webinar series is expected to bring visibility to the research community in fire safety engineering and to promote much needed interactions between fire safety engineers, fire ecologists, atmospheric scientists, geographical scientists and beyond. Comprised of 31 videos, the series offers a 15-week, 3-hours-per-week format, and provides a basis for an educational course on wildland fires in an academic engineering program. The webinars address such topics as fire behavior, fire ecology, weather and atmospheric science, fuel ignition, flame spread, fire emissions, mitigation measures, and other topics.  The new wildland webinar series represents a community-level effort, featuring a diverse group of leading experts on wildland and wildland-urban-interface fires. The webinar videos feature 29 instructors, mostly from the U.S., Australia, and Europe.  “The problems posed by wildland fires and wildland-urban-interface (WUI) fires are at the interface between separate scientific communities, [including] fire safety engineers, fire ecologists and atmospheric scientists, and there is a need to share information and knowledge between these communities so that we can better coordinate efforts and collectively develop solutions to mitigate the negative impact of wildland/WUI fires on the human, ecological and climate systems,” said Arnaud Trouvé, Chair of the IFSC and Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland.

"fire","2023-05-04","Not Discerned","{""Fayetteville"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:16:43","[Episcopal News Service] A lightning strike – that actuarial “act of God,” as junior warden Mark Hamilton puts it – brought together the congregation of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Southern Pines, North Carolina, in a most unexpected way this year.  The storm damage wasn’t as remarkable as what it required of parishioners: When the lightning knocked out the church’s fire alarm system on Jan. 4, leaders at Emmanuel and the school on church grounds quickly mobilized a human fire watch, a rotation of more than 50 volunteers. They maintained 24-hour-a-day protection of the facilities from fire, a human alternative to the automated alarm system, while the old system was replaced.  “You never realize how thankful you are for what you take for granted until you lose it,” Hamilton told Episcopal News Service.  “We thought that might be a couple weeks, maybe three weeks,” Jill Connett, head of school at Episcopal Day School, said. Instead, repairs dragged on, and the human fire watch lasted nearly four months. “When this hit, I will tell you, it brought the church and school community together a little more.”  Now, the church and school are celebrating the end of the fire watch. Fire marshals certified that the newly installed replacement fire protection system was operational on May 4. A party for fire watch volunteers is planned for later this month, with matching T-shirts in the works.  “Some people said they’re going to kind of miss it, the form of exercise, the form of fellowship,” Hamilton said. But he made sure to add an obvious caveat: “I don’t think we’d want to do it forever.”  A fire watch works exactly like you might imagine. For each hourlong shift, at least one volunteer had to stroll the entire church campus and its six buildings. They span more than four acres across one city block in this central North Carolina community, about a 40-mile drive west of Fayetteville. It usually took volunteers about a half hour to complete one circuit, so twice an hour they would look in every room of each building, checking for signs of smoke or fire. And “if you did detect fire, your job is to call the fire department,” Hamilton said.  The initial emergency happened around 6 a.m. Jan. 4, when the lightning struck somewhere on the church campus. “I happened to be at the church when it hit, and it sounded like a bomb went off,” Hamilton said.  The power stayed on, but Connett reported that internet service in the school was down and the fire alarm system was beeping. The church founded the now-independent school in 1963, and the church and the school still share an interconnected fire alarm system.  Within a day or two of investigating the problem, the church’s fire security firm informed leaders that the old system couldn’t be fixed and had to be replaced. The fire marshal further informed them that, without an automated system, the church would have to form a fire watch to rely on human eyes, or else face closure because of the exposure to potential harm and property damage.  Under the emergency plan developed by Connett and the church’s wardens, the fire watch began on Jan. 6, with a logbook for each shift proving that volunteers were doing the checks required by the fire marshal. The school took responsibility for overnight coverage, largely with hired contractors, while the church recruited the volunteers who would walk the grounds during the day. Some school board members also took some shifts, and Connett covered nights when no one else was available.  “It almost became like a second job,” Connett said, describing how she and Hamilton coordinated shifts on a spreadsheet. “It’s been quite an ordeal.”  Because of the fire watch, no church services were cancelled, and no days of school were missed. The upgrades to the fire protection system cost more than $100,000, including hiring people to take overnight fire watch shifts, though all of that is expected to be covered by the church’s insurance policy.  Frank Holt, a vestry member who volunteered for fire watch shifts, told ENS he and others took the fire watch responsibility in stride. “It’s good exercise,” he said. “You can put in some miles.”  A few others brought their dogs with them. “We had some really great volunteer folks who really stepped up,” Hamilton said. And when the fire marshals came May 4 and said they could end the fire watch, it “was a great day.”  Connett agreed. “If you had seen my face,” she said, “it was like a huge weight was lifted.”  “What we kind of developed was a bit of a new community,” Hamilton said, a community of fire watch volunteers. “I think that was one of the benefits, one of the silver linings to this.”  After the fire system was restored, Connett spoke during the congregation’s annual day school Sunday service on May 7. Her message: “There are blessings that can come out of any circumstance.”  And the logbook? It got pretty thick after 17 weeks of fire watch shifts, but Hamilton sees no sentimental value in keeping it. He’s thinking of having it unceremoniously – and safely – burned.  – David Paulsen is a senior reporter and editor for Episcopal News Service.

The fire got out of hand in the remote area between the Whistle Stop Trail in West Farmington and the Irving Big Stop on Wilton Road, also known as U.S. Route 2 and state Route 4.  Forest rangers, with the help of the Farmington Police Department, found the person responsible. The transient who was not identified was issued a court summons on Wednesday for a civil violation of having a fire on the land of another without permission, Nelson said.  The summons has not yet been filed in the District Court. It will go to the District Attorney’s Office first. Without a name, which Nelson declined to reveal, it is difficult to know who the transient is. The person’s court date in a Franklin County court will be in August.  “We think it is important that (the community) know there is not a wildfire arsonist, as far as we know,” Nelson said.  It was made clear to the person not to set any more fires, he said. If more are set, the alleged firestarter could face criminal charges.  Advertisement  The state is in a precarious position for wildfires until more rain falls, Nelson said. Maine has had about 300 fires statewide, which is about half of the annual average, and it is only May.  “We will continue to patrol the area to check for illegal fires,” Nelson said.  The fire drew 45 firefighters from several departments. Tim “T.D.” Hardy, Farmington Fire Rescue chief, spotted smoke rising from the woods while he was at Aubuchon Hardware store on Wilton Road.  Firefighters had to make their own trail to get to the fire because there was no way in. They couldn’t get trucks to the scene and used utility terrain vehicles, hand tools and backpacks with water and pumps to put the fire out. Farmington and Kingfield Fire Rescue utility task vehicles, known as UTVs, are equipped with tanks and pumps.  As of Thursday, there had been at least six woods or brush fires this week in Franklin County.

The fire started in the garage early on Mother’s Day.  A heat lamp being used to keep some chicks warm likely caused the fire.  “Opened up our back bedroom door and it was glowing orange,” Stephanie Oswald said.  She and her husband Ryan say you become grateful for what you do have – for the lives saved.  Stephanie’s mother was staying with them for Mother’s Day.  “She was in this back bedroom that went first, so she was about six inches from this back wall,” Stephanie said.  By the time everyone got out, the fire was raging – fueled by strong winds.  “There was already about ten-foot flames over the garage,” she said.  “Just the heat from that blowing wind, it was like a blow furnace,” Ryann explained.  The said nearby flood zones also slowed down the response from firefighters. Two of the three roads that lead to their home remain closed, but most of what they lost can be replaced.  “After we got family and pets out, we moved our vehicles out of the way and then we just literally watched it burn,” Stephanie said.  Now they, along with their two kids and five pets, are all staying in an area hotel. It’s tough but they said people are making it more bearable.  “You really find out who your friends are and we have got so many friends that we, we had no idea how cared for we could be,” Ryan said  After losing so much they’re seeing just how many people have their backs and it’s giving them some new perspective.  Stephanie said, “It absolutely does. I find my whole demeanor different. It’s a very humbling experience.”  The Oswalds say firefighters worked hard to keep the flames from reaching their next-door neighbor’s home.  They’re still working through insurance to see what will be covered. A family member has set up a fundraising page for them.

"fire","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Swansboro"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:00:00","“Prior to the King Fire we’d had discussions about fire drills but after how we were affected we knew we had to act.” — Taffy Warner, Mosquito fire drill organizer  The Mosquito Fire Protection District is working to keep Swansboro and Mosquito fire ready by holding a community fire drill Saturday, 10-11:30 a.m.  For the third year in a row Mosquito Fire personnel and community volunteers will coordinate the drill at the Swansboro Airport. Firefighters, aided by support group members, will simulate the staging and set up of the airfield evacuation site.  In case of an actual emergency the airfield site is a holdout position where community members will gather if the region’s two main access roads — Rock Creek Road and Mosquito Road — are blocked during a fire. Residents are encouraged to participate in the drill; in addition to an evacuation site for people, there will also be a simulated evac site for large animals and RVs.  Mosquito’s unique geography with limited routes in and out poses a specific challenge if a fire were to come through. Though the limited means of egress has long been known, the King Fire in 2014 made it clear to the community that preparation for a worst-case scenario was vital, according to one of the drill’s organizers, Taffy Warner.  “Prior to the King Fire we’d had discussions about fire drills but after how we were affected we knew we had to act,” Warner explained. “Rock Creek Road was suddenly exclusively for the use of fire personnel and that was a big eye opener for us.”  Mosquito Fire Chief Jack Rosevear shared he thinks the drills are particularly important for fire response as they keep residents and first responders aware of what to do and plan around.  “The biggest priority is bringing information to the community,” Rosevear said. “Information (such as) always having at least two escape routes; we as people often stick to a routine and a certain way, but in an emergency those may suddenly not be an option. Knowing that the airfield is a temporary resource while roads out are blocked, giving MFPD time to help with initial preparation and firefighting before the higher authorities come in, managing that chaos, it’s important. We’re planning ahead for the worst-case scenarios, like if the fire would impact the area directly near the airport itself.”  The Community Emergency Response Team will aid in the drill, setting up road signs and directing the pretend-evacuees. Last year’s drill saw around 50 households participating, not counting the many volunteers, according to Warner, and it is hoped with the weather being cooler this time around more residents will get involved.  Efforts like this fire drill show why Mosquito has the distinction of being designated a Fire Wise USA community. The Fire Wise designation stems from the collective work by MFPD, Sawnsboro Country Property Owners Association, Mosquito Fire Safe Council and residents to reduce fuel loads and keep the area prepared.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS1kcmlsbC1oZWxwcy1tb3NxdWl0by1yZXNpZGVudHMtcHJlcGFyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  HARTFORD, Conn. — Ten adults and five children are displaced in Hartford's South End after police said a man intentionally started a fire inside a third-floor unit. Police have a suspect they're preparing a warrant for but have not identified the man they say started the fire.  Mother of two, Tamarra Ricketts, was doing her best to mask overwhelm Thursday after her first-floor unit was damaged by water and smoke. She was lying in bed with her family when her partner opened the door to find fire.  “It was a fight upstairs so they were fighting upstairs before all of this happened,” she said. “It was still a bunch of commotion, so he opened the door and that’s when he said the building’s on fire—get the kids.”  Most of her belongings inside this first-floor apartment on Wethersfield Avenue were damaged by smoke and water. All of it happened on her daughter Hinata’s 11th birthday.  “I was ok with the accident. But to know that somebody did this intentionally—not thinking about the other lives that lived in this building. It pisses me off.”  The family was gearing up for a backyard birthday celebration but is instead being assisted by the Red Cross, which is providing temporary housing for displaced families. Ricketts doesn’t know what she’ll do after that but says she’s going to celebrate her daughter’s birthday despite losing her home.  “I’m not going to let anything get us down. You know? We have God on our side so that’s all that matters.”  Authorities say the fire originated in a closet and was intentionally started by a man on the third floor.  “It seems like it was an attempt to harm himself or having a mental episode,” said LT Aaron Boisvert.  That man is being treated at the hospital for smoke inhalation.  “The good news is that some of these arsons go unsolved this one will not,"" added Boisvert.  But not all was lost. Twelve hours after families ran to the parking lot in terror, Ricketts found the stray kitten they rescued months ago wheezing under her daughter’s bed.  “Everybody was out alive and safe that was the most important thing. Material things can be replaced.”  Police have not charged the suspect at this time but said an arrest warrant is forthcoming.  The investigation remains active and ongoing. Anyone with any information regarding the case is asked to call the HPD Tip Line at 860-722-TIPS (8477).

New Zealand police started removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where multiple people were killed in Tuesday's fire. (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  Fire and Police investigators inspect inside the Loafers Hostel in Wellington, New Zealand, Thursday, May 18, 2023, following a fire that left several people dead in the early hours of Tuesday May 16. New Zealand police started removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where multiple people were killed in Tuesday's fire. (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police on Friday lowered the confirmed death toll from a Wellington hostel fire from six people to five, although they said they still haven’t finished searching the dangerous four-story building.  And in another development, a man charged with two counts of arson in connection with the fire made his first court appearance. He was not required to enter a plea and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance on June 19.  If found guilty, the man faces a maximum 14 years in prison on the charges. Police said they’re treating the case as a homicide investigation and could add more serious charges later.  Police Inspector Dion Bennett did not offer an explanation for why authorities had downgraded the death toll after they had put it at six since Tuesday, hours after the fire ripped through Loafers Lodge.  But he did say police have still not been able to search all areas of the building after parts of a roof and a floor collapsed in the fire and created piles of debris.  “The scene examination in itself, and in the third floor in particular, is quite dangerous,” Bennett told reporters. “And there are still parts we can’t cross.”  He said that urban search and rescue teams had been working with police to prop up sections of the floor as police inched forward with their examination. He said police have removed four bodies and hoped to remove the fifth soon.  The 48-year-old man charged with setting fire to a couch and to the lodge wore a black hoodie in court, waved his arms about and tried to fire his lawyer, local media reported.  Lawyer Douglas Ewen later told The Associated Press that the man remained his client. The judge granted the man temporary name suppression, a routine practice in the New Zealand legal system.  Police had earlier said there was a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The deadly fire ripped through the building at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or jumped from windows.  Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers, which are not required in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he’d asked his housing minister to investigate current building regulations to see if they need changing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLXdlbGxpbmd0b24taG9zdGVsLWZpcmUtYXJzb24tNjU3ODgxY2U1Mzc5MTlmZWI3OGI2MDllNGUxZTI1MGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Maine Fire Marshal Rich McCarthy and Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien announced the news of the fatality. The person was found on the site around 2:15 p.m. The person's identity was not immediately announced pending the state medical examiner's determination. Federal investigators and York police investigated along with Kittery police, officials said.  “The investigation into the origin and cause of this fire is still under investigation, but at this time we believe all persons involved are accounted for,” McCarthy said.  All of the employees at the Days Inn were accounted for, O’Brien said.  The fire marshal said investigators said they did not know the gender of the deceased person.  O’Brien noted the fire attack on Wednesday was set up on the south side of the Days Inn, a 200-foot-long strip dubbed the “A side” of the building. The body was recovered about halfway down the A side of the building, he said.  “It was definitely in the area of the biggest burn in the building,"" O'Brien said. ""It was the area my firefighters were trying to make an attempt to get to the first three or four minutes of the fire.”  The owners of the building are not being investigated, the fire marshal said. He added that at the time of Thursday’s press conference at the Gorges Road fire station, the Days Inn's owners had yet to be notified of the death.  Fire crews were working Thursday at the site of the 85 Route 1 Bypass structure, which burned to the ground in a blaze that was reported at mid-day Wednesday and not reported under control until just after 6 p.m.  Chief describes Days Inn blaze as 'firefighter's nightmare'  Fire crews attempted to access one room within the Days Inn after receiving a report someone might be trapped inside it. Despite making entry to the building, O’Brien said responders could not make it any closer than two or three rooms near that point, forcing them to retreat and O’Brien making the call for responders to take up a defensive mode.  When firefighters entered the building, they did so without any hand lines to put out the fire.  “The building is wood frame with furniture, lots of material that burned inside that building. It is a firefighter’s nightmare with individual rooms and hallways and everything else,” O’Brien stated. “Trust me when I say that I was extremely hesitant when I sent my firefighters into that building to go make that initial primary search, they went into that building with no protection.”  While there have been past code violations against the Days Inn, the fire chief noted they had been corrected in recent years. The hotel, however, has likely not been inspected in a few years, O’Brien said.

It did not have a sprinkler system.  According to Kittery Town Manager Kendra Amaral, the hotel was built before state building code required sprinkler systems, though all fire alarms in the Days Inn operated soundly at the time of the fire, she said.  “If this was to be reconstructed today, it would have to have sprinklers,” she continued.  Since 1994, the Days Inn property, which town officials noted was last assessed at $1,512,959, has been owned by Kittery Motor Inn Inc. State records list Rohit Patel as the owner.  A proposal to redevelop the property and construct a new hotel had been filed with the town on May 5, less than two weeks ago. The plans, submitted by Kamlesh Patel, called for a new four-story, 107-room hotel to replace the Days Inn, which would have been demolished.  A member of the Patel family declined to speak Wednesday as the Days Inn burned.  Though town officials gave consideration to the idea of demolishing the remainder of the Days Inn, Amaral said that won't happen Thursday. An excavator was brought to the 85 Route 1 Bypass site to move some of the debris, which was smoldering in areas among the rubble, in order to help officials continue their investigation.  While the property will be altered by the excavator, Amaral said, it won’t be a full demolition process.  “That will give the property owner and their insurer their opportunity to investigate the site,” she said.  Kittery manager thanks firefighters  “Firefighters were working throughout the night on the site,"" Amaral said on Thursday. “They have worked tirelessly and safely throughout this entire emergency and we are grateful for the work that they do, for our public safety dispatchers, from the police department and from responding communities.”  In the wake of the death, the Kittery Fire Department will undergo a critical incident stress debriefing.  The death at the Days Inn marks the first fatal fire in Kittery since a mobile home burned about three years ago, O'Brien said.  “I have several young firefighters ... this would be their first fatal fire,” O’Brien said. “We will bring them in. We have a chaplain. We will sit down and go through the debrief and discuss it, and have them understand that things like this happen. They did everything they could. We’ll deal with that. We offer counseling. We have to wake up every morning and do our job.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYWNvYXN0b25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvb25lLWZvdW5kLWRlYWQtZGF5cy1pbm4tZmlyZS1raXR0ZXJ5LW1lLXJvdXRlLTEtYnlwYXNzLzcwMjMxNDg5MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WFIE) - A man was arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out at the old Pearl Cleaners building.  [Previous Story: Old Pearl Cleaners building destroyed by fire]  The Evansville Fire Department confirmed a person of interest had been detained. After interviewing the man identified as Charles Perrin, Evansville police say he knowingly and intentionally set a fire in the building.  “Some of the statements he made did affirm that he did purposely set the fire,” said EPD Officer Mario Reid.  According to an affidavit, Perrin told investigators he set the fire for self-gratification, as he got an adrenaline rush. EPD officials say Perrin also told investigators that he left and soon came back to admire his work.  “The difference with this investigation is that we had three different agencies working very closely together,” Officer Reid said. “But not only were we working with the other agencies including the Evansville Fire Department, but we were also making contact with people in the community.”  Investigators brought Perrin back to the scene of the crime after interrogating him. Police say Perrin agreed to walk through the timeline and location of where everything happened.  “They [firefighters] were able to dig into the area a little bit and just verify what he said,” EFD Division Chief Mike Larson said.  Perrin now faces charges of arson and criminal mischief.  “Just all we ask is if you see something, say something,” Larson said. “So that helps tremendously for pretty much all investigations.”  25-year-old Charles Perrin (Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office)  That fire happened Wednesday around 2 a.m.  Evansville Division Chief Mike Larson says the fire was considered “out” around 8 a.m. Wednesday.  After the fire was out, fire crews continued to put out hot spots until around 4 p.m. to make sure the fire didn’t rekindle.  That Pearl Dry Cleaners location had been in business for more than 100 years when it closed in 2017.  Police say the estimated value of the property is nearly $445,000.

"fire","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Evansville"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:19:35","EVANSVILLE – An Evansville man was arrested Thursday and accused of starting the fire that destroyed a historic Downtown building.  Charles James Perrin, 25, was booked into the Vanderburgh County jail on charges of arson and criminal mischief causing at least $50,000 in damages.  Perrin is accused of setting the blaze that gutted the former Pearl Cleaners building at 428 N.W. 3rd St. Once known as “Pearl Steam Laundry,” the structure had stood at the northern edge of Downtown Evansville for more than 100 years and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Evansville Fire Department spokesman and District Chief Mike Larson announced the arrest during a Thursday afternoon news conference alongside EPD Officer Mario Reid.  Reid claimed that after officers made contact with Perrin, he voluntarily came to EPD headquarters and reportedly admitted to setting the blaze. Police believe he was homeless at the time of his arrest.  At least one other media organization had obtained a probable cause affidavit in Perrin's arrest, but neither Evansville police nor the fire department made that affidavit available at the news conference.  According to Reid, the Indiana State Fire Marshal, which was investigating the cause of the blaze, ""presented"" the affidavit to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's office and the jail.  In addition, the Courier & Press requested detailed logs showing law enforcement and fire crews’ response to the blaze from Evansville-Vanderburgh Central Dispatch. The agency refused to release the records citing “an ongoing investigation.”  “Evansville Fire Department has not given us clearance to release anything pertaining to the incident as of yet,” operations supervisor Chase Collins wrote at 3:30 p.m.  More:Fire destroys former Pearl Cleaners site in Downtown Evansville  Who owns the building?  Like many large properties in Evansville, the Pearl Cleaners site is officially owned by a limited liability company.  According to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office, the building is owned through The Pearl Development LLC. Its registered agent is listed as Ryan Schulz: an attorney with Kahn, Dees, Donovan & Kahn.  After the Courier & Press reached out to Schulz on Thursday, Pearl Development LLC sent a news release. It was unsigned.  “Almost exactly one year ago we bought this historical landmark with the hopes of restoring it to usable commercial space,” the release states. “Our dream of revitalizing this iconic building and returning it to her former glory, (sic) is now ash.”  According to the Vanderburgh Assessor’s site, the LLC bought the property from the Korb family last June.  Reid confirmed during Thursday's news conference that police have talked to the current owner.  State documents and assessor’s records tie the property to Dr. Bachar Malek. When the Courier & Press reached out to him via an email address in state records, Malek said he was no longer associated with the property and that the current owners have been “trying to sell it for a while with no potential buyer.”  “The Pearl building last time I was there was completely empty only outside bricks and window left so you need to ask yourself, what got caught on fire?” he said.  More:Evansville's Lloyd Pool will be knocked down soon, two years after it closed  Were the property taxes paid?  No – at least according to assessor’s records.  That department’s website says property taxes were last paid in spring of 2022. As of Thursday, the owners owed more than $22,000.  There was no official word as of Thursday whether the building was insured.  The property was the target of a lawsuit  Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before. It was filed by WNIN – its former neighbor at the historic Carpenter House – stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  Pearl applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.  A plan filed in that lawsuit documented a 250-foot wide plume of groundwater contaminated with the solvent PCE on the Pearl Cleaners site.  'Pearl Steam Laundry' was on the National Register of Historic Places  According to a sign posted on the charred building, “Pearl Steam Laundry” was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 6, 1984 alongside several other Downtown buildings. It went on the state registry two years before that.  Now it’s gone.  What happens next?  Reid said the next step will be for code enforcement from the Evansville Building Commission to complete a inspection.  That report will then be turned over to the fire department to determine what needs to happen next.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9oZXJlcy13aGF0LXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLXBlYXJsLWNsZWFuZXItZmlyZS1pbi1ldmFuc3ZpbGxlLzcwMjI5ODI2MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WWLP) – Controversy Wednesday night involving the budget for the District 1 South Hadley Fire Department, after a small group of taxpayers voted to reject funding salaries.  Wednesday night that budget was approved to fund District 1, but before that vote, we heard concerns from both sides of this issue, “I’ve been doing this for 32 years and I have never heard of the fire department being unfunded,” South Hadley Fire Chief, Robert Authier told 22News.  The majority of District 1 residents voted to approve appropriating a total of $2.7 million to fund the personnel services account for the fire department. But before that vote, concerns were raised about transparency when it comes to numbers within the budget, as well as a proposed amendment changing the districts health insurance.  Back in April, residents in District 1 originally voted no on the budget during their annual meeting, which ultimately stripped funding for wages for firefighters and paramedics. Top fire officials also at the meeting, urging voters of what would be at stake to not pass this funding.  Richard MacKinnon, President of Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts told 22News, “It’s a disaster for public safety here in South Hadley, what’s at stake is whether they are going to have fire, ems protection, and other emergency response for incidents that they respond to every day and every night.”  Again, the budget was approved Wednesday night, and ways to avoid something like this from happening again was also discussed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYW1wc2hpcmUtY291bnR5LzItN20tYnVkZ2V0LWFwcHJvdmVkLWZvci1zb3V0aC1oYWRsZXktZGlzdHJpY3QtMS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3dscC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2hhbXBzaGlyZS1jb3VudHkvMi03bS1idWRnZXQtYXBwcm92ZWQtZm9yLXNvdXRoLWhhZGxleS1kaXN0cmljdC0xLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Jefferson County Sheriff Peter Barnett says that a deputy and state trooper responded to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6 p.m. to check on the welfare of someone who lived there.  The resident, later identified as 45-year-old Nathan Krump, allegedly brandished a weapon and fired one round toward the deputy.  Court papers say Krump yelled to police, “You’re going to get killed. Get off my property.” (See more about what police said in statements here.)  More shots followed.  “It was very chaotic to begin with. Shots fired in all different directions...going door to door, and getting the neighbors in the close proximity out of the area. And then when the gunshots started, moving more people farther distance away...We’re very, very lucky that everyone came out of this alive”  Krump allegedly went back into the home and the officers retreated to a safe spot to wait for backup.  The police officers’ statements say, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  They called for backup. More officers arrived and brought in an armored vehicle and involved Watertown police, sheriff’s deputies, and state troopers. Police later realized there was a bullet hole in the windshield of a state trooper’s car.  While police were fired upon, no officer fired back.  Sheriff Barnett says officers didn’t get a clear shot and he would have had to give the command, which he was never asked to give. Barnett says he’s very proud of officers’ restraint.  Police blocked off the road and the neighborhood was evacuated.  “Each step is methodical. Let’s make sure that when we move, it’s right and we don’t make any mistakes,” said Barnett.  Word quickly spread around Pillar Point about what was happening.  “All of a sudden you go from a resting posture to a defensive one. Your senses are sharpened and you just try to be ready for whatever,” said neighbor Richard Dodge.  Authorities set up a perimeter and members of the sheriff’s office and the Watertown Police Department tried to communicate with Krump.  A fire started and the house was quickly engulfed. Police said Krump tried to get away by riding a tractor. He was tased and taken into custody at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.  Krump was charged with first-degree attempted murder. He was jailed without bail following his arraignment in Watertown city court Wednesday morning.  Four members of the sheriff’s office were taken to Samaritan Medical Center for evaluation.  We know one deputy was hit by the tractor Krump allegedly used to allegedly flee the scene.  Another sprained his ankle while running under gunfire to evacuate a neighboring home.  The investigation by the sheriff’s office, state police, and country district attorney’s office is ongoing. Police say more charges are pending.  Also assisting were the Watertown Police Department, county Fire and Emergency Management, the 911 dispatch center, county fire investigators, Samaritan Medical Center, and fire departments from Brownville, Sackets Harbor, Glen Park, Chaumont, town of Watertown, Three Mile Bay, Black River, and Northpole.

(NEWS10) – Nearly a week with no rain and with winds expected to gust up to 35 mph, fire dangers throughout the Capital Region are still a concern. NEWS10 has more on the dangerous conditions.  There are three ingredients to make a fire. You need fuel, heat and oxygen. Officials say the current conditions are the perfect recipe to cook up a dangerous fire.  Art Hunsinger, former Clifton Park Fire Chief, says these ingredients are easy to spot.  “All the dry stuff that’s still on the ground, the leaves that were under the snow that are still sitting on the ground now blowing around, the pine needles that are left over that would be dry from last summer that are on the roadway. People are changing out to new mulch now that spring is here. Old mulch is so dry that a good heat on that mulch is just going to travel right down the mulch, and if it’s back to a building, it’s going to burn a building if we’re not careful,” said Hunsinger.  Stephen DiRenzio, Warning Coordination meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in Albany, says the conditions are perfect for out-of-control fires.  “Winds and the dry conditions are the two biggest problems. The winds keep things dry. And we’ve had no rain. And then yes, they can definitely push the fire along,” said DiRenzio.  DEC commissioner, Basil Seggos, says the entire state of New York is under a fire danger risk and released the following statement on Twitter:  “Fire danger is now high in all of New York State due to lack of precipitation. Please exercise extreme caution with campfires, any back yard burns, and discarded cigarette.”  “Driving around I still see people throwing cigarette butts out their car windows and this is probably not the time to do that,” said DiRenzio.  “It’s enough to start something like here on fire. A lit cigarette thrown out of the window in an area like this. If it’s hot enough it’s gonna start this stuff on fire and the wind is gonna take it,” said Hunsinger.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxMC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay11bmRlci1pbmNyZWFzZWQtcmlzay1mb3ItZmlyZS1kYW5nZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

First responders discovered a fully engulfed residence along with two cars at South Fifth Street and West Jefferson Avenue after receiving a report of a fire at about 11:20 p.m. First responders were notified of a person still trapped inside of the home, a sheriff's office release said.  Additional law enforcement and backup fire crews were called to the scene as the growing number of people outside of the burning home started to interfere with first responders, the sheriff's office said. Tribal police were also called in to assist with crowd control, the sheriff's office said.  One man was arrested on suspicion of obstruction after he tried to take firefighting equipment from a fire truck and pushed a police officer and firefighter, the sheriff's office said.  Electricity in the neighborhood was cut as the fire reached power lines at about 12:40 a.m.  Fire crews knocked down the fire in the early morning hours on Monday and recovered the body of a 14-year-old girl.

And I know at this point in time, we have, I believe I just talked to the water supply officer that we had 11 different communities with tank trucks here. So that helped us be able to get the water up. The building is *** non fire suppressed building. It is alarm panel. So everybody, the alarms were going off on arrival. Any questions you need to speak up because that's pumping. It's interesting. The wind is coming, the wind is coming from the northwest. The building fire actually started on the southeast side but just as soon as the start of the evacuation doors were left open underneath and the wind blew right through and blew that right up. One of our major concerns on arrival is *** 500 gallon propane tank that was was in impingement and it was at 70%. So most of our water and the initial stock was worried about that propane tank and *** situation of having that gas off. So we actually protect our firefighters that way. And I will, if I will, we made an interior search on this building. When we found out *** room number of *** possibility of an occupant, we made the interior search with no hand lines, no water lines to make an entrance into this, to see if we could make *** rescue and do *** search. They got to that the second floor, basically the first floor from roadside, they got to the second floor and got within two rooms of that and could not go any further. That was way, way, way too much fire. And *** point at that time, and they had to turn around at that point in time when they said that they could not make entrance into that room or anything close to that room. We went to *** strictly defensive mode to protect the firefighters. I have one firefighter with *** laceration and the other injury we have is from *** passer by that came to watch the fire. She went down and they're working with her. Now, not at this time when we got there, police were doing *** very good job of opening doors and getting and getting them out. We got there. There were actually people who had been out, were running back in to get shoes and things like that. So the police did an incredible job. The kid police needed *** pat on the back because I'm busy trying to figure out how I'm going to fight this fire and they're in there trying to get the people out before we got there. So have no idea how many people is there anything about this particular fire that made this especially challenging for your department. The wind, lack of water, wind size of the fire, the size of the building, lack of *** fire suppressed building. All those add up. Not yet. At this time it's under investigation. That's something that my town manager will deal with. She's *** public relations on this fire. That's something she can handle very well. I have heard the same things. Yes. The fire extended next door. I understand it's coming winds coming from the northwest. We have *** building that sits dead south to it. We have its York Hospital, physical therapy and also health club. There's *** gazebo out there that I think the roof kind of came off that much fire that quick, that much heat and that much Amber. We also had fires across the street that was said several woods, fires and brush fires extended, almost got into one side of the house and was quickly knocked down and we have had brand patrol all the way out to route one on state road and they've been knocking down fires out there in the woods and things like that. When will, you know, if this fire is clear of any casualties? When will we know? Not for *** while? Probably that that much destruction will be *** while before we get, figuring out where we're going, the investigation into this? Look like once you finally do put the fire out, I mean, what would be the next steps will be determining where we start to look. We have an idea. We will start to work with the fire marshals office. I have two marshals investigators on scene now and I understand the sergeant is on his way down at that point in time, we will direct efforts with the firefighters into those areas that have major concern for where we think there could be *** possibility of that issue. When was the last time your department's dealt with *** buyer of this size? Oh, that's *** good question. I mean, we deal with fires all the time. We've had *** very busy winter with structure fires. This one, this one is *** big one. I mean, years ago that burnt, I was *** firefighter when that whole place burned. But I guess we had *** major one down the village. It was maybe 15 years ago that went to *** third alarm, but most of our stuff is handled with *** single alarm, maybe two alarm fires, residential type buildings *** long time since I was at 1/5 alarm. Within *** half hour. Yeah. And this, we haven't had *** five alarm fire here in *** long time. Any idea how long the roads are going to be blocked for? I'm sorry, how long the roads are going to be blocked until we're done? You said 11 communities have tankers here. How many agencies? Well, I think if you go 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way you can grab everybody's name *** town. I'll tell you they're here. How many 16, approximately 16 communities, things like that? Any other questions? We will, we will have another briefing probably later tonight after we know more about what's happening up there. I would probably schedule that. Maybe. What time is it now? I know I'm not going to help your six o'clock news, so it will probably be closer to maybe eight, which will help your 11 o'clock news. So I'll let, let's plan another one for eight o'clock to figure out that person right there. My boss. He any other questions? Thanks for being so patient and I have to get back to work.

Reply  A fire broke out Tuesday night at a senior housing facility in Norwalk, according to fire officials. (Shutterstock)  NORWALK, CT — A number of elderly residents needed to be rescued after a fire broke out Tuesday night at a senior housing facility in Norwalk, according to fire officials.  In a news release, Deputy Fire Chief Steve Shay said an apartment fire was reported around 5:30 p.m. at a Cedar Street housing facility with two buildings containing 48 apartments in total and a shared common interior hallway. The fire began in one of the first floor apartments and quickly spread to the hallway siding, which caused heavy smoke to spread to all the apartments on the first and second floors, Shay said.  According to Shay, many elderly residents needed to be rescued from their apartments, approximately seven of which were removed from second floor windows on ladders. Others were rescued using interior stairways. As firefighters extinguished the blaze, crews quickly searched each apartment and removed residents from the building. They also rescued several pets, Shay said.  Police also banged on doors in the building to alert residents of the fire. Two residents were taken to a hospital while other residents were treated at the scene by emergency medical service officers and released, Shay said. The building was declared unfit for occupancy and the number of displaced residents is still being counted, according to Shay. The American Red Cross is providing housing for those affected.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0L25vcndhbGsvZmlyZS1icmVha3Mtb3V0LXNlbmlvci1ob3VzaW5nLWZhY2lsaXR5LW5vcndhbGstZmTSAWtodHRwczovL3BhdGNoLmNvbS9jb25uZWN0aWN1dC9ub3J3YWxrL2FtcC8zMTM4MDIyNi9maXJlLWJyZWFrcy1vdXQtYXQtc2VuaW9yLWhvdXNpbmctZmFjaWxpdHktaW4tbm9yd2Fsay1mZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Kalispell"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 07:00:54","The Kalispell City Council pored over the preliminary budgets on Monday for the police, fire and ambulance, and parks and recreation departments.  The city’s proposed $15.5 million operating budget, up from $14.1 million last year, largely goes toward public safety and emergency services. The Police Department’s proposed budget totals $6.7 million, an 8.61% increase over the previous year’s budget, while the Fire Department’s proposed budget comes in at $4.8 million, a 4.89% increase.  The police department is looking to add three squad cars, including one undercover vehicle, according to a briefing by outgoing Chief Doug Overman.  Also included in next year’s additions is a Labrador retriever K-9 unit, which is expected to join the force in June.  The total proposed budget for the city comes in at just under $139 million. Last year’s budget totaled $115.4 million.  The budget includes some funds from opioid settlements, the reception of which was described as a surprise by City Manager Doug Russell. He anticipates the city to get around $16,000 per year for up to around 20 years, which he is hoping will be pooled with the portion received by the county to continue their joint co-responder mental health stabilization program.  The program is currently funded by a state grant, but local leaders have been looking for a revenue source to keep it going.  The fire department is looking to upgrade its radio systems and upgrade the chassis on a fire truck, according to Chief Dan Pearce.  The ambulance service is funded almost entirely by Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, according to Pearce, although low rates and unpaid bills mean that expenses are passed on to city taxpayers.  Mayor Mark Johnson described the roughly $800,000 funding gap for ambulance services that result as a “bitter pill to swallow,” but said that he thought it was a critical local service and preferred taxpayers footing the bill to a privatized ambulance service outside of the city’s control. He also pointed out that the projected number is less than the over $1 million that taxpayers paid only a few years ago.  The parks department's $4 million budget looks much the same as in previous years, with a previously ratified uptick in certain recreation and permitting fees boosting the department’s revenues.  New expenses for the department this year include higher prices on vehicle fuel and natural gas for pool heating, a new garage to maintain their fleet of vehicles, and roughly $20,000 to implement a new online reservation and registration system, according to department head Chad Fincher.  Fincher said the new program would minimize phone calls and printouts, as well as allow the community to sign up for department programs outside of regular business hours.  The city won’t adopt the final budget until property valuations come in from the state. Those numbers typically arrive in mid-August.  COUNCIL ALSO approved the final plat for the third phase of the Bloomstone development, which is located at 1070 Treeline Road on the north side of town. The project is slated to include 47 single-family homes on approximately 10 acres.  The council meets again on Monday, June 5.

Dan Krauth has the story.  The city of New York has seen an explosion in battery fires sparked by e-bikes and e-scooters. There have been 80 e-battery fires so far this year, including 60 injuries and nine deaths.  The city leads the nation in e-battery fires. Cities like Los Angeles and Seattle have reported about a dozen in the same time period. Other cities like Houston don't track them.  7 On Your Side Investigates had to look across the pond, to London, to find a major city that's experiencing a similar deadly rise in fires.  The British city has a similar number of electronic devices and fires reported this year.  ""It's our fastest growing fire trend,"" said Charlie Pugsley, the Asst. Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade. ""We're up to around one fire every two days from e-bikes or e-scooters,"" he said.  They've launched a media campaign called Charge Safe and they took action in the transit system. The city banned all e-bikes and scooters from the Tube where the flames and smoke could be especially dangerous, and people have no way to escape.  ""When you consider a metro subway system, if you have a fire there with open carriages, you have nowhere to go and so we fully understand and support Transport for London's decision there,"" said Pugsley.  There's a similar fire concern in New York City. The MTA took action recently. They didn't ban e-devices from trains. Instead, they banned people from charging them on board and the new policy states they have to be powered off.  ""In the news, every kind of incident that we heard of these things going on fire is when somebody's charging it so we can't have that happen on the train,"" said Gerard Bringmann, an MTA Board Member and part of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council.  The city's fire marshal said fires are not only limited to devices that are charging. The e-battery fire in a fatal Queens blaze last month was charging at the time it went up in flames. But the e-battery fire that leveled a Bronx supermarket was not.  ""It was not charging at the time, so it doesn't really fit the narrative that these things are always from delivery workers and they're charging all the time, it's not always the case,"" said NYC Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn.  With limited space, city leaders have been promoting the use of the devices as an alternative way of getting around. They've also expressed concerned they don't want to affect the livelihood of the more than 60,000 delivery workers who use the devices.  When asked who's going to police the new policy, Bringmann said it'll primarily be up to transit workers.  ""The first line of defense would be the conductors, if it's a problem and they get some push back they could at least get on the phone and have MTA police meet them at the next station,"" he said. ""There's certain risks that you take everywhere so we want to mitigate those risks as much as possible.""  City leaders have also been taking action. They passed a series of 5 new laws that include banning the sale of uncertified and unregulated batteries. Even though people can still purchase them online which is a problem for cities across the world.  ""Maybe we need to have something else down the line but this is a good start,"" said Bringmann. ""The MTA is not beyond tweaking this policy down the line.""  ----------  DO YOU NEED A STORY INVESTIGATED?

"fire","2021-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Georgetown"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:13:28","AUSTIN (KXAN) — A bill filed in response to a fire that took the lives of 75 dogs at a Georgetown pet resort in 2021 passed both chambers of the Texas Legislature this week.  House Bill 2063 is aimed at increasing safety requirements in Texas kennels. It now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, where it could be signed into law.  In September 2021, a fire broke out at the Ponderosa Pet Resort, killing 75 dogs belonging to 59 families. None of the facility’s staff members were on-site at the time, and there wasn’t a sprinkler system.  The City of Georgetown told KXAN after it happened that its fire code, as well as federal and state standards, did not require sprinkler systems for a facility of this type and size.  According to State Rep. James Talarico, after the fire, dog lovers and community advocates organized a petition that garnered more than 17,000 signatures from across the country calling for legislative solutions to keep dogs in kennels safe.  In response, Talarico filed House Bill 2063, which requires kennels to disclose to pet owners if a dog or cat will be left unattended or left in a facility that does not have a fire sprinkler system, according to the representative.  “The fire in Georgetown was absolutely gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families that lost their loving companions,” Talarico said. “After the fire, our community rallied together and called for action. Our legislation will ensure accidents like this never happen again in Texas.”  The bill awaits a signature from Abbott.  Owner turns grief into action  Leikyn Huckins boarded her two dogs, Gizmo and Drexel, at the Ponderosa Pet Resort before the fire broke out. She says she was heartbroken by the loss and shocked to learn about the standard for pet boarding facilities in the state.  “The problem is there just really isn’t any oversight. There are not really any regulations besides sanitation. So, you know, you really have to be your own pets advocate,” Huckins said.  Huckins since has led families that lost pets in the blaze to call for changes at the local and state level to improve pet safety at these facilities.  She has written and met with local leaders to call for city pet safety ordinances. She cites that Georgetown, Liberty Hill, Cedar Park, and Round Rock have all put measures protecting pets from similar dangers on their books.  Huckins said she is excited the bill has reached the governor’s desk and hopes it is the first of many that will secure pet safety in Texas.  “It’s all been a positive response. And I look forward to just continuing until I can get something passed on a state level that will include fire protection for these buildings,” Huckins said.  In the meantime, Huckins has taken to social media to highlight legislative changes and share photos and videos of the pets lost in the fire.  She also uses the account to educate owners on what they should consider asking a boarding house before trusting them with their pets.  “There’s no requirements for fire sprinklers, there’s no requirements for somebody to be there overnight. There’s not even requirements for climate control. So you need to ask everything that you assume will be provided,” Huckins said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4YW4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwva2VubmVsLXNhZmV0eS1iaWxsLWZpbGVkLWFmdGVyLXBvbmRlcm9zYS1wZXQtcmVzb3J0LWZpcmUtcGFzc2VzLWhlYWRzLXRvLWdvdmVybm9yLWFiYm90dHMtZGVzay_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3hhbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9rZW5uZWwtc2FmZXR5LWJpbGwtZmlsZWQtYWZ0ZXItcG9uZGVyb3NhLXBldC1yZXNvcnQtZmlyZS1wYXNzZXMtaGVhZHMtdG8tZ292ZXJub3ItYWJib3R0cy1kZXNrL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-25","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:58:57","Fire service leaders took to Capitol Hill last week to urge Congress to approve federal funding for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and essential fire grant programs that fire departments count on to keep their communities safe.  The IAFF, among other organizations, asked the U.S. House of Representatives to approve the reauthorization of funding for the USFA, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant and Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) programs. Congress, as part of the annual budgeting process, must approve funding levels for the federal government’s investment in fire safety.  Funding for the SAFER and AFG programs is slated to sunset at the end of the fiscal year. The House Subcommittee on Research and Technology held a hearing on future funding of the USFA and its grant programs, where top fire service officials called on lawmakers to step up and fully invest in the nation’s public safety.  “Every fire fighter takes an oath to protect their communities to the best of their abilities, and we hold that oath sacred. We ask the U.S. Congress to have our backs and not make our jobs even more dangerous by failing to invest in the staffing, training, and equipment we need. Our safety rests in your hands,” Kevin O’Connor, Assistant to the General President For Governmental Affairs and Political Action, said at the hearing.  AFG grants provide critical funding for essential equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training, and other resources to help fire fighters and other first responders protect the public and themselves from fire and related hazards.  Grants from the SAFER program are used to help local fire departments hire fire fighters to meet the staffing, response, and operational standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).  The International and its affiliates, working with supportive elected officials, have secured these grants to ensure that hundreds of fire departments across the nation stay safely staffed and properly equipped, even through economic downturns.  In April, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act, with a vote of 95 to 2. The Senate bill would reauthorize AFG and SAFER programs through 2030, while also authorizing $95 million for the USFA, an increase of $20 million from current levels.  The IAFF also supports providing the USFA with an additional $12.5 million to ensure the successful completion of their data management and IT upgrades.  Congress has consistently ensured the reauthorization of the SAFER/AFG program and the USFA by never allowing these fire service programs to lapse, despite any haggling over funding levels.  “Supporting our fire fighters and first responders has never been more essential than it is today. During COVID lockdowns, fire fighters, and other frontline workers carried the weight of a nation in crisis. Emergency services never stopped during lockdowns thanks to the brave men and women who showed up every day to put their lives on the line,” said Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology.  Collins said the COVID-19 pandemic led thousands of fire fighters, both career and volunteer, to exit the service, leaving many fire departments understaffed with fewer new recruits signing up for training.  Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell, U.S. Fire Administrator, addressed the hearing to provide lawmakers with an update on federal efforts to bolster the USFA and meet emerging challenges in the fire service, such as recruitment and retention, preparing fire fighters to handle the climate-driven increase in fires within the Wildland Urban Interface, establishing a comprehensive fire fighter cancer registry, and providing behavioral health assistance and suicide prevention initiatives for fire fighters.

"fire","2023-03-29","Not Discerned","{""Blue"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:17:03","WASHINGTON — United Launch Alliance expects to conduct a static-fire test of its Vulcan Centaur rocket in several days, but the timing of the vehicle’s first launch will depend on the outcome of an ongoing investigation of a test anomaly.  ULA rolled the Vulcan rocket from the pad at Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, back to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) building on May 15. The vehicle had been on the pad for several days to conduct a tanking test and practice countdown.  Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said in a May 15 tweet that the company needed to “adjust a handful of parameters and set points” for the vehicle before performing what the company calls the Flight Readiness Firing (FRF), a static-fire test of the booster’s BE-4 engines on the pad. That work would be done while the rocket is back in the VIF.  In a May 16 interview after a speech at the Humans to Mars Summit here, Bruno said that work involved a combination of minor adjustments to both pad infrastructure and the vehicle. The former includes adjusting set points in a hydraulics system and changing the rate of liquid oxygen flowing into the rocket to top off tanks after recycling the countdown. Those adjustments, he said, could be done in software.  On the booster, he said there was an issue during the pad tests with flowing gas through spark torch igniters used to ignite the BE-4 engines. The gas is intended to make sure that the igniters are dry and can light, but the timing was off. That could involve some combination of adjustments on the rocket and ground infrastructure.  “There’s nothing wrong with the engines,” he added. “We’ve lit the engines a zillion times on the test stand at Blue,” a reference to test stands by engine manufacturer Blue Origin.  That work is done more easily inside the VIF, he said, where there is protection from the weather and where work can continue when other range operations might cause a halt to work on the pad.  Once those fixes are complete, Bruno said the vehicle will roll back out to the pad for the FRF. “It’ll be a few days,” he said of the timing of the test, which will depend on both when the work is complete and getting approval from the range for test, which is required since it is considered an “energetic” event.  Assuming there are no problems with that firing, the last major obstacle before launch is completing an investigation into a March 29 incident during testing of the Centaur upper stage. Hydrogen leaked from the structural test article and ignited, creating a fireball.  Bruno said the investigation was delayed because it took time to remove equipment on top of the Centaur, such as a payload adapter and mass simulators for the payload and payload fairing. Only in the last week and a half was ULA able to get access to the dome section of the Centaur where the leak was located.  Engineers have isolated a small region on that dome where they believe the leak came from, as well as the likely ignition source. “I’m pretty confident that we’re going to find the leak, and once we find the leak we’ll know if we have to take corrective action or not on the flight vehicle,” he said.  If ULA doesn’t need to modify the Centaur, that would allow the Cert-1 launch to take place in early summer, he said. “If we do, it could take longer, but I don’t expect it to get out of the year.”  Complicating launch scheduling is the requirement for the primary payload, the Peregrine lunar lander from Astrobotic, which has a launch window that is open only for about four to five days per month. Before the Centaur test anomaly, ULA had been working towards a May 4 launch, which Bruno said in February was the start of a window about four days long.  “In the big picture, it’s a steel pressure vessel and it had a leak,” he said. “We’re going to understand it and we’re going to fix it. It’s not like other things that go wrong on rockets like engines that blow up. It’s just a piece of structure. We’ll fix it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91bGEtcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci12dWxjYW4tY2VudGF1ci1zdGF0aWMtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  TONOPAH, Ariz. — A popular Tonopah watering hole is no more after it was the victim of another early morning fire on Wednesday, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said.  Tin Top Bar & Grill appears to be a ""total loss"" after it was fully engulfed in flames near the intersection of Wintersburg Road and Salome Highway, deputies said. No one was injured and officials are investigating what started the fire.  Many in the community heard about the fire in the early morning hours as it was still in flames, including Michelle Davis who got a call from her friend around 12:30 a.m.  ""I could actually see the flames from my backyard,"" Davis said.  Joe Berg, who's worked at the Tin Top Bar & Grill for years, and lives down the street, was there as the restaurant burned.  ""It was engulfed pretty bad,"" Berg said.  The signs on the side of the Tin Top with white background and red and black letters are now burned, the roof collapsed and chairs from the patio are left charred.  ""Just kind of devastating,"" Berg said. ""All those signs – I freehand painted all those signs myself.""  It's a place that community members say was more than just a restaurant or a place to grab drinks.  Berg talks about Halloween parties, big haunted houses, Christmas light displays and much more as part of the joyful moments that the Tin Top was the backdrop for.  ""I live right down the road and I hear karaoke out here – some of them were great, I give them all props. Some of them sound like they’re getting squeezed by a duck,"" Berg said with a laugh. ""But it’s great, we all have fun, we have a blast. We had so much fun here.""  Davis called the Tin Top the ""Tonopah Cheers.""  ""Everybody knew everybody,"" Davis said.  She started going to the Tin Top when she moved out to Tonopah almost four years ago.  ""We have a women's group out there and we would use the upstairs area and do crochet nights every other Tuesday night and they do paint nights and just all kinds of stuff,"" Davis said.  But the restaurant was also a place holding difficult moments too.  ""I lost my wife in the parking lot three years ago,"" Berg said. ""This place means a whole lot to us, a whole lot.""  The difficult moments are now coming for the more than two dozen staff members who worked at the restaurant. Davis started a GoFundMe for them.  ""Just knowing that they can't just go down the street tomorrow to Applebee's or somewhere else – if they chose to stay in that line of work,"" Davis said. ""It's going to be a rough patch for everybody.""  The current owner told 12News off camera he's owned the restaurant for 17 years and isn't sure what the next steps are for the Tin Top.  But the community is hoping the fire won't mean the end for the bar and grill.  ""Hopefully we can bring it back again,"" Berg said.  It's not the first time the restaurant property has faced fire. In its more than 30 years of operation, Tin Top has seen at least two other fires on the property, according to its website.  ""The Tin Top Bar & Grill has been many things through time,"" the restaurant's website said. ""Buildings on this property have burned to the ground at least twice.""  The restaurant thanked the community for its support during this time in a Facebook post.

"fire","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Northampton"", ""Northamptonshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:41:13","The Bombyx Center in Florence remains the home of the Florence Congregational Church, a Jewish Reform congregation and a preschool, while also hosting live music and offering space for multiple community groups and activities. Gazette file photo  Cassandra Holden, executive director of the Bombyx Center in Florence, speaks last fall to a group from the Mass Cultural Council and MassDevelopment during their visit to the region. Gazette file photo  NORTHAMPTON — Staff and board members from the Bombyx Center for Arts & Equity are meeting this morning with city officials to try to get answers for what Bombyx says is a bewildering turn of events: a sudden shutdown of live indoor music ordered by a city fire inspector.  The shutdown order, issued May 11 by Capt. Mark Curtin, fire prevention officer for the Northampton Fire Department, forced Bombyx to cancel a weekend festival May 12-13 called Collider! Fest that featured multiple musicians, music workshops, a record fair, and some catered food service.  Cassandra Holden, Bombyx’s executive director, and Elizabeth Dunaway, president of the nonprofit group’s board of directors, estimate this sudden cancellation has cost the Florence center and its partners for Collider! Fest about $15,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. (The musicians were all paid and tickets were refunded; some of the musicians were able to play at Hawks & Reed Performing Arts Center in Greenfield the evening of May 12.)  It’s also not clear when live indoor music may resume at Bombyx; shows are currently scheduled for both Saturday and Sunday. A show on Tuesday night by one of the center’s resident community music groups, the Bombyx Brass Collective, was moved to the lawn outside the center.  More concerning, Holden and Dunaway say, is the fact that the shutdown order, apparently made because of Curtin’s concerns about inadequate fire prevention measures at the venue, comes after months of regular interaction with city officials about the center’s ongoing renovation efforts — during which those same officials have consistently approved their plans, Holden said.  “This whole situation is very confusing,” Holden said during an interview Tuesday at Bombyx. The shutdown order “seemed very random, and we don’t understand where it came from.”  “We’re really hoping to get some clarity at the [Thursday] meeting,” Holden said.  That meeting has been organized by Alan Wolf, chief of staff for Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra, and is expected to include members of the city’s Fire and Building departments and other officials including city councilors.  “We want to work with Bombyx to be sure they can be open and operate in a safe manner, in compliance with all state and local codes,” Wolf said in a phone call this week. “We all want them to succeed.”  But Bombyx staff believe the center has been operating in a safe manner since opening in the fall of 2021, and they say both the city’s building inspector, Jonathan Flagg, and city planner Carolyn Misch have reviewed and approved all their plans so far. Nor has the Fire Department expressed any previous concerns to them about a lack of fire prevention measures, they say.  In a letter they sent to Curtin and several other city officials earlier this week, Holden and Dunaway wrote that part of the issue seems to be a difference in how Bombyx staff regard the center and how Curtin viewed it when he came by last week. Staff view Bombyx as a community arts center that also hosts live music, while Curtin appeared to view the space as a nightclub during his inspection.  The Bombyx Center is located in Florence’s historic Congregational Church, whose parishioners continue to use the sanctuary. The center is also home to the Beit Ahavah Reform Synagogue and the Cloverdale Preschool,while numerous other local groups, such as the Young@Heart Chorus, use the facility on a regular basis.  Art exhibits, public talks, educational workshops and other events are also a big part of the mix. This evening, for instance, Northampton’s International Language Institute is holding an annual event there, Giving Voice, that recognizes its immigrant students.  “We’re really like 33 Hawley,” said Dunaway, referring to the space downtown operated by the Northampton Community Arts Trust. “We’re a community arts and cultural center that also hosts live music. We’re not a nightclub. We don’t sell alcohol.”  According to a pie chart the Bombyx Center prepared as part of their letter to city officials, live music represented 4.4% of the center’s activities during the past six weeks of facility use.  The ‘shutdown’  Yet when Curtin came unannounced to Bombyx on May 11, Holden and Dunaway say, he referred to it as a “nightclub.” Curtin said he had come in response to a complaint, the two women say, though he did not say what the complaint was about or who made it.  After making what Holden says was a brief examination of the Bombyx sanctuary, where both live music and religious services take place, Curtin cited a lack of a sprinkler system and told Holden the center would have to reduce its capacity to 100 people (the center can accommodate a little over 300).  Then, Holden says, Curtin said the capacity would have to be reduced to 50 people, before “leaving abruptly saying that Bombyx was ‘shut down’ immediately,” as she and Dunaway outlined in their letter to Curtin and other city officials.  It was not clear at that time whether that meant the center was shut for all activities, Holden said. She noted that the the Rev. Marisa Egerstrom, the Congregational Church minister, and Rabbi Raquel Shira Kosovske of Beit Ahavah had to call the Fire Department separately to determine that they were, in fact, still permitted to host services in the sanctuary.  Curtin did not respond to a phone message from the Gazette. Flagg also did not respond to a phone message.  For his part, Wolf, who’s serving as the point person for the city’s overall response to the issue, said Bombyx falls into something of a gray area in defining exactly what it is. “Is it a nightclub? If it is, it needs a sprinkler system.”  He added that there’s been concern in New England about club safety ever since the notorious fire in 2003 at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, in which a pyrotechnic display at a rock concert touched off a fast-moving blaze that killed 100 people and injured another 230.  “Ultimately the city’s goal is to keep everyone safe, and it’s up to businesses to be in compliance with all building codes and requirements,” Wolf said. “The city does its best to keep up with all of this.”  He added, “We want [visitors] to Bombyx to be safe, and we want Cassandra to be able to keep doing what she’s been doing.”  In their letter to city officials, Bombyx detailed a long list of renovations and improvements they’ve made to the property since beginning its management there in the fall of 2021, including electrical upgrades, repairing the sanctuary floor, and (currently) installing air conditioning. The letter says they’ve also received a $79,000 grant to install fire suppression and ventilation systems, as well as plumbing upgrades, in the center’s kitchen.  All told, the center has received almost $350,000 in grants so far to improve its facilities, Bombyx says.  In addition, Holden said it’s Bombyx’s understanding with the city that a full sprinkler system in the sanctuary is not required until they fully complete their purchase of the building from the Congregational Church — the agreement calls for this to be done by 2028 — or if they construct any major additions to the existing buildings.  “We are making steady improvements, but we can’t do them all at once,” she said.  Holden and Dunaway acknowledge the center has fielded some complaints about noise and parking during live music events. But they say they’re working to address those issues and don’t believe they’re connected to the current shutdown order.  In the end, Holden says she hopes the city looks favorably on their effort to help the local economy by bringing people to the area for live music, and to serve as a community resource for all the different groups that use the center.  Bombyx, Dunaway noted, has also been buoyed by wishes of support from residents and elected officials — and also “inundated” by questions of what happened last week, which is why the center has now spoken publicly about the issue.  “I think we all want to make this work,” Holden said. “Hopefully [the meeting] will show us a path forward.”  Steve Pfarrer can be reached at spfarrer@gazettenet.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYXpldHRlbmV0LmNvbS9Cb21ieXgtQ2VudGVyLXN0YWZmLXNlZWstYW5zd2Vycy1hZnRlci1Ob3J0aGFtcHRvbi1maXJlLW9mZmljaWFsLWFicnVwdGx5LWNsb3Nlcy10aGUtRmxvcmVuY2UtYXJ0cy1hbmQtY29tbXVuaXR5LXNwYWNlLTUxMDA3OTMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The deal must be approved by Durango City Council and the DFPD board of directors. A special meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 30 at the fire district's Station 1 at 142 Sheppard Drive.  If approved by both boards, the two entities would trade ownership of the buildings and the city would additionally pay $3,586,275 to the fire district, a city news release says.  The city and DFPD hired Bob Allen, of the appraisal group Allen & Associates, to determine fair market values of the properties. In the news release, he said the city’s offer of $3.6 million is fair based on several factors.  The Colorado Department of Transportation’s appraised value of River City Hall is $3.9 million. The fire district paid $6.9 million for the 9-R Administration Building and the attached Big Picture High School facility in December 2021, he said. And parkland on the River City Hall property will be maintained by the city.  Hal Doughty, DFPD fire chief, said the city will need to subdivide the property because a portion of the Animas River Trail and a small park, Veterans Park, are not included in the trade and will remain city property.  Although DFPD’s Station 2 currently resides at River City Hall, for years Doughty has said the facility is in poor shape and needs major upgrades. The fire district purchased the 9-R administration building with the intent of moving its downtown facility there, but plans changed after determining that the facility is too large to house a fire station alone.  A joint police and fire station was considered, but in January Doughty said River City Hall is the best place for a new and improved station, and also noted bringing Durango Police Department to River City Hall wouldn’t be possible without major disruptions to nearby businesses.  Meanwhile, the city was eyeing the 9-R Administration Building as the potential home for a new civic center.  “Oh, man, I'm excited,” Doughty said about the deal. “But I'm also, you know, cautiously optimistic.”  If city and fire officials approve the proposed trade, the fire district will be able to finally replace its downtown fire station and improve working and living conditions for firefighters. And the city will be able to upgrade into a bigger facility at the 9-R Administration Building, he said.  “Which they're desperately in need of because they're out of room at the current City Hall,” he said. “Their police station is in such bad shape.”  ×  He added the deal will be a “huge benefit” to the community, which is the main point of exploring options to begin with.  José Madrigal, city manager, said he is also excited with the deal and the opportunity to preserve the 9-R Administration Building for historical purposes and its continued use. But, there is a long way to go.  If City Council and the fire board approve the trade, public input hearings about design features of the 9-R Administration Building will be needed, he said. But the initial deal is a nice and necessary first step.  Doughty said the fire district and the city likely would have preferred to get more money or value for their respective properties, but the proposed building swap and payment by the city are signs of a fair negotiation.  “Each one of us absolutely believes that we can improve our service to the community by moving in the direction of acquiring these new properties,” he said. “And I think that we have the opportunity to be absolutely transparent with the public on exactly how that looks now that the negotiations (are finished).”  In something resembling a big game of musical chairs, the city, fire district and school district are trying to rotate offices and staff into buildings occupied or owned by one another.  The fire district plans to stay at River City Hall, but the city wants to move out of City Hall and relocate offices from the Carnegie Building across the street from the 9-R Administration building at 201 East 12th St. 9-R administrative staff was originally scheduled to vacate in July, but that didn’t happen, and the school district currently leases the building from DFPD for about $120,000 per year. It hasn’t yet identified a new facility, Doughty said.  But the school district is considering at least one option. Madrigal said the school district has expressed interest in moving into the Carnegie Building across the street.  “There’s a lot of moving pieces with this,” he said. “The second step is the long-discussed, if possible, Buckley Park and Carnegie Building (swap).”  cburney@durangoherald.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2R1cmFuZ28tYW5kLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtcmVhY2gtZGVhbC10by1zd2FwLTktci1hZG1pbi1idWlsZGluZy1hbmQtcml2ZXItY2l0eS1oYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WBTV) - A huge fire destroyed a dental office in Huntersville on Wednesday night.  It happened at the Riccobene Family Dentistry on busy Gilead Road just about two blocks east of Interstate 77 and it kept firefighters busy for hours. Flames were shooting through the roof of the dentist office which was under renovation  Around 50 firefighters battled this fire from the inside and from above. Then, crews spent several hours putting out hot spots and making sure it didn’t reignite.  That fire was already raging when firefighters got the call around 9:30 p.m. They called in extra help and Medic was on standby.  Once they got the fire under control, Huntersville Fire spokesperson Bill Southard talked about some of the challenges they faced.  The fire started late Wednesday night.  “We were way behind as soon as we arrived. Crews worked extremely hard; we had some water supply issues initially due to traffic in the area,” Southard said. “I can’t tell you how amazing our part-time volunteer firefighters did today. A lot of people showed up - close to 50 firefighters, some from off duty - and they aggressively fought this fire.”  According to the Huntersville Fire Department, one of the problems crews encountered was people kept driving over their hoses which slowed the water supply. One of those hoses was even ruined.  *PLEASE READ* One thing we encountered this evening. TWICE this evening, vehicles drove over our large diameter hose. One hose was ruined & had to be replaced mid-fire. These hoses are what keeps water in the hands of FF’s actively fighting fire & is a serious safety issue. pic.twitter.com/Qa2uBDxpKI — Huntersville Fire (@Huntersville_FD) May 18, 2023  The dental office is right next to an O’Reilly Auto Parts store.

No injuries were reported in the fire, and the building is a total loss. The fire marshal will work to find the origin and cause.  The aftermath of the Huntersville fire near Gilead Rd.

In just one year, those same people are rebuilding and looking forward to the future and one of those people affected by the fire was Stephanie Munshower.  She lost both her and her grandmother’s home during that wildfire, but despite all the destruction and devastation that the flames caused, she told us that she has kept up hope that everything will be okay, “It was such a huge process of grieving but also recognizing that we had to move forward, because you can’t stay stagnant in that place of grief and sadness. You have to move forward, and I knew from the first time that I saw that the house was gone that we’re going to come back because this is home.”  If you drive down Hwy 277 South, you’ll see barren lands and trees still black from being scorched from huge flames, that firefighters from across the country battled for over a week, serving as a reminder of the huge wildfire that covered the area.

Consequently, we didn’t have anything up until the day I moved in. I didn’t even have a bed. So, putting that all together, we had people that gave us furniture so most of the furniture that we have right now is something that people gave us and graciously provided for us.

Klamath County Fire District No. 1 and Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue will each receive $1.5 million dollars. OSFM says these two agencies were selected to receive funding due to the increased risk of wildfire near their communities.    Over the last few decades, these regions have experienced more wildfires that have increased the demand for firefighters. This investment will help to lessen that need and provide highly-trained personnel to stop fires before they have a chance to grow and impact communities.  OSFM says there has been a decrease in the number of career and volunteer firefighters entering the field. With this investment, the hope is to create an accessible pathway into a fire career and increase diversity and inclusion.  “The fire service recognizes that our greatest asset is our people, and we are committed to building, developing, and nurturing the skills of these new apprentices while unlocking their full potential and preparing them for long and healthy careers,” Klamath County Fire District No. 1 Chief Greg Davis said. “Through targeted training initiatives, mentorship programs, coaching, and career progression opportunities, we aim to create a dynamic and engaged workforce that is equipped and capable to tackle any challenge the fire service is faced with.”    The apprenticeship program provides participants with 4,000 hours of training over two years. Apprentices learn the skills of basic emergency medical technician (EMT), applicable college-level math and writing coursework, and on-the-job training. During the program, apprentices also increase staffing at local fire agencies.  Funding for this program was made possible through Senate Bill 762, which was signed into law in 2021. This investment is part of a multi-pronged approach Oregon is taking to strategically invest in responding to and preventing wildfires. Learn more about the OSFM’s wildfire investments .    OSFM has also allocated $6-million in funding for the 2023 Wildfire Season, where local fire agencies can apply for up to $35,000 to hire additional firefighters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va3BpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vcmVnb24tc3RhdGUtZmlyZS1tYXJzaGFsLWFubm91bmNlcy0zbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWludG8tZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXItYXBwcmVudGljZXNoaXAtcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The store was evacuated and staff gathered in the parking lot, while a barrier of shopping carts was placed in a row across the parking lot entrance.  Fire Capt. Taylor Fogle of the Martins Ferry Volunteer Fire Department Ladder Company said the fire was doused quickly.  “We were dispatched on report of a possible structure fire, multiple calls,” he said. Dispatchers then clarified the fire was on the outside of the store.  “The fire here was typically on the outside. There was nothing involved in the structure itself. The structure is completely safe and sound. With the outside here, we’re not sure what caused it as of this point. We’ll be doing an investigation,” he said.  Fogle said the flames caused soot to form on one side of the building, but the fire itself did not damage the store. He said no injuries resulted, and they were able to extinguish the fire shortly after arriving.  He did not speculate about what was burning but said it was not a dumpster fire, although the dumpster was nearby.  “The garbage compactor was not involved. There was something here that was on the ground, we’re not sure what that is. We spoke with the manager. They’re going to be doing their own investigation to figure out what was there and what could have caused it,” he said.  Fogle pointed out a nearby exterior store camera, which would have recorded anyone who might have deliberately set a fire.  Kroger staff at the site made no comment, but the store was soon able to reopen. Responding police officers said the store was cleared as a safety precaution.  The Kroger corporate office did not respond to a request for comment.  The smoke was visible to residents, patrons of nearby businesses and motorists on Interstate 70 and Ohio 7.  Neighborhood resident Debbie Chesnick saw the early stages of the blaze.  “It was just a bunch of billowing black smoke that came out in puffs, and it kept getting blacker and blacker,” she said. “It was pretty scary for a minute there. We didn’t know if it was on the roof or where it was. .. .To have that much smoke and stuff, it blows my mind.”  Mikala Lee, another resident, watched the firefighters contain the incident.  “My dogs started barking and I looked out my window and saw the black cloud,” she said. “They got it out really fast.”  City water department employee Jeff Jackson was also observing. He said first responders had to prepare for the worst.  “We seen smoke, then flames. It was going from black smoke to white smoke. Because of the smoke, you couldn’t really see.

"fire","2018-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:24:00","Victims say they barely escaped the 2018 wildfire after the U.S. Forest Service decided to let the fire burn and failed to tell them to evacuate.  DENVER (CN) — Victims of the 2018 Roosevelt Fire on Wednesday asked the 10th Circuit to revive their lawsuit claiming the U.S. Forest Service considered resource benefits as a factor when it decided to let the manmade fire burn.  Starting on Sept. 15, 2018 in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, the manmade Roosevelt Fire burned Lincoln and Sublette counties of Wyoming, consuming 25,000 acres and destroying nearby property.  Steven Knezovich and his son were hunting in the area when the fire broke out, but forest rangers failed to adequately warn them to evacuate. When the fire rapidly grew, the men suffered burns and barely made it out alive. Several local property owners joined the Knezovich family in suing the federal government on Sept. 23, 2021.  A federal judge dismissed the case on Oct. 11, 2022. Knezovich appealed.  In its reply brief, the Forest Service argued it did not immediately tend to the Roosevelt Fire because the area was not easily accessible and therefore unsafe for firefighters. In addition, the Forest Service’s helicopter, needed to observe the area before entering, had been committed to another fire.  But Knezovich's attorney, Quentin Rhoades, contends the Forest Service wrongly factored in the resource benefits of letting the fire burn. Rhoades practices with the the Missoula firm Rhoades and Erickson.  “The problem is that it’s part of an overall bigger picture and that’s discretionary,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Nancy Moritz, appointed by Barack Obama. “You’re not suggesting that that initial decision was made based only on that factor.”  Rhoades maintained the federal government is prohibited from considering resource benefits at all when managing a manmade fire.  “What you can’t do as a firefighter in this case is say 'the fire might do the forest a lot of good if we just let it burn' — your judgment does not apply in this context,” Rhoades argued. “That’s not an abuse of discretion, it’s not a mistake, it's flatly prohibited.”  Department of Justice Attorney Levi Martin asked the court to follow the lead set by the 2016 Hardscrabble Ranch case and affirm. But the Hardscrabble case hinged on the Forest Service following a decision checklist, not avoiding a certain factor.  “When you’re directed to not consider something, that removes it, and that seems different from Hardscrabble to me,” observed U.S. Circuit Judge Veronica Rossman, appointed by Joe Biden.  Martin countered that any differences were minimal.  “It’s too fine a point to make a difference,” Martin said. “It’s the flipside of the same coin.” He added: “The fire was in a dangerous location, they couldn’t access it and they didn’t have the resources to address it,” Martin reminded the court.  But the panel wondered whether the question was best answered by a jury.  “Might they have fought this fire the exact same way, isn’t that a jury question,” prodded U.S. Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich, appointed by George W. Bush.  Knezovich requested the case be revived for further discovery.  Asked for comment, Forest Service press officer John Winn said in an email, “We respect the court's decision and we encourage all visitors to remember to check for current fire risk, weather events and be well prepared. The safety of visitors and adjacent communities to national forests is one of our top priorities.”  The court did not indicate when or how it will decide the case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9yb29zZXZlbHQtZmlyZS12aWN0aW1zLWFzay0xMHRoLWNpcmN1aXQtdG8tcmV2aXZlLWNsYWltcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcmVzdC1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The youngest is a newborn.  Example video title will go here for this video  TACOMA, Wash. — A Tacoma family of 11 sifted through what’s left of their belongings after the home they lived in was destroyed in a fire nearly one week ago.  “We put pieces of what we can together but even anything we are able to pull out is so smokey and damaged and charred,” said Destany Droge, who escaped from the burning home.  Sentimental pieces like Destany’s late grandmother’s Bible were destroyed. But on May 12, what matters most barely made it out.  “Live every day like it's your last because you never know. We were two seconds away from not making it out of there,” Doge said.  Around 4:30 a.m. on May 12, while everyone was asleep, Kaihla Koroshes woke up to flames.  “I saw some light and it took me a minute to realize it wasn’t the sunrise. I realized it was a fire and I ran out of my room and up the stairs and screamed for all of them to get up and the house was on fire,” said Koroshes.  Eleven people were inside the home including seven kids, the youngest is a newborn. Koroshes went back multiple times to get everyone out, including 15-year-old Kayli, but the home was engulfed.  Kayli was able to get the window open and her mother Destany told her to jump.  “I just kept screaming and no one could hear me. I laid there and I couldn't breathe so I opened the window and jumped out,” said Kaylianna Bezk.  Kayli made what would be a life-saving jump from the second-story window, but now has a long road to recovery. She is still suffering from lung issues and was on life support for nearly three days.  The fire is believed to have started on the back porch but the cause remains unknown.  The family’s dog made it out, but the cat is still missing. The biggest concern for the family is where they will stay next. The family of 11 is staying in an Airbnb, but needs to find a new house by Friday.  “Don’t take anything for granted because you could have everything one day and wake up the next with nothing,” Droge said.  The family set up a GoFundMe to help with expenses and to find permanent housing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdGFjb21hLWZhbWlseS1kaXNwbGFjZWQtaG9tZS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtZmlyZS8yODEtMTU4MWU3MDMtODdlNi00ZWU0LWE0ZmQtMGRmZmE5MDFiMGU50gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3RhY29tYS1mYW1pbHktZGlzcGxhY2VkLWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWZpcmUvMjgxLTE1ODFlNzAzLTg3ZTYtNGVlNC1hNGZkLTBkZmZhOTAxYjBlOQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A witness told firefighters, a family member had been smoking a cigarette on the balcony, and discarded it into a cardboard box containing old cigarette butts.

"fire","2023-07-05","14:00:00","{""Akron"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:11:29","A new No. 12 fire station will serve Akron's west side neighborhoods next year, replacing a building that functioned for decades along West Market Street near the rail crossing through the city's Wallhaven neighborhood.  City officials gathered Tuesday morning to break ground on the new fire station, which will be constructed just south of Wallhaven's central crossroads.  “Today was an exciting day for the entire Akron community and especially for the residents here in Ward 4,” Mayor Dan Horrigan said. “In 2018, we broke ground on Fire Station 2 in Middlebury, which was the first new fire station in Akron in 22 years. Now, just a few short years later, we’re happy to break ground on yet another new fire station — making it the third one in five years and marking our latest investment into Akron Fire.”  Station 12 will join Station 2 and Station 4 among the latest to be replaced. The city already has begun discussions to evaluate which station will be up next for replacement, the mayor's office said.  Here is what we know so far about the new No. 12 fire station:  Where will the new fire station be built?  The new No. 12 fire station will be at 112 S. Hawkins, close to the busy intersection of Market Street, Hawkins Avenue and Exchange Street. It will be just to the south of Westgate Circle and the Swensons Drive-In.  The city will install a new signal light directly in front of the fire station on South Hawkins Ave to alert drivers when emergency vehicles are exiting the property.  When will the fire station be ready?  Officials believe the new station will be fully operational in the summer of 2024.  It will be 14,959 square feet and cost approximately $9.5 million. The current fire station on West Market Street is 7,066 square feet.  The station will have nine beds and, at a minimum, will have a crew of six firefighter/medics, an engine, and a med unit.  It will feature three full apparatus bays as well as equipment decontamination facilities and an air-drying hose tower.  How is the city of Akron paying for the new fire station?  The funds paying for new fire station are generated from a ballot measure approved by Akron voters in 2017; the charter amendment known as Issue 4 created a .25% income tax to pay for roads and emergency services.  Fire Chief Joseph Natko said the new station is an investment in the city's safety that ""will serve this area for many years to come.”  “Station 12 has been serving the Akron community for 72 years, averaging almost 3,000 calls in 2022,” Natko said. “This new building will help our firefighter/medics better serve Akron and will keep our firefighters safer as they answer the call to protect our residents.""  What will happen to the old station?  The old station No. 12 will be decommissioned once its replacement is up and running, city officials said. Details about what the city plans to do with the property, which sits across from an Acme Fresh Market, were not immediately available.

"fire","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:38:48","PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh’s aging fire trucks are in such bad shape that the city has now been forced to buy used trucks from local volunteer fire departments.  It’s a potentially critical problem that could impact your safety.  Rick Earle discovered that a controversial decision to cancel a fire truck order last year is now having an impact on the failing fleet.  Earle: Have you seen this?  Anthony Coghill, Pittsburgh City Council: What is that, the old truck that we just bought?  Earle: Yes.  Coghill: How many years old is it?  Earle: 25.  Earle showed Coghill a Facebook post from the Emsworth Volunteer Fire Company that contains a picture of the 1998 American LaFrance engine that served the Borough of Emsworth for over 20 years.  The Facebook post indicates that the truck is now “onto its next life with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire.”  Earle: I’m assuming this truck is going into the Pittsburgh Fire History Museum?  Coghill: Yea, it’s going down to the Carnegie Science Center. No, it’s a serious problem.  The problem is so serious that the city has had to resort to buying used engines from volunteer departments. So far, they’ve purchased two. The city doesn’t have enough working fire trucks, so when one goes down, there’s no backup.  It’s a difficult predicament for a 630-member paid fire department.  Earle: Is this a little bit embarrassing?  Ralph Sicuro, Pittsburgh Fire Fighter Union President: Well, I wouldn’t say embarrassing. It’s a necessity when you have this lack of following a good plan of action to be able to replace our apparatus.  But the previous administration said they did have a plan.  Former Mayor Bill Peduto approved the purchase of three engines, with plans to buy two more trucks, but the Union balked at the purchase, claiming that the trucks didn’t meet the specifications needed to survive the hilly Pittsburgh terrain and the rugged winter weather.  The Peduto administration disagreed, saying that while not the top of the line, they would do just fine.  Peduto authorized the purchases, and the city ordered the trucks. But when Peduto lost the election, the new administration canceled the entire order.  Earle: If you had ordered them, you’d have them?  Sicuro: First of all, that would have absolutely had brought things in today, but they would not have lasted. They would not have been able to allow us to complete our mission. These were subpar apparatus.  After canceling the order last year, the city placed a new order for four new pumpers and two ladder trucks. But City Controller Michael Lamb said the city waited too long to place the new order.  “I’m not sure the cancellation was the problem, the problem was when they canceled, they didn’t order. They should have, they should have stepped up right at that moment and ordered new equipment,” said Lamb.  And now those ladder trucks won’t be in until July and Pumper trucks until next April, nearly a year away.  At times during the past couple of months, there have been no spare pumpers.  So when one goes down, firefighters have had to respond to calls in an SUV and wait for a pumper from a nearby station.  Earle: Is this a public safety crisis?  Sicuro: It is a crisis and the fact that if we don’t act, and we don’t develop a purchasing plan, remember, this is two years plus before we are going to get new apparatus in, so. Every day we allow this to go by without figuring out a plan and funding it, we’re going to be in a bigger problem.  Sicuro is now urging the city of Pittsburgh to implement an annual purchasing plan so this doesn’t ever happen again.  “We have to take action soon by getting an order in place, getting it paid for, and moving on to the next one to the next one, year after year, in order to replace the fleet, we currently have and have enough proper spare apparatus for when things go down,” said Sicuro.  “We need the administration to step up, pull the trigger. Let’s get a plan to renew this equipment because I said the next two years is going to be difficult. We’re going to be seeing more purchases like this,” said Lamb.  Councilman Coghill, who sits on the Equipment Leasing Authority that’s responsible for purchasing fire trucks and all other city vehicles, said he hears the message, loud and clear.  “We see the need. The administration sees the need as well. It’s a matter of finding the right monies in order to up the fleet. It’s going to be costly. It’s going to be tough decisions to be made by council, but to me, nothing’s more important than getting our public safety from point A to point B,” said Coghill.  Even with the addition of the two used fire trucks, Sicuro called it a band-aid solution.  Controller Lamb said the city will likely be forced to buy more used fire trucks just to get by until the new trucks come in.  Download the FREE WPXI News app for breaking news alerts.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""LauderdaleByTheSea"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:14:08","LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. – Judson Hopping is the chief of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea’s volunteer fire department, where firefighters are paid for calls they respond to.  Hopping recently had a hunch that something was not right.  He noticed Deputy Chief John Louvaris was paid for a call he didn’t respond to.  “I knew that people were signing up for calls that were not present for the calls,” said Hopping. “I was on shift and he was not there, but she gave him credit for it.”  He is talking about the department’s secretary, one of only two full-time employees, who kept track of the call sheets.  She is Cheryl Louvaris, the deputy chief’s wife.  “I had a suspicion that she was taking sheets home and having her husband sign for them,” Hopping said.  There were other irregularities, including missing supplies and equipment, so Hopping set up some cameras.  “I have her on camera talking to her husband, who was sitting in the office with her,” he said. “She kept telling him, ‘you were on this call, sign this’ and she went to hand him the sheet, and someone came in the office and she pulls it back.”  Hopping said he also caught John Louvaris stealing gas.  “That’s fuel we use for the ATV’s and Jet Skis, and what do we see him doing there? He’s putting gas into his personal truck,” said Hopping. “Walking from behind one of the apparatus with a five gallon gas can and walking over to his personal vehicle and dispensing the gasoline in his personal vehicle.”  Local 10 News’ Christina Vazquez asked Hopping if he thinks this is the first time Louvaris has done this, or if it’s the first time he was caught on camera.  “I believe that was the first time he was caught on camera,” Hopping replied.  Court records show that in 2009, John Louvaris faced a misdemeanor charge related to stealing gas. He plead no contest and agreed to pay just over $500 in restitution to an Oakland Park BP gas station. The restitution order can be seen at the bottom of this story.  Hopping said at the time, Louvaris was suspended, but he was allowed to come back to work when the matter was resolved.  He said last week the majority of department membership voted to fire John Louvaris, and the chief fired Cheryl Louvaris for this, and he says for showing a firefighters his, and another firefighter’s, personal and confidential information, to include financial data about their pensions.  “It puts a black eye on our department, for the actions of two people,” said Hopping. “I did catch it, I acted on my suspicions and I caught them.”  The video footage has been shared with the Broward Sheriff’s Office, which told Local 10 News they are looking into it.  Hopping said John Louvaris had been with the department since 2005 while Cheryl Louvaris was employed there beginning in 2008.  Local 10 News has confirmed with the mayor of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea and Pompano Beach Fire Rescue that the two municipalities are in final negotiations for Pompano Beach to provide fire services to Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, a change that could happen by late summer.  When asked if he thinks equipment, materials and supplies are disappearing from the station because of the upcoming change, Hopping responded, “I believe some of it does. I really think it has been going on for a while.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NhbDEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbGF1ZGVyZGFsZS1ieS10aGUtc2VhLXZvbHVudGVlci1maXJlLWNoaWVmLW5vdGljZWQtZGVwdXR5LWNoaWVmLXNlY3JldGFyeS13ZXJlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""There were several adult dogs inside and they had gone toward the bedroom but got stuck. And no way to get out."" Okandogs Vice President Jan Short said.

I just think they were just totally shocked and fear.""  Okandogs opened in 2014 to help the humane society when it ran out of space. Short originally wanted to care for a few dogs at a time, but things changed.  ""At the time, all shelters neutered and spayed at six or eight weeks.

""All dogs get spayed, neutered, microchipped, and rabies (shots), and all other shots that are required before they're released.""  Currently, Okandogs looks after 74 dogs and rescues more than 625 dogs a year.  Short asks people who want to adopt their dogs to have a fully fenced yard appropriate to the size of the dog. They will also need a daily plan that supports potty training, socializing and bonding time.  Information and Okandogs' adoption application can be found here.  As for the homeowner who lost his home and 25 dogs to the fire, Short says he didn't ask for the surviving dogs back.  ""He's disabled.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WOLO)— It’s been 100 years since a deadly fire killed 77 people who were unable to escape a Camden Schoolhouse in 1923.  Governor Henry McMaster and other local officials honored the lives lost at the site where the Cleveland School and Theatre once stood.  According to Chief John Bowers with the Camden Fire Department, the fire was started by an oil lamp that burst on the school’s stage during a play.  Bowers says the fire is considered the deadliest fire in South Carolina history and the National Fire Protection Association reports it as the fourth deadliest fire in U.S. history.  As people scrambled to exit the building, others rushed in to help — making it harder for everyone to escape.  Bowers says the coroner was also killed in the fire, making it even harder to identify those who died.  Sisters Phyllis Wainscott and Pamela Morris say their grandmother survived the fire. Their great uncle however, did not.  “To see the things that my grandmother talked about and to hear the facts that I had no idea it was so.. um… Some of the horrendous things that they actually went through, and the stairwell being so tight and packed. And people being thrown out the windows. Children, many children being saved that I’ve met today…their descendants…who were saved because they were thrown out of a window by an adult,” recalls Phyllis Wainscott along with her sister Pamela Morris.  Ann Seegars lost five family members to the fire.  “My mother in law’s mother, and brother and sister, and sister-in-law and child were all burned at one time. Plus there was other family members too,” says Seegars.  She recalls that her family didn’t speak about that night very often, saying, “I think it was such a tragedy until you would just get some facts, but not the horror of it.”  According to Chief Bowers, the Cleveland School Fire helped change fire codes and laws across the state and the nation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiY2NvbHVtYmlhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3LzEwMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1zY2hvb2wtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chief Shawn Esler of the Waterville Fire-Rescue Department said Wednesday the blaze was first reported at about 9:40 p.m. as a tree on fire, but firefighters then learned a building was on fire at 100 Silver St., the same address as an apartment building.  Firefighters found flames at the rear of the 1 1/2-story, two-bay garage used for storage, according to Esler. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly, he said.  “The fire appears to have originated in a designated smoking area and extended into the garage,” Esler wrote in an email. “Vegetation and leaves surrounding the garage contributed to the fire spread. The fire was contained to the building of origin.”  He said the fire is not considered suspicious and investigators are gathering more information.  “We will consider the fire undetermined until we speak with a few more people in the area,” Esler said.  He said the garage contained items for the apartment building, including furniture and building materials.  Winslow firefighters assisted city firefighters at the scene, and Oakland firefighters covered the city station, according to Esler.  No one was injured due to the fire, he said.

DEP Deputy Commissioner David Madore said the fire might have damaged some gas infrastructure at the landfill, which is being evaluated.  But the department is not monitoring the air quality around the site after the Monday fire, which burned for four hours before being contained. He said no more emissions are coming from the site since the fire was put out.  Madore also said responders prevented any water runoff used to fight the fire from entering local rivers. He said DEP staff will return to the site on Thursday.  Environmental activists have criticized Casella Waste Systems' management of the site and how it handles toxic sludge in recent years. Its proposed expansion and acceptance of out-of-state trash has also faced criticism from locals who worry about the landfill's environmental impact on their area.  Don't Waste ME's Ed Spencer, who lives in West Old Town, said both the state and Casella need to be more forthcoming about how such incidents happen and when they happen.  ""We want to know what happened and... exactly what is going on in as real time as possible,"" he said.  Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis said he is still looking for answers after tribal members complained about burning eyes and sore throats in the wake of the fire. He said it's an especially pressing issue as the region is right in the middle of the fiddlehead harvesting season.  ""So yeah, we had, we had a lot of concerns, and we still do,"" he said.  Francis says he is working with the tribe's local U.S. Environmental Protection Agency trustee to get information about the fire.

Now it was the Marshall Fire Department’s turn to go inside.  On Tuesday evening the building’s interior was getting smoky, with the help of burning straw bales. In a back room, a pair of firefighters crouched down and aimed a hose like they would at a real fire scene.  “You want to get the ceiling,” said Fire Chief Quentin Brunsvold as he helped lead the training exercise.  As firefighters pointed the hose upward, the water knocked down ceiling tiles and insulation. Meanwhile, different groups of firefighters were preparing to do search and rescue training at the front of the building, and on the upper floor.  Getting to hold training at the former C&N Game Room Outlet on Tuesday was a good opportunity for the fire department, Brunsvold said.  “We don’t typically get a lot of commercial buildings available for this kind of work,” Brunsvold said.  The C&N building was eventually headed for demolition, but first Lockwood Motors had made it available for emergency responder training.  Brunsvold said the fire department had a variety of training exercises planned that night. The design of the building gave them a chance to use different tactics than they would use at a house fire.  “We don’t get a lot of practice cutting flat roofs,” he said. The fact that the building had a second story also opened up opportunities for aerial training.  The fire training did attract some attention from people in the neighborhood around East College Drive and Sunrise Lane. A few local residents gathered near the property to watch the fire trucks and the training exercises.  Brunsvold said the fire department had put the word out on social media about the training earlier in the day.  “We wanted everyone to know it’s just training,” he said. Although there was smoke at the property, there wasn’t a threat to the public.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnNoYWxsaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3Ntb2tlLWFuZC1maXJlLWJ1dC1qdXN0LXRyYWluaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Valley Air District encourages residents to be prepared and plan for potential poor air quality due to wildfire smoke that might reach the Valley as we head into the hotter, drier time of the year. Predicting the severity of the fire season is always challenging, particularly with ever-changing conditions and weather patterns.  The District reminds residents to change out air filters in their home and set up a Clean Air Room for when smoke impacts become severe. A Clean Air Room is a room in your home or apartment where you and your family can escape the worst of the smoke impacts from wildfires.  Residents can follow a few easy steps to create a Clean Air Room.  Choose a room where your entire family can relax and spend the majority of their time; prevent smoke from entering the room by tightly closing doors and windows. Stay cool. Run fans, window air conditioners or central air conditioning; filter the air in the room with a store-bought air purifier or create a DIY air purifier.  Also, avoid creating smoke or other particles indoors (no candles, no open flame cooking, no smoking); spend as much time as possible in the clean air room to get the most benefits; and remember cloth masks don’t work for wildfire smoke, choose N95 masks instead.  Hot and dry conditions throughout the San Joaquin Valley can create the potential for wildfires and lead to smoke impacts in the region. Due to historic rain and snow this past winter, there is the risk of an increased build-up of undergrowth and potential for significant dry vegetation during the summer months. This will present a higher risk for hotter, faster-moving fires in mountain communities surrounding the Valley, often sending smoke into the San Joaquin Valley.  Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter (PM), which can trigger asthma attacks, aggravate chronic bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Those with existing respiratory conditions are especially susceptible to the adverse health effects of this form of pollution. Anyone experiencing poor air quality due to wildfire smoke should move indoors to a filtered, air-conditioned environment with windows closed and contact their primary care provider for more information.  The public can check the District’s wildfire page at www.valleyair.org/wildfires for information about any wildfires affecting the Valley. In addition, anyone can follow air quality conditions by downloading the free “Valley Air” app on their mobile device.  For more information, visit www.valleyair.org or call the District office in Modesto at 209-557-6400.  The Valley Air District covers eight counties including San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and San Joaquin Valley air basin portions of Kern.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ha2RhbGVsZWFkZXIuY29tL25ld3MvdmFsbGV5LWFpci1kaXN0cmljdC11cmdlcy1maXJlLXNlYXNvbi1wcmVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Marathon said the cause of the Monday morning fire was under investigation. Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.  Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.

The fire at 118 White House School Road was reported at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Chief Don French of the Madison Fire Department.  The family of five, which includes three young children, was dining out at the time, leaving five dogs at home.  None of the pets was hurt because a passerby happened to spot the fire and let the dogs out of the single-story house before calling firefighters, French said.  The house was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, he said. A nearby pickup truck also sustained minor damage.  The blaze drew firefighters from Madison, Anson, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Starks. French said firefighters were at the scene until about 10 p.m.  The Office of State Fire Marshal has conducted an investigation, French said, and believes one of the family’s dogs inadvertently turned on one of the burners. It is not clear if the dog was trying to reach food on the stove.  “The stove wasn’t on when the homeowner left. They checked it,” French said. “We believe that the dog turned one of the valves on the stove, and there was something on top of the stove that probably caught fire. They said macaroni and cheese, or something like that.”  The family was with a relative Wednesday, French said, while the American Red Cross was trying to find a place for the family to stay.

Luckily, the fire didn't spread and was contained to the building where it started, he said.  There were no injuries.  He didn't say what could have been in the building. Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  The incident is being classified as a two-alarm at this time. The Indiana State fire marshal was on scene as of at least 5:30 a.m. to assist with the use of a drone.  Multiple roadways around the blaze had been closed, but by 7 a.m. the main closure was Northwest Fourth Street heading into downtown.  Larson said it's too early to talk about a cause, but firefighters will be on scene likely into the afternoon tamping down hot spots.  Contamination from the property was the subject of a lawsuit filed in August 2017 by public nonprofit broadcaster WNIN. At that time, WNIN’s studios were at the adjacent Historic Carpenter Home.  Pearl Cleaners applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.  A plan filed in that lawsuit documented a 250-foot wide plume of groundwater contaminated with the solvent PCE on the Pearl Cleaners site.

A fire ripped through the hostel in New Zealand's capital Tuesday, killing multiple people and forcing others to flee the four-story building in their pajamas in what a fire chief called his ""worst nightmare."" (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  New Zealand police say they plan to start removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where at least six people were killed in a fire  WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand police said Thursday they plan to start removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where at least six people were killed in a fire.  Police Inspector Dion Bennett said they were aiming to remove the first two bodies from Loafers Lodge on Thursday and the next two on Friday. Bennett said it's possible they could find more victims as officers continue their scene examination.  “The damage on the third floor is significant,” Bennett told reporters. “The debris is piled high, and there is much for them to move and search underneath.”  Police say the believe the fire was arson and have launched a homicide investigation.  Bennett said they haven't yet arrested anybody but they have a list of people they want to speak to and hope to quickly identify any suspects. He declined to say if they had found accelerant or other evidence of criminal behavior at the scene.  Police said there had been a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire on Tuesday. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The homicide investigation represents a change in outlook by police, who initially said they didn't believe the fire was deliberately lit.  Bennett said police had accounted for 92 people who were in the hostel and had a list of others who remained unaccounted for, although were not necessarily missing. Police had earlier said they expected that the final death toll would be fewer than 10 people.  News outlet RNZ identified Liam Hockings, a journalist, as one of the hostel's residents who was missing. Hockings is the brother of the BBC presenter Lucy Hockings.  The fire ripped through the building early Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or dived from windows.  The Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the nation's building codes did not require sprinklers in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  “I have asked the Minister for Housing to look particularly at issues around building regulations to see whether there’s anything more that we should be doing right at this point,"" Hipkins told reporters Wednesday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcG9saWNlLWhvc3RlbC1maXJlLWtpbGxlZC02LWFyc29uLTk5Mzg0Mzg40gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcG9saWNlLWhvc3RlbC1maXJlLWtpbGxlZC02LWFyc29uLTk5Mzg0Mzg4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After that month of unanswered questions from residents about the state of their local fire department, a unanimous vote by the Fire Territory Advisory Board will have the Lakeville Volunteer Fire Department back up and running under a new administrative fire chief.  “The firemen themselves have one person to go to for paperwork, us as a fire territory board have one sole person we can go to, the administrative chief, to oversee that,” explains Patrick Howard, the Town of Lakeville Representative on the Fire Territory Board.  The administrative chief will act as a liaison between the volunteer firefighters and the board, which will help prevent logistic issues that caused the sudden shutdown in the first place.  Just last month, the department stopped fire service because paperwork issues caused issues with its insurance.  Volunteer firefighters will now need to be hired on as employees of Union Township in order to be properly insured.  “Until the non-for-profit can come back, the best course of action to get these men back out there and serving the community was to take them on as employees of Union Township, and at that point they can have insurance coverage again,” Howard says.  Once the administrative chief and the 14 volunteers who've applied are officially hired, Southwest Fire Territory won’t have to keep covering Lakeville calls.  “It will be directed to them that we do have our firemen in place, and we can respond to emergency calls,” Howard explains.  Southwest Fire Territory will still assist with mutual aid if needed.  The board expects to officially hire the chief and volunteer firefighters Friday, then the department can get back up and running.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzU3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xha2V2aWxsZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtdXBkYXRlLXB1YmxpYy1vbi1sb2NhbC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The company is recalling certain Cherokees from the 2014 through 2016 model years. Water can get into the liftgate control computer, causing an electrical short that can touch off a fire.  The company says it hasn’t developed a fix yet. Owners will get notification letters starting June 30. Stellantis says the problem was caught in a routine review of customer data.  It’s not clear how many of the small SUVs have caught fire. Stellantis says in documents posted Tuesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has 50 customer assistance records, 23 warranty claims and 21 field reports due to the issue.

The fire erupted late Sunday night from a garage within a townhome complex on Aspen Court in White Bear Lake. A criminal complaint states 911 callers reported hearing “things blowing up.”  When police arrived, a man pointed officers in the direction of his son, 45-year-old Christian Thomas Dahm.  “He’s over there. He started the fire,” the man said.  Dahm was found naked except for a pair of pants around his ankles, and he fell limp when police handcuffed him and had to be carried away.  Christian Thomas Dahm (Courtesy of Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office)  The wife of Dahm’s father was rescued from the residence, though she had trouble breathing and had suffered some burn injuries. She was brought to Regions Hospital in critical condition and remained on a ventilator as of Tuesday, the complaint states.  While in custody, Dahm told an investigator that he was working on a fishing pole over a pan of motor oil when he lit a cigarette with a torch.  “All of a sudden, there was a fire,” Dahm told investigators.  Accounts from Dahm’s father and a neighbor indicate Dahm was yelling, throwing things around and making banging noises in the garage in the moments leading up to the fire.  Dahm’s father and his wife were allegedly concerned Dahm was high on methamphetamine and went to check on him. When they opened the door to the garage, Dahm’s father said it was “like everything exploded,” charging documents state.  A witness recalled seeing “flames hurling out of the garage.”  Dahm is charged with one count of negligent fires resulting in great bodily harm, but the complaint notes more charges could be added as the investigation unfolds. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.  At Dahm’s initial court appearance Wednesday morning, a judge set his bail at $50,000. He remains in custody, jail records show. His next hearing is scheduled for June 9.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4tY29ubmVjdGlvbi13aXRoLXdoaXRlLWJlYXItbGFrZS1mb3VycGxleC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

RELATED: Firefighters respond after fire breaks out at home just north of downtown  When fire crews arrived at the two-story home, located in the 800 block of W. Poplar Street, they found flames coming from the second floor.  “They did a search of the structure, and the search came back that nobody was actually inside at the time,” said Battalion Chief David Prado with SAFD.  Firefighters quickly began attacking the fire, which made its way into the attic.  Firefighters can be seen in the second floor window, trying to attack the flames which had burned into the attic. (KSAT 12 News)  Although they found the ground-floor doors and windows boarded up, they also found evidence that someone had found a way inside the house.  “Clothes, there’s food items,” Prado said. “So we do believe that people were squatting in this structure.”  Victor Villarreal, who lives across the street, says he knows for a fact that has been happening.  “Every day you see people going in and out,” Villarreal said. “They crawl up that drainpipe, go into the second story window and come back down and open the back door for everyone else.”  West Poplar house fire image. (KSAT)  Villarreal said he has called San Antonio police dozens of times during the five years he has lived in the neighborhood.  However, he says, the intruders are able to conceal themselves from officers.  According to SAPD records, officers have been called to the home for suspicious activity five times since the beginning of this year. It is unclear whether any of those calls resulted in arrests.  As of late Wednesday morning, police had not provided that information.  Villarreal said while the owners moved out a few years ago, the home has been a neighborhood fixture for generations.  Real estate records online show it was built in 1929.  “It’s sad because, like I said, it’s one of the oldest houses in the neighborhood,” Villarreal said. “I hate to see it go like that.”  Investigators, so far, have not determined the exact cause of the fire, nor have they made any arrests.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9maXJlLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtbG9va2luZy1pbnRvLXJlcG9ydHMtb2Ytc3F1YXR0ZXJzLXNlZW4taW5zaWRlLWhvbWUtdGhhdC1idXJuZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This time, 21-year-old Brandon Cambridge was the star man, scoring a match-winning brace in just his 3 rd career MLS appearance.  First Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey, Malanda, Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram  Charlotte FC dominated the early stages of the match with the lion’s share of possession. This dominance resulted in two big penalty shouts, both involving Enzo Copetti but neither of which was awarded by referee Tori Penso.  Ten minutes into the match, a passage of good play resulted in Brandt Bronico slipping Copetti in behind. His aggressive first touch got him on the wrong side of the defender, and it appeared he was barged over from behind. Penso and VAR didn’t share the opinion of the CLTFC players or home crowd, though, and no penalty was given.  It only took fifteen minutes for Copetti to be involved in yet another contentious decision. This time, Ashley Westwood played a well-weighted long ball over the top for Copetti, who took his first touch beyond the Chicago defender. The Argentine went down from a last-ditch sliding challenge, but again was not rewarded with a penalty.  Chicago got themselves back in the game following the first 25 minutes of CLTFC dominance. Kristijan Kahlina made an excellent point blank save in the 27th minute, but Kacper Przybylko was able to slot one past him two minutes later on a breakaway. Kahlina had initially made a high caliber 1v1 stop, but the unlucky rebound fell directly back to the Polish striker to pass into an empty net.  From there, the half wound down with a few half chances for both sides. The Crown dominated possession and the Fire mainly looked to play on the break, but neither could find a clear chance before halftime.  Second Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey (59’), Malanda (84’), Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram (90’)  Substitutions: Cambridge (59’), Tuiloma (84’), Hegardt (90’)  Charlotte FC came out of the gates hot again to start the second half, resulting in a similar narrative to the first. Copetti had two more potential penalties waved off – one a handball on the Chicago defender, one a pull-back on Copetti’s shirt – and the Crown couldn’t get on the board.  Head Coach Christian Lattanzio quickly made a tactical shift by bringing in winger Brandon Cambridge for defender Jaylin Lindsey at the 60th minute. Adilson Malanda shifted to right back and Derrick Jones to center back, which enabled Swiderski to play as the central attacking midfielder and Cambridge as the right winger.  The change paid immediate dividends when Justin Meram played a clever pass to Cambridge across the top of the box. Cambridge coolly side footed the ball into the far post with his weaker left foot for the equalizer and his first career MLS goal.  From there the Crown began pouring on the pressure. Cambridge played in an inch perfect cross that barely evaded Swiderski on the far post. Then, Swiderski whipped in a deep free kick for Jan Sobocinski, whose glancing header was well saved by Fire goalkeeper Chris Brady.  Eventually CLTFC got their reward for the sustained pressure, and it was again Cambridge in just his third MLS appearance who found the winner. Nathan Byrne curled in a good cross for the winger on the back post. He settled the ball down, took a good prep touch out of his feet, and passed into the far post with his left foot again to put Charlotte FC in the lead.  Down the stretch, Lattanzio made substitutions to secure the result, with Bill Tuiloma featuring for the first time in a few weeks following his recovery from a muscle injury and Chris Hegardt providing extra energy on the wing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZWZvb3RiYWxsY2x1Yi5jb20vbmV3cy9mdWxsLXRpbWUtY2hhcmxvdHRlLWZjLXNob3ctcmVzaWxpZW5jZS1pbi13aW4tb3Zlci1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225. The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association and offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters may remain anonymous if they wish.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

Mosser is currently working four-hour afternoon shifts while she is being trained.  Mosser’s start date was May 15.  Council approved a motion to pay bills totaling $37,494.33.  The Wellsville Foundation’s request for a road closure on Riverside between Seventh and Eighth streets on June 16 for a block party which will serve as a fundraiser for the foundation was approved.  Ordinances for prohibiting the use of electronic devices while operating a motor vehicle in the village and modifying the division of sewerage fund revenues were placed on first read.  An ordinance to increase appropriations for current expenses in the village passed on first read by emergency measure with an all-in-favor vote.  Also approved was an opportunity for village employees to meet with a representative from Globe Life to talk about what insurance coverage they need. Each employee will be eligible for $3,000 of accidental death insurance at no cost to them.  In her report Fiscal Officer Hoi Wah noted that the village has spent about $69,000 of the $70,000 grant received for the marina project and has completed just about everything that was on the list.  In his report Mayor Bob Boley asked everyone to spread the word that the ELCH Wellsville Clinic is open, and that Consumers National Bank will be open in the former Huntington location on May 30.  Boley requested that council draft an ordinance requiring signs be taken down within a week of the event they were posted for. The village is having issues with event signage being put up in the village and left up for months. A motion was approved to draft an ordinance that would require posters to have the signs removed within a week following the event or face a misdemeanor charge with up to a $150 fine.

The fire, called in at 12:40 p.m., was brought under control in a half hour by 30 to 40 firefighters, Chief Jaye Sims of the Freehold Borough Fire Department said. No one was injured.  “If you’ve ever smelled burnt coffee in a pot, that’s what it smelled like,” Sims said.  Firefighters from Freehold Township, Howell, Manalapan, Marlboro and Naval Weapons Station Earl joined the borough department to fight the fire because of the size of the plant, Sims said.

Spanknebel and the Hadley Fire Department hosted Massachusetts State Fire Marshal Peter J. Ostroskey and a side-by-side prop that demonstrated the power of fire sprinklers to save lives and property.  The Department of Fire Services’ side-by-side sprinkler trailer set up at American Legion Post 271 on May 16, the third day of Home Fire Sprinkler Week. The trailer contains two rooms with identical furnishings. On room was protected by a single sprinkler head, and the other was not. Before a crowd of residents and municipal officials, DFS personnel ignited a small fire in the wastebasket of each room. The fire in the first room was completely extinguished within seconds, causing minimal damage. The fire in the second room grew unchecked, consuming everything inside and presenting unsurvivable conditions in about two minutes. Hadley firefighters extinguished it before it grew even further.  “Firefighters know that sprinklers protect people, pets, and property,” said Chief Spanknebel. “This demonstration lets residents see that fact for themselves. By containing or even extinguishing a fire while it’s still small, a single sprinkler head can give you time to use your home escape plan and get out safely. Firefighters are much less likely to be injured in a fire where sprinklers are in use, and the damage is much less likely to displace residents for an extended period of time.”  “Fire is fast, but sprinklers are faster,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Today’s demonstration made the safety benefits as clear as day. It also showed that a single sprinkler head uses much less water to suppress a small fire than firefighters have to use when they extinguish a big one. The products of combustion, from greenhouse gas emissions to burned synthetic materials in water runoff, are much lower when sprinklers are in play. If you’re building or buying a home, remember that sprinklers aren’t just safety tools – they’re green technology.”  Local fire departments can request the side-by-side sprinkler trailer for their own demonstrations through the Department of Fire Services’ web page.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) joins in cautioning Michiganders about the danger of fires under current weather conditions. In particular, EGLE notes that it is illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  For more details, check EGLE’s open burning webpage.  Warm temperatures, winds and winter buildup of dry grasses and leaves have pushed fire danger to very high levels across the Lower Peninsula.  Map showing where fire danger currently exists in Michigan.  “People need to be careful when doing any outdoor activity that could spark a wildfire,” said Don Klingler, Michigan Department of Natural Resources resource manager for the southern Lower Peninsula. “These fuels can ignite very easily.”  Nine out of 10 wildfires are caused by people, and yard debris burning is the top cause of wildfires in Michigan.  Burn permits will not be issued for the next few days, Klingler said. It’s always critical to check Michigan.gov/BurnPermit before you start your fire to make sure weather conditions allow for safe burning. In southern Lower Peninsula communities, consult local fire authorities.  Fire danger goes up when weather is hot and dry and increases even more when it’s windy. Windborne embers can travel far and fast, turning a small fire into a large one. Lightning strikes are also an issue if stormy weather is predicted.  Due to the increased fire danger, the DNR has suspended most prescribed burns over the next few days.  Snow is still present in parts of the Upper Peninsula, but people should exercise caution in areas without snow.  Safety tips to keep fires under control  When you’re working with fire or equipment outdoors, keep in mind that fires can take off very fast and that the remains of a fire smolder for some time. Here are some tips to keep it safe out there:  Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.

Rick Graves with Portland Fire & Rescue points out some of the fire damage to the May apartment building on May 17, 2023, in Portland, Ore. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said the third and fourth stories of The May apartments were gutted.  “And the first and second floors are going to have significant water damage,” he said. “If it’s deemed unsafe, people may not be able to enter and get their items.”  The fire started at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city. More than a half-dozen large hoses and several smaller hoses were trained on the building for hours as residents scrambled to safety.  Graves said the basement has been essentially turned into a swimming pool. Oil tanks used for the building’s furnace system are leaking. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services is looking into possible runoff into the stormwater system.  During a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Portland Fire & Rescue officials said they were considering sending an investigator through one of the building’s windows where they believe the fire may have started. The May apartments had a number of known electrical issues and code violations that appear to have gone unaddressed.  Structural engineers from the city are also on-site to review the safety of the building and neighboring structures. Fire officials on Wednesday said they are “very concerned” the building may collapse. Residents of two nearby apartment complexes have been allowed to briefly enter their apartment units, one by one, for up to five minutes to collect personal documents.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  The city said the owner of the damaged apartment building will need to hire an engineer to complete a full structural review and decide whether it should be repaired or demolished.  The Red Cross has organized a shelter at the University of Portland for the scores of displaced residents. An aid group called Team Farmer arrived on the scene Tuesday and provided 45 pizzas.  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Now that the smoke has cleared, it’s evident the unreinforced brick walls of the complex are bulging slightly.  “If the city engineer deems this a structure that is a danger, there will be an accelerated course put on it,” Graves said. “It’s usually fast-tracked on the demolition permit.”  The building’s fire alarm system was working during the fire, but many residents had grown weary of frequent false alarms and were ignoring it. So fire crews had to go floor by floor, alerting residents to exit the building immediately.  The fire spread aggressively, with explosive flashovers blowing windows out and sending shards of glass to the other side of a four-lane street. Graves said one firefighter was cut on his forehead.  “He lightly rubbed his forehead, looked at it, grunted, put his helmet back on, grabbed three saws at once and walked away,” Graves said. “He’s a monster.”  Another firefighter was sent to the hospital with an elevated blood pressure and is expected to be OK.  Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone said more than 80 firefighters responded to the scene, with help from dozens of others providing mutual emergency aid.  “I want to recognize and acknowledge the efforts and heroism displayed by the men and women of Portland Fire under the most hazardous of conditions,” Boone said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2FwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlLWRvd250b3duLXBvcnRsYW5kLW9yZWdvbi_SAV5odHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9hcGFydG1lbnQtZmlyZS1kb3dudG93bi1wb3J0bGFuZC1vcmVnb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Fire growth is exponentially faster than what it used to be,"" said Fire Chief Michael Spanknebel. ""So we would have 12-15 minutes before we would start seeing really heavy fire conditions. In today, you saw it was 2-3 minutes where we were at flashover at the room because of all those, the foams and the plastics and everything that are in modern construction and modern homes for furniture.""  In Massachusetts, typically a building’s size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system. On Tuesday, the fire department demonstrated what a home with a sprinkler would look like during a fire vs. one without.  Spanknebel said there are many myths about sprinklers which prevent people from using them, so he hopes the visual aid can offer a different perspective.  ""I just think because they see the commercial side of it where you have galvanized piping and extensive installs for a Walmart or Home Depot, where you see huge heads and piping all over the place,"" he said. ""This is basically a rated PVC piping, looks like a plumbing that you put in your walls. It's all done basically like plumbing.""  Spanknebel said another myth they hope to address is one around the amount of water that goes off during a home fire.  ""If one sprinkler head goes off, all of them don't off go off like you see in the movies,"" he said. ""That single head that's tripped by the heat is the only unit that will go off and it will control that fire, low amounts of water, so you can how much it saved the furniture, saved the room.""  Spanknebel said a sprinkler system can also buy people more time in the event of an emergency.  ""So that you have the time to get your family out of the house,"" Spanknebel said. ""And it's also saving the firefighters that are coming to your home to try and extinguish the fire. So if that sprinkler head can control that, that's gonna allow us the time to get there if needed, if the head doesn't take care of itself, it's gonna allow the time to extinguish it completely.""  Spanknebel encouraged everyone who may be considering building a new home to have a sprinkler system installed.

""In the past, we've only been able to train with acquired structures, and that really limited the amount of training we could do. With the new training facility we can replicate the training over and over again, and get all of our crews through consistently,"" says Scantlin.  The fire department says it's working to add even more props to other levels of the building. The new facility will host its official grand opening to the public Wednesday, May 24th.

The fire was called in just before 7 a.m. in the 9000 block of Wurzbach Road, not far from Datapoint Drive and Interstate 10.  Mark Trevino, a battalion chief with the San Antonio Fire Department, said they were able to do a partial search of the building and found nobody inside.  “As soon as we saw fire through the roof, we did what we could to do a search, as it has been known to have some people coming in and out,” Trevino said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.  The area, along with Wurzbach Road, was closed off to drivers as firefighters worked to put out hot spots.  “There’s hot spots right now since this is an older building and it’s a lot of wood structure. It’s got heavy wood floors and it’s built on different areas. There’s layer on top of layers so we have to get in there and tear into the building in order to get to the hot spots,” Trevino said.  Fire officials say the building will be demolished. Tuesday’s fire is the third time the fire department was called to the structure, as they responded back on Jan. 27 and previously on March 6, 2022.  “The structure is unstable. It’s unsafe so the city will have to go head and make it a hazard, so that it can’t get people involved and caught into,” Trevino said.  Anahi Martinez, a resident nearby, works at a building not far from the one that caught fire.  “I have a group chat with my work employees and my coworkers and they said there was a fire at the abandoned Japanese restaurant,” Martinez said. “I came out, I just saw all of the fire trucks, the ambulances.”  According to the San Antonio Fire Department website, as many as 14 units answered the call.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9maXJlZmlnaHRlcnMtcmVzcG9uZC10by1maXJlLWF0LWZvcm1lci1yZXN0YXVyYW50LW9uLW5vcnRod2VzdC1zaWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The location was off Turner Creek Road.  Bergstrom said fewer than 20 acres on private property were impacted. There were multiple burn piles, and the blaze initially started when one got out of control.  “Looking at the fuel models — types of ground material that could potentially ignite — the remoteness of the area, the terrain, lack of access, I called for a third alarm,” Bergstrom said. “This was not flat ground. This was steep timber terrain.”  Bergstrom said the “wildland model” for firefighting was activated for increased fire activity in this case. Different types of hoses came into play, for example, according to the chief.  “This doubled in size in less than 20 minutes,” Bergstrom said. “Structures were being threatened. Opting to go to a third alarm called in more resources, not just our immediate neighbors.”  In addition to Yamhill, agencies that responded to the callout were from Amity, Gaston, Grand Ronde Tribal, Lafayette, McMinnville and Tualatin Valley (Newberg).  There were 13 pieces of equipment and 35 firefighters on scene.  “This came extremely early in the year,” Bergstrom said of the fire. If this incident is any indication of the fire season that agencies might be facing this year, he said “it puts us on the ready.” He said this was the type of fire activity he would expect to see in June or July.  “Fuels have dried out,” the chief said. “We had an east wind and higher than normal temperature. The fuel moisture is dropping rapidly.”  In recent days, wildland fires were reported in the following locations: 21000 block of Dopp Road, Newberg; 3000 block Stoller Road, Dayton; 16000 block of Masonville Road, McMinnville; 28000 block of Andy Riggs Road, Grand Ronde, and 16000 block of Kings Grade Road, Newberg.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL25ld3NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZT9hcnRpY2xlVGl0bGU9dGhyZWUtYWxhcm0td2lsZGxhbmQtZmlyZS1idXJucy1ub3J0aHdlc3Qtb2YteWFtaGlsbC0tMTY4NDI1MTg1Ni0tNDYxMzctLTFob21lLW5ld3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-01","18:00:00","{""Quincy"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:33:57","QUINCY — Michele Talley said she got interested in firefighting right out of high school and has stayed interested ever since.  “I started as a volunteer firefighter in Southern California when I was 18,” she said. “When I got married and started a family, l left the fire service – and I missed it.”  So when she had the chance she started learning more about it.  “I went back to college, just to give myself something to do, and I started taking fire prevention, fire investigation classes, those kinds of things,” she said.  Talley has been a volunteer or on the paid staff in fire departments in three states. Currently, she is a lieutenant with Grant County Fire District 3 in Quincy, and earned certification as a fire marshal in April.  Her college instructor was part of the fire department in Apple Valley, California, a town that was big enough to have a paid staff.  “I got hired on there. It was mostly as an inspector, where you do fire and life safety inspections, public education kind of stuff, which I really enjoyed. I got my first taste of it then, back in my 20s,” she said.  Talley said she and husband Dave wanted a change and moved to the small Eastern Oregon town of Helix.  “I started volunteering at my local department and went up through the ranks, (became a) training officer, and became a district chief there,” she said.  The family came to Quincy when her husband accepted a job at Quincy High School.  “So I started all over as a volunteer here,” she said. “I got to recreate myself with each state.”  She joined GCFD 3 as a volunteer in 2009 and eventually was hired for a paid position as the firefighter retention coordinator. She’s been on the district’s paid staff for 10 years, she said.  “This is my 29th year,” she said, as a volunteer or on a department’s paid staff.  But as a veteran, Talley said she started thinking of the future.  “So I started thinking, ‘Okay, what are some things I can do, that if I can physically do this job, (will) still make a difference?’ Now this department still requires you to be a line firefighter. We’re just not big enough to have you stand alone in an (administration) role,” she said.  But she still wanted more skills, she said, and started thinking about the fire prevention and inspection work she had done in her 20s. Jim Kling, the district’s previous fire marshal, had announced his plans to retire. Talley started taking fire inspector certification classes and working with Kling to learn from his experience and expertise.  “It’s one thing to get the certification - okay yeah, I know where to find everything in this red binder, this fire code book - but another thing to actually apply it,” she said.  While there were classes, the certification process required a lot of studying on her own too, she said. Kling was fire marshal for more than 25 years, and was generous with his time and knowledge.  “It’s a lot of ongoing training. It really was a lot of shadowing Chief Kling prior to this and learning it in the field,” she said.  Kling still answers her questions, even after retirement.  “He’s still on speed dial,” Talley said.  A fire marshal does investigate the origin of a fire, but there’s a lot more to it than that. The fire marshal is involved in the entire construction or remodeling process, especially commercial buildings.  “I do everything from plan reviews for all new construction that comes in, with fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, things like that - the planning version of it too, what we call pre-construction systems - all the way through the testing of all those systems,” she said.  The fire marshal inspects fire hydrants during construction. If there’s a fuel tank in the project, she tests that. She conducts fire and life safety inspections.  “If you have a new business that comes in, before they open their doors I’m supposed to go through and do my walkthrough,” she said.  Existing businesses also are subject to inspections, and Talley said she likes to work with business owners to change anything that might need changing.  “I come from the education background, and I like working with people to teach them,” she said. “It’s like, ‘You want the safest building for your customers and your employees. And I want the same thing.’  “I don’t want to be the scary person. Yes, I have to enforce code, that’s part of my job, but I’m also here to educate them,” she said.  Talley is still learning herself, she said, and has found that contractors and building owners usually are willing to answer her questions about their systems and work with her. She cited the data centers currently under construction in Quincy as an example.  “Those are the cream of the crop contractors, and they’re excited about telling you about their projects. And they’re gracious. They know that I’m new and they’re not trying to pull a fast one. They want you to know how their systems work.”  It’s a great job, though, she said.  “It’s never the same day twice, that’s what I love about my job,” she said.  The fire service attracted her because it allows her to help her community, she said, and that’s what’s still attractive about it.  “I really enjoy what I do. I really feel like I’m making a difference,” she said, “and that’s what brings a lot of joy to my job.”  Cheryl Schweizer may be reached at cschweizer@columbiabasinherald.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29sdW1iaWFiYXNpbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi9taWNoZWxlLXRhbGxleS1maW5kcy1yZXdhcmRzLWZpcmUtc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

TEXAS CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Marathon Petroleum officials say they are still monitoring the air quality in the Texas City area after Monday's fire, in which we now know what was burning. According to Marathon Petroleum officials, hydrocarbon Naphtha is what was burning.  ""It's component that has a lot of waxes or paraffin's and benzene's or benzene that we know are carcinogens, so it's like a combination of what they're using to refine down and create several products,"" Tox Doc, Dr. Noreen Khan-Mayberry said.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says those smoke particles can be dangerous. But in a Facebook post on Monday, the Texas City Police Department announced a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community wasn't necessary. Normally, that decision comes from the Office of Emergency Management. They make the decision based on information they get from the company and also what they may see or experience when they have reps on site of the fire.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says this is reminiscent of the March 2019 ITC plant fire, in which our partners at the Texas Tribune uncovered high benzene levels lingered in the air for two weeks after public health measures and shelter-in-place warnings were lifted.  When it comes to Monday's Marathon plant fire, the experts we spoke to say if the company knew Naphtha was burning, a shelter-in-place should have been issued.  ""It's always easier to figure out after, even though, when they know which unit blows up or ignites, they know exactly what's in that unit and what's burning in those units. So they know that quickly. It's not like these are unlabeled and take them a long time to find out,"" Dr. Khan-Mayberry said. ""So, yes, I definitely think that precautions should've been put in place, in terms of 'Hey, there's a fire, there's been an explosion in the unit,' and there should be a shelter in place, at least for a few hours until you can get TCEQ out there and start doing some real air monitoring.""

The two-and-a-half story wood frame building had two apartments, and when firefighters arrived there was heavy fire on the first floor.  Crews remained on the scene for several hours before extinguishing the fire, and there was a partial collapse of the roof onto the first floor.

There were two people home at the time of the fire, and they were able to evacuate safely. LeBarnes said he was not sure how many people lived in the building. One cat and dog made it out of the building, but another cat and dog were missing and likely died in the fire, LeBarnes said.

Neither resident was home at the time of the fire, he said.  A call reporting the fire came into Stephens County 911 Dispatch just before 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 14, Bennett told WNEG.  He said, “The call came into our dispatch about 5 minutes before 8 p.m., and Carnes Creek, New Hope and Eastanollee volunteer fire departments were paged out. Carnes Creek put the first truck on scene within seven minutes of the call coming in.”  When the initial crew arrived on scene, there was heavy fire and smoke throughout the house, with the heaviest flames concentrated in the right, rear corner of the home.  Bennett said the decision was made to send a crew into the structure for an interior attack on the fire. Fire crews were able suppress the fire with the majority of the damage occurring in the rear quarter of the building, and much of the front portion of the home and belongings were saved from fire damage. Smoke damage was more widespread, Bennett said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for approximately 35 to 40 minutes before the home was secured and the fire crews could begin clean-up operations.  Bennett said there was no clear indication of how the fire started, and explained that the homeowner’s insurance company will decide the cause of the fire following its investigation.  Sunday’s fire was the third fire in a fairly small section of the county, and Bennett said that this year has seen an unusually-high number of fires throughout the county.  Bennett said, “This year, Stephens County Fire Services, and the City of Toccoa, have seen an unheard of amount of structure fires. I talked with some other captains and lieutenants in other counties, and told them how many (fire calls) we run, and they were amazed. For some reason, this year we’ve had a lot more than normal.”  Bennett said that arson does not appear to play a role in the large number of fires this year, but carelessness and inattention is definitely a factor.  He said, “A lot of it is just carelessness, or unintentional type things. We typically don’t see a lot of arson around here.”  Bennett added that the fires are not limited to a certain demographic.  He said, “It’s not just the elderly, not just young people.”  Bennett strongly urges citizens to make sure there are working fire alarms throughout their home, and to make a habit of checking for potential fire hazards prior to leaving the home, even for a short period of time.  The number one tip to prevent fires is smoke alarms, Bennett said, urging citizens to check and test their fire alarms on a regular basis. He also urged residents to be observant and make an extra effort to look for fire hazards.  He said, “Don’t leave the house without making one last lap through the house to make sure nothing is left on like hair dryers, the stove, ovens, or curling irons. That extra 30 seconds can save your home, your belongings, your pets.”  Bennett said that even items that may not have open flames, or may not seem hot enough to start a fire, can be dangerous if left unattended.  He said, “That curling iron you leave on, if it is next to a can of hairspray or something, that kind of thing is where problems start.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd25lZ3JhZGlvLmNvbS9jYXJuZXMtY3JlZWstZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

No one was hurt.Fire Chief Laurent McDonald said crews responded to an alarm at 11:38 a.m. at 30 Old Charlton Road. Firefighters were there until 4 p.m.  McDonald said there was a partial building and stored lumber at the site, which used to be the home of Stone's Saw Mill.  In addition, the property owner has been using the area to place old items there including a filled 53-foot box trailer, tires and plastic water tanks, as well as old televisions and computers.  “We’ve been working with DEP with the property to clean up some of the stuff,” McDonald said. “One of the property owners were there earlier in the morning, still continuing his cleanup efforts to basically, clean up the property and dispose stuff. About an hour after he left is when the fire was discovered.”  Despite being nothing of major value destroyed at the site, it was in the best interest to contain it and put it out, rather than just let it burn, McDonald said. The footprint of the fire was 100-feet-by-100-feet, he said.  “You wouldn’t let it burn because you have plastics,” McDonald said. “Fortunately, the owner started cleaning up the old tires and moved a bunch of them. There were still some there but they weren’t in the area that (was) involved.”  McDonald said they do not have a cause for the fire but they don’t think it’s suspicious. The investigation is ongoing, he said.  “It appears for all intent and purposes it’s accidental in nature,” McDonald said. “Because there were TV items and glass and bottles and whatnot, there’s different speculations you can go on. It may have been sunlight amplified through glass. We can’t really put a finger on the cause but we believe it to be accidental. But, where it started, it did get some of the heavy timbers and grass on the fire which spread to the remnants of the building.”  Aug. 31, 1992, the sawmill was destroyed by fire. The fire was discovered fully involved at 11:10 p.m., shooting flames 20 to 30 feet into the air. It smoldered all night and broke out again the next morning. The pile of slab wood that burned would have been ground into landscaping woodchips and sawdust for farms, while a stack of 30 15-foot logs, which would have been cut into 2,000 linear feet of planking, also burned. Firefighters from Oxford, Charlton, Webster, Leicester and Sutton responded to the late-night blaze as Auburn firefighters waited at the Oxford firehouse.  McDonald said the fire presents greater problems for cleanup.  “Fire is not a good way to dispose of anything because it causes great problems, plus what it does to the air,” McDonald said.  Monday, Oxford fire received mutual aid from Charlton, Dudley and Webster.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnYXJkbmVybmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3JlbW5hbnRzLW9mLW9sZC1zYXdtaWxsLXJhdmFnZWQtYnktZmlyZS1tb25kYXktb24tb2xkLWNoYXJsdG9uLXJvYWQvNzAyMTk0MDAwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At 1:53 p.m. fire companies were dispatched to MLK/Southard St for a fire in an abandoned commercial building. Once on site, a call for all hands on deck was made.  The fire would eventually reach five alarms, but there were no reported injuries from anyone within the building. A firefighter had to be transported to the hospital for vomiting, but nothing fire or injury related.  According to Trenton Fire Director Kenneth Douglas, five other city fire departments came to assist in extinguishing the flames.  “Pretty much went to defensive operations almost immediately due to the collapsing of the gym area,” Director Douglas said. “They tried to make an advance inside, but because of the heavy fire load, they were actually backed out and got out just before the collapse.”  Although the school has been closed since 2007, there were plans for the redevelopment of the property. Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora who arrived about 45 minutes after the first alarm, said a potential $50 million grant from HUD could turn the abandoned school into a spectacular senior housing residence.  “It’s an implementation grant that our housing authority is a finalist. No guarantees but if we make it, that would be one of the projects,” Gusciora explained.  Gusciora said any redevelopment had hoped to save many of the historic parts of the building, “especially all the wood floors,” Gusciora explained.  It is also reported that three additional small fires occurred at neighboring homes that were put out immediately by tenants or firefighters in the area.  The fire has since been deemed under control and a perimeter has been put around the building to keep people from entering.  Earlier this year, residents complained that students were entering the school and spending entire days inside. Police allegedly made attempts to prevent a constant flow of trespassers.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

Both children suffered burns over 70% of their bodies, said Destiny Davis, a granddaughter of homeowner Sharon Davis. Medical personnel at VCU Medical Center in Richmond continue to stabilize the kids, ages one and two.  “They’re going to be here for a couple of months,” Destiny Davis estimated. “They're going to have to learn to walk again.”  Her 72-year-old grandmother, who also was taken to VCU Medical Center for smoke inhalation, has been given a tube to help her breathe.  “She was able to squeeze my hand,” Destiny Davis said. “She’s going to be OK.”  All three, however, were still listed in critical condition at the hospital.  Sharon Davis and three of her great-grandchildren were in the home in the 1100 block of Covington Road when the fire broke out around 3:50 p.m. One of the children was able to get out, but fire officials said the other two were trapped upstairs and had to be rescued.  Sharon Davis had been helped by a neighbor and was standing in her yard when the authorities arrived.  Once everyone was out of the house, firefighters had the blaze under control in around 16 minutes. However, the damage inside was extensive.  “They lost everything,” Destinay Davis said, adding that a GoFundMe site was being established to help.

Tuesday’s training is part of a weeklong training at State Fire School on campus and at training structures in the Toledo area.  On Tuesday, well over a dozen firefighters set up their gear at the top of Doyt Perry football stadium in Bowling Green for rope rescue training.  “There are water towers, there are antennas, there are quarries, there are steep ravines, there are lots of different potentials that are out there not just mountain climbing and cliffs like people you are going to apply these skills,” said the instructor and retired Columbus firefighter Gary Hamilton.  Zach Bukszar went over the forty-foot wall for the first time, a chemist by day, Bukszar is a volunteer firefighter back home in Twinsburg, Ohio.  “Um, terrifying, but I mean I got to watch everybody put everything together and make sure all those safety protocols are in place so I know that there is no real danger, it’s just you know getting initially over that edge is the biggest hard part, then once you are kind of in there and you can feel that you are supported it gets a lot easier,” Bukszar said.  Just up the road in Toledo, firefighters were picking apart an abandoned home, during the Street Smart Engine and Truck class.  “Trying to pass on knowledge to younger inexperienced firefighters to get them some real-world hands-on experience,” said Lt. Joseph Cassetta, with the City of Orlando Fire Department.  BGSU currently hosts two annual training programs on campus, oversees the Penta Career Center Fire program, and administers a Certified Rescue Technician (CRT) series in Columbus and Cincinnati.

(WPRI) — All of Southern New England is under a Red Flag Warning and Fire Weather Watch due to the warm and dry conditions.  The R.I. Department of Emergency Management (DEM) is urging the public to be cautious and avoid outdoor burning since the conditions increase the chance of fires spreading more quickly. This means no campfires, charcoal or cooking fires, and using any devices that emit flames or embers.  Fire officials also believe many recent brush fires may have been started by improperly disposed cigarettes.  Crews are currently battling a brush fire in the woods off Fisher Street in Attleboro.  (Story continues below video.)  Rhode Island has seen its fair share of brush fires in the past month, including one that burned as many as 600 acres of land in Exeter.  “The last time we had the Red Flag Warnings is when we had that large fire in Exeter, so it’s definitely a ‘watch out’ situation for the fire community right now,” DEM Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin said.  “Being so recently that we just had large fires, having this Red Flag Warning again is putting us on a high alert absolutely,” he continued.

It is 19 years old. Would you put a Home Depot stove in a commercial building? The Viking stove at Station 2 cost the town $6,300.00 in 2001,” says Fierro. “MFD has never prioritized Viking stoves and Nautilus equipment over safety. The silly conversation about Viking stoves holds no merit; they are 20 years or older and have and continue to serve the town well.”  Regarding Nautilus Gym equipment, Fierro says it was acquired by a grant awarded in the 2001-2002 years that was written by Battalion Chief Durning.  “Most of our other equipment is donated by residents that are moving away, and they offer it to the Fire Department,” he says.  Fierro also states that the radios at Station 3 “do work and always work. If a repair is made or there is an issue, every Officer and Firefighter is issued a personal radio and a radio in the Engine; the backup plan has a backup plan. Our radios are not substandard; they still do the job, just not supportive, and challenging to get parts for they have timed out.”  Regarding the request for more firefighters, Fierro says hiring more firefighters is to replace retired members and keep everyone safe.  “To state we are not a serious department on what basis, I stand behind all our members and have a diverse team of Professional Firefighters that other departments admire; our training level is above and beyond,” he adds.  Fierro responded to comments made in the lawsuit about Fire House #3 conditions and also by resident Eileen Birmingham.  “Station 3 is not a “gulag,” I was stationed there for 11 years and enjoyed every minute of it. The people in the neighborhood I met and the flowers we planted all represent that we were happy and proud to be there. Hypothetically in my opinion, if you wanted to punish someone, you would move them to the busiest rig in town, Engine 1 or Truck 1, located at headquarters,” he said.  Fierro says the stove at Station 3 is approximately six years old.  “I remember it being delivered and installed, and it functions 100%. The Sunday gravy we cook on all three stoves tastes the same; i will verify that I’ve personally been at all three Firehouses over my career.”  Fierro writes that there are four paid studies stating that Station 3 is needed.  “Dismissing the studies because they do not fit one narrative is, at best, disappointing,” says Fierro. “Eileen [Birmingham] was given these studies and is quoted ‘I choose not to accept 20-year-old data,’ even though all reports say we are understaffed at 90 Firefighters.”  Fierro says no one has mentioned that the Firefighters 100% renovated Station 2 kitchen and two bathrooms and a Station 3 Bathroom, with the town only paying for material and firefighters doing all labor.  Fierro also writes that MFD staff is full of Montclair residents. He says that information about these buildings has become false and mentions “pop-in visits from the CFO to inspect the buildings, take photos, and interview members.”  “Traditionally, this request is made to the Chief’s office, and a guided tour is scheduled. We do not let people wander around restricted areas and living quarters with personal items left about. It would be irresponsible to our members. Yes, the building is public; however, some areas are not, similar to areas of Town Hall where the public is not allowed to enter at will or sit in on meetings and ask questions. I have had multiple members call and feel uncomfortable and are exploring formal complaints.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyaXN0YW5ldC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9tZmQtdW5pb24tcmVmdXRlcy1jbGFpbXMtcmVnYXJkaW5nLWZpcmUtaG91c2UtMy1hbmQtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An autopsy was expected to be performed at Albany Medical Center on Tuesday to positively determine the cause of death, Amsterdam Fire Chief Anthony Agresta said.  Another 51-year-old male resident of the second floor apartment was able to exit the building on his own and alerted police at the scene that his roommate was still inside.  Four individuals living in the first floor apartment were able to leave the building on their own and have been displaced by the fire. Five dogs and two cats were killed.  Multiple callers reported the fire around 6:48 p.m. on Monday. The second floor porch was fully involved when Amsterdam fire crews and police arrived on the scene.  The fire spread through the second floor apartment and entered the attic area of the two-family home. The first floor apartment sustained water damage.  Agresta confirmed the surviving roommate received medical attention following the fire, but declined to provide further details regarding the man’s condition or his identity.  “Unfortunately, I’m not able to confirm his identity,” Agresta said.  The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Amsterdam Fire Department and state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  The fire is believed to have started in the area of the second floor porch. The cause of the fire does not appear to be suspicious.

A fast response by firefighters confined the fire to the exterior balcony.  Columbus firefighters were sent to the apartment complex at 9:43 p.m. Monday on a report of an apartment fire at 3586 Nicholas Lane after a fire was reported on a second story balcony, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  Firefighters arrived on the scene in less than five minutes of the dispatch and reported a working fire with flames showing. Columbus police, also on the scene, assisted firefighters by notifying neighboring apartment occupants of the fire and aiding in the evacuation of the building, Wilson said. With an evacuation underway and additional firefighters enroute to the scene, the first arriving engine company charged a hose line and advanced into the second floor apartment. As crews entered the apartment, they found the interior of the apartment was clear of fire. Crews pushed to the balcony where they found fire burning up a vinyl sided wall. Firefighters extinguished the flames within seconds of their arrival on the balcony, Wilson said.  Firefighters removed a section of the balcony ceiling and confirmed that that fire was confined to the exterior balcony and did not extend into the apartment’s attic space or apartment’s interior living space.  Fire department investigators learned from the tenant that a family member had been smoking a cigarette on the balcony earlier in the evening and discarded it in a cardboard box that was being used to collect cigarette butts, Wilson said. Investigators said that the cardboard box had completely burned away but a large amount of cigarette butts were located in that location. Investigators ruled the fire accidental as a result of improper cigarette disposal.  Captain Troy Todd, Columbus Fire Department fire investigator, said that the department sees fires similar to this incident each year. “We have seen a number of significant-damage fires occur in the city from improper cigarette disposal. This type of fire is easily preventable if proper disposal takes place,” he said.  Damage from the fire is estimated at approximately $5,000.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include the Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services. No injuries were reported at the scene.  The Columbus Fire Department recommends that all smoking material be disposed of in a noncombustible container. The container should also be periodically emptied to prevent a collection of material within the container. Materials may be doused with water to confirm that the smoking materials are completely extinguished.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2NmZC1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWRpc2NhcmRlZC1jaWdhcmV0dGUtbGVhZHMtdG8tYXBhcnRtZW50LWJhbGNvbnktZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The threat for brush fire development and growth is very high, owing to recent dry conditions, dry brush and dry air with warming temperatures.  Additionally, a gusty westerly wind to 30 mph for many and up to 40 mph on Cape Cod, becoming southwest late in the day, will contribute to fire spread and this can apply to both brush fires and building fires, as any type of fire thrives on wind to grow and spread. Though Tuesday morning clouds have been thinning for strengthening sun, wildfire smoke from distant fires in western Canada will thicken in our New England sky Tuesday, carried thousands of feet above our heads by the jet stream winds aloft, contributing to a colorful Tuesday evening sunset and Wednesday morning sunrise.  Though that smoke doesn’t directly make it to the ground, there’s just enough pollution in southern New England air for moderate air quality – noticed only by those with respiratory problems – and pollen continues to fill the air. A cold front dropping south from Canada will carry scattered showers from north to south Tuesday late evening and overnight, not arriving to southeastern New England until predawn Wednesday, dropping only hundredths of an inch of rain for communities that see them, and perhaps not surviving the trip at all for the southwest quarter of New England.  Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.  So, fire danger and pollen continues Wednesday, though a drop of about 20 degrees in daytime high temperature owing to the new, cooler air from Canada should mean the relative humidity of the air isn’t quite as dry. The busy, northerly breeze Wednesday will gust to 30 mph at times and will ensure high temperatures near 60 feel like the 50s even at the warmest time of day – a big drop from one day prior! As dry and fair weather continues, temperatures climb incrementally to the mid 60s, then around 70 degrees, respectively, on Thursday and Friday. A sluggish cold front will approach New England this weekend, though timing has been somewhat variable in the forecast. 24 hours ago, it looked like the front may arrive with scattered rain showers on Sunday. That timing has since sped up to later Saturday into early Sunday morning, so we clearly still have some work to do firming this up.  That said, whatever showers arrive shouldn’t stay more than about 12 to 15 hours, which means the entire weekend isn’t expected to be marred by them. We could use some meaningful rain, but our First Alert Team isn’t sold on just how much these showers will deliver, with current estimates from our exclusive NBC Forecast System having dropped to around half an inch due to the increasing forecast speed of the system.  For now, we continue to carry highs in the 60s and 70s next week in our exclusive 10-day forecast, just as long as a northeast wind off the cool ocean doesn’t set up, which we’ll be keeping an eye out for signals of.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vd2VhdGhlci9yYXJlLXZlcnktaGlnaC1icnVzaC1maXJlLWRhbmdlci1wcm9tcHRzLXdhcm5pbmdzLWluLW5ldy1lbmdsYW5kLzMwNDYxMzgv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjYm9zdG9uLmNvbS93ZWF0aGVyL3JhcmUtdmVyeS1oaWdoLWJydXNoLWZpcmUtZGFuZ2VyLXByb21wdHMtd2FybmluZ3MtaW4tbmV3LWVuZ2xhbmQvMzA0NjEzOC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire has since been determined arson by the Maine Forest Service, Farmington Fire Chief Timothy Hardy reported.  The Farmington Fire Department received the call around 6:30 p.m. on Monday evening, but it took time before they arrived at the scene due to the difficult location. Chief Hardy stated that the challenge was accessing the fire in order to put it out due to a lack of roads or trails in the area. It was impossible to get firetrucks directly to the fire, and Red Schoolhouse Road was blocked off for over two hours to allow firetrucks to reach as close to the scene as possible. Even so, the responding departments had to cut a trail through the trees to the fire.  There was also difficulty with water access. Firefighters used backpack pumps and hand tools to bring water to the remote site. ATVs with water tanks and pumps from the Farmington, Kingfield, and Jay Fire Departments were used to shuttle equipment and water back and forth.  Leaf litter and small trees were burned, although nothing large was reached by the fire, which was completely doused by around 9:30 p.m. when the responders left the site.  The Farmington Fire Department returned to the scene early Tuesday morning and saw that the fire was still out. The Maine Forest Service also returned on Tuesday to conduct investigations into the origins of the fire, which are still on-going.

Two officers had arrived to check on reports of a noise, and realized there was an active fire.  After calling for help, other officers joined in to form a human tower of top of an air conditioning register and passed Rebecca Dampier’s two children, Andrew Dampier and Alexandria Carter, down to safety. Rebecca then jumped and was caught by the officers.  Vermilion County Deputy Seth Moody received honors from Danville Police Chief Christopher Yates, along with Danville officers Jered Greer, Ayden Lamar, Scott Showers, and Damon Bellik.  Ironically, Rebecca’s father was a Chicago Firefighter for years, knew the movie Backdraft very well, and had passed some of that knowledge on to Rebecca. She heard something that sounded like knocking. And that reminded her.  AUDIO: And in the Backdraft movie, this guy hears something that sounds like knocking. So he goes and goes to open it out of curiosity, and it was the last thing he ever sees. So for me, if I don’t see anything, and there’s nothing but blackness, I just knew not to open that door.  Eleven-year-old Andrew received a special certificate from Chief Yates for alerting the family. What he did was especially heroic, because he and his mom are hard of hearing. Andrew told Neuhoff Media it all began when he could smell the smoke.  AUDIO: So I stayed calm like anybody would do. I went to my mom, told her what happened. I got my sister up super fast and carefully. I went to the window and looked for anybody who could help us to evacuate.

Upon arrival at the scene, the fire department found the front porch engulfed in flames. Fire personnel immediately began an exterior attack, and disconnected electric and gas utilities.  Once the exterior fire was under control, firefighters worked to extinguish fire that spread into the structural part of the house, extending to the attic. Firefighters were able to enter the house and begin the interior attack.  Once inside, fire personnel reported the home unoccupied. A hole was cut into the roof to allow for ventilation. Once the fire was reported to be under control, with only a few smoldering areas remaining, firefighters conducted a secondary search. A small dog was found deceased in the house.  Interior crews then exited the house and firefighters continued to extinguish smoldering areas, and hot spots. Smoke continued to emanate from underneath the metal roof, so a portion of the roof was pulled back to extinguish the remaining embers.  The house sustained heavy damage. The fire department was able to protect all of the nearby exposures, and no civilian or firefighter injuries were reported.  The Pittsburg Fire Department, Pittsburg Police Department, Crawford County EMS, Kansas Gas Service, and Evergy responded to the scene.  The cause of the fire remains undetermined at this time.

"fire","2023-11-01","00:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:45:00","By Debbie Rogers  [email protected]  MILLBURY — Lake Township voters will most likely decide on funding a full-time fire department in November.  At Tuesday’s meeting, the trustees continued discussion on a possible 4.2-mill levy.  “If we’re going to put a levy on the ballot, we’ve got to start taking action pretty rapidly,” said Trustee Richard Welling.  According to the Wood County Auditor’s Office, an additional 4.2-mill levy would raise $1.2 million and cost the owner of a $100,000 home $147 per year.  Fire Chief Barrett Dorner said that the current personnel situation in the township is dire. The community needs to decide the direction for the future, he said.  “We’re willing to provide whatever service the community is willing to pay for,” he said, adding that more community question-and-answer sessions will be held.  “It’s not a scare tactic,” Dorner added. “We just need to be honest with you about what we can do now.”  Request for fire and EMS service is up 70% in the last eight years, he said.  “If that keeps going, our 1,600 runs a year right now will be almost 3,000 runs in 2031,” Dorner said. “We are going to continue our rapid growth, and hopefully it stays consistent and we don’t see a big spike.”  He said he wants to be up front about the department’s current capabilities.  There are two people on staff, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  They rely heavily on backup from neighboring departments.  The department has four levies, which total 4.8 mills, for financial support. The 2022 operating budget was $1.5 million.  Total annual payroll is $795,000, Dorner said  The department relies on administrative staff to respond to calls, when needed. That pulls people away from other responsibilities, such as grant writing, Dorner said.  Volunteers still work for the department, but they are mainly available at night and weekends.  “Those are our slowest time periods. Our busiest is 8 a.m.-8 p.m.,” Dorner said. “They’re available when we need them the least. I wish that wasn’t the case.”  Finding paramedics, especially ones to work part time, is incredibly difficult, right now, he added.  “One of the inspiring things that I’ve heard through all this … if we had full-time (positions open) we would have a line out the door of our people who want to work in Lake Township,” Dorner said. “That’s not everywhere.”  Another levy — or an addition to the proposed levy — is also being discussed.  “I want to bring dispatch back,” said Trustee Lorie Davis on Tuesday.  The township last operated dispatch in 2015. When costs became too high, the township contracted with the Wood County Sheriff’s Office.  Since then, the service has continued to improve, Dorner said on Tuesday.  “We are really reshaping fire dispatch in Wood County,” he said. “They’ve done an outstanding job of working with us.  Dorner said dispatch would cost at least another $500,000 and he requested more time to review the request.  Fiscal Officer Buddy Ritson said that if the trustees want to bring back dispatch and need a levy for it, there should be two separate requests.  “The fire fund is not healthy at this time,” Ritson said.  Building something from scratch right now will be expensive and take time, Dorner said.  After the meeting, Ritson said the township is paying $10,051 per month to the sheriff’s office for dispatch.  Davis said she strongly believes Lake Township should have its own emergency dispatch.  “I feel that dispatch is an important thing here in our own township,” Davis said.  The township, Northwood and Rossford commissioned a study last year to look into combining fire and EMS operations.  According to the study, which was released earlier this year, Lake Township has 54 personnel, with some full-time positions and mostly paid-on-call workers.  After the meeting, Dorner said the idea of combining the three departments is not dead. It’s just going to take too much time to come to fruition and Lake needs action now, he said.  Also at the meeting, the trustees:  • Approved $35,000 to Bowers Asphalt and Paving, Inc., Walbridge, to repair roads.  • Authorized $4,295 to Kaylor Plumbing, Wiring and Heating Inc., Genoa, for electrical repairs to the shelter house and kitchen in Friendship Park.  • Voted to buy firefighting foam from Advanced Eco Systems Inc., Tallmadge, for $1,478.  • Approved paying $1,437 to Speck Sales Inc. for two rear tires for the 2107 New Holland road mower.  • Voted to authorize the purchase and installation of new chain guards on the HI-WAY machine for $1,291. Gledhill Machinery Co., Galion, will do the work.  • Hired Mark Halliday and William Cook as firefighters for $10.10 an hour.  • Accepted resignations from Dakota Crabtree, Hunter Hayes, Tyler Clark and Amy Perry, who are EMTs and firefighters.  • Appointed Zachary Jenkins to the zoning commission for a five-year term.  • Reappointed Donald Nichols and John Sigurdson to the zoning board of appeals for a five-year term.  • Heard April department reports. Zoning issued five permits and collected $900. Police made three arrests and issued 15 citations. Fire and EMS had 92 calls. There were seven burials and three cremations at the cemetery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9mdWxsLXRpbWUtZmlyZS1hbmQtZW1zLWZvci1sYWtlLW1heS1iZS1vbi1ub3ZlbWJlci1iYWxsb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fire, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:    Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team.

Jasmine R. Miller was taken into custody last Thursday and charged with one count of arson — knowingly damaging by fire the dwelling of another without consent, a level-four felony, court records reviewed by Law&Crime show.  According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the Daily Journal, firefighters in Johnson County at about 2:09 a.m. on March 30, 2023, responded to a house fire at a residence located in the 200 block of Restin Road, approximately 120 miles south of Indianapolis. Detectives with the county sheriff’s office arrived about an hour after the fire started and began the search for Miller, who allegedly started the fire before taking her daughter and fleeing the scene on foot. The home reportedly belonged to her then-boyfriend, whose name was not included in the report.  Investigators said that Miller started the fire over an argument with her boyfriend that began on the evening of March 29 about her being at a casino, the Journal reported. During the argument, Miller reportedly sent a text to her boyfriend saying she was going to “drive his f—— truck through [his house].”  The boyfriend was afraid Miller might be serious and filed a report with the sheriff’s office. As a direct result of his report, deputies reportedly arrested Miller when she left the casino and charged her with operating a vehicle without a license.  Miller’s boyfriend picked her up from jail in the early morning hours of March 30 and the two reportedly continued to fight, with Miller blaming him for her arrest. Before they arrived back at the house, Miller reportedly declared that she would be packing her things and moving to her mother’s house.  Miller then proceeded to pack some of her belongings into garbage bags and began loading them into her boyfriend’s truck, per the Journal. While loading the truck, Miller’s boyfriend said he smelled smoke and when he went inside to investigate he saw that all of the clothing in his closet had been set aflame.  “He observed his clothes [that were] hanging from racks on the north wall were on fire,” the affidavit reportedly states.  According to the Journal, the boyfriend briefly confronted Miller before making sure the house was clear of kids and pets. While he was checking the house, Miller reportedly fled the area on foot with her young daughter in tow.  In an interview with detectives, Miller’s boyfriend reportedly said she kept butane torch lighters in the house which she used for smoking meth and likely used to light the fire. In a backyard a few houses away from the boyfriend’s home, investigators reportedly found a purse containing two butane torch lighters and casino player cards in Miller’s name.  An investigator with the White River Township Fire Department determined that the cause of the fire was “incendiary” and the source of ignition was “an open flame being introduced to clothing,” Indianapolis Fox affiliate WXIN reported.  Following her arrest, Miller was booked at the Johnson County Jail where she is currently being held on $100,000 cash-only bond, jail records show.  Have a tip we should know?

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.  ESPN's Tim Bontemps contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjYxNjIwL3NvdXJjZXMtNzZlcnMtZmlyZS1jb2FjaC1kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLXRocmVlLXNlYXNvbnPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2MTYyMC9zb3VyY2VzLTc2ZXJzLWZpcmUtY29hY2gtZG9jLXJpdmVycy10aHJlZS1zZWFzb25zP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Oregon Department of Forestry said in a statement, several lightning strikes hit the region Monday night, starting a fire between Sharps Creek and Mosby.  ODF said a fire detection camera that was set up last Fall, played a key role in alerting firefighters to the fire’s location.  Crews said the fire was stopped at half an acre, but if gone unnoticed could have grown much larger.  “We were able to see smoke from a portion of the state that previously wouldn’t have that early detection and we were able to get it at a half-acre rather than potentially having to wait overnight to have people return then see the smoke,” said ODF Public Affairs, Jessica Prakke.  Prakke said this camera is just one of 93 cameras across the state, made possible by Senate Bill 762.  ODF said Senate Bill 762 provides more than $200 million to help Oregon modernize and improve its wildfire preparedness.  © 2023 KOBI-TV NBC5.

Download the app.  On October 23, 2022, Jim Henterly sat on the passenger bench of a National Park Service AStar helicopter, peering out at the craggy expanse of North Cascades National Park. Next to him was a firefighter from the NOCA (North Cascades) wildland crew, and directly in front of them stood 6,102-foot Desolation Peak. It was an unorthodox move for the parks system to allow the helicopter into the backcountry, but a moderately active fire that had broken out late in the season near Ross Lake, less than 2 miles downhill from Desolation Peak, had closed the trails. On the summit, a cabin covered in silver tinfoil glimmered in the sun like a wrapped Christmas present in a sea of craggy peaks. The first dusting of snow that patched the ground and frosted the roof added to the impression.  It had been a month since Henterly, the resident fire lookout on Desolation, left for the season, unable to properly close the lookout cabin for the winter because of the ongoing wildfire activity. After his lookout season ended in September and he went home to Whatcom county, Henterly didn’t know if he’d return before the following June. But the Desolation Fire, as it became known, climbed halfway uphill toward the lookout cabin, threatening to burn it down. In an effort to preserve it, fire crews had wrapped the 14 ½ by 14 ½-foot wooden structure in a foil blanket. And now, with the threat of the fire passed, Jim returned to remove the foil, inspect the structure, and prepare it for the heavy snows of a North Cascades winter.  To his relief, Henterly, who has spent seven seasons scanning for smoke atop Desolation, found no damage to the lookout cabin or any of its equipment. The structure itself has stood atop Desolation for almost a century, but this latest fire isn’t the only thing that threatens its continued existence as the last staffed fire lookout in North Cascades National Park.  The Desolation Peak lookout armored against approaching flames. (Photo: Alex Depue)  The summer before, I spent some time with Henterly at Desolation, which is also one of the few remaining staffed lookouts in the entire state of Washington. After corresponding by email for months, I met him at the tail end of the season. After a rigorous 5-mile hike with nearly 5,000 feet of elevation gain, I made it to the ridgeline and got my first glimpse of the cabin. With the shutters propped up, the structure gave me the impression of a single-story pagoda, symbolism that added to my reverence of this place. A man with deeply kind eyes and the svelte body of a lifelong hiker in his sixties, Henterly was cleaning the cabin and readying it for winter when I arrived. A big storm was forecast to sweep into the region within days and the shutters of the mostly glass structure would need to be fastened.  The Desolation Peak fire lookout stands about a foot off the ground on cinder blocks, in the foreground of the twin-fanged peaks of Mt. Hozomeen. The box-like building is painted a light shade called “lookout gray,” and its shutters are raised during fire season to reveal windows on all sides. The interior of the small cabin is a calming green called “Irish meadows,” which, like the exterior color, the Forest Service used regularly for lookouts and the National Park Service maintains for historical continuity. Against the four walls are a lone cot, a desk with an ancient hand-crank coffee grinder, and a bookshelf. In the center of the room sits the Osborne Fire Finder, a device that resembles a high circular table with sights and a map, and can give ranges and bearings from any location within view. Its purpose is to pinpoint smoke and flames so that the operator can dispatch wildland firefighting crews to the blaze’s exact location.  Henterly trained for decades to earn his spot as a lookout at Desolation. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  As he went about stowing objects under the cabin, Henterly told me how he trained as a wildland firefighter and fire lookout for over 20 years to get this post. Some years standing watch as a lookout can be slow with very little fire activity, but these last few years have mirrored the amplified wildfire season that the rest of the West has experienced. Henterly told me about a fire a few years back that holds special significance to him, and he showed me how he used the Osborne Fire Finder to acquire the location by lining up the sights of two apertures that rotate around the map. That fire was classified a monitor-only situation because it was in the remote wilderness of the Arctic Creek drainage north of Mt. Prophet. On his small desk was the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio he used to call in the coordinates and updates to headquarters. Henterly’s job was to observe, document, and relay the life of the flame. Because he found it, the Fire Management Office designated it the Arctic Jim Fire.  Built in 1932, this lookout tower near the border of Washington and British Columbia has long stood as a symbol of firefighting in the West. A century atop a mountain has given this structure a character all its own, with remnants from previous tenants ranging from books and cups to maps and memorabilia. From the outside, it’s the only man-made object in sight, aside from an outhouse a few yards beyond. It’s not surprising that it has captured the imaginations of backpackers, writers, and historians for decades.  Jack Kerouac was the first to introduce me to fire lookouts through his novels Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels, both of which chronicled his experience as a fire lookout on Desolation in the summer of 1956. Notable nature writers Gary Snyder, Norman Maclean, Edward Abbey, and Phillip Connors have also written about the monk-like experience of living in a glass house on a mountaintop. These stories drew me to visit the historic Desolation Peak Lookout 13 years ago, and I’ve revisited the site a handful of times since, along with countless other lookouts across the region.  According to the Forest Fire Lookout Association (FFLA), fire lookouts proliferated between 1930 and 1950, when the Forest Service maintained more than 5,000 towers around the country, mostly concentrated in the forests of the western United States. During this era, Washington alone built 660 alpine lookouts. Since the 1950s, government agencies have torn down many of these lookouts due to disrepair or destruction in forest fires. A number of nonprofit preservation groups like the FFLA maintain some of the remaining structures for public enjoyment.  In a 2019 survey, the FFLA estimated that only around 300 lookout towers were still staffed in the United States, mostly by volunteers, and those small numbers continue to dwindle due to advances in technology. With the use of drones, satellites, aircraft, and even fixed camera systems, the role of fire lookout is quickly becoming obsolete. In Washington, only 93 lookout towers remain, and only a third of those ever host an actual person. Of these few, only a handful are paid, part-time positions within the National Park or National Forest services during any given fire season, which is usually between June and September. The heightened fire activity in the West has not led to higher staffing levels of fire lookouts. Not yet.  Henterly tells me a pivotal role of the lookout at Desolation is to relay radio messages from field crews to headquarters in the park. These radio dispatches, pertaining to ongoing wildfires, trail work, and even rescues, are too far away for headquarters to pick up. Jim constantly monitors every word that comes out of his handheld. It could be a firefighter Mayday, or a mishap that needs to be passed on. Every evening he relays his own report to HQ.  During the 2022 lookout season, Jim proved the importance of his work and the value of fire lookouts in general. During the height of the fire season, he monitored and reported on approximately 20 different wildfires, not only within North Cascades National Park, but also in the neighboring Pasayten Wilderness and in Canada. His dispatches provided critical information to fire crews and a low-cost alternative to the exorbitant financial costs of reconnaissance flights. Those flights are intermittent, and Jim’s constant attention, coupled with regular radio reports, provides vital information with little overhead. The work that Jim does, and the necessity of Desolation Lookout, is so vital that fire crews hiked to the peak last fall to wrap it in protective foil, so that its mission may continue in the future. With the growing fire seasons created by climate change, it seems that lookouts are more important than ever. Perhaps Jim and Desolation Lookout will inspire government agencies to invest, one more time, in the tried and true method of fighting fire by posting fire watchers to stand guard against our burning world.  (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  Meanwhile, the few remaining towers are garnering huge interest from outdoor enthusiasts, perhaps due to the fact that the role of the fire lookout is slowly fading into history. Backpackers can rent many of these structures overnight. Some are open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis and are often crammed full of campers during the height of summer. These communal barracks are especially sought-after for Pacific Northwest hikers, who ascend steep mountain terrain in droves for a chance to sleep protected amongst the high peaks. Regional blogs keep track of what lookouts are available to rent, which ones are free to stay in, and log the currently staffed locations, so visitors can hike to the cabins themselves and hear first-hand what it’s like to be a fire lookout.  The lives of lookout personnel require patience uncommon in our time, distilled with enduring focus. Every minute or so during my visit, Henterly returned his gaze to 360-degree scans of the surrounding landscape, stalling our conversation and creating stretches of silence that punctuated his stories. Much of the fire season has no sign of smoke, so his vigil can become endlessly repetitive. Luckily for Henterly, his view is inspiring. There are mountains on all sides, spreading out in ripples of ridgelines and glaciated peaks that comprise the northern expanse of the Cascade mountains.  It’s useful for lookouts to have personal interests to fill the quiet moments. For Henterly, drawing is a way to while away the daylight. With a pencil, he sketches finely detailed pictures that can fit into the palm of your hand. He’s drawn portraits of nature writers and mythical creatures, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s ents, which are enormous walking and talking trees. The sketches merge with his lookout tasks, as the contrast of light smoke on a dark landscape parallel the lead on white paper. Over the seasons, he’s turned his sketches into stickers that he’s posted around the cabin with quotes from his favorite authors.  On the doorpost, I noticed a sticker Henterly drew with John Muir’s quote, “One can make a day of any size.” It’s a fitting adage for a fire lookout. Because Henterly’s been lucky to staff this lookout for consecutive seasons, he’s grown familiar with this corner of the backcountry. He’s watched a black bear become a mother, guiding her cub through the blueberry bushes until it was finally big enough to venture out on its own. There are also two large ravens that perch on the rooftop of his cabin, and they too welcomed offspring to their avian family. Last year their chick went missing. Henterly recalled the peregrine falcon and Cooper’s hawk that preyed upon the ravens in previous seasons. He hoped the young raven went off on its own, like the young bear.  While the animals have become Henterly’s closest community, there are regular pilgrims, like me, that come to visit the lookout. After so much time alone, Henterly welcomes the opportunity to talk with other humans face-to-face. In these dwindling days of staffed lookouts, Henterly has become a storyteller, sharing the deep history of this place with people who have traveled from all over the world. He told me how Native Americans quarried stones for tools from this ridge for at least 9,000 years. In 1859, a Swiss topographer named Henry Custer explored the area with Native guides and created maps from their journeys. Early U.S. Forest rangers and firefighters, like Ed Pulaski, fought and sometimes gave their lives to protect the land. Trail crews, volunteering their time, maintain the trail and the lookout. Fire crews treasure it as an icon. A long line of lookouts has staffed this peak, including Jack Kerouac, with his vision of a coming generation of backpackers heading into the wilderness.  The lookout on a smoky evening. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  I noticed a quote by Barry Lopez on the cabin wall: “One of the great dreams of man must be to find some place between the extremes of nature and civilization where it is possible to live without regret.” That ignited a conversation with Henterly about the important work of environmental authors, Lopez and Gary Snyder, Thoreau and Emerson. Talking to Henterly, I felt blissfully lost. I had dreamt of this place for so long, and now I had experienced it personally, making it a small part of my own story. But I didn’t want to outstay my welcome, so I thanked Henterly for his hospitality and slowly began the trek to my campsite at the southern tip of Starvation Ridge. Henterly walked with me along the alpine meadow. We stopped to scan for the young black bear, and he invited me to return in the morning for a cup of black coffee and more talk of our shared interests.  Back at my camp, more than 15 miles in any direction from the nearest road, I watched the dark of the night unfurl like a blanket over Starvation Ridge as pinpricks of stars poked through the sky. My eyelids grew heavy. There on that primeval post, one of the last of the fire watchers stood guard against the elements. Though I couldn’t see the lookout from my campsite, I imagined the lone light of the tower burning like a lantern in a sea of darkened peaks. It’s been burning in my mind these past years, a beacon of inspiration that draws backpacking pilgrims like me to this vast wilderness. Its light will burn longer still: In June 2023, Jim Henterly will begin his eighth consecutive season as Desolation Peak’s fire lookout.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhY2twYWNrZXIuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvbGFzdC1maXJlLWxvb2tvdXQtbm9ydGgtY2FzY2FkZXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtcGFyay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Michigan-based automaker Chrysler announced on Tuesday the voluntary safety recall of Jeep Cherokees, model years 2014 to 2016, that the automaker says are at-risk of catching fire, even when their engines are turned off.  The recall centers around the “power liftgate module” system, which is a motor system that opens and closes the rear hatch or cargo compartment of the vehicles.  Chrysler told federal regulators that water can seep into these liftgate module systems, potentially sparking a fire.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “An electrical short in the power liftgate module may lead to a vehicle fire with the ignition on or off,” Chrysler said in its formal recall notice filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Photo of where a ""power liftgate module"" is located in a Jeep Cherokee's rear hatch, according to an NHTSA filing by Chrysler in 2015.  The recall applies to at least 132,000 Jeep Cherokee models, the automaker told regulators, but some media reports have estimated more than 200,000 models could be at risk.  There is no repair or remedy at this time to fix the problem, so Chrysler is advising all owners of these vehicles to park them outside until further notice.  “Owners are advised to park outside and away from structures until the recall repair is complete,” the automaker told regulators. “The remedy is currently under development.”  Consumer advocates say the “park outside” part of the recall announcement could be especially hard for some Chicago owners, who rely on indoor parking garages.  “In some of the recent recalls where there’s a park outside warning, we’re seeing vehicles turned away from parking garages, even folks who have a monthly contract are told they can’t park in the garage until the recall repair has been performed,” said Michael Brooks, the Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety.  Brooks said owners need to take the recall notice seriously.  “NHTSA doesn’t issue a lot of ‘park outside’ warnings, so when they do, it’s important that owners heed that,” Brooks said.  In its formal filings with regulators, Chrysler said it began investigating concerns over “cargo compartment fires” in these vehicles in 2022, but customer reports to the company about the problem date back to 2017.  The filings indicate Chrysler may have received dozens of reports of fires taking place, but as of April 27, the automaker said it is “not aware of any accidents or injuries potentially related to this issue.”  A 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Jeep Cherokee owners may feel a sense of deja vu over the liftgate problem.  Back in October 2015, Chrysler announced a safety recall regarding the same liftgate fire issue in 2014 and 2015 models of the Jeep Cherokee, according to prior NHTSA filings reviewed by NBC 5 Responds.  At that time, Chrysler said it would install water shields to prevent moisture from corroding the liftgate module, in order to prevent the risk of fire.  But now, Chrysler said “Vehicles repaired under the prior recalls will still need to have the new remedy performed,” once it’s developed.  “This exact same defect is still occurring,” Brooks said. “And it looks like between the time that first fix was implemented to today, there have been between 50-100 fires, it’s a little unclear from their filings. That’s a large number of vehicle fires.”  No timeline was shared by Chrysler for when a new remedy to the problem will be developed.  For more information, Jeep Cherokee owners can call Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) at 1-800-853-1403, or contact the NHTSA Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or visit www.nhtsa.gov.

"fire","2023-05-01","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:06:47","Fire can be a force for either good or bad. For instance, the words “all fired up!” usually connotes positive feelings whereas the phrase “you’re fired!” can mean that you have been involuntarily deselected from the workforce.  Fire can destroy or renew. A little of both took place at our farm recently.  A year ago last May an unpredicted and unpredictable derecho struck our region. Our farmstead, like many others, lost dozens of trees. The number of trees in our shelterbelt that were busted off or uprooted could officially be classified as “more than you can shake a stick at.”  Like many homeowners in our region, I quickly formed a close personal relationship with my chainsaw. We are eternally grateful for all the help we received from neighbors and friends who pitched in with the cleanup. The downed trees were pitched into a brush pile that grew to approximately the same size and tonnage as a house.  Last week I decided that it was time to burn the brush pile. It seemed fitting that it was almost a year to the day after the derecho.  One cannot simply conduct a major burn on a whim nowadays. One must alert the authorities so that they can be prepared in case things get out of hand. Another factor is that people who live hereabouts become nervous whenever they see a large plume of smoke rising into the sky. Such a thing is likely to be reported to the authorities, causing enormous amounts of undue consternation and perhaps a visit from your local fire department.  I watched the weather forecast closely and chose a day that promised light winds. Early on the morning of the burn I strolled down to the brush pile accompanied by our faithful farm dog, Bella.  “Don’t play with fire!” is an admonishment that’s often issued to little boys. This only serves to make fire seem all the more fascinating to the boy. Our family incinerated our household refuse when I was a kid and I frequently volunteered to tend the burn barrel. I thus acquired a deep respect for the way fire can behave. Liquid accelerants cost me more than one set of eyebrows.  A few well-placed wadded-up newspapers were all that was needed to ignite the brush pile. Within seconds the fire had leaped from twig to branch, roaring greedily as it gobbled the desiccated wood.  The heat quickly became surprisingly intense. Even at 50 feet away, Bella and I were beginning to feel quite toasty. We probably could have roasted weenies right where we stood.  Bella sat at my feet and peered up at me with an anxious expression that seemed to say, “Dad? Don’t you see what’s happening? Are you sure that everything is OK?”  I assured her that things were going exactly as planned. “But maybe we should back up a few yards,” I told her. “If we stand this close much longer, we’ll both soon be hot dogs.”  It was one of those rare mornings here on the prairie when the wind was virtually nonexistent. This happens about as often as a visit from Halley’s Comet.  Some of the trees in the brush pile were absolutely huge. One of them had a trunk that appeared to be the same diameter as a rear tractor tire. There could be no doubt that this tree was more than 100 years old. This meant there could also be no doubt that it had been planted by my great-grandfather Charlie Sveen, who homesteaded our farm.  Glancing at the garden hose at my feet, I thought about how Charlie had probably carried buckets of water to that tree to nurse it through long, hot summers. The tree had returned the favor by providing shelter from our relentless winds for multiple generations of my family.  And now it was going back to the atmosphere from whence it came via the rapacious flames of an ignoble brush pile fire.  Like a passionate new romance, a brush pile fire throws off tremendous amounts of heat and drama at the start. And like a romance, things eventually settle down to a slow smolder. That is when the real work begins.  I used a long-handled shovel to push wayward deadwood onto the glowing heap of coals as a fickle breeze pushed the lazy smoke in random directions. By the end of the day, I had absorbed more smoke than a side of bacon.  “Phew!” exclaimed my wife when I walked into the house, “You smell like you’re on fire!”  It’s gratifying to know that the spark is still there after more than 40 years.  — Jerry’s book, Dear County Agent Guy, is available at http://Workman.com and in bookstores nationwide","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnNoYWxsaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL29waW5pb24vbG9jYWwtY29sdW1ucy8yMDIzLzA1L3BsYXlpbmctd2l0aC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ohio has eight cities on highest home fire risk index.  Canton and Akron have made Hartford insurance company's index of ""top 150 U.S. cities with highest home fire risk.""  The insurer ranked Canton as No. 41 and Akron as No. 40 on its list.  The city it considered with the highest home fire risk was Modesto, California. Ohio had six other cities among the 150. Cincinnati was ranked No. 8 in the index. Youngstown was No. 16. Columbus was No. 39. Cleveland was No. 98, Dayton No. 113 and Toledo No. 122.  The Hartford said it each of the cities on its list of 150 will get $10,000 each to fund fire safety education for children.  More:Deadly rash of house fires in Ohio: 'We know that so many of these fires are preventable.'  Jeff Welch, an assistant director of media and public relations for the Hartford, says the company releases its index of 150 cities with the highest home fire risk once every three years as part of its Junior Fire Marshal Program to educate kids about fire risks. The first was in 2017 and the second in 2020.  Welch said the index covers all residential structures, including single-family homes, duplexes and multi-family units like apartment complexes. It doesn't include vehicle fires or fires at businesses.  Data crunched over three years  In the 2017 index, Welch said, Akron ranked 54th and Canton was not on the list. In the 2020 index, Canton was No. 72 and Akron was No. 33.  Messages seeking comment were left with the Canton and Akron fire departments.  Welch stressed that the index only indicates home fire risk for a particular city in relation to the others on the index.  “The ranking itself is all relative. You could be a safe city but (the) 109 cities below you are a little safer (in terms of home fire risk). It’s not saying (a city on the list) is a dangerous city. I wouldn't frame it that way and that's not how we frame it.”  Welch said, “It’s not an indication of anything to do with the fire department or response times ... or training."" He said the purpose of the index was to generate interest and support for fire safety education and to help educate people on what to do in the event of a fire.  Welch said the Hartford's data analysts come up with the rankings looking at the number of home fires in zip codes for a particular city per a certain number of people who live there according to Census data. They then contract with a polling firm to reach people around the country online and poll them on their behavior that may increase or reduce the risk of a fire. Welch said at least 100 people in each of the 150 cities on the list were surveyed.  Questions on the survey asked people if they engaged in behaviors that raised the risk of fires or mitigated the risk or impact of fires. Had they left something cooking on the stove for too long? Did they have a working fire extinguisher? Did they regularly replace the batteries of their smoke detectors? Did members of the household have an emergency escape plan?  Welch said the goal of the program was to identity the cities where children best need fire education that the Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program could target with the $10,000 grants.  ""We’re trying to identify where the fire safety gaps are through this index,"" he said, adding that the Junior Fire Marshal program has educated 112 million children the past 76 years. ”Really the goal is to educate these kids so they become fire safe adults.""

The house at 556 Northwest Drive off DuPont Road caught fire Saturday evening and was so badly damaged firefighters were unable to enter it to completely extinguish the blaze.  Smoke was seen at the site Sunday and Monday as well.  The cause of the fire is undetermined due to the extent of the damage but it remains under investigation, said Jason Baltic, deputy state fire marshal and chief investigator for the Fire Marshal’s office.  Washington Bottom Volunteer Fire Chief Garry Freed said Monday the fire appeared suspicious because there were no utilities on at the house.  It’s one of two structures owned by the DNR at the site, after it was transferred to the state by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the late ’60s or early ’70s.  Westfall said the DNR used to allow people to stay there in exchange for maintaining the property but it has moved away from that model. Both buildings were dilapidated before Saturday’s fire, he said.  “The agency has wanted to demolish the buildings for quite some time,” Westfall said.  The sticking point has been the demolition of the larger lockhouse along the river as well.  “It’s likely to be expensive,” he said.

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcmEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc2FjcmFtZW50by1jcmV3cy1wcmVwYXJlLXdpbGRsYW5kLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtZmlyZXMvNDM5MTIyNDnSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3JhLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLWNyZXdzLXByZXBhcmUtd2lsZGxhbmQtZW5jYW1wbWVudC1maXJlcy80MzkxMjI0OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""SantaRosa"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:14:00","SANTA ROSA -- Fire departments across the Bay Area say the record-setting wet weather at the beginning of the year is not a reason to take it easy this fire season.  In some ways, all that rain will create more work for residents to protect their homes from fire danger later this year.  ""The main thing, my understanding with fire, is the embers, it's not necessarily the flames,"" said Jake Lehrer, a Santa Rosa resident who designed his home to be hardened against fire risk almost 20 years ago. ""If nobody is here, overtime...it will start to grow and burn the house down.""  Lehrer knew he was living in a fire-prone area, so he asked the city for help adding features around his property, including a stucco house and a special deck. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, he added more layers of protection including new vents at the base of the house and a metal roof.  ""It's all protecting the house from embers flying,"" he explained.  The metal roof can block embers from getting under that surface. The home also has a non-venting attic. His deck is sealed in a way to keep embers from spreading so close to his house. While those long-term amenities to his home help, he still clears his property each year, not just trimming grass and weeds but removing dead trees.  The wet start to 2023 does not give him any comfort about the steps he will need to take this spring.  ""I would say the main thing is to keep fuel away from your house -- at 30 feet, 50 feet, any fuel,"" Lehrer said.  Santa Rosa Fire Department Fire Inspector Will Powers says residents need grass and weeds on their property knocked down under four inches ahead of fire season.  ""The first thing we're looking at is what's closest to the home,"" he told KPIX while visiting Lehrer's home. ""We're looking at the roof line. This resident here has trimmed this stuff away from the roof line. That is very crucial in creating that defensible safe.""  Late-season rain and the large amount of rainfall the region received will contribute to vegetation growth. Clearing fuels and cutting grass to create defensible space will require that vegetation get cut at least twice this year, compared to when drought conditions allow for the grass to only be cut once.  ""This is the time when we want residents thinking about the plans they need to make for what could potentially be a long, long summer,"" said Santa Rosa Fire Division Chief Fire Marshall Paul Lowenthal. ""Our community has been through some pretty significant events and are taking things a lot more seriously and it's preventing damage here locally.""  Lowenthal said they will likely declare the start of fire season in the beginning of June. Warmer weather happening this week will factor into that decision. Inspections of properties will begin the first and second week of June.  ""We definitely were caught off guard in 2017. In 2020, we saw the effects of what measures like the resident here has taken,"" Lowenthal told KPIX. ""It's great to see efforts like this. We still see a lot of homes that still need work done. But for every resident that does work like this, it's one less home that could potentially be damaged or destroyed.""  In 2020, there were 1,152 properties impacted by fire in Santa Rosa, but only 30 were destroyed, according to Lowenthal. He says that better prepared residents helped make the difference that fire season. That's why he wants to encourage the public to take important steps now to help them through the summer and fall.  Leaders at Con Fire add that they anticipate a more dangerous fire season will return sooner rather than later after a relative break in recent years. The abundance of vegetation and all the rain during the winter is part of why they are preparing for the worst.  The agency says there will likely be a greater crop of fuel this year and it will eventually dry out, that could lead to a busy and potentially dangerous fire season.  ""To me, the rain allows us to have drinking water. It doesn't help with fire,"" Lehrer said.

Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Crews battled a large fire in a five-story apartment building in downtown Portland on Tuesday.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  According to Portland Fire & Rescue, the fire started at about 10:30 a.m. at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city.  Smoke from an apartment fire in downtown Portland, Ore., May 16, 2023, is seen from the Wells Fargo Center in this provided photo. Courtesy of Arnold Benson  Several people were rescued from the building, and shortly afterward crews were ordered to withdraw from the building due to the fire’s growth.  Barbett Grace sat on the pavement and watched the building burn Tuesday. She lived on the third floor and said she didn’t notice the fire alarm at first because they’ve had several false alarms. Then she heard the fire trucks outside.  “So, I opened the door and it was dark and full of smoke,” Grace said. “I just went to the window and climbed out.”  Grace, 67, has arthritis, but she managed to get down the three stories using the building’s fire escape. She had been scheduled to move this week because her doctor worried she wouldn’t be able to use the fire escape. Now, she’s moving six blocks away, but will turn up empty-handed because all her possessions were destroyed in the fire.  Barbett Grace, 67, pictured here on May 16, 2023, lived on the third floor of The May apartments. She said she managed to escape the building using a fire escape after the apartments erupted in flames. Fire officials closed streets around the roughly 113-year-old building out of fear it may collapse from the fire. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  ”It’s mostly just stuff. The paperwork, my veterans paperwork, my drivers license, Social Security card — all of those are going to have to be replaced. And that’s going to be the biggest thing,” she said.  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said many people and animals had to scramble from the building as the fire quickly spread.  “Upon arrival some of the first arriving crews were actually just aggressively running the hallways, slamming doors saying, ‘This is not a false alarm. Get out, get out, get out!’” he said.  Two firefighters suffered minor medical issues, but no other injuries were reported.  Graves added that emergency vehicles moved away from the roughly 113-year-old building in case of a structural collapse. The streets around the building were also closed.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Most of Interstate 405 closed starting around noon Tuesday as smoke from the fire limited visibility on the freeway. The closure resulted in significantly snarled traffic throughout the city in the afternoon, even after the highway reopened.  Portland General Electric also cut power to the area as a precaution.  Firefighters monitored the building overnight into Wednesday morning. Portland’s city engineer will evaluate its stability on Wednesday.  Known issues  The May apartment building was constructed in 1910, according to property records.  Graves called it a “non-sprinkled building” that did have “sprinkled exits.” He said firefighters did not know if the sprinklers worked or whether they went off. An agreement from Aug. 8, 1974, notes The May had some sprinklers along the corridors, stairs and the basement, according to Ken Ray, a spokesperson with the city’s Bureau of Development Services. It also had hardwired smoke detectors, alarms and fire extinguishers, according to that same 1974 agreement.  The fire remains under investigation, though Graves said it appears it began on the third floor.  Records show the building had some documented issues in recent months. On Dec. 1, 2022, the city received a complaint stating the building had “severe leaks, mold, mildew” that there was “exposed electrical wiring” and that there were “no smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detectors.”  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  On Dec. 15, a Bureau of Development inspector went to the building and documented 10 violations that were sent in a letter to SkyNat Limited Partnership, the property’s owner. The violations included repairing emergency lighting on several floors, replacing an expired fire extinguisher, and addressing electrical extension cords in the lobby “daisy chained with other power strips or extension cords” that created a potential safety or fire hazard.  The city gave SkyNat two months to correct the violations.  ”Due to limited staffing, the Bureau of Development Services does not have the resources to re-inspect most buildings on the deadlines set in violation letters,” Ray said in a statement. “It is the property owner’s responsibility to fix the concerns and notify BDS for a re-inspection. That did not happen, and fines began accruing for the uncorrected violations.”  SkyNat paid fines in February and March and, as of April 27, still owes the city $1,723.  The Bureau of Development Services inquired last month about the 10 documented violations, and SkyNat told the city it was still fixing the violations. City inspectors returned to the property Monday and found most, but not all of the violations had been fixed.  According to its website, SkyNat is a family business with more than 500 residential units in Portland, Gresham, Vancouver and Tigard. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  When reached by OPB, a maintenance contractor for the company referred a request for comment to company officials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2018-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:16:30","WASHINGTON -- In partnership with Meta, FEMA’s Ready Campaign, the Ad Council and the U.S. Fire Administration co-launched a new virtual reality experience promoting fire safety awareness.  In “The Escape Plan,” users must work through various obstacles to make a timely escape from an apartment building fire. The free virtual reality experience lets users practice their fire escape skills on their own time and in a safe, controlled environment and can be used with virtual reality equipment. At the end of the experience, users can create their own fire escape plan and visit Ready.gov and Listo.gov in Spanish language to further prepare for home fires and other hazards.  While virtual reality equipment is recommended, but not required, a desktop version of “ The Escape Plan ” allows users to participate in the experience and practice fire safety anywhere there is internet connectivity.  “From our user-friendly FEMA App that provides real-time weather alerts and helps people prepare for common hazards, to the use of geospatial tools to identify the hardest hit communities following a disaster, FEMA continues to use every tool at our disposal to help people before, during and after disaster,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “We are excited to partner with Meta and the Ad Council on this new virtual reality tool and we are eager to further leverage technology to protect people and save lives.”  “You don’t have much time to act in the event of a fire,” said Michelle Hillman, Ad Council Chief Campaign Development Officer. “Being able to practice a fire safety and evacuation plan before the emergency arises will reduce the chance of panic and ultimately save lives.”  “At Meta we are building for the next generation of the internet, which is why our partnership with FEMA and the Ad Council to develop immersive experiences in Virtual and Augmented Reality like the Escape Plan is so important,” said Caitlin Ryan, VP Creative Shop EMEA – Meta. “In VR, mistakes can be made without real-world consequences, ensuring individuals can safely learn and are better prepared, ready to act quickly in a real emergency. The VR version of this product creates the sensation of being present in a virtual three-dimensional environment, allowing you to experience and learn what you need to do to escape a home fire. While the Escape Plan is a virtual experience, the impact will be real.”  Virtual reality is emerging as an effective way to augment professional and personal emergency training and can have advantages over large-scale training programs that take extensive time and resources. Experiences can be developed to simulate an environment, whether the setting be in an office, emergency room or in your own home, rather than placing the trainee in the potential path of harm.  “Proven technology like automatic fire sprinklers, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors save the lives of civilians every day, and the U.S. Fire Administration has long advocated for the use of immersive learning tools to protect our nation’s fire fighters and increase public safety education,” said U.S. Administrator Moore-Merrell. “It is our hope that ‘The Escape Plan’ and other technological advancements will protect even more people and help us to further address America’s persistent fire problem.”  “The Escape Plan” joins a suite of digital tools leveraged by FEMA to help people before, during and after disasters. Last year, the Ready Campaign launched an easy-to-use digital form to help individuals and families create an emergency plan on their phone or laptop. The form can be saved onto any device and emailed to other members of their family and is available in both English and Spanish languages. And just last year, FEMA updated its mobile app to give users increased personalization options and help them take charge of disasters. The new app is more accessible, with increased functionality and innovative features to help people prepare for, protect against and recover from disasters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlbWEuZ292L3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMzA1MTYvbmV3LXZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS1leHBlcmllbmNlLXRlc3RzLXVzZXJzLWZpcmUtc2FmZXR5LXNraWxsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-02","14:00:00","{""MillHall"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:21:57","MILL HALL — Mill Hall Fire Company will temporarily stop conducting lift assists.  Announced during Bald Eagle Township’s supervisor meeting Monday, the fire company will temporarily stop responding to lift assists.  According to Mill Hall Fire Chief Tony Walker, the company voted to discontinue them for the time being during their May’s meeting. He added the issue is due to a lack of help as well as other issues he would not publicly address.  The fire company previously discontinued lift assists about six years ago. At that time they stopped due to lack of training and issues of liability, according to Walker.  “That was a big issue and that is part of this other one — why we quit doing them. I did leave that up to the company, so they voted,” he said.  Lift assists are involved when an individual is assisted up to a mobile position from the ground by emergency service officials. They are not treated or brought to a hospital for medical attention. An ambulance is dispatched for emergency specific incidents.  Since lift assists fall under a non-emergency, it falls back onto fire companies, according to Flemington Goodwill Hose Ambulance Chief Kim Shainline, who was in attendance during the meeting.  “If there is any form of question on if it is a medical issue, then an ambulance is dispatched,” she said.  Other municipalities have either stopped doing assists or have partnered with local ambulance stations, according to Walker. They signed up to be quick response services (QRS).  Firefighters are meant to be well rounded for such incidents, according to Walker. There are currently only two medically trained EMTs at Mill Hall Fire Company, he added.  Shainline was in attendance with other members of Goodwill Ambulance in order to set up Goodwill Hose as the next responding department. Currently, after the Mill Hall Fire Company, Goodwill EMS is the next to call for lift assists through dispatchers.  Goodwill Hose Fire Chief Gary Mellot is offering to take up the assists with Mill Hall being unable to, according to Shainline.  “Gary said they (Goodwill Hose) would still be interested in helping fulfill that need because now it is an unmet need for your community. Which could mean that person ends up sitting on the floor for a half hour to an hour or longer, and now it does become a medical emergency. What if there is no ambulance available for that patient?” she said.  More of a burden is being placed onto ambulance services who are taking care of emergencies with injured people, according to Shainline. Ambulances from Williamsport or State College are forced to pick up lift assists when Clinton County services are busy.  “That doesn’t make any sense to me, especially when there are firefighters around who are still doing the lift assists,” Shainline said.  The caller is indicated if they are in an emergency with a dispatcher. The dispatcher then has a list of questions signifying if it is an emergency or not. A patient is billed after three lift assists, according to Shainline. The first two have no charge.  With the lack of manpower for lifting assisting, Walker said the fire company partnered with Goodwill Hose as they were doing nine-tenths of the lift assists.  “They were doing most of them for us because we didn’t have anyone,” Walker said.  Supervisors had an issue of what is considered an emergency, since they have a year-long contract with Mill Hall Fire Company. Supervisor Stephen Tasselli said that Mill Hall is in a contract with them and should stick by it until it expires in December.  “A contract is a contract. I don’t want to hold a gun to your head because of one thing but it is what it is,” he said.  Bald Eagle Township tries to give every emergency service department in the area a stipend, according to Chairman Tuff Rine. Mill Hall Fire Company gets a major share due to the number of calls they receive in Bald Eagle Township.  “I can’t really tell you Bald Eagle Township can do anything other than ask that our communications center follows the call procedure that has been set up — somebody is calling to get lifted versus somebody who has fallen and broken their head open — I think it becomes a question of the communications center on who they should call,” Rine said. “If Mill Hall has decided that they are not going to do lift assists anymore, then I would think the communications center should flip to the other page and have Goodwill take care of it.”  The Mill Hall Fire Company has been dealing with issues regarding lift assists for almost a year and a half.  “Because of some issues that some monkey dug up which caused a lot of chaos within all the emergency services here in the county. That is why a lot of them quit doing them (lift assists),” Walker explained.  He added the fire departments and supervisors should meet and “hash something out.”  Tasselli urged that they are trying to support everybody with the issue. He added he hopes they can work together to come to a resolution.  “We are kind of in a catch 22 listening to everybody and trying to help out and communicate with you all to keep this service,” he said. “We also tried on a couple of occasions with services to try to go to Lock Haven… to get a back door for you guys besides Flemington and we were told ‘hey we can’t do that, you’re not allowed to do that’ from the city manager. We are kind of in the same boat you are but I think you guys are doing a good job communicating with what’s happening right now.”  Shainline asked for the supervisors’ approval for Goodwill Hose to be the next due for lift assists.  Colten Mellott, the deputy fire chief for Goodwill Hose, was also in attendance during the meeting Monday, representing the fire company. He explained how their officers have the minimum training requirements for lift assists. There are about three EMT trained members of the company, so far.  “We are here to help the community whether it’s Flemington Borough, Bald Eagle Township, Mill Hall, Lock Haven. We ran 81 calls this year and so far, we have not dropped a single one. Our department’s ever expanding, we run an engine tanker, a traffic unit… and we have a rescue. We put medical equipment on board and we are working to get into QRS certification. All of our line officers, whether it’s from the fire chief down to the sergeant, all of them we require a minimum, you have to have first aid/CPR and most of our guys that are going are officers, so they have the minimum training requirements,” he explained.  They will ask the patient if they are hurt, and if they are, Goodwill Hose will contact an ambulance service for assessment. Mellott offered supervisors their service whenever they needed.  In other business:  There has been no progress with the Cottage Lane water line project.  At April’s supervisors meeting, Steve Gibson, the director of planning/county engineer attended to discuss the project. During that meeting, it was discussed that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will pay for engineering of the water lines once there is a project sponsor. A sponsor must be the entity that applies for the necessary loans. They will take on all financial responsibility if grant funding is not received. It is an issue that supervisors fear to take on currently.  As of Monday’s meeting, there is nothing new from Gibson or Suburban Water, according to supervisors.  “I thought Steve Gibson was supposed to get back to us with more details and present some options,” Tasselli said.  The only cost for the township would be legal fees according to supervisor Kenny McGhee’s summation of what Gibson stated.  “I am in favor of signing the application to get it started,” McGhee said. “The engineering is going to be paid for by DEP. They’re supplying it, and might as well use it.”  The project will not go anywhere until the application has a sponsor. Supervisors plan to contact Gibson about the application signage and making progress with Cottage Lane.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvbWlsbC1oYWxsLWZpcmUtY28tZGlzY29udGludWVzLWxpZnQtYXNzaXN0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR) is reminding the public to exercise caution and follow all state laws and local ordinances regarding open burning. The National Weather Service has issued Special Weather Statements for elevated fire weather and additional Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings are anticipated.  Open burning requires a permit from your town forest fire warden, and Vermonters should always check with their town forest fire warden before burning. When conditions are dry, town fire wardens can institute a burn ban in their respective town.  Find your town forest fire warden.  Most areas in Vermont have been 1” below normal rainfall for the last two weeks, with the last measurable rain on May 3. The weather forecast over the next few weeks does not indicate any signs of relief, with little to no precipitation forecasted.  The dry conditions call for extra attention when open burning—particularly with campfires—to reduce the risk of wildland fires.  FPR issues a daily Fire Danger Forecast for Vermont. Today’s forecast is high or very high. Get the most recent update:  Increased awareness can go a long way to limit the occurrence of wildland fires. Please help prevent wildfires by following these simple guidelines:  Be aware of the current weather conditions before igniting a fire.  Understand open burning laws.  Obtain a permit from your Town Forest Fire Warden.  Never leave an open fire unattended.  Never build a campfire on top of duff.  Use a camp stove to prevent escaped fires.  Extinguish fires completely before leaving. This can be done by dousing the fire in water, including all embers. Use a live, green branch to mix and stir the embers. If water is not available, use soil or sand to mix into the embers to cool them down. Continue to mix water and soil with the embers until the material is cool. Before leaving, use the back of your hand to check for heat in the campfire.    Find more Wildland Fire information from FPR online.  Source: May 15, 2023.

Steamboat Springs Fire Rescue Chief Chuck Cerasoli said the focus of the work will be on “hardening” Blackmer Trail as a critical road access point for fire officials to safety and quickly position firefighting equipment in the case of wildfires that could move toward Steamboat Springs from the southwest.

(WCIA) – What started as a final hurrah for newly graduated U of I students could follow some of them to court.  “There was one couch put in the middle of the street. Then all of a sudden there [were] 20 couches and it was kind-of the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” U of I senior Jared Kurland said.  Then, that pile of furniture was set on fire as hundreds of people watched. Students say the crowd started gathering just before midnight. By 12:15, the fire ignited at the intersection of S Oak and E Chalmers Streets in Champaign. By 1 a.m. Monday, multiple citations for open alcohol violations were issued.  “I mean, I probably inhaled half a couch just being in the vicinity because everything was going up in the air,” U of I senior Spencer Gallagher said.  That’s a sentence you don’t hear every day.  “Someone wanted to start a fire and that’s exactly what happened,” Kurland said.  300 people crowded around a residential intersection – some with alcohol, old furniture and lighter fluid in hand.  “It was terrifying. We were all texting each other being like, ‘does everybody have renters’ insurance?'” U of I senior Regan Sauer said.  That’s because it happened just a few feet from Sauer’s front lawn, in a pocket of Campustown known as “Seniorland.”  “We’ve had people over before but it’s never been this severe,” Sauer said. “We’re kind-of upset that this happened.”  And no one really knows why, except that it may have been part of a farewell tradition among new graduates.  “It’s kind-of the last thing all the seniors do. Then after this we all walked to the quad, have a good time there, and say our goodbyes to each other,” U of I senior Sahil Yemul said.  “There was a similar instance of this last year, though maybe not quite as large,” University of Illinois Police Department Communications Director Patrick Wade said in a statement.  “It wasn’t a good thing. I mean, it was cool to watch at least,” Gallagher said.  UIPD says the gathering is currently under investigation and could bring serious legal consequences. So far, six students have been given notices to appear in court.  “Luckily I didn’t get one but I was here when they were passing them out,” Kurland said.  Plus, they’re all feeling lucky no one was hurt. Students said it was a way to spend their last moments in Champaign together…  “It was probably not the safest thing to do but you can’t really do this anywhere else so everyone was just having a good time,” Yemul said.  …And simply, to dispose of items they don’t need anymore.  “There are all these old couches that people have and they want to get rid of them somehow. So they just brought them out there and set them on fire,” Kurland said.  It was eventually extinguished by the fire department, and Champaign Public Works crews cleared the road of debris. But that didn’t stop the house on that corner from receiving a notice for excessive trash, and partial responsibility for a mess created largely by strangers.  “That’s why we’re out here now trying to pick it up because we obviously don’t want to get in trouble with the city. We’re not troublemaker girls we just want to be on everybody’s good side,” Sauer said.  UIPD declined an interview because the investigation is ongoing.

The blaze occurred in the kitchen area of The Thai on North Mission Street just before 1 a.m.  Wenatchee Police Department Capt. Edgar Reinfeld says officers had to rescue both men as the fire raged, including the need to physically carry one of them from the building.  ""Officers arrived and immediately found one male just inside the building. Then, they discovered there was a second man in the structure and got them both out safely. Through an investigation it was learned that these two were cooking inside the restaurant after hours and that both were intoxicated while doing so.""  Police say the restaurant's owners told officers the pair were not authorized to be inside the restaurant, which was closed at the time of the fire.  Reinfeld says the employee's actions caused the fire but its exact source is still under investigation and that charges against the men are unlikely, but possible.  ""Most fire-related charges such as Reckless Burning or Arson - and in this case it would be considered a potential arson because it was an occupied building even though it was just the two of them inside the building - require an element of recklessness at the least, like someone saying 'this is a really bad idea but let's do it anyway', or the intent to actually cause a structure fire. And I'm not sure we're going to get to either one of those based on the evidence that we currently have on the fire, but if something else were to come to light, we would possibly file charges.""

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fre, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:  Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXNpZGVudHMtdm9pY2UtY29uY2VybnMtYWZ0ZXItcGFybWEtYXBhcnRtZW50LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWZpcmUv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Jlc2lkZW50cy12b2ljZS1jb25jZXJucy1hZnRlci1wYXJtYS1hcGFydG1lbnQtYnVpbGRpbmctZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3Bvc3RzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FjY2lkZW50LWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC9mb3JtZXItc291dGgtZ2xlbnMtZmFsbHMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1lYXJseS1tb3JuaW5nLWZpcmUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNzNiMTA2YS1mMjY3LTExZWQtOWVhZS1iZjNiYmYxNjIyODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
