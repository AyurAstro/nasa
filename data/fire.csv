Both Bostian Heights and China Grove had fire trucks hit in the incident, according to reports.  On its Facebook page, Bostian Heights fire department stated, “When you are approaching emergency vehicles, you must reduce your speed and move over on interstates and highways with multiple lanes, please reduce your speed even if traffic is moving in the other lanes.”  According to reports, both fire departments and a towing company were working to clear a crash that involved a tractor-trailer and a passenger car near mile marker 65. “A tanker (Bostian Heights FD) and two engines (Bostian Heights FD/China Grove FD) were stationary in lanes 1 and 2 with all emergency lights activated when a passenger car struck the tanker and came to rest next to one of the engines.” It appears the driver of the car may have tried to stop, from skid marks on the roadway, but ended up sliding sideways into the Bostian Heights truck, then bumping the China Grove truck.  Initial reviews of damage to the Bostian Heights truck appeared extensive but further review is needed.  “Fortunately, all personnel were in the safety zone in front of the trucks and our old girl (Tanker 414) saved our lives,” the fire department posted. “All fire personnel along with the driver of the passenger car escaped injuries and were able to return home to their loved ones.”"

The Droge family says their smoke alarms didn’t sound until part of their North Tacoma home was engulfed in flames last Friday.  It was a delay that forced their daughter to jump nearly 20 feet to survive.  “I was in shock and I couldn’t stop screaming,” recalls 15-year-old Kayli.  She woke up to smoke filling her bedroom.  While the rest of the family of 11 made it to safety, Kayli couldn’t make it out from upstairs.  “I was like ‘baby, jump out the window. Jump out the window!” says her mother, Destany Droge. “She was like, ‘I can’t. I can’t.’  “I thought I was going to die in that moment,” says Kayli.  But she jumped, with Droge rushing to break the fall. Droge tore her rotator cuff in the process.  “I’d do it again in a heartbeat,” says Droge.  Kayli was rushed to Harborview Medical Center and released on Tuesday. Her mom calls it a day of joy for the family.  “What matters to me is that we’re here. We can look at each other, we can see each other. Everything else will come,” says Droge.  She tells KIRO 7 that the home is a total loss and that at the end of this week, the family doesn’t know where they’ll live. Right now they’re staying in a donated Air-BnB. The family created a GoFundMe to help with expenses and shelter.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation by the Tacoma Fire Department."

What You Need To Know Hadley Fire Department hosted a fire sprinkler demonstration to highlight the benefits of having them in homes    The department said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage because of the flammability of the items inside In Massachusetts, usually a building's size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system    The department said a sprinkler will only go off if a fire is in that room, as opposed to some movies where they all go off at once  They said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage today because of the flammability of items inside.  ""Fire growth is exponentially faster than what it used to be,"" said Fire Chief Michael Spanknebel. ""So we would have 12-15 minutes before we would start seeing really heavy fire conditions. In today, you saw it was 2-3 minutes where we were at flashover at the room because of all those, the foams and the plastics and everything that are in modern construction and modern homes for furniture.""  In Massachusetts, typically a building’s size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system. On Tuesday, the fire department demonstrated what a home with a sprinkler would look like during a fire vs. one without.  Spanknebel said there are many myths about sprinklers which prevent people from using them, so he hopes the visual aid can offer a different perspective.  ""I just think because they see the commercial side of it where you have galvanized piping and extensive installs for a Walmart or Home Depot, where you see huge heads and piping all over the place,"" he said. ""This is basically a rated PVC piping, looks like a plumbing that you put in your walls. It's all done basically like plumbing.""  Spanknebel said another myth they hope to address is one around the amount of water that goes off during a home fire.  ""If one sprinkler head goes off, all of them don't off go off like you see in the movies,"" he said. ""That single head that's tripped by the heat is the only unit that will go off and it will control that fire, low amounts of water, so you can how much it saved the furniture, saved the room.""  Spanknebel said a sprinkler system can also buy people more time in the event of an emergency.  ""So that you have the time to get your family out of the house,"" Spanknebel said. ""And it's also saving the firefighters that are coming to your home to try and extinguish the fire. So if that sprinkler head can control that, that's gonna allow us the time to get there if needed, if the head doesn't take care of itself, it's gonna allow the time to extinguish it completely.""  Spanknebel encouraged everyone who may be considering building a new home to have a sprinkler system installed. He said it not only protects those living in the home but the firefighters as well."

We might have had the scenario but we didn't have the smoke to go with it or the sound to go with it,"" Chief Scantlin stated.

The fire was called in just before 7 a.m. in the 9000 block of Wurzbach Road, not far from Datapoint Drive and Interstate 10.  Mark Trevino, a battalion chief with the San Antonio Fire Department, said they were able to do a partial search of the building and found nobody inside.  “As soon as we saw fire through the roof, we did what we could to do a search, as it has been known to have some people coming in and out,” Trevino said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.  The area, along with Wurzbach Road, was closed off to drivers as firefighters worked to put out hot spots.  “There’s hot spots right now since this is an older building and it’s a lot of wood structure. It’s got heavy wood floors and it’s built on different areas. There’s layer on top of layers so we have to get in there and tear into the building in order to get to the hot spots,” Trevino said.  Fire officials say the building will be demolished. Tuesday’s fire is the third time the fire department was called to the structure, as they responded back on Jan. 27 and previously on March 6, 2022.  “The structure is unstable. It’s unsafe so the city will have to go head and make it a hazard, so that it can’t get people involved and caught into,” Trevino said.  Anahi Martinez, a resident nearby, works at a building not far from the one that caught fire.  “I have a group chat with my work employees and my coworkers and they said there was a fire at the abandoned Japanese restaurant,” Martinez said. “I came out, I just saw all of the fire trucks, the ambulances.”  According to the San Antonio Fire Department website, as many as 14 units answered the call."

The location was off Turner Creek Road.  Bergstrom said fewer than 20 acres on private property were impacted. There were multiple burn piles, and the blaze initially started when one got out of control.  “Looking at the fuel models — types of ground material that could potentially ignite — the remoteness of the area, the terrain, lack of access, I called for a third alarm,” Bergstrom said. “This was not flat ground. This was steep timber terrain.”  Bergstrom said the “wildland model” for firefighting was activated for increased fire activity in this case. Different types of hoses came into play, for example, according to the chief.  “This doubled in size in less than 20 minutes,” Bergstrom said. “Structures were being threatened. Opting to go to a third alarm called in more resources, not just our immediate neighbors.”  In addition to Yamhill, agencies that responded to the callout were from Amity, Gaston, Grand Ronde Tribal, Lafayette, McMinnville and Tualatin Valley (Newberg).  There were 13 pieces of equipment and 35 firefighters on scene.  “This came extremely early in the year,” Bergstrom said of the fire. If this incident is any indication of the fire season that agencies might be facing this year, he said “it puts us on the ready.” He said this was the type of fire activity he would expect to see in June or July.  “Fuels have dried out,” the chief said. “We had an east wind and higher than normal temperature. The fuel moisture is dropping rapidly.”  In recent days, wildland fires were reported in the following locations: 21000 block of Dopp Road, Newberg; 3000 block Stoller Road, Dayton; 16000 block of Masonville Road, McMinnville; 28000 block of Andy Riggs Road, Grand Ronde, and 16000 block of Kings Grade Road, Newberg."

Talley has been a volunteer or on the paid staff in fire departments in three states. Currently, she is a lieutenant with Grant County Fire District 3 in Quincy, and earned certification as a fire marshal in April.  Her college instructor was part of the fire department in Apple Valley, California, a town that was big enough to have a paid staff.  “I got hired on there. It was mostly as an inspector, where you do fire and life safety inspections, public education kind of stuff, which I really enjoyed. I got my first taste of it then, back in my 20s,” she said.  Talley said she and husband Dave wanted a change and moved to the small Eastern Oregon town of Helix.  “I started volunteering at my local department and went up through the ranks, (became a) training officer, and became a district chief there,” she said.  The family came to Quincy when her husband accepted a job at Quincy High School.  “So I started all over as a volunteer here,” she said. “I got to recreate myself with each state.”  She joined GCFD 3 as a volunteer in 2009 and eventually was hired for a paid position as the firefighter retention coordinator. She’s been on the district’s paid staff for 10 years, she said.  “This is my 29th year,” she said, as a volunteer or on a department’s paid staff.  But as a veteran, Talley said she started thinking of the future.  “So I started thinking, ‘Okay, what are some things I can do, that if I can physically do this job, (will) still make a difference?’ Now this department still requires you to be a line firefighter. We’re just not big enough to have you stand alone in an (administration) role,” she said.  But she still wanted more skills, she said, and started thinking about the fire prevention and inspection work she had done in her 20s. Jim Kling, the district’s previous fire marshal, had announced his plans to retire. Talley started taking fire inspector certification classes and working with Kling to learn from his experience and expertise.  “It’s one thing to get the certification - okay yeah, I know where to find everything in this red binder, this fire code book - but another thing to actually apply it,” she said.  While there were classes, the certification process required a lot of studying on her own too, she said. Kling was fire marshal for more than 25 years, and was generous with his time and knowledge.  “It’s a lot of ongoing training. It really was a lot of shadowing Chief Kling prior to this and learning it in the field,” she said.  Kling still answers her questions, even after retirement.  “He’s still on speed dial,” Talley said.  A fire marshal does investigate the origin of a fire, but there’s a lot more to it than that. The fire marshal is involved in the entire construction or remodeling process, especially commercial buildings.  “I do everything from plan reviews for all new construction that comes in, with fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, things like that - the planning version of it too, what we call pre-construction systems - all the way through the testing of all those systems,” she said.  The fire marshal inspects fire hydrants during construction. If there’s a fuel tank in the project, she tests that. She conducts fire and life safety inspections.  “If you have a new business that comes in, before they open their doors I’m supposed to go through and do my walkthrough,” she said.  Existing businesses also are subject to inspections, and Talley said she likes to work with business owners to change anything that might need changing.  “I come from the education background, and I like working with people to teach them,” she said. “It’s like, ‘You want the safest building for your customers and your employees. And I want the same thing.’  “I don’t want to be the scary person. Yes, I have to enforce code, that’s part of my job, but I’m also here to educate them,” she said.  Talley is still learning herself, she said, and has found that contractors and building owners usually are willing to answer her questions about their systems and work with her. She cited the data centers currently under construction in Quincy as an example.  “Those are the cream of the crop contractors, and they’re excited about telling you about their projects. And they’re gracious. They know that I’m new and they’re not trying to pull a fast one. They want you to know how their systems work.”  It’s a great job, though, she said.  “It’s never the same day twice, that’s what I love about my job,” she said.  The fire service attracted her because it allows her to help her community, she said, and that’s what’s still attractive about it.  “I really enjoy what I do. I really feel like I’m making a difference,” she said, “and that’s what brings a lot of joy to my job.”  Cheryl Schweizer may be reached at cschweizer@columbiabasinherald.com."

TEXAS CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Marathon Petroleum officials say they are still monitoring the air quality in the Texas City area after Monday's fire, in which we now know what was burning. According to Marathon Petroleum officials, hydrocarbon Naphtha is what was burning.  ""It's component that has a lot of waxes or paraffin's and benzene's or benzene that we know are carcinogens, so it's like a combination of what they're using to refine down and create several products,"" Tox Doc, Dr. Noreen Khan-Mayberry said.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says those smoke particles can be dangerous. But in a Facebook post on Monday, the Texas City Police Department announced a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community wasn't necessary. Normally, that decision comes from the Office of Emergency Management. They make the decision based on information they get from the company and also what they may see or experience when they have reps on site of the fire.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says this is reminiscent of the March 2019 ITC plant fire, in which our partners at the Texas Tribune uncovered high benzene levels lingered in the air for two weeks after public health measures and shelter-in-place warnings were lifted.  When it comes to Monday's Marathon plant fire, the experts we spoke to say if the company knew Naphtha was burning, a shelter-in-place should have been issued.  ""It's always easier to figure out after, even though, when they know which unit blows up or ignites, they know exactly what's in that unit and what's burning in those units. So they know that quickly. It's not like these are unlabeled and take them a long time to find out,"" Dr. Khan-Mayberry said. ""So, yes, I definitely think that precautions should've been put in place, in terms of 'Hey, there's a fire, there's been an explosion in the unit,' and there should be a shelter in place, at least for a few hours until you can get TCEQ out there and start doing some real air monitoring.""  Eyewitness News reached out to the Office of Emergency Management as well as the Texas City Police Department to see why a shelter-in-place wasn't issued, but we haven't heard back.

Neither resident was home at the time of the fire, he said.  A call reporting the fire came into Stephens County 911 Dispatch just before 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 14, Bennett told WNEG.  He said, “The call came into our dispatch about 5 minutes before 8 p.m., and Carnes Creek, New Hope and Eastanollee volunteer fire departments were paged out. Carnes Creek put the first truck on scene within seven minutes of the call coming in.”  When the initial crew arrived on scene, there was heavy fire and smoke throughout the house, with the heaviest flames concentrated in the right, rear corner of the home.  Bennett said the decision was made to send a crew into the structure for an interior attack on the fire. Fire crews were able suppress the fire with the majority of the damage occurring in the rear quarter of the building, and much of the front portion of the home and belongings were saved from fire damage. Smoke damage was more widespread, Bennett said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for approximately 35 to 40 minutes before the home was secured and the fire crews could begin clean-up operations.  Bennett said there was no clear indication of how the fire started, and explained that the homeowner’s insurance company will decide the cause of the fire following its investigation.  Sunday’s fire was the third fire in a fairly small section of the county, and Bennett said that this year has seen an unusually-high number of fires throughout the county.  Bennett said, “This year, Stephens County Fire Services, and the City of Toccoa, have seen an unheard of amount of structure fires. I talked with some other captains and lieutenants in other counties, and told them how many (fire calls) we run, and they were amazed. For some reason, this year we’ve had a lot more than normal.”  Bennett said that arson does not appear to play a role in the large number of fires this year, but carelessness and inattention is definitely a factor.  He said, “A lot of it is just carelessness, or unintentional type things. We typically don’t see a lot of arson around here.”  Bennett added that the fires are not limited to a certain demographic.  He said, “It’s not just the elderly, not just young people.”  Bennett strongly urges citizens to make sure there are working fire alarms throughout their home, and to make a habit of checking for potential fire hazards prior to leaving the home, even for a short period of time.  The number one tip to prevent fires is smoke alarms, Bennett said, urging citizens to check and test their fire alarms on a regular basis. He also urged residents to be observant and make an extra effort to look for fire hazards.  He said, “Don’t leave the house without making one last lap through the house to make sure nothing is left on like hair dryers, the stove, ovens, or curling irons. That extra 30 seconds can save your home, your belongings, your pets.”  Bennett said that even items that may not have open flames, or may not seem hot enough to start a fire, can be dangerous if left unattended.  He said, “That curling iron you leave on, if it is next to a can of hairspray or something, that kind of thing is where problems start.”"

No one was hurt.Fire Chief Laurent McDonald said crews responded to an alarm at 11:38 a.m. at 30 Old Charlton Road. Firefighters were there until 4 p.m.  McDonald said there was a partial building and stored lumber at the site, which used to be the home of Stone's Saw Mill.  In addition, the property owner has been using the area to place old items there including a filled 53-foot box trailer, tires and plastic water tanks, as well as old televisions and computers.  “We’ve been working with DEP with the property to clean up some of the stuff,” McDonald said. “One of the property owners were there earlier in the morning, still continuing his cleanup efforts to basically, clean up the property and dispose stuff. About an hour after he left is when the fire was discovered.”  Despite being nothing of major value destroyed at the site, it was in the best interest to contain it and put it out, rather than just let it burn, McDonald said. The footprint of the fire was 100-feet-by-100-feet, he said.  “You wouldn’t let it burn because you have plastics,” McDonald said. “Fortunately, the owner started cleaning up the old tires and moved a bunch of them. There were still some there but they weren’t in the area that (was) involved.”  McDonald said they do not have a cause for the fire but they don’t think it’s suspicious. The investigation is ongoing, he said.  “It appears for all intent and purposes it’s accidental in nature,” McDonald said. “Because there were TV items and glass and bottles and whatnot, there’s different speculations you can go on. It may have been sunlight amplified through glass. We can’t really put a finger on the cause but we believe it to be accidental. But, where it started, it did get some of the heavy timbers and grass on the fire which spread to the remnants of the building.”  Aug. 31, 1992, the sawmill was destroyed by fire. The fire was discovered fully involved at 11:10 p.m., shooting flames 20 to 30 feet into the air. It smoldered all night and broke out again the next morning. The pile of slab wood that burned would have been ground into landscaping woodchips and sawdust for farms, while a stack of 30 15-foot logs, which would have been cut into 2,000 linear feet of planking, also burned. Firefighters from Oxford, Charlton, Webster, Leicester and Sutton responded to the late-night blaze as Auburn firefighters waited at the Oxford firehouse.

At 1:53 p.m. fire companies were dispatched to MLK/Southard St for a fire in an abandoned commercial building. Once on site, a call for all hands on deck was made.  The fire would eventually reach five alarms, but there were no reported injuries from anyone within the building. A firefighter had to be transported to the hospital for vomiting, but nothing fire or injury related.  According to Trenton Fire Director Kenneth Douglas, five other city fire departments came to assist in extinguishing the flames.  “Pretty much went to defensive operations almost immediately due to the collapsing of the gym area,” Director Douglas said. “They tried to make an advance inside, but because of the heavy fire load, they were actually backed out and got out just before the collapse.”  Although the school has been closed since 2007, there were plans for the redevelopment of the property. Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora who arrived about 45 minutes after the first alarm, said a potential $50 million grant from HUD could turn the abandoned school into a spectacular senior housing residence.  “It’s an implementation grant that our housing authority is a finalist. No guarantees but if we make it, that would be one of the projects,” Gusciora explained.  Gusciora said any redevelopment had hoped to save many of the historic parts of the building, “especially all the wood floors,” Gusciora explained.  It is also reported that three additional small fires occurred at neighboring homes that were put out immediately by tenants or firefighters in the area.  The fire has since been deemed under control and a perimeter has been put around the building to keep people from entering.  Earlier this year, residents complained that students were entering the school and spending entire days inside. Police allegedly made attempts to prevent a constant flow of trespassers.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.  Previous Trentonian reporting contributed to this article."

Both children suffered burns over 70% of their bodies, said Destiny Davis, a granddaughter of homeowner Sharon Davis. Medical personnel at VCU Medical Center in Richmond continue to stabilize the kids, ages one and two.  “They’re going to be here for a couple of months,” Destiny Davis estimated. “They're going to have to learn to walk again.”  Her 72-year-old grandmother, who also was taken to VCU Medical Center for smoke inhalation, has been given a tube to help her breathe.  “She was able to squeeze my hand,” Destiny Davis said. “She’s going to be OK.”  All three, however, were still listed in critical condition at the hospital.  Sharon Davis and three of her great-grandchildren were in the home in the 1100 block of Covington Road when the fire broke out around 3:50 p.m. One of the children was able to get out, but fire officials said the other two were trapped upstairs and had to be rescued.  Sharon Davis had been helped by a neighbor and was standing in her yard when the authorities arrived.  Once everyone was out of the house, firefighters had the blaze under control in around 16 minutes. However, the damage inside was extensive.  “They lost everything,” Destinay Davis said, adding that a GoFundMe site was being established to help.

On Tuesday, well over a dozen firefighters set up their gear at the top of Doyt Perry football stadium in Bowling Green for rope rescue training.  “There are water towers, there are antennas, there are quarries, there are steep ravines, there are lots of different potentials that are out there not just mountain climbing and cliffs like people you are going to apply these skills,” said the instructor and retired Columbus firefighter Gary Hamilton.  Zach Bukszar went over the forty-foot wall for the first time, a chemist by day, Bukszar is a volunteer firefighter back home in Twinsburg, Ohio.  “Um, terrifying, but I mean I got to watch everybody put everything together and make sure all those safety protocols are in place so I know that there is no real danger, it’s just you know getting initially over that edge is the biggest hard part, then once you are kind of in there and you can feel that you are supported it gets a lot easier,” Bukszar said.

It is 19 years old. Would you put a Home Depot stove in a commercial building? The Viking stove at Station 2 cost the town $6,300.00 in 2001,” says Fierro. “MFD has never prioritized Viking stoves and Nautilus equipment over safety. The silly conversation about Viking stoves holds no merit; they are 20 years or older and have and continue to serve the town well.”  Regarding Nautilus Gym equipment, Fierro says it was acquired by a grant awarded in the 2001-2002 years that was written by Battalion Chief Durning.  “Most of our other equipment is donated by residents that are moving away, and they offer it to the Fire Department,” he says.  Fierro also states that the radios at Station 3 “do work and always work. If a repair is made or there is an issue, every Officer and Firefighter is issued a personal radio and a radio in the Engine; the backup plan has a backup plan. Our radios are not substandard; they still do the job, just not supportive, and challenging to get parts for they have timed out.”  Regarding the request for more firefighters, Fierro says hiring more firefighters is to replace retired members and keep everyone safe.  “To state we are not a serious department on what basis, I stand behind all our members and have a diverse team of Professional Firefighters that other departments admire; our training level is above and beyond,” he adds.  Fierro responded to comments made in the lawsuit about Fire House #3 conditions and also by resident Eileen Birmingham.  “Station 3 is not a “gulag,” I was stationed there for 11 years and enjoyed every minute of it. The people in the neighborhood I met and the flowers we planted all represent that we were happy and proud to be there. Hypothetically in my opinion, if you wanted to punish someone, you would move them to the busiest rig in town, Engine 1 or Truck 1, located at headquarters,” he said.  Fierro says the stove at Station 3 is approximately six years old.  “I remember it being delivered and installed, and it functions 100%. The Sunday gravy we cook on all three stoves tastes the same; i will verify that I’ve personally been at all three Firehouses over my career.”  Fierro writes that there are four paid studies stating that Station 3 is needed.  “Dismissing the studies because they do not fit one narrative is, at best, disappointing,” says Fierro. “Eileen [Birmingham] was given these studies and is quoted ‘I choose not to accept 20-year-old data,’ even though all reports say we are understaffed at 90 Firefighters.”  Fierro says no one has mentioned that the Firefighters 100% renovated Station 2 kitchen and two bathrooms and a Station 3 Bathroom, with the town only paying for material and firefighters doing all labor.  Fierro also writes that MFD staff is full of Montclair residents. He says that information about these buildings has become false and mentions “pop-in visits from the CFO to inspect the buildings, take photos, and interview members.”  “Traditionally, this request is made to the Chief’s office, and a guided tour is scheduled. We do not let people wander around restricted areas and living quarters with personal items left about. It would be irresponsible to our members. Yes, the building is public; however, some areas are not, similar to areas of Town Hall where the public is not allowed to enter at will or sit in on meetings and ask questions. I have had multiple members call and feel uncomfortable and are exploring formal complaints.”"

Crandell, 43, of 42 Stewart St., was found in his second floor apartment by responding fire crews. He had succumbed to the fire.  An autopsy was expected to be performed at Albany Medical Center on Tuesday to positively determine the cause of death, Amsterdam Fire Chief Anthony Agresta said.  Another 51-year-old male resident of the second floor apartment was able to exit the building on his own and alerted police at the scene that his roommate was still inside.  Four individuals living in the first floor apartment were able to leave the building on their own and have been displaced by the fire. Five dogs and two cats were killed.  Multiple callers reported the fire around 6:48 p.m. on Monday. The second floor porch was fully involved when Amsterdam fire crews and police arrived on the scene.  The fire spread through the second floor apartment and entered the attic area of the two-family home. The first floor apartment sustained water damage.  Agresta confirmed the surviving roommate received medical attention following the fire, but declined to provide further details regarding the man’s condition or his identity.  “Unfortunately, I’m not able to confirm his identity,” Agresta said.  The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Amsterdam Fire Department and state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  The fire is believed to have started in the area of the second floor porch. The cause of the fire does not appear to be suspicious.

A fast response by firefighters confined the fire to the exterior balcony.  Columbus firefighters were sent to the apartment complex at 9:43 p.m. Monday on a report of an apartment fire at 3586 Nicholas Lane after a fire was reported on a second story balcony, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  Firefighters arrived on the scene in less than five minutes of the dispatch and reported a working fire with flames showing. Columbus police, also on the scene, assisted firefighters by notifying neighboring apartment occupants of the fire and aiding in the evacuation of the building, Wilson said. With an evacuation underway and additional firefighters enroute to the scene, the first arriving engine company charged a hose line and advanced into the second floor apartment. As crews entered the apartment, they found the interior of the apartment was clear of fire. Crews pushed to the balcony where they found fire burning up a vinyl sided wall. Firefighters extinguished the flames within seconds of their arrival on the balcony, Wilson said.  Firefighters removed a section of the balcony ceiling and confirmed that that fire was confined to the exterior balcony and did not extend into the apartment’s attic space or apartment’s interior living space.  Fire department investigators learned from the tenant that a family member had been smoking a cigarette on the balcony earlier in the evening and discarded it in a cardboard box that was being used to collect cigarette butts, Wilson said. Investigators said that the cardboard box had completely burned away but a large amount of cigarette butts were located in that location. Investigators ruled the fire accidental as a result of improper cigarette disposal.  Captain Troy Todd, Columbus Fire Department fire investigator, said that the department sees fires similar to this incident each year. “We have seen a number of significant-damage fires occur in the city from improper cigarette disposal. This type of fire is easily preventable if proper disposal takes place,” he said.  Damage from the fire is estimated at approximately $5,000.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include the Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services. No injuries were reported at the scene.  The Columbus Fire Department recommends that all smoking material be disposed of in a noncombustible container. The container should also be periodically emptied to prevent a collection of material within the container. Materials may be doused with water to confirm that the smoking materials are completely extinguished."

The threat for brush fire development and growth is very high, owing to recent dry conditions, dry brush and dry air with warming temperatures.  Additionally, a gusty westerly wind to 30 mph for many and up to 40 mph on Cape Cod, becoming southwest late in the day, will contribute to fire spread and this can apply to both brush fires and building fires, as any type of fire thrives on wind to grow and spread. Though Tuesday morning clouds have been thinning for strengthening sun, wildfire smoke from distant fires in western Canada will thicken in our New England sky Tuesday, carried thousands of feet above our heads by the jet stream winds aloft, contributing to a colorful Tuesday evening sunset and Wednesday morning sunrise.  Though that smoke doesn’t directly make it to the ground, there’s just enough pollution in southern New England air for moderate air quality – noticed only by those with respiratory problems – and pollen continues to fill the air. A cold front dropping south from Canada will carry scattered showers from north to south Tuesday late evening and overnight, not arriving to southeastern New England until predawn Wednesday, dropping only hundredths of an inch of rain for communities that see them, and perhaps not surviving the trip at all for the southwest quarter of New England.  Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.  So, fire danger and pollen continues Wednesday, though a drop of about 20 degrees in daytime high temperature owing to the new, cooler air from Canada should mean the relative humidity of the air isn’t quite as dry. The busy, northerly breeze Wednesday will gust to 30 mph at times and will ensure high temperatures near 60 feel like the 50s even at the warmest time of day – a big drop from one day prior! As dry and fair weather continues, temperatures climb incrementally to the mid 60s, then around 70 degrees, respectively, on Thursday and Friday. A sluggish cold front will approach New England this weekend, though timing has been somewhat variable in the forecast. 24 hours ago, it looked like the front may arrive with scattered rain showers on Sunday. That timing has since sped up to later Saturday into early Sunday morning, so we clearly still have some work to do firming this up.  That said, whatever showers arrive shouldn’t stay more than about 12 to 15 hours, which means the entire weekend isn’t expected to be marred by them. We could use some meaningful rain, but our First Alert Team isn’t sold on just how much these showers will deliver, with current estimates from our exclusive NBC Forecast System having dropped to around half an inch due to the increasing forecast speed of the system.  For now, we continue to carry highs in the 60s and 70s next week in our exclusive 10-day forecast, just as long as a northeast wind off the cool ocean doesn’t set up, which we’ll be keeping an eye out for signals of."

The fire has since been determined arson by the Maine Forest Service, Farmington Fire Chief Timothy Hardy reported.  The Farmington Fire Department received the call around 6:30 p.m. on Monday evening, but it took time before they arrived at the scene due to the difficult location. Chief Hardy stated that the challenge was accessing the fire in order to put it out due to a lack of roads or trails in the area. It was impossible to get firetrucks directly to the fire, and Red Schoolhouse Road was blocked off for over two hours to allow firetrucks to reach as close to the scene as possible. Even so, the responding departments had to cut a trail through the trees to the fire.  There was also difficulty with water access. Firefighters used backpack pumps and hand tools to bring water to the remote site. ATVs with water tanks and pumps from the Farmington, Kingfield, and Jay Fire Departments were used to shuttle equipment and water back and forth.  Leaf litter and small trees were burned, although nothing large was reached by the fire, which was completely doused by around 9:30 p.m. when the responders left the site.  The Farmington Fire Department returned to the scene early Tuesday morning and saw that the fire was still out. The Maine Forest Service also returned on Tuesday to conduct investigations into the origins of the fire, which are still on-going. It has been officially determined that the fire was caused by arson.  Mutual aid partners from several surrounding towns were on the scene to assist Farmington, including the Jay Fire Department, Wilton Fire Department, Industry Volunteer Fire and Rescue, Temple Fire Department, New Sharon Fire Department and Kingfield Fire Department, as well as the Maine Forest Service. Mutual aid partners began to leave the scene between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m., as darkness began to set in."

At Tuesday’s meeting, the trustees continued discussion on a possible 4.2-mill levy.  “If we’re going to put a levy on the ballot, we’ve got to start taking action pretty rapidly,” said Trustee Richard Welling.  According to the Wood County Auditor’s Office, an additional 4.2-mill levy would raise $1.2 million and cost the owner of a $100,000 home $147 per year.  Fire Chief Barrett Dorner said that the current personnel situation in the township is dire. The community needs to decide the direction for the future, he said.  “We’re willing to provide whatever service the community is willing to pay for,” he said, adding that more community question-and-answer sessions will be held.  “It’s not a scare tactic,” Dorner added. “We just need to be honest with you about what we can do now.”  Request for fire and EMS service is up 70% in the last eight years, he said.  “If that keeps going, our 1,600 runs a year right now will be almost 3,000 runs in 2031,” Dorner said. “We are going to continue our rapid growth, and hopefully it stays consistent and we don’t see a big spike.”  He said he wants to be up front about the department’s current capabilities.  There are two people on staff, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  They rely heavily on backup from neighboring departments.  The department has four levies, which total 4.8 mills, for financial support. The 2022 operating budget was $1.5 million.  Total annual payroll is $795,000, Dorner said  The department relies on administrative staff to respond to calls, when needed. That pulls people away from other responsibilities, such as grant writing, Dorner said.  Volunteers still work for the department, but they are mainly available at night and weekends.  “Those are our slowest time periods. Our busiest is 8 a.m.-8 p.m.,” Dorner said. “They’re available when we need them the least. I wish that wasn’t the case.”  Finding paramedics, especially ones to work part time, is incredibly difficult, right now, he added.  “One of the inspiring things that I’ve heard through all this … if we had full-time (positions open) we would have a line out the door of our people who want to work in Lake Township,” Dorner said. “That’s not everywhere.”  Another levy — or an addition to the proposed levy — is also being discussed.  “I want to bring dispatch back,” said Trustee Lorie Davis on Tuesday.  The township last operated dispatch in 2015. When costs became too high, the township contracted with the Wood County Sheriff’s Office.  Since then, the service has continued to improve, Dorner said on Tuesday.  “We are really reshaping fire dispatch in Wood County,” he said. “They’ve done an outstanding job of working with us.  Dorner said dispatch would cost at least another $500,000 and he requested more time to review the request.  Fiscal Officer Buddy Ritson said that if the trustees want to bring back dispatch and need a levy for it, there should be two separate requests.  “The fire fund is not healthy at this time,” Ritson said.  Building something from scratch right now will be expensive and take time, Dorner said.  After the meeting, Ritson said the township is paying $10,051 per month to the sheriff’s office for dispatch.  Davis said she strongly believes Lake Township should have its own emergency dispatch.  “I feel that dispatch is an important thing here in our own township,” Davis said.  The township, Northwood and Rossford commissioned a study last year to look into combining fire and EMS operations.  According to the study, which was released earlier this year, Lake Township has 54 personnel, with some full-time positions and mostly paid-on-call workers.  After the meeting, Dorner said the idea of combining the three departments is not dead. It’s just going to take too much time to come to fruition and Lake needs action now, he said.  Also at the meeting, the trustees:  • Approved $35,000 to Bowers Asphalt and Paving, Inc., Walbridge, to repair roads.  • Authorized $4,295 to Kaylor Plumbing, Wiring and Heating Inc., Genoa, for electrical repairs to the shelter house and kitchen in Friendship Park.  • Voted to buy firefighting foam from Advanced Eco Systems Inc., Tallmadge, for $1,478.  • Approved paying $1,437 to Speck Sales Inc. for two rear tires for the 2107 New Holland road mower.  • Voted to authorize the purchase and installation of new chain guards on the HI-WAY machine for $1,291. Gledhill Machinery Co., Galion, will do the work.  • Hired Mark Halliday and William Cook as firefighters for $10.10 an hour.  • Accepted resignations from Dakota Crabtree, Hunter Hayes, Tyler Clark and Amy Perry, who are EMTs and firefighters.  • Appointed Zachary Jenkins to the zoning commission for a five-year term.  • Reappointed Donald Nichols and John Sigurdson to the zoning board of appeals for a five-year term.  • Heard April department reports. Zoning issued five permits and collected $900. Police made three arrests and issued 15 citations. Fire and EMS had 92 calls. There were seven burials and three cremations at the cemetery."

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fire, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:    Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).  Visitors may continue to see smoke from the roadways and the risk of smoke continues to remain the biggest concern. Travelers should use caution throughout the impacted area.  Copyright 2023 WGCU.

The fire did not result in any injuries.  Firefighters were called to the scene just after 10:30 p.m. when they began receiving ""multiple 911 calls reporting a structure fire,"" said Erin Henry, the city spokesperson.  At the scene, crews found 2½ story building with a ""heavy fire"" coming from the back of the building, Henry said.  It was reported to firefighters that several people still could have been inside, Henry said. A second alarm was struck to bring additional firefighters to the scene.  The home was searched and authorities were able to confirm ""all occupants were accounted for,"" Henry said.  ""Despite challenging conditions and access issues in the rear of the building, the fire was brought under control in under 45 minutes,"" she added. ""There were no injuries to civilians or firefighters.""  The total number of people displaced in the fire was about 13, Henry said.  The fire marshal's office was investigating the cause of the blaze.  Pedro Coelho, owner of Padaminas NY Bakery II, which is located next door at 58 Main St., said his bakery sustained water damage and the fire burned through the building's soffits, he said.  Part of the ceiling and the insulation fell in the dining area, he said. Coelho said he has been in that location for 10 years and this was the first incident of any kind.  Coelho said he was told that a passing driver spotted the fire and knocked on doors to alert residents. When everyone was outside, they wanted to thank the man, but he was no longer there, Coelho said.  Staff photographer H John Voorhees III contributed to this story."

Jasmine R. Miller was taken into custody last Thursday and charged with one count of arson — knowingly damaging by fire the dwelling of another without consent, a level-four felony, court records reviewed by Law&Crime show.  According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the Daily Journal, firefighters in Johnson County at about 2:09 a.m. on March 30, 2023, responded to a house fire at a residence located in the 200 block of Restin Road, approximately 120 miles south of Indianapolis. Detectives with the county sheriff’s office arrived about an hour after the fire started and began the search for Miller, who allegedly started the fire before taking her daughter and fleeing the scene on foot. The home reportedly belonged to her then-boyfriend, whose name was not included in the report.  Investigators said that Miller started the fire over an argument with her boyfriend that began on the evening of March 29 about her being at a casino, the Journal reported. During the argument, Miller reportedly sent a text to her boyfriend saying she was going to “drive his f—— truck through [his house].”  The boyfriend was afraid Miller might be serious and filed a report with the sheriff’s office. As a direct result of his report, deputies reportedly arrested Miller when she left the casino and charged her with operating a vehicle without a license.  Miller’s boyfriend picked her up from jail in the early morning hours of March 30 and the two reportedly continued to fight, with Miller blaming him for her arrest. Before they arrived back at the house, Miller reportedly declared that she would be packing her things and moving to her mother’s house.  Miller then proceeded to pack some of her belongings into garbage bags and began loading them into her boyfriend’s truck, per the Journal. While loading the truck, Miller’s boyfriend said he smelled smoke and when he went inside to investigate he saw that all of the clothing in his closet had been set aflame.  “He observed his clothes [that were] hanging from racks on the north wall were on fire,” the affidavit reportedly states.  According to the Journal, the boyfriend briefly confronted Miller before making sure the house was clear of kids and pets. While he was checking the house, Miller reportedly fled the area on foot with her young daughter in tow.  In an interview with detectives, Miller’s boyfriend reportedly said she kept butane torch lighters in the house which she used for smoking meth and likely used to light the fire. In a backyard a few houses away from the boyfriend’s home, investigators reportedly found a purse containing two butane torch lighters and casino player cards in Miller’s name.  An investigator with the White River Township Fire Department determined that the cause of the fire was “incendiary” and the source of ignition was “an open flame being introduced to clothing,” Indianapolis Fox affiliate WXIN reported.  Following her arrest, Miller was booked at the Johnson County Jail where she is currently being held on $100,000 cash-only bond, jail records show.  Have a tip we should know? [email protected]"

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.

Read this article on the new Outside+ app available now on iOS devices for members! Download the app.  On October 23, 2022, Jim Henterly sat on the passenger bench of a National Park Service AStar helicopter, peering out at the craggy expanse of North Cascades National Park. Next to him was a firefighter from the NOCA (North Cascades) wildland crew, and directly in front of them stood 6,102-foot Desolation Peak. It was an unorthodox move for the parks system to allow the helicopter into the backcountry, but a moderately active fire that had broken out late in the season near Ross Lake, less than 2 miles downhill from Desolation Peak, had closed the trails. On the summit, a cabin covered in silver tinfoil glimmered in the sun like a wrapped Christmas present in a sea of craggy peaks. The first dusting of snow that patched the ground and frosted the roof added to the impression.  It had been a month since Henterly, the resident fire lookout on Desolation, left for the season, unable to properly close the lookout cabin for the winter because of the ongoing wildfire activity. After his lookout season ended in September and he went home to Whatcom county, Henterly didn’t know if he’d return before the following June. But the Desolation Fire, as it became known, climbed halfway uphill toward the lookout cabin, threatening to burn it down. In an effort to preserve it, fire crews had wrapped the 14 ½ by 14 ½-foot wooden structure in a foil blanket. And now, with the threat of the fire passed, Jim returned to remove the foil, inspect the structure, and prepare it for the heavy snows of a North Cascades winter.  To his relief, Henterly, who has spent seven seasons scanning for smoke atop Desolation, found no damage to the lookout cabin or any of its equipment. The structure itself has stood atop Desolation for almost a century, but this latest fire isn’t the only thing that threatens its continued existence as the last staffed fire lookout in North Cascades National Park.  The Desolation Peak lookout armored against approaching flames. (Photo: Alex Depue)  The summer before, I spent some time with Henterly at Desolation, which is also one of the few remaining staffed lookouts in the entire state of Washington. After corresponding by email for months, I met him at the tail end of the season. After a rigorous 5-mile hike with nearly 5,000 feet of elevation gain, I made it to the ridgeline and got my first glimpse of the cabin. With the shutters propped up, the structure gave me the impression of a single-story pagoda, symbolism that added to my reverence of this place. A man with deeply kind eyes and the svelte body of a lifelong hiker in his sixties, Henterly was cleaning the cabin and readying it for winter when I arrived. A big storm was forecast to sweep into the region within days and the shutters of the mostly glass structure would need to be fastened.  The Desolation Peak fire lookout stands about a foot off the ground on cinder blocks, in the foreground of the twin-fanged peaks of Mt. Hozomeen. The box-like building is painted a light shade called “lookout gray,” and its shutters are raised during fire season to reveal windows on all sides. The interior of the small cabin is a calming green called “Irish meadows,” which, like the exterior color, the Forest Service used regularly for lookouts and the National Park Service maintains for historical continuity. Against the four walls are a lone cot, a desk with an ancient hand-crank coffee grinder, and a bookshelf. In the center of the room sits the Osborne Fire Finder, a device that resembles a high circular table with sights and a map, and can give ranges and bearings from any location within view. Its purpose is to pinpoint smoke and flames so that the operator can dispatch wildland firefighting crews to the blaze’s exact location.  Henterly trained for decades to earn his spot as a lookout at Desolation. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  As he went about stowing objects under the cabin, Henterly told me how he trained as a wildland firefighter and fire lookout for over 20 years to get this post. Some years standing watch as a lookout can be slow with very little fire activity, but these last few years have mirrored the amplified wildfire season that the rest of the West has experienced. Henterly told me about a fire a few years back that holds special significance to him, and he showed me how he used the Osborne Fire Finder to acquire the location by lining up the sights of two apertures that rotate around the map. That fire was classified a monitor-only situation because it was in the remote wilderness of the Arctic Creek drainage north of Mt. Prophet. On his small desk was the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio he used to call in the coordinates and updates to headquarters. Henterly’s job was to observe, document, and relay the life of the flame. Because he found it, the Fire Management Office designated it the Arctic Jim Fire.  Built in 1932, this lookout tower near the border of Washington and British Columbia has long stood as a symbol of firefighting in the West. A century atop a mountain has given this structure a character all its own, with remnants from previous tenants ranging from books and cups to maps and memorabilia. From the outside, it’s the only man-made object in sight, aside from an outhouse a few yards beyond. It’s not surprising that it has captured the imaginations of backpackers, writers, and historians for decades.  Jack Kerouac was the first to introduce me to fire lookouts through his novels Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels, both of which chronicled his experience as a fire lookout on Desolation in the summer of 1956. Notable nature writers Gary Snyder, Norman Maclean, Edward Abbey, and Phillip Connors have also written about the monk-like experience of living in a glass house on a mountaintop. These stories drew me to visit the historic Desolation Peak Lookout 13 years ago, and I’ve revisited the site a handful of times since, along with countless other lookouts across the region.  According to the Forest Fire Lookout Association (FFLA), fire lookouts proliferated between 1930 and 1950, when the Forest Service maintained more than 5,000 towers around the country, mostly concentrated in the forests of the western United States. During this era, Washington alone built 660 alpine lookouts. Since the 1950s, government agencies have torn down many of these lookouts due to disrepair or destruction in forest fires. A number of nonprofit preservation groups like the FFLA maintain some of the remaining structures for public enjoyment.  In a 2019 survey, the FFLA estimated that only around 300 lookout towers were still staffed in the United States, mostly by volunteers, and those small numbers continue to dwindle due to advances in technology. With the use of drones, satellites, aircraft, and even fixed camera systems, the role of fire lookout is quickly becoming obsolete. In Washington, only 93 lookout towers remain, and only a third of those ever host an actual person. Of these few, only a handful are paid, part-time positions within the National Park or National Forest services during any given fire season, which is usually between June and September. The heightened fire activity in the West has not led to higher staffing levels of fire lookouts. Not yet.  Henterly tells me a pivotal role of the lookout at Desolation is to relay radio messages from field crews to headquarters in the park. These radio dispatches, pertaining to ongoing wildfires, trail work, and even rescues, are too far away for headquarters to pick up. Jim constantly monitors every word that comes out of his handheld. It could be a firefighter Mayday, or a mishap that needs to be passed on. Every evening he relays his own report to HQ.  During the 2022 lookout season, Jim proved the importance of his work and the value of fire lookouts in general. During the height of the fire season, he monitored and reported on approximately 20 different wildfires, not only within North Cascades National Park, but also in the neighboring Pasayten Wilderness and in Canada. His dispatches provided critical information to fire crews and a low-cost alternative to the exorbitant financial costs of reconnaissance flights. Those flights are intermittent, and Jim’s constant attention, coupled with regular radio reports, provides vital information with little overhead. The work that Jim does, and the necessity of Desolation Lookout, is so vital that fire crews hiked to the peak last fall to wrap it in protective foil, so that its mission may continue in the future. With the growing fire seasons created by climate change, it seems that lookouts are more important than ever. Perhaps Jim and Desolation Lookout will inspire government agencies to invest, one more time, in the tried and true method of fighting fire by posting fire watchers to stand guard against our burning world.  (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  Meanwhile, the few remaining towers are garnering huge interest from outdoor enthusiasts, perhaps due to the fact that the role of the fire lookout is slowly fading into history. Backpackers can rent many of these structures overnight. Some are open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis and are often crammed full of campers during the height of summer. These communal barracks are especially sought-after for Pacific Northwest hikers, who ascend steep mountain terrain in droves for a chance to sleep protected amongst the high peaks. Regional blogs keep track of what lookouts are available to rent, which ones are free to stay in, and log the currently staffed locations, so visitors can hike to the cabins themselves and hear first-hand what it’s like to be a fire lookout.  The lives of lookout personnel require patience uncommon in our time, distilled with enduring focus. Every minute or so during my visit, Henterly returned his gaze to 360-degree scans of the surrounding landscape, stalling our conversation and creating stretches of silence that punctuated his stories. Much of the fire season has no sign of smoke, so his vigil can become endlessly repetitive. Luckily for Henterly, his view is inspiring. There are mountains on all sides, spreading out in ripples of ridgelines and glaciated peaks that comprise the northern expanse of the Cascade mountains.  It’s useful for lookouts to have personal interests to fill the quiet moments. For Henterly, drawing is a way to while away the daylight. With a pencil, he sketches finely detailed pictures that can fit into the palm of your hand. He’s drawn portraits of nature writers and mythical creatures, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s ents, which are enormous walking and talking trees. The sketches merge with his lookout tasks, as the contrast of light smoke on a dark landscape parallel the lead on white paper. Over the seasons, he’s turned his sketches into stickers that he’s posted around the cabin with quotes from his favorite authors.  On the doorpost, I noticed a sticker Henterly drew with John Muir’s quote, “One can make a day of any size.” It’s a fitting adage for a fire lookout. Because Henterly’s been lucky to staff this lookout for consecutive seasons, he’s grown familiar with this corner of the backcountry. He’s watched a black bear become a mother, guiding her cub through the blueberry bushes until it was finally big enough to venture out on its own. There are also two large ravens that perch on the rooftop of his cabin, and they too welcomed offspring to their avian family. Last year their chick went missing. Henterly recalled the peregrine falcon and Cooper’s hawk that preyed upon the ravens in previous seasons. He hoped the young raven went off on its own, like the young bear.  While the animals have become Henterly’s closest community, there are regular pilgrims, like me, that come to visit the lookout. After so much time alone, Henterly welcomes the opportunity to talk with other humans face-to-face. In these dwindling days of staffed lookouts, Henterly has become a storyteller, sharing the deep history of this place with people who have traveled from all over the world. He told me how Native Americans quarried stones for tools from this ridge for at least 9,000 years. In 1859, a Swiss topographer named Henry Custer explored the area with Native guides and created maps from their journeys. Early U.S. Forest rangers and firefighters, like Ed Pulaski, fought and sometimes gave their lives to protect the land. Trail crews, volunteering their time, maintain the trail and the lookout. Fire crews treasure it as an icon. A long line of lookouts has staffed this peak, including Jack Kerouac, with his vision of a coming generation of backpackers heading into the wilderness.  The lookout on a smoky evening. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  I noticed a quote by Barry Lopez on the cabin wall: “One of the great dreams of man must be to find some place between the extremes of nature and civilization where it is possible to live without regret.” That ignited a conversation with Henterly about the important work of environmental authors, Lopez and Gary Snyder, Thoreau and Emerson. Talking to Henterly, I felt blissfully lost. I had dreamt of this place for so long, and now I had experienced it personally, making it a small part of my own story. But I didn’t want to outstay my welcome, so I thanked Henterly for his hospitality and slowly began the trek to my campsite at the southern tip of Starvation Ridge. Henterly walked with me along the alpine meadow. We stopped to scan for the young black bear, and he invited me to return in the morning for a cup of black coffee and more talk of our shared interests.  Back at my camp, more than 15 miles in any direction from the nearest road, I watched the dark of the night unfurl like a blanket over Starvation Ridge as pinpricks of stars poked through the sky. My eyelids grew heavy. There on that primeval post, one of the last of the fire watchers stood guard against the elements. Though I couldn’t see the lookout from my campsite, I imagined the lone light of the tower burning like a lantern in a sea of darkened peaks. It’s been burning in my mind these past years, a beacon of inspiration that draws backpacking pilgrims like me to this vast wilderness. Its light will burn longer still: In June 2023, Jim Henterly will begin his eighth consecutive season as Desolation Peak’s fire lookout."

Michigan-based automaker Chrysler announced on Tuesday the voluntary safety recall of Jeep Cherokees, model years 2014 to 2016, that the automaker says are at-risk of catching fire, even when their engines are turned off.  The recall centers around the “power liftgate module” system, which is a motor system that opens and closes the rear hatch or cargo compartment of the vehicles.  Chrysler told federal regulators that water can seep into these liftgate module systems, potentially sparking a fire.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “An electrical short in the power liftgate module may lead to a vehicle fire with the ignition on or off,” Chrysler said in its formal recall notice filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Photo of where a ""power liftgate module"" is located in a Jeep Cherokee's rear hatch, according to an NHTSA filing by Chrysler in 2015.  The recall applies to at least 132,000 Jeep Cherokee models, the automaker told regulators, but some media reports have estimated more than 200,000 models could be at risk.  There is no repair or remedy at this time to fix the problem, so Chrysler is advising all owners of these vehicles to park them outside until further notice.  “Owners are advised to park outside and away from structures until the recall repair is complete,” the automaker told regulators. “The remedy is currently under development.”  Consumer advocates say the “park outside” part of the recall announcement could be especially hard for some Chicago owners, who rely on indoor parking garages.  “In some of the recent recalls where there’s a park outside warning, we’re seeing vehicles turned away from parking garages, even folks who have a monthly contract are told they can’t park in the garage until the recall repair has been performed,” said Michael Brooks, the Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety.  Brooks said owners need to take the recall notice seriously.  “NHTSA doesn’t issue a lot of ‘park outside’ warnings, so when they do, it’s important that owners heed that,” Brooks said.  In its formal filings with regulators, Chrysler said it began investigating concerns over “cargo compartment fires” in these vehicles in 2022, but customer reports to the company about the problem date back to 2017.  The filings indicate Chrysler may have received dozens of reports of fires taking place, but as of April 27, the automaker said it is “not aware of any accidents or injuries potentially related to this issue.”  A 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Jeep Cherokee owners may feel a sense of deja vu over the liftgate problem.  Back in October 2015, Chrysler announced a safety recall regarding the same liftgate fire issue in 2014 and 2015 models of the Jeep Cherokee, according to prior NHTSA filings reviewed by NBC 5 Responds.  At that time, Chrysler said it would install water shields to prevent moisture from corroding the liftgate module, in order to prevent the risk of fire.  But now, Chrysler said “Vehicles repaired under the prior recalls will still need to have the new remedy performed,” once it’s developed.  “This exact same defect is still occurring,” Brooks said. “And it looks like between the time that first fix was implemented to today, there have been between 50-100 fires, it’s a little unclear from their filings. That’s a large number of vehicle fires.”  No timeline was shared by Chrysler for when a new remedy to the problem will be developed.  For more information, Jeep Cherokee owners can call Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) at 1-800-853-1403, or contact the NHTSA Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or visit www.nhtsa.gov.

For instance, the words “all fired up!” usually connotes positive feelings whereas the phrase “you’re fired!” can mean that you have been involuntarily deselected from the workforce.  Fire can destroy or renew. A little of both took place at our farm recently.  A year ago last May an unpredicted and unpredictable derecho struck our region. Our farmstead, like many others, lost dozens of trees. The number of trees in our shelterbelt that were busted off or uprooted could officially be classified as “more than you can shake a stick at.”  Like many homeowners in our region, I quickly formed a close personal relationship with my chainsaw. We are eternally grateful for all the help we received from neighbors and friends who pitched in with the cleanup. The downed trees were pitched into a brush pile that grew to approximately the same size and tonnage as a house.  Last week I decided that it was time to burn the brush pile. It seemed fitting that it was almost a year to the day after the derecho.  One cannot simply conduct a major burn on a whim nowadays. One must alert the authorities so that they can be prepared in case things get out of hand. Another factor is that people who live hereabouts become nervous whenever they see a large plume of smoke rising into the sky. Such a thing is likely to be reported to the authorities, causing enormous amounts of undue consternation and perhaps a visit from your local fire department.  I watched the weather forecast closely and chose a day that promised light winds. Early on the morning of the burn I strolled down to the brush pile accompanied by our faithful farm dog, Bella.  “Don’t play with fire!” is an admonishment that’s often issued to little boys. This only serves to make fire seem all the more fascinating to the boy. Our family incinerated our household refuse when I was a kid and I frequently volunteered to tend the burn barrel. I thus acquired a deep respect for the way fire can behave. Liquid accelerants cost me more than one set of eyebrows.  A few well-placed wadded-up newspapers were all that was needed to ignite the brush pile. Within seconds the fire had leaped from twig to branch, roaring greedily as it gobbled the desiccated wood.  The heat quickly became surprisingly intense. Even at 50 feet away, Bella and I were beginning to feel quite toasty. We probably could have roasted weenies right where we stood.  Bella sat at my feet and peered up at me with an anxious expression that seemed to say, “Dad? Don’t you see what’s happening? Are you sure that everything is OK?”  I assured her that things were going exactly as planned. “But maybe we should back up a few yards,” I told her. “If we stand this close much longer, we’ll both soon be hot dogs.”  It was one of those rare mornings here on the prairie when the wind was virtually nonexistent. This happens about as often as a visit from Halley’s Comet.  Some of the trees in the brush pile were absolutely huge. One of them had a trunk that appeared to be the same diameter as a rear tractor tire. There could be no doubt that this tree was more than 100 years old. This meant there could also be no doubt that it had been planted by my great-grandfather Charlie Sveen, who homesteaded our farm.  Glancing at the garden hose at my feet, I thought about how Charlie had probably carried buckets of water to that tree to nurse it through long, hot summers. The tree had returned the favor by providing shelter from our relentless winds for multiple generations of my family.  And now it was going back to the atmosphere from whence it came via the rapacious flames of an ignoble brush pile fire.  Like a passionate new romance, a brush pile fire throws off tremendous amounts of heat and drama at the start. And like a romance, things eventually settle down to a slow smolder. That is when the real work begins.  I used a long-handled shovel to push wayward deadwood onto the glowing heap of coals as a fickle breeze pushed the lazy smoke in random directions. By the end of the day, I had absorbed more smoke than a side of bacon.  “Phew!” exclaimed my wife when I walked into the house, “You smell like you’re on fire!”  It’s gratifying to know that the spark is still there after more than 40 years.  — Jerry’s book, Dear County Agent Guy, is available at http://Workman.com and in bookstores nationwide"

Ohio has eight cities on highest home fire risk index.  Canton and Akron have made Hartford insurance company's index of ""top 150 U.S. cities with highest home fire risk.""  The insurer ranked Canton as No. 41 and Akron as No. 40 on its list.  The city it considered with the highest home fire risk was Modesto, California. Ohio had six other cities among the 150. Cincinnati was ranked No. 8 in the index. Youngstown was No. 16. Columbus was No. 39. Cleveland was No. 98, Dayton No. 113 and Toledo No. 122.  The Hartford said it each of the cities on its list of 150 will get $10,000 each to fund fire safety education for children.  More:Deadly rash of house fires in Ohio: 'We know that so many of these fires are preventable.'  Jeff Welch, an assistant director of media and public relations for the Hartford, says the company releases its index of 150 cities with the highest home fire risk once every three years as part of its Junior Fire Marshal Program to educate kids about fire risks. The first was in 2017 and the second in 2020.  Welch said the index covers all residential structures, including single-family homes, duplexes and multi-family units like apartment complexes. It doesn't include vehicle fires or fires at businesses.  Data crunched over three years  In the 2017 index, Welch said, Akron ranked 54th and Canton was not on the list. In the 2020 index, Canton was No. 72 and Akron was No. 33.  Messages seeking comment were left with the Canton and Akron fire departments.  Welch stressed that the index only indicates home fire risk for a particular city in relation to the others on the index.  “The ranking itself is all relative. You could be a safe city but (the) 109 cities below you are a little safer (in terms of home fire risk). It’s not saying (a city on the list) is a dangerous city. I wouldn't frame it that way and that's not how we frame it.”  Welch said, “It’s not an indication of anything to do with the fire department or response times ... or training."" He said the purpose of the index was to generate interest and support for fire safety education and to help educate people on what to do in the event of a fire.  Welch said the Hartford's data analysts come up with the rankings looking at the number of home fires in zip codes for a particular city per a certain number of people who live there according to Census data. They then contract with a polling firm to reach people around the country online and poll them on their behavior that may increase or reduce the risk of a fire. Welch said at least 100 people in each of the 150 cities on the list were surveyed.  Questions on the survey asked people if they engaged in behaviors that raised the risk of fires or mitigated the risk or impact of fires. Had they left something cooking on the stove for too long? Did they have a working fire extinguisher? Did they regularly replace the batteries of their smoke detectors? Did members of the household have an emergency escape plan?  Welch said the goal of the program was to identity the cities where children best need fire education that the Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program could target with the $10,000 grants.  ""We’re trying to identify where the fire safety gaps are through this index,"" he said, adding that the Junior Fire Marshal program has educated 112 million children the past 76 years. ”Really the goal is to educate these kids so they become fire safe adults.""

The house at 556 Northwest Drive off DuPont Road caught fire Saturday evening and was so badly damaged firefighters were unable to enter it to completely extinguish the blaze.  Smoke was seen at the site Sunday and Monday as well.  The cause of the fire is undetermined due to the extent of the damage but it remains under investigation, said Jason Baltic, deputy state fire marshal and chief investigator for the Fire Marshal’s office.  Washington Bottom Volunteer Fire Chief Garry Freed said Monday the fire appeared suspicious because there were no utilities on at the house.  It’s one of two structures owned by the DNR at the site, after it was transferred to the state by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the late ’60s or early ’70s.  Westfall said the DNR used to allow people to stay there in exchange for maintaining the property but it has moved away from that model. Both buildings were dilapidated before Saturday’s fire, he said.  “The agency has wanted to demolish the buildings for quite some time,” Westfall said.  The sticking point has been the demolition of the larger lockhouse along the river as well.  “It’s likely to be expensive,” he said.  Evan Bevins can be reached at ebevins@newsandsentinel.com."

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes."

In some ways, all that rain will create more work for residents to protect their homes from fire danger later this year.  ""The main thing, my understanding with fire, is the embers, it's not necessarily the flames,"" said Jake Lehrer, a Santa Rosa resident who designed his home to be hardened against fire risk almost 20 years ago. ""If nobody is here, overtime...it will start to grow and burn the house down.""  Lehrer knew he was living in a fire-prone area, so he asked the city for help adding features around his property, including a stucco house and a special deck. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, he added more layers of protection including new vents at the base of the house and a metal roof.  ""It's all protecting the house from embers flying,"" he explained.  The metal roof can block embers from getting under that surface. The home also has a non-venting attic. His deck is sealed in a way to keep embers from spreading so close to his house. While those long-term amenities to his home help, he still clears his property each year, not just trimming grass and weeds but removing dead trees.  The wet start to 2023 does not give him any comfort about the steps he will need to take this spring.  ""I would say the main thing is to keep fuel away from your house -- at 30 feet, 50 feet, any fuel,"" Lehrer said.  Santa Rosa Fire Department Fire Inspector Will Powers says residents need grass and weeds on their property knocked down under four inches ahead of fire season.  ""The first thing we're looking at is what's closest to the home,"" he told KPIX while visiting Lehrer's home. ""We're looking at the roof line. This resident here has trimmed this stuff away from the roof line. That is very crucial in creating that defensible safe.""  Late-season rain and the large amount of rainfall the region received will contribute to vegetation growth. Clearing fuels and cutting grass to create defensible space will require that vegetation get cut at least twice this year, compared to when drought conditions allow for the grass to only be cut once.  ""This is the time when we want residents thinking about the plans they need to make for what could potentially be a long, long summer,"" said Santa Rosa Fire Division Chief Fire Marshall Paul Lowenthal. ""Our community has been through some pretty significant events and are taking things a lot more seriously and it's preventing damage here locally.""  Lowenthal said they will likely declare the start of fire season in the beginning of June. Warmer weather happening this week will factor into that decision. Inspections of properties will begin the first and second week of June.  ""We definitely were caught off guard in 2017. In 2020, we saw the effects of what measures like the resident here has taken,"" Lowenthal told KPIX. ""It's great to see efforts like this. We still see a lot of homes that still need work done. But for every resident that does work like this, it's one less home that could potentially be damaged or destroyed.""  In 2020, there were 1,152 properties impacted by fire in Santa Rosa, but only 30 were destroyed, according to Lowenthal. He says that better prepared residents helped make the difference that fire season. That's why he wants to encourage the public to take important steps now to help them through the summer and fall.  Leaders at Con Fire add that they anticipate a more dangerous fire season will return sooner rather than later after a relative break in recent years. The abundance of vegetation and all the rain during the winter is part of why they are preparing for the worst.  The agency says there will likely be a greater crop of fuel this year and it will eventually dry out, that could lead to a busy and potentially dangerous fire season.  ""To me, the rain allows us to have drinking water. It doesn't help with fire,"" Lehrer said.  More information about wildfire preparedness is available on the Santa Rosa Fire Department website."

Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Crews battled a large fire in a five-story apartment building in downtown Portland on Tuesday.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  According to Portland Fire & Rescue, the fire started at about 10:30 a.m. at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city.  Smoke from an apartment fire in downtown Portland, Ore., May 16, 2023, is seen from the Wells Fargo Center in this provided photo. Courtesy of Arnold Benson  Several people were rescued from the building, and shortly afterward crews were ordered to withdraw from the building due to the fire’s growth.  Barbett Grace sat on the pavement and watched the building burn Tuesday. She lived on the third floor and said she didn’t notice the fire alarm at first because they’ve had several false alarms. Then she heard the fire trucks outside.  “So, I opened the door and it was dark and full of smoke,” Grace said. “I just went to the window and climbed out.”  Grace, 67, has arthritis, but she managed to get down the three stories using the building’s fire escape. She had been scheduled to move this week because her doctor worried she wouldn’t be able to use the fire escape. Now, she’s moving six blocks away, but will turn up empty-handed because all her possessions were destroyed in the fire.  Barbett Grace, 67, pictured here on May 16, 2023, lived on the third floor of The May apartments. She said she managed to escape the building using a fire escape after the apartments erupted in flames. Fire officials closed streets around the roughly 113-year-old building out of fear it may collapse from the fire. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  ”It’s mostly just stuff. The paperwork, my veterans paperwork, my drivers license, Social Security card — all of those are going to have to be replaced. And that’s going to be the biggest thing,” she said.  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said many people and animals had to scramble from the building as the fire quickly spread.  “Upon arrival some of the first arriving crews were actually just aggressively running the hallways, slamming doors saying, ‘This is not a false alarm. Get out, get out, get out!’” he said.  Two firefighters suffered minor medical issues, but no other injuries were reported.  Graves added that emergency vehicles moved away from the roughly 113-year-old building in case of a structural collapse. The streets around the building were also closed.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Most of Interstate 405 closed starting around noon Tuesday as smoke from the fire limited visibility on the freeway. The closure resulted in significantly snarled traffic throughout the city in the afternoon, even after the highway reopened.  Portland General Electric also cut power to the area as a precaution.  Firefighters monitored the building overnight into Wednesday morning. Portland’s city engineer will evaluate its stability on Wednesday.  Known issues  The May apartment building was constructed in 1910, according to property records.  Graves called it a “non-sprinkled building” that did have “sprinkled exits.” He said firefighters did not know if the sprinklers worked or whether they went off. An agreement from Aug. 8, 1974, notes The May had some sprinklers along the corridors, stairs and the basement, according to Ken Ray, a spokesperson with the city’s Bureau of Development Services. It also had hardwired smoke detectors, alarms and fire extinguishers, according to that same 1974 agreement.  The fire remains under investigation, though Graves said it appears it began on the third floor.  Records show the building had some documented issues in recent months. On Dec. 1, 2022, the city received a complaint stating the building had “severe leaks, mold, mildew” that there was “exposed electrical wiring” and that there were “no smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detectors.”  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  On Dec. 15, a Bureau of Development inspector went to the building and documented 10 violations that were sent in a letter to SkyNat Limited Partnership, the property’s owner. The violations included repairing emergency lighting on several floors, replacing an expired fire extinguisher, and addressing electrical extension cords in the lobby “daisy chained with other power strips or extension cords” that created a potential safety or fire hazard.  The city gave SkyNat two months to correct the violations.  ”Due to limited staffing, the Bureau of Development Services does not have the resources to re-inspect most buildings on the deadlines set in violation letters,” Ray said in a statement. “It is the property owner’s responsibility to fix the concerns and notify BDS for a re-inspection. That did not happen, and fines began accruing for the uncorrected violations.”  SkyNat paid fines in February and March and, as of April 27, still owes the city $1,723.  The Bureau of Development Services inquired last month about the 10 documented violations, and SkyNat told the city it was still fixing the violations. City inspectors returned to the property Monday and found most, but not all of the violations had been fixed.  According to its website, SkyNat is a family business with more than 500 residential units in Portland, Gresham, Vancouver and Tigard. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  When reached by OPB, a maintenance contractor for the company referred a request for comment to company officials."

In “The Escape Plan,” users must work through various obstacles to make a timely escape from an apartment building fire. The free virtual reality experience lets users practice their fire escape skills on their own time and in a safe, controlled environment and can be used with virtual reality equipment. At the end of the experience, users can create their own fire escape plan and visit Ready.gov and Listo.gov in Spanish language to further prepare for home fires and other hazards.  While virtual reality equipment is recommended, but not required, a desktop version of “ The Escape Plan ” allows users to participate in the experience and practice fire safety anywhere there is internet connectivity.  “From our user-friendly FEMA App that provides real-time weather alerts and helps people prepare for common hazards, to the use of geospatial tools to identify the hardest hit communities following a disaster, FEMA continues to use every tool at our disposal to help people before, during and after disaster,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “We are excited to partner with Meta and the Ad Council on this new virtual reality tool and we are eager to further leverage technology to protect people and save lives.”  “You don’t have much time to act in the event of a fire,” said Michelle Hillman, Ad Council Chief Campaign Development Officer. “Being able to practice a fire safety and evacuation plan before the emergency arises will reduce the chance of panic and ultimately save lives.”  “At Meta we are building for the next generation of the internet, which is why our partnership with FEMA and the Ad Council to develop immersive experiences in Virtual and Augmented Reality like the Escape Plan is so important,” said Caitlin Ryan, VP Creative Shop EMEA – Meta. “In VR, mistakes can be made without real-world consequences, ensuring individuals can safely learn and are better prepared, ready to act quickly in a real emergency. The VR version of this product creates the sensation of being present in a virtual three-dimensional environment, allowing you to experience and learn what you need to do to escape a home fire. While the Escape Plan is a virtual experience, the impact will be real.”  Virtual reality is emerging as an effective way to augment professional and personal emergency training and can have advantages over large-scale training programs that take extensive time and resources. Experiences can be developed to simulate an environment, whether the setting be in an office, emergency room or in your own home, rather than placing the trainee in the potential path of harm.  “Proven technology like automatic fire sprinklers, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors save the lives of civilians every day, and the U.S. Fire Administration has long advocated for the use of immersive learning tools to protect our nation’s fire fighters and increase public safety education,” said U.S. Administrator Moore-Merrell. “It is our hope that ‘The Escape Plan’ and other technological advancements will protect even more people and help us to further address America’s persistent fire problem.”  “The Escape Plan” joins a suite of digital tools leveraged by FEMA to help people before, during and after disasters. Last year, the Ready Campaign launched an easy-to-use digital form to help individuals and families create an emergency plan on their phone or laptop. The form can be saved onto any device and emailed to other members of their family and is available in both English and Spanish languages. And just last year, FEMA updated its mobile app to give users increased personalization options and help them take charge of disasters. The new app is more accessible, with increased functionality and innovative features to help people prepare for, protect against and recover from disasters."

Announced during Bald Eagle Township’s supervisor meeting Monday, the fire company will temporarily stop responding to lift assists.  According to Mill Hall Fire Chief Tony Walker, the company voted to discontinue them for the time being during their May’s meeting. He added the issue is due to a lack of help as well as other issues he would not publicly address.  The fire company previously discontinued lift assists about six years ago. At that time they stopped due to lack of training and issues of liability, according to Walker.  “That was a big issue and that is part of this other one — why we quit doing them. I did leave that up to the company, so they voted,” he said.  Lift assists are involved when an individual is assisted up to a mobile position from the ground by emergency service officials. They are not treated or brought to a hospital for medical attention. An ambulance is dispatched for emergency specific incidents.  Since lift assists fall under a non-emergency, it falls back onto fire companies, according to Flemington Goodwill Hose Ambulance Chief Kim Shainline, who was in attendance during the meeting.  “If there is any form of question on if it is a medical issue, then an ambulance is dispatched,” she said.  Other municipalities have either stopped doing assists or have partnered with local ambulance stations, according to Walker. They signed up to be quick response services (QRS).  Firefighters are meant to be well rounded for such incidents, according to Walker. There are currently only two medically trained EMTs at Mill Hall Fire Company, he added.  Shainline was in attendance with other members of Goodwill Ambulance in order to set up Goodwill Hose as the next responding department. Currently, after the Mill Hall Fire Company, Goodwill EMS is the next to call for lift assists through dispatchers.  Goodwill Hose Fire Chief Gary Mellot is offering to take up the assists with Mill Hall being unable to, according to Shainline.  “Gary said they (Goodwill Hose) would still be interested in helping fulfill that need because now it is an unmet need for your community. Which could mean that person ends up sitting on the floor for a half hour to an hour or longer, and now it does become a medical emergency. What if there is no ambulance available for that patient?” she said.  More of a burden is being placed onto ambulance services who are taking care of emergencies with injured people, according to Shainline. Ambulances from Williamsport or State College are forced to pick up lift assists when Clinton County services are busy.  “That doesn’t make any sense to me, especially when there are firefighters around who are still doing the lift assists,” Shainline said.  The caller is indicated if they are in an emergency with a dispatcher. The dispatcher then has a list of questions signifying if it is an emergency or not. A patient is billed after three lift assists, according to Shainline. The first two have no charge.  With the lack of manpower for lifting assisting, Walker said the fire company partnered with Goodwill Hose as they were doing nine-tenths of the lift assists.  “They were doing most of them for us because we didn’t have anyone,” Walker said.  Supervisors had an issue of what is considered an emergency, since they have a year-long contract with Mill Hall Fire Company. Supervisor Stephen Tasselli said that Mill Hall is in a contract with them and should stick by it until it expires in December.  “A contract is a contract. I don’t want to hold a gun to your head because of one thing but it is what it is,” he said.  Bald Eagle Township tries to give every emergency service department in the area a stipend, according to Chairman Tuff Rine. Mill Hall Fire Company gets a major share due to the number of calls they receive in Bald Eagle Township.  “I can’t really tell you Bald Eagle Township can do anything other than ask that our communications center follows the call procedure that has been set up — somebody is calling to get lifted versus somebody who has fallen and broken their head open — I think it becomes a question of the communications center on who they should call,” Rine said. “If Mill Hall has decided that they are not going to do lift assists anymore, then I would think the communications center should flip to the other page and have Goodwill take care of it.”  The Mill Hall Fire Company has been dealing with issues regarding lift assists for almost a year and a half.  “Because of some issues that some monkey dug up which caused a lot of chaos within all the emergency services here in the county. That is why a lot of them quit doing them (lift assists),” Walker explained.  He added the fire departments and supervisors should meet and “hash something out.”  Tasselli urged that they are trying to support everybody with the issue. He added he hopes they can work together to come to a resolution.  “We are kind of in a catch 22 listening to everybody and trying to help out and communicate with you all to keep this service,” he said. “We also tried on a couple of occasions with services to try to go to Lock Haven… to get a back door for you guys besides Flemington and we were told ‘hey we can’t do that, you’re not allowed to do that’ from the city manager. We are kind of in the same boat you are but I think you guys are doing a good job communicating with what’s happening right now.”  Shainline asked for the supervisors’ approval for Goodwill Hose to be the next due for lift assists.  Colten Mellott, the deputy fire chief for Goodwill Hose, was also in attendance during the meeting Monday, representing the fire company. He explained how their officers have the minimum training requirements for lift assists. There are about three EMT trained members of the company, so far.  “We are here to help the community whether it’s Flemington Borough, Bald Eagle Township, Mill Hall, Lock Haven. We ran 81 calls this year and so far, we have not dropped a single one. Our department’s ever expanding, we run an engine tanker, a traffic unit… and we have a rescue. We put medical equipment on board and we are working to get into QRS certification. All of our line officers, whether it’s from the fire chief down to the sergeant, all of them we require a minimum, you have to have first aid/CPR and most of our guys that are going are officers, so they have the minimum training requirements,” he explained.  They will ask the patient if they are hurt, and if they are, Goodwill Hose will contact an ambulance service for assessment. Mellott offered supervisors their service whenever they needed.  In other business:  There has been no progress with the Cottage Lane water line project.  At April’s supervisors meeting, Steve Gibson, the director of planning/county engineer attended to discuss the project. During that meeting, it was discussed that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will pay for engineering of the water lines once there is a project sponsor. A sponsor must be the entity that applies for the necessary loans. They will take on all financial responsibility if grant funding is not received. It is an issue that supervisors fear to take on currently.  As of Monday’s meeting, there is nothing new from Gibson or Suburban Water, according to supervisors.  “I thought Steve Gibson was supposed to get back to us with more details and present some options,” Tasselli said.  The only cost for the township would be legal fees according to supervisor Kenny McGhee’s summation of what Gibson stated.  “I am in favor of signing the application to get it started,” McGhee said. “The engineering is going to be paid for by DEP. They’re supplying it, and might as well use it.”  The project will not go anywhere until the application has a sponsor. Supervisors plan to contact Gibson about the application signage and making progress with Cottage Lane."

The Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR) is reminding the public to exercise caution and follow all state laws and local ordinances regarding open burning. The National Weather Service has issued Special Weather Statements for elevated fire weather and additional Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings are anticipated.  Open burning requires a permit from your town forest fire warden, and Vermonters should always check with their town forest fire warden before burning. When conditions are dry, town fire wardens can institute a burn ban in their respective town.  Find your town forest fire warden.  Most areas in Vermont have been 1” below normal rainfall for the last two weeks, with the last measurable rain on May 3. The weather forecast over the next few weeks does not indicate any signs of relief, with little to no precipitation forecasted.  The dry conditions call for extra attention when open burning—particularly with campfires—to reduce the risk of wildland fires.  FPR issues a daily Fire Danger Forecast for Vermont. Today’s forecast is high or very high. Get the most recent update:  Increased awareness can go a long way to limit the occurrence of wildland fires. Please help prevent wildfires by following these simple guidelines:  Be aware of the current weather conditions before igniting a fire.  Understand open burning laws.  Obtain a permit from your Town Forest Fire Warden.  Never leave an open fire unattended.  Never build a campfire on top of duff.  Use a camp stove to prevent escaped fires.  Extinguish fires completely before leaving. This can be done by dousing the fire in water, including all embers. Use a live, green branch to mix and stir the embers. If water is not available, use soil or sand to mix into the embers to cool them down. Continue to mix water and soil with the embers until the material is cool. Before leaving, use the back of your hand to check for heat in the campfire.    Find more Wildland Fire information from FPR online.  Source: May 15, 2023.

The St. George Fire Department responded to the report of a fire Monday afternoon that had ignited the rotting inside of an old mulberry tree. The old tree is located in the backyard of a home at 333 N. Main Street and was quickly attacked and extinguished by firefighters.  The inside of the mulberry tree appeared to have been smoldering for a few days until part of the fire broke out and neighbors began to smell smoke, St. George Fire Chief Robert Stoker told St. George News.  “It looks like it’s been burning for a while,” he said, adding that he suspects a lightning strike as the cause of the smolderin"

(WCIA) – What started as a final hurrah for newly graduated U of I students could follow some of them to court.  “There was one couch put in the middle of the street. Then all of a sudden there [were] 20 couches and it was kind-of the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” U of I senior Jared Kurland said.  Then, that pile of furniture was set on fire as hundreds of people watched. Students say the crowd started gathering just before midnight. By 12:15, the fire ignited at the intersection of S Oak and E Chalmers Streets in Champaign. By 1 a.m. Monday, multiple citations for open alcohol violations were issued.  “I mean, I probably inhaled half a couch just being in the vicinity because everything was going up in the air,” U of I senior Spencer Gallagher said.  That’s a sentence you don’t hear every day.  “Someone wanted to start a fire and that’s exactly what happened,” Kurland said.  300 people crowded around a residential intersection – some with alcohol, old furniture and lighter fluid in hand.  “It was terrifying. We were all texting each other being like, ‘does everybody have renters’ insurance?'” U of I senior Regan Sauer said.  That’s because it happened just a few feet from Sauer’s front lawn, in a pocket of Campustown known as “Seniorland.”  “We’ve had people over before but it’s never been this severe,” Sauer said. “We’re kind-of upset that this happened.”  And no one really knows why, except that it may have been part of a farewell tradition among new graduates.  “It’s kind-of the last thing all the seniors do. Then after this we all walked to the quad, have a good time there, and say our goodbyes to each other,” U of I senior Sahil Yemul said.  “There was a similar instance of this last year, though maybe not quite as large,” University of Illinois Police Department Communications Director Patrick Wade said in a statement.  “It wasn’t a good thing. I mean, it was cool to watch at least,” Gallagher said.  UIPD says the gathering is currently under investigation and could bring serious legal consequences. So far, six students have been given notices to appear in court.  “Luckily I didn’t get one but I was here when they were passing them out,” Kurland said.  Plus, they’re all feeling lucky no one was hurt. Students said it was a way to spend their last moments in Champaign together…  “It was probably not the safest thing to do but you can’t really do this anywhere else so everyone was just having a good time,” Yemul said.  …And simply, to dispose of items they don’t need anymore.  “There are all these old couches that people have and they want to get rid of them somehow. So they just brought them out there and set them on fire,” Kurland said.  It was eventually extinguished by the fire department, and Champaign Public Works crews cleared the road of debris. But that didn’t stop the house on that corner from receiving a notice for excessive trash, and partial responsibility for a mess created largely by strangers.  “That’s why we’re out here now trying to pick it up because we obviously don’t want to get in trouble with the city. We’re not troublemaker girls we just want to be on everybody’s good side,” Sauer said.  UIPD declined an interview because the investigation is ongoing. You can read their full statement below."

(WANE) — What started as a car fire spread in a storage facility south of downtown Fort Wayne on Monday, and the Fort Wayne Fire Department (FWFD) is investigating.  Crews were spotted just before 2:30 p.m. in the area of 2206 Broadway at BTE Storage. The video above shared by WANE 15 viewer Chad Schlatter shows smoke coming from the building.  According to the FWFD, a vehicle was on fire in one of the storage units, which then spread through the attic to seven other storage units.  The FWFD said the first firefighters to arrive at the scene saw black smoke coming from a structure. It took more than 30 minutes to contain the flames, according to a release from the FWFD.  A firefighter at the scene said the damage to the storage units was “pretty significant.” The release said there was heavy damage at the facility due to the fire, smoke, and water.  No injuries were reported, according to the release.  Drew Bogs sent WANE 15 photos that provided an aerial view of the fire from downtown Fort Wayne, and a large amount of smoke could be seen in the air.

The blaze occurred in the kitchen area of The Thai on North Mission Street just before 1 a.m.  Wenatchee Police Department Capt. Edgar Reinfeld says officers had to rescue both men as the fire raged, including the need to physically carry one of them from the building.  ""Officers arrived and immediately found one male just inside the building. Then, they discovered there was a second man in the structure and got them both out safely. Through an investigation it was learned that these two were cooking inside the restaurant after hours and that both were intoxicated while doing so.""  Police say the restaurant's owners told officers the pair were not authorized to be inside the restaurant, which was closed at the time of the fire.  Reinfeld says the employee's actions caused the fire but its exact source is still under investigation and that charges against the men are unlikely, but possible.  ""Most fire-related charges such as Reckless Burning or Arson - and in this case it would be considered a potential arson because it was an occupied building even though it was just the two of them inside the building - require an element of recklessness at the least, like someone saying 'this is a really bad idea but let's do it anyway', or the intent to actually cause a structure fire. And I'm not sure we're going to get to either one of those based on the evidence that we currently have on the fire, but if something else were to come to light, we would possibly file charges.""  No one was injured in the fire but the restaurant has been rendered unable to operate as a result of the fire and will be closed indefinitely while necessary repairs are made.  KPQ News has reached out to the owners of The Thai but had yet to receive a response at the time of this posting."

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fre, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:  Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).  Visitors may continue to see smoke from the roadways and the risk of smoke continues to remain the biggest concern. Travelers should use caution throughout the impacted area.

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled."

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs."
