"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""May"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:01:01","Here's a rapid-fire update on all 34 stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio we use for the CNBC Investing Club. Jim ran through each one of them Wednesday during the May edition of our ""Monthly Meeting."" Apple (AAPL): With the iPhone maker's business in emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India beginning to show momentum, our longtime ""own it, don't trade it"" mantra continues to look great. Financial features like Apple Pay should help with services revenue growth in the years ahead, too. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Jim said he's worried about overstaying his welcome in AMD, a company he's liked for many years under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su. That's a high-quality problem to have, though. The stock, up 60% this year, is nearing a 52-week high. Amazon (AMZN): The e-commerce and cloud giant is leaning into generative artificial intelligence (AI) to reignite its advertising business, which generated $9.5 billion in revenues in the first quarter. It's a promising plan. However, Jim suggested the Club may need to trim its Amazon position soon, strictly from a portfolio-management perspective. AMZN is nearing a 3% weighting in the Trust. Bausch Health (BHC): After the ""Monthly Meeting"" concluded, shares of the troubled pharmaceutical maker soared on a favorable ruling in the company's Xifaxan patent litigation. BHC stock jumped more than 41% at one stage to a session of $8.56. We're still trying to figure out the full extent of the court ruling, but it's news that could eliminate the possibility of a default, which brought the stock to $6. Xifaxan, which represents 80% of sales at BHC's Salix Pharmaceuticals unit, is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and overt hepatic encephalopathy. Bausch Health disappointed investors with first-quarter earnings and revenue when it reported earlier this month. However, the company at the time offered better-than-expected forward guidance. Caterpillar (CAT): Our focus is on the deluge of infrastructure spending coming in the U.S. over the coming years, and less on where dealer inventory levels sit in the next quarter, something Wall Street analysts talk a lot about. This allows us to be patient and see through short-term noise. Costco (COST): Costco continues to keep its prices low and its quality high, and traders who sell its stock on, say, weak monthly sales are usually proven wrong over time. Salesforce (CRM): CEO Marc Benioff has successfully fended off an unusual amount of activist pressure in the stock. Following the stock's big year-to-date run, we sold 100 shares on May 4. We're curious to see whether Salesforce can jumpstart Slack, the workplace-messaging app it acquired nearly two years ago for almost $28 billion. Coterra Energy (CTRA): Coterra's first-quarter results were downright impressive , given the steep decline in natural prices in recent months. Jim said he'd like to buy more if the stock fell below $24 per share, but suggested the oil-and-gas firm's robust buyback program may be putting in a floor. Danaher (DHR): Danaher is in a rough patch, but our long-term faith in management to execute and deliver efficiencies across its life-sciences businesses hasn't been shaken. To sell here would suggest management has lost a step. We don't believe that's the case, and Jim said he'd like to buy some additional shares. Disney (DIS): We're sticking with Disney, although our entry into the entertainment giant was a bit early. Simply put, the company's current market value is significantly lower than its franchise value, rooted in its vast intellectual property library. The odds favor that mismatch correcting over time. Estee Lauder (EL): The prestige cosmetics firm is dealing with a more volatile recovery in its Asia travel retail business than expected, leading to very disappointing guidance that's crushed the stock. But now it's priced in, and we want to use the weakness to buy more, betting on CEO Fabrizio Freda to deliver. Jim said buy EL and we added more shares to the Trust . Emerson Electric (EMR): The automation-focused industrial needs another quality quarter to shake off the overhang created by its initially hostile takeover of National Instruments (NATI). In the absence of that, Jim said we may bid adieu to Emerson. Ford (F): CEO Jim Farley did a fantastic job delivering in the automaker's latest quarter, and we like his decision to scale back Ford's business in China . The impact of Tesla's price wars on the overall electric-vehicle market remains to be seen, but it's a wrinkle we didn't see coming. Foot Locker (FL): We have low expectations for the sneaker retailer's earnings report Friday. It's still early into CEO Mary Dillon's tenure, though, and we maintain our optimism in her turnaround strategy. We'll look to add to our position, currently just a 1.5% weighting, on future weakness in the stock. GE Healthcare (GEHC): The medical imaging and diagnostics company joined our portfolio Wednesday . Jim said it was coming on the Monthly Meeting. Recently spun-out from General Electric (GE), we see an industry leader that's now better positioned to accelerate growth. Alphabet (GOOGL): We pared back our exposure in Google's parent company in early May, locking in big profits in the portfolio-management move. But Jim said he's optimistic about Alphabet's ability to serve as an AI-focused consulting firm of sorts for other companies, like it recently did with fast-food chain Wendy's (WEN). Halliburton (HAL): A steep drop in oil prices recently has dragged Halliburton down, too, prompting some investors to question whether a multiyear cycle of increased drilling investments is still in the cards. But the Biden administration refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and more visibility around economic growth would help oil prices pick back up. Honeywell (HON): The upcoming CEO transition, with the retiring Darius Adamczyk set to be replaced by COO Vimal Kapur on June 1, has seemingly kept a lid on the stock recently. However, that gave us a chance to upgrade the stock to a buy-it-here 1 rating Monday. Its exposure to aerospace and clean energy allow us to be patient. Humana (HUM): The health insurer Medicare Advantage offering is much-improved, leading the company to revise its membership estimates higher multiple times since the fall. It's also the kind of defensive stock that should be relatively resilient in any bad-news scenarios with the debt-ceiling fight in Washington. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Separating its consumer products division from its pharmaceutical and medical technology units was a good move for shareholders . But the ongoing talc lawsuit fight has been bad. A favorable resolution to the latest proposed settlement would bring the focus back to the fundamentals and unlock the stock. Linde (LIN): The well-run industrial gas giant is off its all-time highs, reached earlier in May, but the multiyear outlook for Linde remains very strong. Linde benefits from green hydrogen trends, as well as expanding semiconductor manufacturing. Eli Lilly (LLY): Eli Lilly's drug pipeline in diabetes and weight loss, as well as Alzheimer's is stellar, and why we believe it's the best large-cap pharmaceutical company out there. We're letting the stock ride for now, up 33% over the past three months, but acknowledge that we may have to book profits. Meta Platforms (META): The Facebook and Instagram parent has wisely used artificial intelligence to improve advertising efficiency on its platforms, and to boost engagement with short-form video feature Reels. Meta's ""year of efficiency"" is working, and Jim said the metaverse thankfully looks like an after-thought right now. Morgan Stanley (MS): It's been a turbulent time for financial stocks since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March and some others, but we continue to like Morgan Stanley's asset and wealth management pivot. If the sector comes back in favor, Jim said he expects the stock to climb to $90 per share from its current levels around $83 each. Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft has been riding the artificial intelligence boom that began late last year after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The tech titan, a key investor and partner with OpenAI, has rolled out a number of encouraging new AI-enabled features to its software. Nvidia (NVDA): Nvidia has become another ""own it, don't trade it"" stock. Its graphics chips are at the heart of the AI cycle. Jim said it's admittedly hard to know when Nvidia shares, up 105% year to date, may take a breather. Palo Alto Networks (PANW): CEO Nikesh Arora has done a great job turning Palo Alto Networks into a profitable, diversified cybersecurity company with scale as the industry consolidates. Despite the stock's recent weakness, it remains above our cost basis of $177.68, and we are hesitant to violate that. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD): Jim said he wants to buy more Pioneer, which will hand the reins to current President and COO Rich Dealy after year-end. Higher oil prices would certainly be a boon for Pioneer's stock price, but the company's high-quality assets in the Permian Basin are attractive on their own. Procter & Gamble (PG): Jim said P & G is primed for another strong move higher, similar to its advance that took it from the mid $130s per share to around $155 on Wednesday. If it slips back to around $150, Jim said he thinks P & G would be a buy. Starbucks (SBUX): Laxman Narasimhan, who took over as CEO in March, deserves time to settle into the job, especially given the difficult Covid reopening environment in China. Middle-class consumers in China may be pulling back on some spending, but we think the coffee chain's bet on the country, already its second-largest sales market, is the right one over time. Constellation Brands (STZ): The situation at Constellation has become a bit of a mixed bag, Jim said, with Modelo's growth remaining impressive while Corona has cooled a bit. However, we like owning the company, particularly due to its cash flow prowess. TJX Companies (TJX): The off-price retailer, which reported solid earnings Wednesday morning, is a buy here, Jim stressed. We expect solid results in the second half of the year. Wells Fargo (WFC): Wells Fargo is a buy, after it agreed to a settlement Tuesday to resolve another legal matter from it scandal-ridden past under previous managers. Its future looks brighter each time another regulatory hurdle is put in the rearview mirror, even though the Federal Reserve-mandated asset cap is still in place. Wynn Resorts (WYNN): Shares of the casino operator jumped 7% to roughly $110 each Wednesday after Barclays upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy, from hold, with a $135 price target. With Wynn's properties in both the U.S. and Macao humming, Jim said he'd consider using weakness in the stock to add to our small position.

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:24:00","The last few days the sunrises and sunsets here in Michigan have been fabulous. It looks like these dawn and dusk delights are going to continue off and on for quite some time.  The reason for the orange and red sunrises and sunsets is a lot of smoke in the sky drifting across North America. Western Canada has numerous wildfires going right now. These fires are actually producing a lot of smoke. You might think smoke in western Canada can’t make it to the skies over Michigan. The smoke easily makes it into our sky in just a couple of days. The fires are a few thousand miles away. The upper-air flow averages 100 mph. In 24 hours, the air can move 2400 miles. Western Canadian air can be over Michigan in just a day or two depending on the upper-level winds.  Smoke in British Columbia and Alberta shows up as faint, wispy white on the latest satellite images.  Why are the sunrises and sunsets orange and red? Sunlight is made up of all of the light colors. Remember a rainbow’s colors are the sunlight colors separated for us. The colors of a rainbow can be remembered by the name ROY G. BIV - Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet. Notice how the colors of a rainbow are grouped. The red, orange and yellow have long wavelengths. The green, blue, indigo and violet have shorter wavelengths.  The smoke particles are blocking some of the light coming from the sun. The colors that are blocked more easily are the short wavelength light colors of the blues and purples. This leaves us with a sunrise or sunset with red, orange and yellow colors.  Satellite shows the fires and smoke in western Canada on May 16, 2023  So will smoke be in our sky everyday? No. The smoke will come at us in waves. Storm systems and rainfall will do a good job of dragging the smoke down to the ground. After a storm system we may have a day or two of blue skies. The smoke will then build up again since westerly winds are the most common upper-air flow.  Until the fires go out, we will continue to have beautiful smoky sunrises and sunsets. There will also be some downsides to smoky skies. The daily forecast could be a little tougher. When a blob of this smoke moves over Michigan we almost get a cloudy sky. The smoke can actually lower the afternoon temperature by five degrees. Of course the smoke is pollution and can give us poor air quality more often.  Find a couple of lawn chairs and be ready for sunrise and sunset watching.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvb24tZmlyZS1zdW5yaXNlcy1hbmQtc3Vuc2V0cy1hcmUtaGVyZS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9vbi1maXJlLXN1bnJpc2VzLWFuZC1zdW5zZXRzLWFyZS1oZXJlLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Montgomery"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:01:00","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - After a long 22 weeks, 17 new firefighters graduated from what Montgomery city officials call the toughest fire training in the country.  “Firefighting is a demanding profession that requires a lot of sacrifices,” said Fire Chief Miford Jordan.  “You are not just becoming a part of something. You are becoming a part of the thing,” said Chief of Staff Chip Hill.  For 22 weeks, strenuous training prepared them for what can often become unthinkable.  “Sunday night, and Monday morning, what hit me and what I hope will hit you is how fast life could change,” said Hill.  The fire at a home on Gilmer Avenue was a tragic real-world lesson for the new firefighters. Two people were killed, and five firefighters were injured.  Keynote speaker Christian Dealba says the house fire was something firefighters see all the time.  “Firefighter Hartman has six years on the job here and was dragged out of the house fire unconscious and lifeless,” said Dealba.  “Captain Crenshaw also has been here for 22 years and has 3rd-degree burns from his shoulders to his hands he was also transported to UAB. His firefighter gloves were burned completely to his hands,” said Deabla.  Dealba says these firefighters will make a full recovery because of the extensive training they have received, having the best equipment possible thanks to city leadership, and with the help of the Montgomery police Department who also responded that night.  Graduates say they are now officially part of a new team, but they all rely on the teams that they have at home.  “The academy is physically and mentally challenging during the day, but at night time, you have many of the tasks you have to accomplish and couldn’t do it without the support of my family, my kids, and my wife,” said graduate Evan Quaco.

Ann Arbor fire crews were called to the 1200 block of Heather Way around 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, for a fire in an exterior wall of a home. When officers arrived, they found smoke in the residence and an active fire in an outside wall.  Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire. There were no injuries.  Although crews were initially confused at the placement of the fire, the department said on social media, video from a neighbor’s exterior camera showed contractors using a blowtorch to kill weeds along the house.  “It should go without saying that using a blow-torch to kill weeds next to a structure is an incredibly poor decision,” wrote the fire department on social media. “It was very fortunate the residence did not suffer greater damage, and there were no injuries.”  The Ann Arbor Fire Department was assisted by crews from Dexter Area Fire Department and Pittsfield, Scio and Ann Arbor townships.

"fire","2023-05-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:38:19","DARTMOUTH — Investigators believe that someone intentionally set fire to the Hawthorne Country Club building.  The Massachusetts Fire Marshal had been investigating after a fire destroyed the property’s clubhouse on May 7.  “Investigators believe this fire was intentionally set,” said Department of Fire Services Spokesperson Jake Wark in an email to The Light on Thursday.  Related  Wark added that it’s their policy not to release details on how suspicious fires begin, so he wasn’t able to provide more information about the country club fire. “This is to ensure that statements from witnesses and others aren’t influenced by facts or evidence they obtained from media coverage,” he said.  The agency is still seeking tips from witnesses. They can contact investigators directly at 978-567-3310 or through the Arson Watch Reward Program’s tip line, which offers rewards of up to $5,000 for information that helps detect or prevent arson crimes, at 1-800-682-9229.  No criminal charges have been brought as of Thursday afternoon, Wark said.  The country club at 970 Tucker Road in Dartmouth had been vacant since it closed in 2016. Recently, the family of fishing mogul Carlos Rafael acquired the property and entered an agreement to sell it to Toll Brothers, a national luxury home builder, for $3 million. But the deal hadn’t closed yet when the fire happened, and it’s not clear if the fire has had any effect on the agreement. Toll Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  Rafael has served time in federal custody for mislabeling fish and falsifying records. His son-in-law, realtor and contractor Jeff Hathaway, spoke to news outlets about Toll Brothers’ plans to turn the property into condos for seniors after the deal was first announced last month. Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  When investigators try to determine the cause of a fire, they look for the point of origin — usually the area with the most damage, Wark said. From there, investigators look for evidence of potential causes.  “Depending on the extent of damage, this may be easy, arduous, or impossible — and it can sometimes be ascertained only with heavy equipment and careful delayering,” Wark, the fire marshal spokesperson, said in an email.  The fire marshal has a dozen K-9s that can detect accelerants, and investigators may test samples from places where the dogs think they found something. Investigators also use witness accounts and video.  Wark did not provide any information on what specific evidence led investigators to rule the country club fire as a possible arson, but he said investigators hope to hear from anyone who has information on the fire.

Around 5:45 p.m. firefighters were called to a structure fire on the 1800 block of West Second Street. Flames were seen coming from the rear of the buildings.  When firefighters arrived on scene they found heavy fire coming form the back of the house. Sioux City Fire Rescue said the fire did spread into the living area of the home. One person was inside of the house when the fire broke out. They did manage to safety escape. Fire officials said getting to the fire was a bit of a challenge.  “Quite a climb up to the house.

This state-of-the-art facility, set to be a highly versatile training simulation platform, will provide firefighter and EMS students with a realistic training environment for various rescue scenarios.  “The Ohio Fire Academy has always been a nationally-recognized leader in firefighter training,” said Governor Mike DeWine. “We recognize the importance of providing our first responders with the most relevant and safe training resources. This new search and rescue house will ensure that our firefighters receive top-notch training on realistic simulation props, further enhancing their skills and safety.”  The two-story structure, spanning approximately 1500 square feet, will be a wood-framed, residential-style training building/home. It will feature removable systems designed specifically for forcible entry and search training, enhancing the authenticity of the training experience. The structure will be used for Fire and EMS classes, offering comprehensive training opportunities for aspiring firefighters and emergency medical personnel.  Electric utilities will be incorporated into the structure to facilitate lighting, emergencies, and training purposes. Additionally, heating will be provided for freeze protection, and ventilation systems will be installed in accordance with the applicable code requirements. The objective is to create a safe and dynamic training environment that prepares firefighters for real-life scenarios they may encounter in the field.  “The groundbreaking ceremony marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Ohio Fire Academy’s commitment to delivering exceptional training experiences,” said State Fire Marshal Kevin Reardon. “The state-of-the-art search and rescue house will stand as a testament to the academy’s dedication to preparing firefighters and EMS students for the challenges they may face in the line of duty.”  Construction of the search and rescue house is scheduled to be completed November 2023","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vY3Jhd2ZvcmRjb3VudHlub3cuY29tL2xvY2FsL3N0YXRlLWZpcmUtbWFyc2hhbHMtb2hpby1maXJlLWFjYWRlbXktYnJlYWtzLWdyb3VuZC1vbi1zZWFyY2gtYW5kLXJlc2N1ZS1ob3VzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Within the region, Deputy Rounds remains a self-motivated and reliable employee,"" stated Ernst.  Deputy Rounds performed consistently in all aspects of his assignment over the past year. His nomination highlighted that Rounds had 37 initial fire investigations and 167 fire safety inspections for the year, one of the highest inspection rates among statewide deputies. Of the 37 investigations, ten were criminal; 18 cases were closed, including 5 cases being closed with arrest. He was also praised for assisting other investigators within the Western Region, which consists of Garrett, Allegany, and Washington counties, the largest in square miles the Office of the State Fire Marshal covers.  ""Deputy Rounds has been an asset to the Western Region and volunteers for multiple other assignments, including Fishing with a Cop, Shop with a Cop, and other regional events. These important events showcase our agency in the community and establish community trust and a positive image,"" stated Ernst.  With 15 years in law enforcement, Deputy Rounds is a seasoned police officer and investigator.

According to Marathon, the fire started at approximately 9:30 a.m., though what sparked the flames is unclear.  ORIGINAL REPORT: 1 Marathon Petroleum employee dies in Texas City refinery fire, company says  Texas City police added that no shelter in place was needed and there was no threat to the community, but air monitoring was conducted as a precaution.  Residents who live within a mile of the plant voiced frustrations Monday with the city's lack of communication about the incident, with one woman saying she found out through ABC13's website.  The Texas City Emergency Management Department has a free text alert system that is advertised on its website as being able to provide those who sign up with ""critical information quickly in a variety of situations."" However, some say they didn't receive any notification despite signing up for emergency alert texts.  ABC13 reached out to several people in Texas City's Emergency Management Department to find out why a text was not sent out through the alert system. Texas City officials said since the public did not need to shelter in place or evacuate, they did not use the emergency notification system.  ""Although the emergency notification system was not used in this incident because no public action was needed, moving forward, to ensure the comfort level of our community, we will push out messages through the system to let the public know they are safe and that no action is needed,"" the department's statement read, in part.  The city did, however, post about it on social media.  A report revealed that a pump leak may have caused the deadly fire.

How a problem can be its own solution – the fire conundrum – is part of what drew some 1600 delegates from 90 countries to Porto, Portugal in mid-May.  The week-long conference included technical field trips on May 15 and the official opening May 16, followed by a keynote session labeled simply “The Problem.”  The opening included a videotaped welcome from António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, who cautioned that “We must keep global warming below 1.5 C” and if we’re to do so, he said, we must energize fire management that includes all voices, including indigenous leaders and communities. (And even though we must act to limit climate change, a UN World Meteorological Organization report this week has forecast a 66 percent chance we’ll reach the 1.5°C increase for a year during the next five years.)  The conference chair, Tiago Oliveira, board chairman of Portugal’s wildfire service Agency for Integrated Rural Fire Management (AGIF), opened with guidance: “We need to take out the emotional side of fire and replace it with the rational management of fire.” Yet he also reminded attendees of the emotional reality of wildland fire. “I am a survivor as many of you are and we are here to build a better future. To ask for help as I did in 2017” – when Portugal endured a storm of fires that killed 120 citizens and firefighters. An article in Scientific Reports suggests that the extreme fire season of 2017 may have been a prelude to future conditions and likewise events that are triggered by climate change effects. The immensity and challenge of these fires also led to the creation of AGIF.  “Every day that we are managing fires we are learning,” Oliveira continued. “We come here to build friendships in fire. The more friends we have in the world of forest fires the more successful we will be. And the world needs our contributions. The world needs less bad fire and more good fire.”  Gordy Sachs, chief of All Hazard and International Fire Support for the U.S. Forest Service and chair of the International Liaison Committee that planned the conference, reiterated the conference’s value globally. Statements from prior conferences [held every four years] influenced Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on climate, and the 2023 Conference will launch a key transition tool for international cooperation – the Landscape Fire Governance Framework – and will, like prior conferences, make each country and the world safer and more resilient.  Most of the opening, as is typical of international gatherings, offered the sort of civil and governance support that is key to implementing new frameworks. So it was heartening (if also disheartening) to learn from Antonia Cunha, president of Portugal’s North Regional Coordination and Development Commission, that he’s aware and concerned that 26 percent of carbon emissions in 2022 in the region was from forest fires.  Likewise, a commitment from Juan Cabandié, Environment Minister of Argentina, highlighted that his country needs to be more directed at planning and prevention. “We’re the eighth largest country in the world and 70 percent of our land at risk of wildfires,” he said. And to support its goals, Argentina has started its first monitoring system for entire country.  Duarte Cordeira, with Portugal’s Ministry of Environment, also returned the delegates to community. “We know that the best fire management is by the community members. If we want a more resistant forest that can provide economic and sustainable benefits, we cannot have a monoculture. We are increasing our defense with the creation of a protection ring of native forest.” He said already 200 of these native fuel breaks have been planted, with another 470 in the works and a goal of 800 villages. And Cordeira noted the challenge. “Yet 97 percent of rural properties are private,” he said, “so we need to increase subsidy for land consolidation.”  A conference opening offers a frame, and after a break for coffee and Pastéis de Nata, the conference jumped into “The Problem.” More on that soon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2lsZGZpcmV0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLW1lZXRpbmctb3BlbnMtd2l0aC1maXJlLXByb2JsZW0tY29tbXVuaXR5LXNvbHV0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Christian Thomas Dahm, 45, faces one felony count of starting negligent fire that caused great bodily harm. He remained jailed Thursday.  The fire broke out at the fourplex about 11:30 p.m. Sunday in the 2600 block of Aspen Court off Glen Oaks Avenue and County Road D.  According to the criminal complaint, when responders got on scene, a townhome unit was fully engulfed in flames, which were spreading to adjoining units. Dahm’s father pointed at Dahm, who was on the back patio, and said, “He started the fire.”  Firefighters located Dahm’s mother inside her townhome unit. She had a pulse, but was struggling to breathe, and had slight burns. She was transported to Regions Hospital in critical condition.  Dahm told police he was in the garage working on his fishing pole over a car hood before the fire started. He said he was using an oil pan and lit a cigarette with a torch and then “all of a sudden, there was a fire,” the complaint states.  Meanwhile, Dahm’s father said he and his wife decided to check on their son before going to bed because they were concerned because they believed he was high on methamphetamine.  He said when he opened the service door to the garage, it appeared as though “everything exploded.” He saw his son run out of the garage.  A neighbor told police that she saw Dahm and his father pull into their driveway before the fire and that Dahm was “cursing and swearing” and making loud noises in the garage.  The fire spread from one townhome to another, where KARE 11 anchor Rena Sarigianopoulos’ parents live, and she wrote on GoFundMe that their home was destroyed.  Dahm’s mother remained in the burn unit at Regions Hospital on Tuesday, the complaint said. She was on a ventilator.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","1998-11-17","Not Discerned","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:14:16","Frank Klopas is Chicago soccer.  His teammates from the Fire’s Double-winning inaugural year of 1998 know it better than anyone. “We used to call Frankie ‘the Mayor,’” said Jesse Marsch, back then a young journeyman midfielder with a serious competitive streak. “We’d see the actual Mayor [Daley] in the airport and his whole entourage would come over and make sure they said hello to him [Klopas].  Born in Prosymna in Greece in 1966, Klopas made his mark on the city’s soccer scene long before MLS came to town. He emigrated to Chicago, won a championship with Mather High School, and signed straight up for the Chicago Sting’s final outdoor season before the original NASL folded – and then played several seasons for the Sting’s indoor team (MISL).    When the Fire launched as an expansion team in 1998, it was a no-brainer to bring Klopas – then in his early 30s – back home to help lead the city’s team in the emergent new professional top flight (MLS).  “It was near the end of my career,” said Klopas, who played in Greece with AEK and in the U.S. National Team in the lean years of American professional soccer between the old NASL folding (1984) and MLS emerging in 1996. “I was so grateful for the chance to go back and finish my career where it all started.  “It was so special to be able to play my last few years in front of my family and in my hometown – and also to have soccer back in the city.” he said about his return after two years with the Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City).  Made for the Big Moments  Klopas was built for the big occasions. He was an eager striker with a near-liquid stride and a keen eye for goal before injuries took their toll. His Chicago homecoming, in what were his autumn years, could have ended as a sentimental swansong – a simple and empty gesture. Instead, he etched his name again into the lore of the city’s soccer by scoring the golden goal, deep in extra-time against the Columbus Crew, that saw the Fire finish that first season with a rare League and Cup Double.    In addition to the unforgettable winner at Soldier Field, he also scored the first goal of that 1998 Cup run. It came at a very different venue in the city, Forest View Park in Arlington Heights, and against the semi-pro Chicago Stingers. “Those games are tough. Not easy at all. Those guys [the Stingers] were ready to go and they were hungry,” Klopas remembered of the game the Fire won 3-1 after trailing in the 85th minute and facing early elimination.  “It came down to little details,” he said of the comeback that began with him sneaking in at the near post and nabbing the equalizer. “In the end it’s down to us making a couple plays. And the rest is history.”  Klopas is quick to deflect attention away from himself and point out the true secret behind that famous 1998 team. “Some of our training sessions were harder than the games,” he said of the spirit a then-young Bob Bradley fostered in a squad that had a core of young Americans like Marsch and Josh Wolff – and a raft of eastern-europeans led by captain Piotr Nowak, Lubos Kubik and Jerzy Podbrozny.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1oZXJvcy1yZXR1cm4tZm9yLWN1cC13aW5uZXIta2xvcGFzLXRoZS1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-01","20:00:00","{""Gatineau"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:41:15","HULL − The state has said it will not count nearly 100 ballots cast between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday and has called into question the validity of the entire town election after a large house fire prevented potential voters from accessing the polls.  The six-alarm fire blocked traffic to Hull High School, the town's only polling place, for an hour and a half. The road reopened at 7 p.m. Monday, an hour before polls were initially set to close.  Hull officials made the last-minute decision to extend voting by two hours to accommodate those who wished to vote, and retroactively asked Plymouth County Superior Court to authorize the extension and permit the counting of ballots cast during that time.  On Wednesday night, the town was told the votes would not be counted and ""the court's decision also calls into question the validity of the election due to the unfortunate disruption of the voting,"" the clerk's website reads. ""The town is reviewing the decision and determining the next steps.""  The last frontier?Weymouth, Quincy struggle with slow redevelopment on Route 3A  More:The tide finally might be turning for one of Hull's last undeveloped waterfront lots  According to Hull Town Clerk Lori West's petition to the court, she and town attorney James Lampke consulted with the elections division at the secretary of state's office before they decided to keep the polls open for two hours beyond the scheduled closing time. Efforts to reach a judge for an emergency order afterhours on Monday were unsuccessful, the petition says.  The town told residents about the extension using an emergency phone system some residents were signed up for, as well as robocalls, social media and Hull Community Cable. West said the candidates, most of whom were at the polls throughout the day, were notified of the decision and were “receptive and understanding.”  ""Everyone involved in the process stepped up to the plate to do the right thing and make the best of an unusual situation,"" Lampke said.  West's petition says “80 or so votes” were cast between 8 and 10 p.m., enough to swing at least one race on the ballot.  ""Until the election results are finalized and certified by the town clerk, she cannot administer the oath of office to some of the candidates where the race was too close to call,” the petition reads.  Court calls for new election to count votes of 'disenfranchised' residents  The court decision by Judge Brian Glenny cites several reasons for calling the town election invalid.  He said there was no way to ensure that the town's efforts to broadcast the information reached every citizen who intended to vote. He also said police officers managing traffic around the fire did not know immediately that the polling hours were being extended. Those officers told people they were not be able to vote, and there is no way to know if those people found out later they could return to the polls.  ""There exists a very real likelihood that citizens were disenfranchised during the May 15, 2023, town election,"" Glenny wrote. ""In the view of the court, a new election is the only just remedy for the unfortunate circumstances.""  Rollins accused of leaking Quincy bridge inquiry: 'Don't say I never gave you anything'  Winter Street: Nonprofit proposes 34-unit building for 'extremely low-income' residents in Quincy  Fewer than 100 votes could swing Hull election  Candidates sought 18 seats on 13 different Hull boards and committees in Monday's election, but it appears only one was close enough to be swung by a difference of 80 to 100 votes.  In a race for a seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority board, Patrick Finn holds a 15-vote lead over Daniel Kernan. Another seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority was won handily by Adrienne Paquinn.  Tied closely to the results of the race is the fate of a 12.5-acre parcel of undeveloped land between a Weir River Estuary bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The land is one of the last parcels of open beachfront in Hull and has been the subject of several failed ideas over the years.  There is agreement among residents and the redevelopment authority that the land has untapped potential, but reaching consensus on exactly what and what not to do with it has proved more challenging.  The Hull Redevelopment Authority has most recently solicited input from residents on its plan to built 117 residential units, a 65-room hotel and retail space that adds up to 181,700 square feet of new buildings. Under the current draft, 68% of the property would remain open space.  Finn has expressed stronger support for the commercial development of the property than his opponent. Kernan supports an alternative plan that would emphasize developed open space, as does Paquinn.  This is a developing story. Please check PatriotLedger.com for the latest updates.

Zoraida Diaz, who's Afro-Latina, started the position last month after serving nearly two decades in the Oakland Fire Department.  Only about 6% of fire chiefs are women across the country. Diaz says when she started out it was never her goal to become a Fire Chief, but her passion for helping people led her to her purpose in fire service.  ""This is my dad. I have to acknowledge him because my dad, when I was going through the academy, he was with me for six and a half months. He would prepare meals for me to make sure that I was healthy the whole time that I was in the academy,"" said Diaz.  It’s been 19 years since Zoraida Diaz joined Oakland’s Fire Dept.

So, no one is going to stop me from being successful, is how I looked at it. Really, I was able to get the respect because I had the credibility of working every position but also who I was when I started in the academy, is who I’ve always been,"" Diaz said.  Fifty-five-year-old Diaz was born and raised in Harlem, NY with her siblings to Puerto Rican parents. After earning a master's degree, she worked as a social worker for over a decade and left New York to eventually settle in Hayward. Soon after, a friend from Oakland’s Fire Dept. introduced her to fire service.  ""Being a former athlete, I just looked at the teamwork and the camaraderie in that exercise, and I was like wow this looks like something I can do,"" Diaz said.  Diaz served as Deputy Chief for two years in Fremont before becoming Fire Chief. She now manages over 150 people and plans to hire a 14th company or fire crew, to expand the Dept.  ""We’re all engaged in doing research or identifying best practices on how we can better serve the community of Fremont,"" Diaz said.  After nearly two decades of service, Diaz says she’ll retire in three to four years to spend time with her family and travel with her fiancée Paula.  ""I weighed 115 lbs. I knew nothing about mechanical aptitude. I knew about the fire service. I was a social worker for 15 years, and I was 36-years old. So, I say to anyone who’s interested in pursuing a career in the fire service, that if I can do it, so can you,"" Diaz said.  Right now, there are six women serving as firefighters here in Fremont.

Emergency Responses  The SFD (and sometimes SPD) responded to the following emergencies:  February 24th — mutual aid at 2 alarm house fire in Westborough  March 7 — car fire on the Mass Pike  March 23 — the State Police Bomb Squad’s disposal of small, gas cylinders (behind the DPW)  April 3rd — mutual aid at 2 alarm house fire in Westborough  April 9th — mutual aid at 2 alarm house fire in Hopkinton  April 14th — mutual aid at Woods fire near the Mass Pike in Westborough  April 26th — Truck fire on Oak Hill Road  May 5th — Chimney fire on Cordaville Road  May 9th — Changing the tire of an elderly resident in need. (Maybe this doesn’t quite qualify as an emergency, but it likely felt like one to the driver.)  Quarterly Reports  The Quarterly Report issued for the SPD covering January through March showed there were over 10 arrests made and another 52 criminal applications. Officers handled over 5 harassment complaints or restraining orders, more than 20 assault and domestics/disturbances, and 20 cases of larceny/forgery/fraud.  The report also shows over 90 vehicle accidents and 892 non-criminal citations issued. There were also 120 responses to alarms and around 150 “911 hang-up/open lines”.  The SFD’s Report for the same time period shows their crews responded to 356 emergencies (up 5% from last year). 13% of incidents occurred at the same time.  Most of the calls were for EMS (over 210). The report also notes that the department provided mutual aid 25 times and only received it 4 times.

Fires that broke out in Lynn on May 12, May 13 and May 17 are being looked at by investigators with the Lynn Fire Department and the Massachusetts State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the state fire marshal’s office as “suspicious,” according to a joint statement from Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation and Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey.  Celino noted that red flag conditions – high winds, low humidity and very dry vegetation – leave the possibility for wildfires to happen.  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” Celino said in the statement. “Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  With the help of mutual aid partners, these fires were taken care of without any serious injuries or property damage to the area, Sullivan added.  Read more: GoFundMe set up for family businesses destroyed in fire in Worcester  Investigators now ask the public to share any information they may have about these fires. They ask that anyone “who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods on these dates or has other information on the fires” to call the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or call the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225.

One of these fires burned from the Lynn Woods Reservation, hopped over Route 1 and began to burn through the Breakheart Reservation in Saugus, WCVB reported.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” Ostroskey said in the statement. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

There’s too many people building,” said resident Ruth. “The traffic here is incredible there’s accidents all the time.”  “They put up a huge amount of apartments just recently right off Treeline,” said nearby neighbor Mike. “I’m afraid it’s going to get so populated that it’s going to take away from the beauty of it.”  As the city gets working on the next fiscal year, Fort Myers Fire wants to bring a new fire station along Treeline Ave, closer to Daniels Pkwy.  The department is teaming with Park and Rec to also bring a park and art space on this piece of land.  “We’re just trying to do things a little smarter,” said Fire Chief Tracy McMillion. “So it’d be a fire station, having a park there and also being a cultural hub of artwork and coolness all in one particular space.”  It’s not just about the green space, as more are built in the southeast part of the city – Chief McMillion tells NBC2 Fort Myers fire is trying to keep up with quick response times.  There are eight fire stations spread throughout the city; Most can get to a home or incident within 11 minutes.  For this part of Ward 6, response times jump to 12-15 minutes in neighborhoods like Marina Bay, Plantation Gardens, Arborwood, Legacy at Gateway, and others.  “We’re seeing a lot more call volume in certain areas that used to not have that,” said McMillion. “And that’s what we’re doing we’re trying to look for a fire, an emergency saturation, and so basically if one station goes out, we want to have the ability for another station to back them up with just a little greater time.”  The city would still need to purchase the land for more than a million dollars, which already sits in front of Fort Myers’ East Water Tank.  If approved, the project would be part of 2024’s budget, there’s no timetable for how long this idea could take.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmJjLTIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9wcm9wb3NlZC1maXJlLXN0YXRpb24taW4tZm9ydC1teWVycy1haW1zLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtcmVzcG9uc2UtdGltZXMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9uYmMtMi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3Byb3Bvc2VkLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1pbi1mb3J0LW15ZXJzLWFpbXMtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1yZXNwb25zZS10aW1lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(CBS) -- A Mercer County neighborhood was evacuated Thursday morning after a warehouse fire.  The fire broke out around 12:30 a.m. at the warehouse on Whitehead Road. Video from the scene showed flames were spilling out from windows.  Smoke was billowing above the buildings after 6 a.m.  A fire broke out at a warehouse on Whitehead Road in Hamilton Township Thursday morning. CBS News Philadelphia  Officials said the building is the former Goodall Rubber building, now operated by a company called Hakim International Trading.  The fire reached four alarms at its peak, with 26 fire units from 14 towns responding.  Chuck Hector, who works at a building across the road, said the fire sparked explosions and jets of flame were shooting up into the air.  ""The flames went literally, 100 feet up in the air,"" Hector said. ""There were large embers that were just going up and going on the roofs.""  Some embers landed on his business' roof, but he said the damage was minor.  Hakim International Trading buys out liquidated items, then stores them and resells them, Hector said.  The building was ""packed stem to stern with thousands of different items,"" he added.  Later in the morning, firefighters were focusing on hot spots and making sure the water tower above wasn't damaged.  Usually with fires such as this there are air quality concerns - officials typically warn residents to close all windows and make sure doors are locked to keep out any smoke.  The state Department of Environmental Protection conducted air quality tests and found no concerns, a township spokesperson said in a statement.  Hamilton Township Deputy Fire Chief John Retalis said about six homes were evacuated because smoke was blowing their way. The evacuations were to remain in effect for the rest of the day.  One firefighter was hospitalized with minor injuries after they slipped and fell.  Firefighters were still putting out hot spots later Thursday morning.

Regulators had originally sought to fine the utility $155 million for two regulatory violations blamed in the fire that left four dead and destroyed more than 200 homes in Shasta and Tehama counties. The deal, as approved, will impose a $10 million fine and then specify that the $140 million balance be paid by shareholders to bolster record keeping and vegetation management in high fire risk areas.

CPUC Regulators alleged the tree that leaned onto the line, triggering the fire, had been earmarked for removal but wasn’t removed due to PG&E’s poor recordkeeping.  PG&E disputed that interpretation and challenged the regulatory findings. The settlement does not resolve the dispute, but does require PG&E to better track trees to ensure those marked for removal are identified by a signed and dated record that includes precise geographic data. The $140 million settlement will also pay for more training, improved data management and investments in local fire safety councils and other fire education efforts.  In a statement, PG&E says it’s “a different company today” under CEO Patti Poppe, and outlined various initiatives during her tenure, including reconfiguring its equipment and a ten year plan to underground 10,000 miles of its power lines. The company says it is “working tirelessly to make our system safer every day.”  As for the specifics surrounding the fire, PG&E says it has accepted Cal Fire’s finding that a tree which fell onto its power line was the cause of the Zogg fire, and has resolved many of the civil claims.  “This settlement agreement allows us to continue focusing our time, resources and efforts to continue to make our system safer now, rather than on a hearing related to events several years ago,” the utility said. “Our objective is to focus on continuing to make things better for our communities.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The webinar series is expected to bring visibility to the research community in fire safety engineering and to promote much needed interactions between fire safety engineers, fire ecologists, atmospheric scientists, geographical scientists and beyond. Comprised of 31 videos, the series offers a 15-week, 3-hours-per-week format, and provides a basis for an educational course on wildland fires in an academic engineering program. The webinars address such topics as fire behavior, fire ecology, weather and atmospheric science, fuel ignition, flame spread, fire emissions, mitigation measures, and other topics.  The new wildland webinar series represents a community-level effort, featuring a diverse group of leading experts on wildland and wildland-urban-interface fires. The webinar videos feature 29 instructors, mostly from the U.S., Australia, and Europe.  “The problems posed by wildland fires and wildland-urban-interface (WUI) fires are at the interface between separate scientific communities, [including] fire safety engineers, fire ecologists and atmospheric scientists, and there is a need to share information and knowledge between these communities so that we can better coordinate efforts and collectively develop solutions to mitigate the negative impact of wildland/WUI fires on the human, ecological and climate systems,” said Arnaud Trouvé, Chair of the IFSC and Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland.

"fire","2023-05-04","Not Discerned","{""Fayetteville"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:16:43","[Episcopal News Service] A lightning strike – that actuarial “act of God,” as junior warden Mark Hamilton puts it – brought together the congregation of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Southern Pines, North Carolina, in a most unexpected way this year.  The storm damage wasn’t as remarkable as what it required of parishioners: When the lightning knocked out the church’s fire alarm system on Jan. 4, leaders at Emmanuel and the school on church grounds quickly mobilized a human fire watch, a rotation of more than 50 volunteers. They maintained 24-hour-a-day protection of the facilities from fire, a human alternative to the automated alarm system, while the old system was replaced.  “You never realize how thankful you are for what you take for granted until you lose it,” Hamilton told Episcopal News Service.  “We thought that might be a couple weeks, maybe three weeks,” Jill Connett, head of school at Episcopal Day School, said. Instead, repairs dragged on, and the human fire watch lasted nearly four months. “When this hit, I will tell you, it brought the church and school community together a little more.”  Now, the church and school are celebrating the end of the fire watch. Fire marshals certified that the newly installed replacement fire protection system was operational on May 4. A party for fire watch volunteers is planned for later this month, with matching T-shirts in the works.  “Some people said they’re going to kind of miss it, the form of exercise, the form of fellowship,” Hamilton said. But he made sure to add an obvious caveat: “I don’t think we’d want to do it forever.”  A fire watch works exactly like you might imagine. For each hourlong shift, at least one volunteer had to stroll the entire church campus and its six buildings. They span more than four acres across one city block in this central North Carolina community, about a 40-mile drive west of Fayetteville. It usually took volunteers about a half hour to complete one circuit, so twice an hour they would look in every room of each building, checking for signs of smoke or fire. And “if you did detect fire, your job is to call the fire department,” Hamilton said.  The initial emergency happened around 6 a.m. Jan. 4, when the lightning struck somewhere on the church campus. “I happened to be at the church when it hit, and it sounded like a bomb went off,” Hamilton said.  The power stayed on, but Connett reported that internet service in the school was down and the fire alarm system was beeping. The church founded the now-independent school in 1963, and the church and the school still share an interconnected fire alarm system.  Within a day or two of investigating the problem, the church’s fire security firm informed leaders that the old system couldn’t be fixed and had to be replaced. The fire marshal further informed them that, without an automated system, the church would have to form a fire watch to rely on human eyes, or else face closure because of the exposure to potential harm and property damage.  Under the emergency plan developed by Connett and the church’s wardens, the fire watch began on Jan. 6, with a logbook for each shift proving that volunteers were doing the checks required by the fire marshal. The school took responsibility for overnight coverage, largely with hired contractors, while the church recruited the volunteers who would walk the grounds during the day. Some school board members also took some shifts, and Connett covered nights when no one else was available.  “It almost became like a second job,” Connett said, describing how she and Hamilton coordinated shifts on a spreadsheet. “It’s been quite an ordeal.”  Because of the fire watch, no church services were cancelled, and no days of school were missed. The upgrades to the fire protection system cost more than $100,000, including hiring people to take overnight fire watch shifts, though all of that is expected to be covered by the church’s insurance policy.  Frank Holt, a vestry member who volunteered for fire watch shifts, told ENS he and others took the fire watch responsibility in stride. “It’s good exercise,” he said. “You can put in some miles.”  A few others brought their dogs with them. “We had some really great volunteer folks who really stepped up,” Hamilton said. And when the fire marshals came May 4 and said they could end the fire watch, it “was a great day.”  Connett agreed. “If you had seen my face,” she said, “it was like a huge weight was lifted.”  “What we kind of developed was a bit of a new community,” Hamilton said, a community of fire watch volunteers. “I think that was one of the benefits, one of the silver linings to this.”  After the fire system was restored, Connett spoke during the congregation’s annual day school Sunday service on May 7. Her message: “There are blessings that can come out of any circumstance.”  And the logbook? It got pretty thick after 17 weeks of fire watch shifts, but Hamilton sees no sentimental value in keeping it. He’s thinking of having it unceremoniously – and safely – burned.  – David Paulsen is a senior reporter and editor for Episcopal News Service.

The fire got out of hand in the remote area between the Whistle Stop Trail in West Farmington and the Irving Big Stop on Wilton Road, also known as U.S. Route 2 and state Route 4.  Forest rangers, with the help of the Farmington Police Department, found the person responsible. The transient who was not identified was issued a court summons on Wednesday for a civil violation of having a fire on the land of another without permission, Nelson said.  The summons has not yet been filed in the District Court. It will go to the District Attorney’s Office first. Without a name, which Nelson declined to reveal, it is difficult to know who the transient is. The person’s court date in a Franklin County court will be in August.  “We think it is important that (the community) know there is not a wildfire arsonist, as far as we know,” Nelson said.  It was made clear to the person not to set any more fires, he said. If more are set, the alleged firestarter could face criminal charges.  Advertisement  The state is in a precarious position for wildfires until more rain falls, Nelson said. Maine has had about 300 fires statewide, which is about half of the annual average, and it is only May.  “We will continue to patrol the area to check for illegal fires,” Nelson said.  The fire drew 45 firefighters from several departments. Tim “T.D.” Hardy, Farmington Fire Rescue chief, spotted smoke rising from the woods while he was at Aubuchon Hardware store on Wilton Road.  Firefighters had to make their own trail to get to the fire because there was no way in. They couldn’t get trucks to the scene and used utility terrain vehicles, hand tools and backpacks with water and pumps to put the fire out.

The fire started in the garage early on Mother’s Day.  A heat lamp being used to keep some chicks warm likely caused the fire.  “Opened up our back bedroom door and it was glowing orange,” Stephanie Oswald said.  She and her husband Ryan say you become grateful for what you do have – for the lives saved.  Stephanie’s mother was staying with them for Mother’s Day.  “She was in this back bedroom that went first, so she was about six inches from this back wall,” Stephanie said.  By the time everyone got out, the fire was raging – fueled by strong winds.  “There was already about ten-foot flames over the garage,” she said.  “Just the heat from that blowing wind, it was like a blow furnace,” Ryann explained.  The said nearby flood zones also slowed down the response from firefighters. Two of the three roads that lead to their home remain closed, but most of what they lost can be replaced.  “After we got family and pets out, we moved our vehicles out of the way and then we just literally watched it burn,” Stephanie said.  Now they, along with their two kids and five pets, are all staying in an area hotel. It’s tough but they said people are making it more bearable.  “You really find out who your friends are and we have got so many friends that we, we had no idea how cared for we could be,” Ryan said  After losing so much they’re seeing just how many people have their backs and it’s giving them some new perspective.  Stephanie said, “It absolutely does. I find my whole demeanor different. It’s a very humbling experience.”  The Oswalds say firefighters worked hard to keep the flames from reaching their next-door neighbor’s home.  They’re still working through insurance to see what will be covered. A family member has set up a fundraising page for them.  The Oswalds lost everything in the fire so family and friends set up a GoFundMe* account to help them rebuild their lives.  *KSL TV does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

"fire","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Swansboro"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:00:00","“Prior to the King Fire we’d had discussions about fire drills but after how we were affected we knew we had to act.” — Taffy Warner, Mosquito fire drill organizer  The Mosquito Fire Protection District is working to keep Swansboro and Mosquito fire ready by holding a community fire drill Saturday, 10-11:30 a.m.  For the third year in a row Mosquito Fire personnel and community volunteers will coordinate the drill at the Swansboro Airport. Firefighters, aided by support group members, will simulate the staging and set up of the airfield evacuation site.  In case of an actual emergency the airfield site is a holdout position where community members will gather if the region’s two main access roads — Rock Creek Road and Mosquito Road — are blocked during a fire. Residents are encouraged to participate in the drill; in addition to an evacuation site for people, there will also be a simulated evac site for large animals and RVs.  Mosquito’s unique geography with limited routes in and out poses a specific challenge if a fire were to come through. Though the limited means of egress has long been known, the King Fire in 2014 made it clear to the community that preparation for a worst-case scenario was vital, according to one of the drill’s organizers, Taffy Warner.  “Prior to the King Fire we’d had discussions about fire drills but after how we were affected we knew we had to act,” Warner explained. “Rock Creek Road was suddenly exclusively for the use of fire personnel and that was a big eye opener for us.”  Mosquito Fire Chief Jack Rosevear shared he thinks the drills are particularly important for fire response as they keep residents and first responders aware of what to do and plan around.  “The biggest priority is bringing information to the community,” Rosevear said. “Information (such as) always having at least two escape routes; we as people often stick to a routine and a certain way, but in an emergency those may suddenly not be an option. Knowing that the airfield is a temporary resource while roads out are blocked, giving MFPD time to help with initial preparation and firefighting before the higher authorities come in, managing that chaos, it’s important. We’re planning ahead for the worst-case scenarios, like if the fire would impact the area directly near the airport itself.”  The Community Emergency Response Team will aid in the drill, setting up road signs and directing the pretend-evacuees. Last year’s drill saw around 50 households participating, not counting the many volunteers, according to Warner, and it is hoped with the weather being cooler this time around more residents will get involved.  Efforts like this fire drill show why Mosquito has the distinction of being designated a Fire Wise USA community. The Fire Wise designation stems from the collective work by MFPD, Sawnsboro Country Property Owners Association, Mosquito Fire Safe Council and residents to reduce fuel loads and keep the area prepared.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS1kcmlsbC1oZWxwcy1tb3NxdWl0by1yZXNpZGVudHMtcHJlcGFyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  HARTFORD, Conn. — Ten adults and five children are displaced in Hartford's South End after police said a man intentionally started a fire inside a third-floor unit. Police have a suspect they're preparing a warrant for but have not identified the man they say started the fire.  Mother of two, Tamarra Ricketts, was doing her best to mask overwhelm Thursday after her first-floor unit was damaged by water and smoke. She was lying in bed with her family when her partner opened the door to find fire.  “It was a fight upstairs so they were fighting upstairs before all of this happened,” she said. “It was still a bunch of commotion, so he opened the door and that’s when he said the building’s on fire—get the kids.”  Most of her belongings inside this first-floor apartment on Wethersfield Avenue were damaged by smoke and water. All of it happened on her daughter Hinata’s 11th birthday.  “I was ok with the accident. But to know that somebody did this intentionally—not thinking about the other lives that lived in this building. It pisses me off.”  The family was gearing up for a backyard birthday celebration but is instead being assisted by the Red Cross, which is providing temporary housing for displaced families. Ricketts doesn’t know what she’ll do after that but says she’s going to celebrate her daughter’s birthday despite losing her home.  “I’m not going to let anything get us down. You know? We have God on our side so that’s all that matters.”  Authorities say the fire originated in a closet and was intentionally started by a man on the third floor.  “It seems like it was an attempt to harm himself or having a mental episode,” said LT Aaron Boisvert.  That man is being treated at the hospital for smoke inhalation.  “The good news is that some of these arsons go unsolved this one will not,"" added Boisvert.  But not all was lost. Twelve hours after families ran to the parking lot in terror, Ricketts found the stray kitten they rescued months ago wheezing under her daughter’s bed.  “Everybody was out alive and safe that was the most important thing. Material things can be replaced.”  Police have not charged the suspect at this time but said an arrest warrant is forthcoming.  The investigation remains active and ongoing. Anyone with any information regarding the case is asked to call the HPD Tip Line at 860-722-TIPS (8477).

New Zealand police started removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where multiple people were killed in Tuesday's fire. (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  Fire and Police investigators inspect inside the Loafers Hostel in Wellington, New Zealand, Thursday, May 18, 2023, following a fire that left several people dead in the early hours of Tuesday May 16. New Zealand police started removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where multiple people were killed in Tuesday's fire. (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police on Friday lowered the confirmed death toll from a Wellington hostel fire from six people to five, although they said they still haven’t finished searching the dangerous four-story building.  And in another development, a man charged with two counts of arson in connection with the fire made his first court appearance. He was not required to enter a plea and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance on June 19.  If found guilty, the man faces a maximum 14 years in prison on the charges. Police said they’re treating the case as a homicide investigation and could add more serious charges later.  Police Inspector Dion Bennett did not offer an explanation for why authorities had downgraded the death toll after they had put it at six since Tuesday, hours after the fire ripped through Loafers Lodge.  But he did say police have still not been able to search all areas of the building after parts of a roof and a floor collapsed in the fire and created piles of debris.  “The scene examination in itself, and in the third floor in particular, is quite dangerous,” Bennett told reporters. “And there are still parts we can’t cross.”  He said that urban search and rescue teams had been working with police to prop up sections of the floor as police inched forward with their examination. He said police have removed four bodies and hoped to remove the fifth soon.  The 48-year-old man charged with setting fire to a couch and to the lodge wore a black hoodie in court, waved his arms about and tried to fire his lawyer, local media reported.  Lawyer Douglas Ewen later told The Associated Press that the man remained his client. The judge granted the man temporary name suppression, a routine practice in the New Zealand legal system.  Police had earlier said there was a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The deadly fire ripped through the building at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or jumped from windows.  Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers, which are not required in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he’d asked his housing minister to investigate current building regulations to see if they need changing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLXdlbGxpbmd0b24taG9zdGVsLWZpcmUtYXJzb24tNjU3ODgxY2U1Mzc5MTlmZWI3OGI2MDllNGUxZTI1MGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(A) caring person and he just wanted to be with his children, his family.”  RELATED COVERAGE:  A crane operator spotted two people working on windows and tried to swing a basket over to them to help, but the smoke and fire made the rescue too difficult. Channel 9 has not confirmed that Demonte Sherrill and the other construction worker were those two people.  “We had two workers on the building on the left side that were on the sixth and seventh floor,” said Alexa Escobar, a construction worker. “Our crane operator let us know he could see two people on the balcony on the fourth floor, as well. We got the crane over there on the basket and tried to get them into the basket so we could get them down but that is when the smoke started to get blacked out and we had no view of them.”  Escobar told Channel 9′s Joe Bruno that her two co-workers always came in early and stayed late to provide for their families.  Massive fire breaks out in SouthPark area of Charlotte  A firefighter climbed up to help the crane operator safely climb down the ladder shortly before 11 a.m. The operator did not appear to be hurt.  Most of the flames were out by noon as firefighters continued to put out hot spots as several roads in the area remained closed.  At about 1 p.m., the Charlotte fire chief said two workers were missing.  First responders rescued 15 people.  The fire started on the second floor, according to witnesses.  A foam spraying machine caught fire and spread to the floors above, a construction worker told Channel 9.  The investigation into the cause continues.

"fire","2023-05-18","14:15:00","{""Kittery"", ""Maine"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 20:47:48","KITTERY, Maine — The remains of one person were found Thursday at the site of a five-alarm fire that destroyed Days Inn on Route 1 Bypass a day earlier, according to authorities.  Maine Fire Marshal Rich McCarthy and Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien announced the news of the fatality. The person was found on the site around 2:15 p.m. The person's identity was not immediately announced pending the state medical examiner's determination. Federal investigators and York police investigated along with Kittery police, officials said.  “The investigation into the origin and cause of this fire is still under investigation, but at this time we believe all persons involved are accounted for,” McCarthy said.  All of the employees at the Days Inn were accounted for, O’Brien said.  The fire marshal said investigators said they did not know the gender of the deceased person.  O’Brien noted the fire attack on Wednesday was set up on the south side of the Days Inn, a 200-foot-long strip dubbed the “A side” of the building. The body was recovered about halfway down the A side of the building, he said.  “It was definitely in the area of the biggest burn in the building,"" O'Brien said. ""It was the area my firefighters were trying to make an attempt to get to the first three or four minutes of the fire.”  The owners of the building are not being investigated, the fire marshal said. He added that at the time of Thursday’s press conference at the Gorges Road fire station, the Days Inn's owners had yet to be notified of the death.  Fire crews were working Thursday at the site of the 85 Route 1 Bypass structure, which burned to the ground in a blaze that was reported at mid-day Wednesday and not reported under control until just after 6 p.m.  Chief describes Days Inn blaze as 'firefighter's nightmare'  Fire crews attempted to access one room within the Days Inn after receiving a report someone might be trapped inside it. Despite making entry to the building, O’Brien said responders could not make it any closer than two or three rooms near that point, forcing them to retreat and O’Brien making the call for responders to take up a defensive mode.  When firefighters entered the building, they did so without any hand lines to put out the fire.  “The building is wood frame with furniture, lots of material that burned inside that building. It is a firefighter’s nightmare with individual rooms and hallways and everything else,” O’Brien stated. “Trust me when I say that I was extremely hesitant when I sent my firefighters into that building to go make that initial primary search, they went into that building with no protection.”  While there have been past code violations against the Days Inn, the fire chief noted they had been corrected in recent years. The hotel, however, has likely not been inspected in a few years, O’Brien said.  Never miss a story: Follow local news on the Seacoastonline mobile app or the Fosters.com mobile app  Sprinkler system was not required in 1956 building  Mutual aid crews from local city and town fire departments within a 20-mile radius of Kittery, from both Maine and New Hampshire, responded to the hotel built in 1956. It did not have a sprinkler system.  According to Kittery Town Manager Kendra Amaral, the hotel was built before state building code required sprinkler systems, though all fire alarms in the Days Inn operated soundly at the time of the fire, she said.  “If this was to be reconstructed today, it would have to have sprinklers,” she continued.  Since 1994, the Days Inn property, which town officials noted was last assessed at $1,512,959, has been owned by Kittery Motor Inn Inc. State records list Rohit Patel as the owner.  A proposal to redevelop the property and construct a new hotel had been filed with the town on May 5, less than two weeks ago. The plans, submitted by Kamlesh Patel, called for a new four-story, 107-room hotel to replace the Days Inn, which would have been demolished.  A member of the Patel family declined to speak Wednesday as the Days Inn burned.  Though town officials gave consideration to the idea of demolishing the remainder of the Days Inn, Amaral said that won't happen Thursday. An excavator was brought to the 85 Route 1 Bypass site to move some of the debris, which was smoldering in areas among the rubble, in order to help officials continue their investigation.  While the property will be altered by the excavator, Amaral said, it won’t be a full demolition process.  “That will give the property owner and their insurer their opportunity to investigate the site,” she said.  Kittery manager thanks firefighters  “Firefighters were working throughout the night on the site,"" Amaral said on Thursday. “They have worked tirelessly and safely throughout this entire emergency and we are grateful for the work that they do, for our public safety dispatchers, from the police department and from responding communities.”  In the wake of the death, the Kittery Fire Department will undergo a critical incident stress debriefing.  The death at the Days Inn marks the first fatal fire in Kittery since a mobile home burned about three years ago, O'Brien said.  “I have several young firefighters ... this would be their first fatal fire,” O’Brien said. “We will bring them in. We have a chaplain. We will sit down and go through the debrief and discuss it, and have them understand that things like this happen. They did everything they could. We’ll deal with that. We offer counseling. We have to wake up every morning and do our job.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYWNvYXN0b25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvb25lLWZvdW5kLWRlYWQtZGF5cy1pbm4tZmlyZS1raXR0ZXJ5LW1lLXJvdXRlLTEtYnlwYXNzLzcwMjMxNDg5MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WFIE) - A man was arrested on Thursday in connection with a fire that broke out at the old Pearl Cleaners building.  [Previous Story: Old Pearl Cleaners building destroyed by fire]  The Evansville Fire Department confirmed a person of interest had been detained. After interviewing the man identified as Charles Perrin, Evansville police say he knowingly and intentionally set a fire in the building.  “Some of the statements he made did affirm that he did purposely set the fire,” said EPD Officer Mario Reid.  According to an affidavit, Perrin told investigators he set the fire for self-gratification, as he got an adrenaline rush. EPD officials say Perrin also told investigators that he left and soon came back to admire his work.  “The difference with this investigation is that we had three different agencies working very closely together,” Officer Reid said. “But not only were we working with the other agencies including the Evansville Fire Department, but we were also making contact with people in the community.”  Investigators brought Perrin back to the scene of the crime after interrogating him. Police say Perrin agreed to walk through the timeline and location of where everything happened.  “They [firefighters] were able to dig into the area a little bit and just verify what he said,” EFD Division Chief Mike Larson said.  Perrin now faces charges of arson and criminal mischief.  “Just all we ask is if you see something, say something,” Larson said. “So that helps tremendously for pretty much all investigations.”  25-year-old Charles Perrin (Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office)  That fire happened Wednesday around 2 a.m.  Evansville Division Chief Mike Larson says the fire was considered “out” around 8 a.m. Wednesday.  After the fire was out, fire crews continued to put out hot spots until around 4 p.m. to make sure the fire didn’t rekindle.  That Pearl Dry Cleaners location had been in business for more than 100 years when it closed in 2017.  Police say the estimated value of the property is nearly $445,000.

"fire","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Evansville"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:19:35","EVANSVILLE – An Evansville man was arrested Thursday and accused of starting the fire that destroyed a historic Downtown building.  Charles James Perrin, 25, was booked into the Vanderburgh County jail on charges of arson and criminal mischief causing at least $50,000 in damages.  Perrin is accused of setting the blaze that gutted the former Pearl Cleaners building at 428 N.W. 3rd St. Once known as “Pearl Steam Laundry,” the structure had stood at the northern edge of Downtown Evansville for more than 100 years and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Evansville Fire Department spokesman and District Chief Mike Larson announced the arrest during a Thursday afternoon news conference alongside EPD Officer Mario Reid.  Reid claimed that after officers made contact with Perrin, he voluntarily came to EPD headquarters and reportedly admitted to setting the blaze. Police believe he was homeless at the time of his arrest.  At least one other media organization had obtained a probable cause affidavit in Perrin's arrest, but neither Evansville police nor the fire department made that affidavit available at the news conference.  According to Reid, the Indiana State Fire Marshal, which was investigating the cause of the blaze, ""presented"" the affidavit to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's office and the jail.  In addition, the Courier & Press requested detailed logs showing law enforcement and fire crews’ response to the blaze from Evansville-Vanderburgh Central Dispatch. The agency refused to release the records citing “an ongoing investigation.”  “Evansville Fire Department has not given us clearance to release anything pertaining to the incident as of yet,” operations supervisor Chase Collins wrote at 3:30 p.m.  More:Fire destroys former Pearl Cleaners site in Downtown Evansville  Who owns the building?  Like many large properties in Evansville, the Pearl Cleaners site is officially owned by a limited liability company.  According to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office, the building is owned through The Pearl Development LLC. Its registered agent is listed as Ryan Schulz: an attorney with Kahn, Dees, Donovan & Kahn.  After the Courier & Press reached out to Schulz on Thursday, Pearl Development LLC sent a news release. It was unsigned.  “Almost exactly one year ago we bought this historical landmark with the hopes of restoring it to usable commercial space,” the release states. “Our dream of revitalizing this iconic building and returning it to her former glory, (sic) is now ash.”  According to the Vanderburgh Assessor’s site, the LLC bought the property from the Korb family last June.  Reid confirmed during Thursday's news conference that police have talked to the current owner.  State documents and assessor’s records tie the property to Dr. Bachar Malek. When the Courier & Press reached out to him via an email address in state records, Malek said he was no longer associated with the property and that the current owners have been “trying to sell it for a while with no potential buyer.”  “The Pearl building last time I was there was completely empty only outside bricks and window left so you need to ask yourself, what got caught on fire?” he said.  More:Evansville's Lloyd Pool will be knocked down soon, two years after it closed  Were the property taxes paid?  No – at least according to assessor’s records.  That department’s website says property taxes were last paid in spring of 2022. As of Thursday, the owners owed more than $22,000.  There was no official word as of Thursday whether the building was insured.  The property was the target of a lawsuit  Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before. It was filed by WNIN – its former neighbor at the historic Carpenter House – stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  Pearl applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.  A plan filed in that lawsuit documented a 250-foot wide plume of groundwater contaminated with the solvent PCE on the Pearl Cleaners site.  'Pearl Steam Laundry' was on the National Register of Historic Places  According to a sign posted on the charred building, “Pearl Steam Laundry” was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 6, 1984 alongside several other Downtown buildings. It went on the state registry two years before that.  Now it’s gone.  What happens next?  Reid said the next step will be for code enforcement from the Evansville Building Commission to complete a inspection.  That report will then be turned over to the fire department to determine what needs to happen next.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9oZXJlcy13aGF0LXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLXBlYXJsLWNsZWFuZXItZmlyZS1pbi1ldmFuc3ZpbGxlLzcwMjI5ODI2MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WWLP) – Controversy Wednesday night involving the budget for the District 1 South Hadley Fire Department, after a small group of taxpayers voted to reject funding salaries.  Wednesday night that budget was approved to fund District 1, but before that vote, we heard concerns from both sides of this issue, “I’ve been doing this for 32 years and I have never heard of the fire department being unfunded,” South Hadley Fire Chief, Robert Authier told 22News.  The majority of District 1 residents voted to approve appropriating a total of $2.7 million to fund the personnel services account for the fire department. But before that vote, concerns were raised about transparency when it comes to numbers within the budget, as well as a proposed amendment changing the districts health insurance.  Back in April, residents in District 1 originally voted no on the budget during their annual meeting, which ultimately stripped funding for wages for firefighters and paramedics. Top fire officials also at the meeting, urging voters of what would be at stake to not pass this funding.  Richard MacKinnon, President of Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts told 22News, “It’s a disaster for public safety here in South Hadley, what’s at stake is whether they are going to have fire, ems protection, and other emergency response for incidents that they respond to every day and every night.”  Again, the budget was approved Wednesday night, and ways to avoid something like this from happening again was also discussed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYW1wc2hpcmUtY291bnR5LzItN20tYnVkZ2V0LWFwcHJvdmVkLWZvci1zb3V0aC1oYWRsZXktZGlzdHJpY3QtMS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3dscC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2hhbXBzaGlyZS1jb3VudHkvMi03bS1idWRnZXQtYXBwcm92ZWQtZm9yLXNvdXRoLWhhZGxleS1kaXN0cmljdC0xLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Jefferson County Sheriff Peter Barnett says that a deputy and state trooper responded to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6 p.m. to check on the welfare of someone who lived there.  The resident, later identified as 45-year-old Nathan Krump, allegedly brandished a weapon and fired one round toward the deputy.  Court papers say Krump yelled to police, “You’re going to get killed. Get off my property.” (See more about what police said in statements here.)  More shots followed.  “It was very chaotic to begin with. Shots fired in all different directions...going door to door, and getting the neighbors in the close proximity out of the area. And then when the gunshots started, moving more people farther distance away...We’re very, very lucky that everyone came out of this alive”  Krump allegedly went back into the home and the officers retreated to a safe spot to wait for backup.  The police officers’ statements say, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  They called for backup. More officers arrived and brought in an armored vehicle and involved Watertown police, sheriff’s deputies, and state troopers. Police later realized there was a bullet hole in the windshield of a state trooper’s car.  While police were fired upon, no officer fired back.  Sheriff Barnett says officers didn’t get a clear shot and he would have had to give the command, which he was never asked to give. Barnett says he’s very proud of officers’ restraint.  Police blocked off the road and the neighborhood was evacuated.  “Each step is methodical. Let’s make sure that when we move, it’s right and we don’t make any mistakes,” said Barnett.  Word quickly spread around Pillar Point about what was happening.  “All of a sudden you go from a resting posture to a defensive one. Your senses are sharpened and you just try to be ready for whatever,” said neighbor Richard Dodge.  Authorities set up a perimeter and members of the sheriff’s office and the Watertown Police Department tried to communicate with Krump.  A fire started and the house was quickly engulfed. Police said Krump tried to get away by riding a tractor. He was tased and taken into custody at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.  Krump was charged with first-degree attempted murder. He was jailed without bail following his arraignment in Watertown city court Wednesday morning.  Four members of the sheriff’s office were taken to Samaritan Medical Center for evaluation.  We know one deputy was hit by the tractor Krump allegedly used to allegedly flee the scene.  Another sprained his ankle while running under gunfire to evacuate a neighboring home.  The investigation by the sheriff’s office, state police, and country district attorney’s office is ongoing. Police say more charges are pending.  Also assisting were the Watertown Police Department, county Fire and Emergency Management, the 911 dispatch center, county fire investigators, Samaritan Medical Center, and fire departments from Brownville, Sackets Harbor, Glen Park, Chaumont, town of Watertown, Three Mile Bay, Black River, and Northpole.

(NEWS10) – Nearly a week with no rain and with winds expected to gust up to 35 mph, fire dangers throughout the Capital Region are still a concern. NEWS10 has more on the dangerous conditions.  There are three ingredients to make a fire. You need fuel, heat and oxygen. Officials say the current conditions are the perfect recipe to cook up a dangerous fire.  Art Hunsinger, former Clifton Park Fire Chief, says these ingredients are easy to spot.  “All the dry stuff that’s still on the ground, the leaves that were under the snow that are still sitting on the ground now blowing around, the pine needles that are left over that would be dry from last summer that are on the roadway. People are changing out to new mulch now that spring is here. Old mulch is so dry that a good heat on that mulch is just going to travel right down the mulch, and if it’s back to a building, it’s going to burn a building if we’re not careful,” said Hunsinger.  Stephen DiRenzio, Warning Coordination meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in Albany, says the conditions are perfect for out-of-control fires.  “Winds and the dry conditions are the two biggest problems. The winds keep things dry. And we’ve had no rain. And then yes, they can definitely push the fire along,” said DiRenzio.  DEC commissioner, Basil Seggos, says the entire state of New York is under a fire danger risk and released the following statement on Twitter:  “Fire danger is now high in all of New York State due to lack of precipitation. Please exercise extreme caution with campfires, any back yard burns, and discarded cigarette.”  “Driving around I still see people throwing cigarette butts out their car windows and this is probably not the time to do that,” said DiRenzio.  “It’s enough to start something like here on fire. A lit cigarette thrown out of the window in an area like this. If it’s hot enough it’s gonna start this stuff on fire and the wind is gonna take it,” said Hunsinger.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxMC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay11bmRlci1pbmNyZWFzZWQtcmlzay1mb3ItZmlyZS1kYW5nZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

One man was arrested on suspicion of obstruction after he tried to take firefighting equipment from a fire truck and pushed a police officer and firefighter, the sheriff's office said.  Electricity in the neighborhood was cut as the fire reached power lines at about 12:40 a.m.  Fire crews knocked down the fire in the early morning hours on Monday and recovered the body of a 14-year-old girl. Officials in Benewah County said they are not releasing the girl's name out of respect for the family.  The fire was caused by a damaged electrical cord to a chest freezer, according to a statement from Idaho State Fire Marshal's Office investigators.  Donations can be sent to P1FCU in the name of Renee Brusseau, the mother of the teenager who was killed. Funds can also be sent to Hodge Funeral Home in St. Maries, or to an account for Renee Brusseau on mealtrain.com.  The family living next door on South Fifth Street also lost their home as a result of the fire.

The fire, reported at 11:36 p.m. on the 1100 block of Arnold Street in Aberdeen, was initially called in as a structure fire with lots of smoke, according to an Aberdeen Fire Department news release.  Aberdeen and Hoquiam firefighters initially responded to the call, with the first personnel to respond seeing smoke and flames from a bedroom on the second floor rear of the apartment building, according to the news release. A second alarm was sent out, with Grays Harbor Fire District 2 and off-duty firefighters requested to assist.  An initial report that there was someone in the fire was countered by Aberdeen police officers, who were able to confirm the building was clear. Firefighters entering the building located and rescued a cat.  Firefighters were able to contain the fire to one apartment, and cleared the scene by 1:50 a.m. While responding to the fire, firefighters peeled off from the scene to respond to a CPR call nearby.  Two people were displaced from the building due to fire and water damage; all human and feline residents were reported safe and uninjured.  A total of 19 firefighters from the three departments responded to the fire, spread across five engines, two medical vehicles and one command unit.  The cause is currently under investigation.

We've had *** fire at the day's end. The building is roughly 240 ft by about 100 ft. It was heavily involved on arrival. The call came in at 123. We were on scene within the first four minutes. The second alarm was struck within two minutes after that. And the third alarm was struck about 15 minutes after that. We have now gone to *** five alarm fire which encompasses most of the Sea Coast community. It's *** good thing. We have mutual aid in this case and that's what it's for. The building is valued at $1.649 million by the con assessor. It is *** total loss. There is nothing left of the building. I'm sure you've been down there and had videos taken of it. All right. At this time, we have, we are still looking, we do not have all persons accountable. The fire marshal was called instantly into this and fire marshal and ATF are on scene starting the investigation and doing the interviews at this time. They, like I said, we don't know how many at this point in time we are possibly, we have one, possibly two that's unaccounted for the water supply was the fire outgrew our water supply instantly within the first five minutes of this fire. Hence, we had to bring extra tank trucks in from around the area. And I know at this point in time, we have, I believe I just talked to the water supply officer that we had 11 different communities with tank trucks here. So that helped us be able to get the water up. The building is *** non fire suppressed building. It is alarm panel. So everybody, the alarms were going off on arrival. Any questions you need to speak up because that's pumping. It's interesting. The wind is coming, the wind is coming from the northwest. The building fire actually started on the southeast side but just as soon as the start of the evacuation doors were left open underneath and the wind blew right through and blew that right up. One of our major concerns on arrival is *** 500 gallon propane tank that was was in impingement and it was at 70%. So most of our water and the initial stock was worried about that propane tank and *** situation of having that gas off. So we actually protect our firefighters that way. And I will, if I will, we made an interior search on this building. When we found out *** room number of *** possibility of an occupant, we made the interior search with no hand lines, no water lines to make an entrance into this, to see if we could make *** rescue and do *** search. They got to that the second floor, basically the first floor from roadside, they got to the second floor and got within two rooms of that and could not go any further. That was way, way, way too much fire. And *** point at that time, and they had to turn around at that point in time when they said that they could not make entrance into that room or anything close to that room. We went to *** strictly defensive mode to protect the firefighters. I have one firefighter with *** laceration and the other injury we have is from *** passer by that came to watch the fire. She went down and they're working with her. Now, not at this time when we got there, police were doing *** very good job of opening doors and getting and getting them out. We got there. There were actually people who had been out, were running back in to get shoes and things like that. So the police did an incredible job. The kid police needed *** pat on the back because I'm busy trying to figure out how I'm going to fight this fire and they're in there trying to get the people out before we got there. So have no idea how many people is there anything about this particular fire that made this especially challenging for your department. The wind, lack of water, wind size of the fire, the size of the building, lack of *** fire suppressed building. All those add up. Not yet. At this time it's under investigation. That's something that my town manager will deal with. She's *** public relations on this fire. That's something she can handle very well. I have heard the same things. Yes. The fire extended next door. I understand it's coming winds coming from the northwest. We have *** building that sits dead south to it. We have its York Hospital, physical therapy and also health club. There's *** gazebo out there that I think the roof kind of came off that much fire that quick, that much heat and that much Amber. We also had fires across the street that was said several woods, fires and brush fires extended, almost got into one side of the house and was quickly knocked down and we have had brand patrol all the way out to route one on state road and they've been knocking down fires out there in the woods and things like that. When will, you know, if this fire is clear of any casualties? When will we know? Not for *** while? Probably that that much destruction will be *** while before we get, figuring out where we're going, the investigation into this? Look like once you finally do put the fire out, I mean, what would be the next steps will be determining where we start to look. We have an idea. We will start to work with the fire marshals office. I have two marshals investigators on scene now and I understand the sergeant is on his way down at that point in time, we will direct efforts with the firefighters into those areas that have major concern for where we think there could be *** possibility of that issue. When was the last time your department's dealt with *** buyer of this size? Oh, that's *** good question. I mean, we deal with fires all the time. We've had *** very busy winter with structure fires. This one, this one is *** big one. I mean, years ago that burnt, I was *** firefighter when that whole place burned. But I guess we had *** major one down the village. It was maybe 15 years ago that went to *** third alarm, but most of our stuff is handled with *** single alarm, maybe two alarm fires, residential type buildings *** long time since I was at 1/5 alarm. Within *** half hour. Yeah. And this, we haven't had *** five alarm fire here in *** long time. Any idea how long the roads are going to be blocked for? I'm sorry, how long the roads are going to be blocked until we're done? You said 11 communities have tankers here. How many agencies? Well, I think if you go 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way you can grab everybody's name *** town. I'll tell you they're here. How many 16, approximately 16 communities, things like that? Any other questions? We will, we will have another briefing probably later tonight after we know more about what's happening up there. I would probably schedule that. Maybe. What time is it now? I know I'm not going to help your six o'clock news, so it will probably be closer to maybe eight, which will help your 11 o'clock news. So I'll let, let's plan another one for eight o'clock to figure out that person right there. My boss. He any other questions? Thanks for being so patient and I have to get back to work.

(Shutterstock)  NORWALK, CT — A number of elderly residents needed to be rescued after a fire broke out Tuesday night at a senior housing facility in Norwalk, according to fire officials.  In a news release, Deputy Fire Chief Steve Shay said an apartment fire was reported around 5:30 p.m. at a Cedar Street housing facility with two buildings containing 48 apartments in total and a shared common interior hallway. The fire began in one of the first floor apartments and quickly spread to the hallway siding, which caused heavy smoke to spread to all the apartments on the first and second floors, Shay said.  According to Shay, many elderly residents needed to be rescued from their apartments, approximately seven of which were removed from second floor windows on ladders. Others were rescued using interior stairways. As firefighters extinguished the blaze, crews quickly searched each apartment and removed residents from the building. They also rescued several pets, Shay said.  Police also banged on doors in the building to alert residents of the fire. Two residents were taken to a hospital while other residents were treated at the scene by emergency medical service officers and released, Shay said. The building was declared unfit for occupancy and the number of displaced residents is still being counted, according to Shay. The American Red Cross is providing housing for those affected.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2Nvbm5lY3RpY3V0L25vcndhbGsvZmlyZS1icmVha3Mtb3V0LXNlbmlvci1ob3VzaW5nLWZhY2lsaXR5LW5vcndhbGstZmTSAWtodHRwczovL3BhdGNoLmNvbS9jb25uZWN0aWN1dC9ub3J3YWxrL2FtcC8zMTM4MDIyNi9maXJlLWJyZWFrcy1vdXQtYXQtc2VuaW9yLWhvdXNpbmctZmFjaWxpdHktaW4tbm9yd2Fsay1mZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-05","Not Discerned","{""Kalispell"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 07:00:54","The Kalispell City Council pored over the preliminary budgets on Monday for the police, fire and ambulance, and parks and recreation departments.  The city’s proposed $15.5 million operating budget, up from $14.1 million last year, largely goes toward public safety and emergency services. The Police Department’s proposed budget totals $6.7 million, an 8.61% increase over the previous year’s budget, while the Fire Department’s proposed budget comes in at $4.8 million, a 4.89% increase.  The police department is looking to add three squad cars, including one undercover vehicle, according to a briefing by outgoing Chief Doug Overman.  Also included in next year’s additions is a Labrador retriever K-9 unit, which is expected to join the force in June.  The total proposed budget for the city comes in at just under $139 million. Last year’s budget totaled $115.4 million.  The budget includes some funds from opioid settlements, the reception of which was described as a surprise by City Manager Doug Russell. He anticipates the city to get around $16,000 per year for up to around 20 years, which he is hoping will be pooled with the portion received by the county to continue their joint co-responder mental health stabilization program.  The program is currently funded by a state grant, but local leaders have been looking for a revenue source to keep it going.  The fire department is looking to upgrade its radio systems and upgrade the chassis on a fire truck, according to Chief Dan Pearce.  The ambulance service is funded almost entirely by Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, according to Pearce, although low rates and unpaid bills mean that expenses are passed on to city taxpayers.  Mayor Mark Johnson described the roughly $800,000 funding gap for ambulance services that result as a “bitter pill to swallow,” but said that he thought it was a critical local service and preferred taxpayers footing the bill to a privatized ambulance service outside of the city’s control. He also pointed out that the projected number is less than the over $1 million that taxpayers paid only a few years ago.  The parks department's $4 million budget looks much the same as in previous years, with a previously ratified uptick in certain recreation and permitting fees boosting the department’s revenues.  New expenses for the department this year include higher prices on vehicle fuel and natural gas for pool heating, a new garage to maintain their fleet of vehicles, and roughly $20,000 to implement a new online reservation and registration system, according to department head Chad Fincher.  Fincher said the new program would minimize phone calls and printouts, as well as allow the community to sign up for department programs outside of regular business hours.  The city won’t adopt the final budget until property valuations come in from the state. Those numbers typically arrive in mid-August.  COUNCIL ALSO approved the final plat for the third phase of the Bloomstone development, which is located at 1070 Treeline Road on the north side of town. The project is slated to include 47 single-family homes on approximately 10 acres.  The council meets again on Monday, June 5.

Dan Krauth has the story.  The city of New York has seen an explosion in battery fires sparked by e-bikes and e-scooters. There have been 80 e-battery fires so far this year, including 60 injuries and nine deaths.  The city leads the nation in e-battery fires. Cities like Los Angeles and Seattle have reported about a dozen in the same time period. Other cities like Houston don't track them.  7 On Your Side Investigates had to look across the pond, to London, to find a major city that's experiencing a similar deadly rise in fires.  The British city has a similar number of electronic devices and fires reported this year.  ""It's our fastest growing fire trend,"" said Charlie Pugsley, the Asst. Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade. ""We're up to around one fire every two days from e-bikes or e-scooters,"" he said.  They've launched a media campaign called Charge Safe and they took action in the transit system. The city banned all e-bikes and scooters from the Tube where the flames and smoke could be especially dangerous, and people have no way to escape.  ""When you consider a metro subway system, if you have a fire there with open carriages, you have nowhere to go and so we fully understand and support Transport for London's decision there,"" said Pugsley.  There's a similar fire concern in New York City. The MTA took action recently. They didn't ban e-devices from trains. Instead, they banned people from charging them on board and the new policy states they have to be powered off.  ""In the news, every kind of incident that we heard of these things going on fire is when somebody's charging it so we can't have that happen on the train,"" said Gerard Bringmann, an MTA Board Member and part of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council.  The city's fire marshal said fires are not only limited to devices that are charging. The e-battery fire in a fatal Queens blaze last month was charging at the time it went up in flames. But the e-battery fire that leveled a Bronx supermarket was not.  ""It was not charging at the time, so it doesn't really fit the narrative that these things are always from delivery workers and they're charging all the time, it's not always the case,"" said NYC Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn.  With limited space, city leaders have been promoting the use of the devices as an alternative way of getting around. They've also expressed concerned they don't want to affect the livelihood of the more than 60,000 delivery workers who use the devices.  When asked who's going to police the new policy, Bringmann said it'll primarily be up to transit workers.  ""The first line of defense would be the conductors, if it's a problem and they get some push back they could at least get on the phone and have MTA police meet them at the next station,"" he said. ""There's certain risks that you take everywhere so we want to mitigate those risks as much as possible.""  City leaders have also been taking action. They passed a series of 5 new laws that include banning the sale of uncertified and unregulated batteries. Even though people can still purchase them online which is a problem for cities across the world.  ""Maybe we need to have something else down the line but this is a good start,"" said Bringmann. ""The MTA is not beyond tweaking this policy down the line.""  ----------  DO YOU NEED A STORY INVESTIGATED?

"fire","2021-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Georgetown"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:13:28","AUSTIN (KXAN) — A bill filed in response to a fire that took the lives of 75 dogs at a Georgetown pet resort in 2021 passed both chambers of the Texas Legislature this week.  House Bill 2063 is aimed at increasing safety requirements in Texas kennels. It now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, where it could be signed into law.  In September 2021, a fire broke out at the Ponderosa Pet Resort, killing 75 dogs belonging to 59 families. None of the facility’s staff members were on-site at the time, and there wasn’t a sprinkler system.  The City of Georgetown told KXAN after it happened that its fire code, as well as federal and state standards, did not require sprinkler systems for a facility of this type and size.  According to State Rep. James Talarico, after the fire, dog lovers and community advocates organized a petition that garnered more than 17,000 signatures from across the country calling for legislative solutions to keep dogs in kennels safe.  In response, Talarico filed House Bill 2063, which requires kennels to disclose to pet owners if a dog or cat will be left unattended or left in a facility that does not have a fire sprinkler system, according to the representative.  “The fire in Georgetown was absolutely gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families that lost their loving companions,” Talarico said. “After the fire, our community rallied together and called for action. Our legislation will ensure accidents like this never happen again in Texas.”  The bill awaits a signature from Abbott.  Owner turns grief into action  Leikyn Huckins boarded her two dogs, Gizmo and Drexel, at the Ponderosa Pet Resort before the fire broke out. She says she was heartbroken by the loss and shocked to learn about the standard for pet boarding facilities in the state.  “The problem is there just really isn’t any oversight. There are not really any regulations besides sanitation. So, you know, you really have to be your own pets advocate,” Huckins said.  Huckins since has led families that lost pets in the blaze to call for changes at the local and state level to improve pet safety at these facilities.  She has written and met with local leaders to call for city pet safety ordinances. She cites that Georgetown, Liberty Hill, Cedar Park, and Round Rock have all put measures protecting pets from similar dangers on their books.  Huckins said she is excited the bill has reached the governor’s desk and hopes it is the first of many that will secure pet safety in Texas.  “It’s all been a positive response. And I look forward to just continuing until I can get something passed on a state level that will include fire protection for these buildings,” Huckins said.  In the meantime, Huckins has taken to social media to highlight legislative changes and share photos and videos of the pets lost in the fire.

"fire","2023-07-25","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:58:57","Fire service leaders took to Capitol Hill last week to urge Congress to approve federal funding for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and essential fire grant programs that fire departments count on to keep their communities safe.  The IAFF, among other organizations, asked the U.S. House of Representatives to approve the reauthorization of funding for the USFA, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant and Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) programs. Congress, as part of the annual budgeting process, must approve funding levels for the federal government’s investment in fire safety.  Funding for the SAFER and AFG programs is slated to sunset at the end of the fiscal year. The House Subcommittee on Research and Technology held a hearing on future funding of the USFA and its grant programs, where top fire service officials called on lawmakers to step up and fully invest in the nation’s public safety.  “Every fire fighter takes an oath to protect their communities to the best of their abilities, and we hold that oath sacred. We ask the U.S. Congress to have our backs and not make our jobs even more dangerous by failing to invest in the staffing, training, and equipment we need. Our safety rests in your hands,” Kevin O’Connor, Assistant to the General President For Governmental Affairs and Political Action, said at the hearing.  AFG grants provide critical funding for essential equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training, and other resources to help fire fighters and other first responders protect the public and themselves from fire and related hazards.  Grants from the SAFER program are used to help local fire departments hire fire fighters to meet the staffing, response, and operational standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).  The International and its affiliates, working with supportive elected officials, have secured these grants to ensure that hundreds of fire departments across the nation stay safely staffed and properly equipped, even through economic downturns.  In April, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act, with a vote of 95 to 2. The Senate bill would reauthorize AFG and SAFER programs through 2030, while also authorizing $95 million for the USFA, an increase of $20 million from current levels.  The IAFF also supports providing the USFA with an additional $12.5 million to ensure the successful completion of their data management and IT upgrades.  Congress has consistently ensured the reauthorization of the SAFER/AFG program and the USFA by never allowing these fire service programs to lapse, despite any haggling over funding levels.  “Supporting our fire fighters and first responders has never been more essential than it is today. During COVID lockdowns, fire fighters, and other frontline workers carried the weight of a nation in crisis. Emergency services never stopped during lockdowns thanks to the brave men and women who showed up every day to put their lives on the line,” said Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology.  Collins said the COVID-19 pandemic led thousands of fire fighters, both career and volunteer, to exit the service, leaving many fire departments understaffed with fewer new recruits signing up for training.  Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell, U.S. Fire Administrator, addressed the hearing to provide lawmakers with an update on federal efforts to bolster the USFA and meet emerging challenges in the fire service, such as recruitment and retention, preparing fire fighters to handle the climate-driven increase in fires within the Wildland Urban Interface, establishing a comprehensive fire fighter cancer registry, and providing behavioral health assistance and suicide prevention initiatives for fire fighters.  Dr. Moore-Merrell also discussed the USFA’s mission to enhance its ability to collect, analyze, and report data from emergency calls to help improve public safety. This effort consists of redesigning the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) with a more modern, cloud-based data capture system, which will be referred to as the National Emergency Response Information System (NERIS).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlhZmYub3JnL25ld3MvaWFmZi11cmdlcy1ob3VzZS1sYXdtYWtlcnMtdG8tYXBwcm92ZS1mZWRlcmFsLWZpcmUtc2VydmljZS1mdW5kaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-03-29","Not Discerned","{""Blue"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:17:03","WASHINGTON — United Launch Alliance expects to conduct a static-fire test of its Vulcan Centaur rocket in several days, but the timing of the vehicle’s first launch will depend on the outcome of an ongoing investigation of a test anomaly.  ULA rolled the Vulcan rocket from the pad at Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, back to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) building on May 15. The vehicle had been on the pad for several days to conduct a tanking test and practice countdown.  Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said in a May 15 tweet that the company needed to “adjust a handful of parameters and set points” for the vehicle before performing what the company calls the Flight Readiness Firing (FRF), a static-fire test of the booster’s BE-4 engines on the pad. That work would be done while the rocket is back in the VIF.  In a May 16 interview after a speech at the Humans to Mars Summit here, Bruno said that work involved a combination of minor adjustments to both pad infrastructure and the vehicle. The former includes adjusting set points in a hydraulics system and changing the rate of liquid oxygen flowing into the rocket to top off tanks after recycling the countdown. Those adjustments, he said, could be done in software.  On the booster, he said there was an issue during the pad tests with flowing gas through spark torch igniters used to ignite the BE-4 engines. The gas is intended to make sure that the igniters are dry and can light, but the timing was off. That could involve some combination of adjustments on the rocket and ground infrastructure.  “There’s nothing wrong with the engines,” he added. “We’ve lit the engines a zillion times on the test stand at Blue,” a reference to test stands by engine manufacturer Blue Origin.  That work is done more easily inside the VIF, he said, where there is protection from the weather and where work can continue when other range operations might cause a halt to work on the pad.  Once those fixes are complete, Bruno said the vehicle will roll back out to the pad for the FRF. “It’ll be a few days,” he said of the timing of the test, which will depend on both when the work is complete and getting approval from the range for test, which is required since it is considered an “energetic” event.  Assuming there are no problems with that firing, the last major obstacle before launch is completing an investigation into a March 29 incident during testing of the Centaur upper stage. Hydrogen leaked from the structural test article and ignited, creating a fireball.  Bruno said the investigation was delayed because it took time to remove equipment on top of the Centaur, such as a payload adapter and mass simulators for the payload and payload fairing. Only in the last week and a half was ULA able to get access to the dome section of the Centaur where the leak was located.  Engineers have isolated a small region on that dome where they believe the leak came from, as well as the likely ignition source. “I’m pretty confident that we’re going to find the leak, and once we find the leak we’ll know if we have to take corrective action or not on the flight vehicle,” he said.  If ULA doesn’t need to modify the Centaur, that would allow the Cert-1 launch to take place in early summer, he said. “If we do, it could take longer, but I don’t expect it to get out of the year.”  Complicating launch scheduling is the requirement for the primary payload, the Peregrine lunar lander from Astrobotic, which has a launch window that is open only for about four to five days per month. Before the Centaur test anomaly, ULA had been working towards a May 4 launch, which Bruno said in February was the start of a window about four days long.  “In the big picture, it’s a steel pressure vessel and it had a leak,” he said. “We’re going to understand it and we’re going to fix it. It’s not like other things that go wrong on rockets like engines that blow up. It’s just a piece of structure. We’ll fix it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91bGEtcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci12dWxjYW4tY2VudGF1ci1zdGF0aWMtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  TONOPAH, Ariz. — A popular Tonopah watering hole is no more after it was the victim of another early morning fire on Wednesday, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said.  Tin Top Bar & Grill appears to be a ""total loss"" after it was fully engulfed in flames near the intersection of Wintersburg Road and Salome Highway, deputies said. No one was injured and officials are investigating what started the fire.  Many in the community heard about the fire in the early morning hours as it was still in flames, including Michelle Davis who got a call from her friend around 12:30 a.m.  ""I could actually see the flames from my backyard,"" Davis said.  Joe Berg, who's worked at the Tin Top Bar & Grill for years, and lives down the street, was there as the restaurant burned.  ""It was engulfed pretty bad,"" Berg said.  The signs on the side of the Tin Top with white background and red and black letters are now burned, the roof collapsed and chairs from the patio are left charred.  ""Just kind of devastating,"" Berg said. ""All those signs – I freehand painted all those signs myself.""  It's a place that community members say was more than just a restaurant or a place to grab drinks.  Berg talks about Halloween parties, big haunted houses, Christmas light displays and much more as part of the joyful moments that the Tin Top was the backdrop for.  ""I live right down the road and I hear karaoke out here – some of them were great, I give them all props. Some of them sound like they’re getting squeezed by a duck,"" Berg said with a laugh. ""But it’s great, we all have fun, we have a blast. We had so much fun here.""  Davis called the Tin Top the ""Tonopah Cheers.""  ""Everybody knew everybody,"" Davis said.  She started going to the Tin Top when she moved out to Tonopah almost four years ago.  ""We have a women's group out there and we would use the upstairs area and do crochet nights every other Tuesday night and they do paint nights and just all kinds of stuff,"" Davis said.  But the restaurant was also a place holding difficult moments too.  ""I lost my wife in the parking lot three years ago,"" Berg said. ""This place means a whole lot to us, a whole lot.""  The difficult moments are now coming for the more than two dozen staff members who worked at the restaurant. Davis started a GoFundMe for them.  ""Just knowing that they can't just go down the street tomorrow to Applebee's or somewhere else – if they chose to stay in that line of work,"" Davis said. ""It's going to be a rough patch for everybody.""  The current owner told 12News off camera he's owned the restaurant for 17 years and isn't sure what the next steps are for the Tin Top.  But the community is hoping the fire won't mean the end for the bar and grill.  ""Hopefully we can bring it back again,"" Berg said.  It's not the first time the restaurant property has faced fire. In its more than 30 years of operation, Tin Top has seen at least two other fires on the property, according to its website.  ""The Tin Top Bar & Grill has been many things through time,"" the restaurant's website said. ""Buildings on this property have burned to the ground at least twice.""  The restaurant thanked the community for its support during this time in a Facebook post.

"fire","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Northampton"", ""Northamptonshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:41:13","The Bombyx Center in Florence remains the home of the Florence Congregational Church, a Jewish Reform congregation and a preschool, while also hosting live music and offering space for multiple community groups and activities. Gazette file photo  Cassandra Holden, executive director of the Bombyx Center in Florence, speaks last fall to a group from the Mass Cultural Council and MassDevelopment during their visit to the region. Gazette file photo  NORTHAMPTON — Staff and board members from the Bombyx Center for Arts & Equity are meeting this morning with city officials to try to get answers for what Bombyx says is a bewildering turn of events: a sudden shutdown of live indoor music ordered by a city fire inspector.  The shutdown order, issued May 11 by Capt. Mark Curtin, fire prevention officer for the Northampton Fire Department, forced Bombyx to cancel a weekend festival May 12-13 called Collider! Fest that featured multiple musicians, music workshops, a record fair, and some catered food service.  Cassandra Holden, Bombyx’s executive director, and Elizabeth Dunaway, president of the nonprofit group’s board of directors, estimate this sudden cancellation has cost the Florence center and its partners for Collider! Fest about $15,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. (The musicians were all paid and tickets were refunded; some of the musicians were able to play at Hawks & Reed Performing Arts Center in Greenfield the evening of May 12.)  It’s also not clear when live indoor music may resume at Bombyx; shows are currently scheduled for both Saturday and Sunday. A show on Tuesday night by one of the center’s resident community music groups, the Bombyx Brass Collective, was moved to the lawn outside the center.  More concerning, Holden and Dunaway say, is the fact that the shutdown order, apparently made because of Curtin’s concerns about inadequate fire prevention measures at the venue, comes after months of regular interaction with city officials about the center’s ongoing renovation efforts — during which those same officials have consistently approved their plans, Holden said.  “This whole situation is very confusing,” Holden said during an interview Tuesday at Bombyx. The shutdown order “seemed very random, and we don’t understand where it came from.”  “We’re really hoping to get some clarity at the [Thursday] meeting,” Holden said.  That meeting has been organized by Alan Wolf, chief of staff for Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra, and is expected to include members of the city’s Fire and Building departments and other officials including city councilors.  “We want to work with Bombyx to be sure they can be open and operate in a safe manner, in compliance with all state and local codes,” Wolf said in a phone call this week. “We all want them to succeed.”  But Bombyx staff believe the center has been operating in a safe manner since opening in the fall of 2021, and they say both the city’s building inspector, Jonathan Flagg, and city planner Carolyn Misch have reviewed and approved all their plans so far. Nor has the Fire Department expressed any previous concerns to them about a lack of fire prevention measures, they say.  In a letter they sent to Curtin and several other city officials earlier this week, Holden and Dunaway wrote that part of the issue seems to be a difference in how Bombyx staff regard the center and how Curtin viewed it when he came by last week. Staff view Bombyx as a community arts center that also hosts live music, while Curtin appeared to view the space as a nightclub during his inspection.  The Bombyx Center is located in Florence’s historic Congregational Church, whose parishioners continue to use the sanctuary. The center is also home to the Beit Ahavah Reform Synagogue and the Cloverdale Preschool,while numerous other local groups, such as the Young@Heart Chorus, use the facility on a regular basis.  Art exhibits, public talks, educational workshops and other events are also a big part of the mix. This evening, for instance, Northampton’s International Language Institute is holding an annual event there, Giving Voice, that recognizes its immigrant students.  “We’re really like 33 Hawley,” said Dunaway, referring to the space downtown operated by the Northampton Community Arts Trust. “We’re a community arts and cultural center that also hosts live music. We’re not a nightclub. We don’t sell alcohol.”  According to a pie chart the Bombyx Center prepared as part of their letter to city officials, live music represented 4.4% of the center’s activities during the past six weeks of facility use.  The ‘shutdown’  Yet when Curtin came unannounced to Bombyx on May 11, Holden and Dunaway say, he referred to it as a “nightclub.” Curtin said he had come in response to a complaint, the two women say, though he did not say what the complaint was about or who made it.  After making what Holden says was a brief examination of the Bombyx sanctuary, where both live music and religious services take place, Curtin cited a lack of a sprinkler system and told Holden the center would have to reduce its capacity to 100 people (the center can accommodate a little over 300).  Then, Holden says, Curtin said the capacity would have to be reduced to 50 people, before “leaving abruptly saying that Bombyx was ‘shut down’ immediately,” as she and Dunaway outlined in their letter to Curtin and other city officials.  It was not clear at that time whether that meant the center was shut for all activities, Holden said. She noted that the the Rev. Marisa Egerstrom, the Congregational Church minister, and Rabbi Raquel Shira Kosovske of Beit Ahavah had to call the Fire Department separately to determine that they were, in fact, still permitted to host services in the sanctuary.  Curtin did not respond to a phone message from the Gazette. Flagg also did not respond to a phone message.  For his part, Wolf, who’s serving as the point person for the city’s overall response to the issue, said Bombyx falls into something of a gray area in defining exactly what it is. “Is it a nightclub? If it is, it needs a sprinkler system.”  He added that there’s been concern in New England about club safety ever since the notorious fire in 2003 at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, in which a pyrotechnic display at a rock concert touched off a fast-moving blaze that killed 100 people and injured another 230.  “Ultimately the city’s goal is to keep everyone safe, and it’s up to businesses to be in compliance with all building codes and requirements,” Wolf said. “The city does its best to keep up with all of this.”  He added, “We want [visitors] to Bombyx to be safe, and we want Cassandra to be able to keep doing what she’s been doing.”  In their letter to city officials, Bombyx detailed a long list of renovations and improvements they’ve made to the property since beginning its management there in the fall of 2021, including electrical upgrades, repairing the sanctuary floor, and (currently) installing air conditioning. The letter says they’ve also received a $79,000 grant to install fire suppression and ventilation systems, as well as plumbing upgrades, in the center’s kitchen.  All told, the center has received almost $350,000 in grants so far to improve its facilities, Bombyx says.  In addition, Holden said it’s Bombyx’s understanding with the city that a full sprinkler system in the sanctuary is not required until they fully complete their purchase of the building from the Congregational Church — the agreement calls for this to be done by 2028 — or if they construct any major additions to the existing buildings.  “We are making steady improvements, but we can’t do them all at once,” she said.  Holden and Dunaway acknowledge the center has fielded some complaints about noise and parking during live music events. But they say they’re working to address those issues and don’t believe they’re connected to the current shutdown order.  In the end, Holden says she hopes the city looks favorably on their effort to help the local economy by bringing people to the area for live music, and to serve as a community resource for all the different groups that use the center.  Bombyx, Dunaway noted, has also been buoyed by wishes of support from residents and elected officials — and also “inundated” by questions of what happened last week, which is why the center has now spoken publicly about the issue.  “I think we all want to make this work,” Holden said. “Hopefully [the meeting] will show us a path forward.”  Steve Pfarrer can be reached at spfarrer@gazettenet.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYXpldHRlbmV0LmNvbS9Cb21ieXgtQ2VudGVyLXN0YWZmLXNlZWstYW5zd2Vycy1hZnRlci1Ob3J0aGFtcHRvbi1maXJlLW9mZmljaWFsLWFicnVwdGx5LWNsb3Nlcy10aGUtRmxvcmVuY2UtYXJ0cy1hbmQtY29tbXVuaXR5LXNwYWNlLTUxMDA3OTMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This fire is not only disappointing to the owners, but their faithful customers who refer to the restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood.  “It really livens up the neighborhood to see so many people coming back and forth,” customer Junius Sicard said.  The restaurant was opened by Johnson and his cousin, Anglee Brown, seven years ago after having a successful food truck, which they may return to during rebuilding to continue serving the community.  “Just gotta stay in good spirits ya know, things happen,” Johnson said, “We just gotta keep your head up and keep moving, that’s the Cuzzo’s way.”  (WATCH BELOW: Red Cross helps 20 displaced residents after southwest Charlotte apartment fire)  Red Cross helps 20 displaced residents after southwest Charlotte apartment fire  ©2023 Cox Media Group","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZWFybHktbW9ybmluZy1zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtZmlyZS13ZXN0LWNoYXJsb3R0ZS1jbG9zZXMtdHVja2FzZWVnZWUtcm9hZC9ZWTRPU0RMUjZWQ1FER1pBMk5WUkFGSTJOTS_SAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NvY3R2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Vhcmx5LW1vcm5pbmctc3RydWN0dXJlLWZpcmUtd2VzdC1jaGFybG90dGUtY2xvc2VzLXR1Y2thc2VlZ2VlLXJvYWQvWVk0T1NETFI2VkNRREdaQTJOVlJBRkkyTk0vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The deal must be approved by Durango City Council and the DFPD board of directors. A special meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 30 at the fire district's Station 1 at 142 Sheppard Drive.  If approved by both boards, the two entities would trade ownership of the buildings and the city would additionally pay $3,586,275 to the fire district, a city news release says.  The city and DFPD hired Bob Allen, of the appraisal group Allen & Associates, to determine fair market values of the properties. In the news release, he said the city’s offer of $3.6 million is fair based on several factors.  The Colorado Department of Transportation’s appraised value of River City Hall is $3.9 million. The fire district paid $6.9 million for the 9-R Administration Building and the attached Big Picture High School facility in December 2021, he said. And parkland on the River City Hall property will be maintained by the city.  Hal Doughty, DFPD fire chief, said the city will need to subdivide the property because a portion of the Animas River Trail and a small park, Veterans Park, are not included in the trade and will remain city property.  Although DFPD’s Station 2 currently resides at River City Hall, for years Doughty has said the facility is in poor shape and needs major upgrades. The fire district purchased the 9-R administration building with the intent of moving its downtown facility there, but plans changed after determining that the facility is too large to house a fire station alone.  A joint police and fire station was considered, but in January Doughty said River City Hall is the best place for a new and improved station, and also noted bringing Durango Police Department to River City Hall wouldn’t be possible without major disruptions to nearby businesses.  Meanwhile, the city was eyeing the 9-R Administration Building as the potential home for a new civic center.  “Oh, man, I'm excited,” Doughty said about the deal. “But I'm also, you know, cautiously optimistic.”  If city and fire officials approve the proposed trade, the fire district will be able to finally replace its downtown fire station and improve working and living conditions for firefighters. And the city will be able to upgrade into a bigger facility at the 9-R Administration Building, he said.  “Which they're desperately in need of because they're out of room at the current City Hall,” he said. “Their police station is in such bad shape.”  ×  He added the deal will be a “huge benefit” to the community, which is the main point of exploring options to begin with.  José Madrigal, city manager, said he is also excited with the deal and the opportunity to preserve the 9-R Administration Building for historical purposes and its continued use. But, there is a long way to go.  If City Council and the fire board approve the trade, public input hearings about design features of the 9-R Administration Building will be needed, he said. But the initial deal is a nice and necessary first step.  Doughty said the fire district and the city likely would have preferred to get more money or value for their respective properties, but the proposed building swap and payment by the city are signs of a fair negotiation.  “Each one of us absolutely believes that we can improve our service to the community by moving in the direction of acquiring these new properties,” he said. “And I think that we have the opportunity to be absolutely transparent with the public on exactly how that looks now that the negotiations (are finished).”  In something resembling a big game of musical chairs, the city, fire district and school district are trying to rotate offices and staff into buildings occupied or owned by one another.  The fire district plans to stay at River City Hall, but the city wants to move out of City Hall and relocate offices from the Carnegie Building across the street from the 9-R Administration building at 201 East 12th St. 9-R administrative staff was originally scheduled to vacate in July, but that didn’t happen, and the school district currently leases the building from DFPD for about $120,000 per year. It hasn’t yet identified a new facility, Doughty said.  But the school district is considering at least one option. Madrigal said the school district has expressed interest in moving into the Carnegie Building across the street.  “There’s a lot of moving pieces with this,” he said. “The second step is the long-discussed, if possible, Buckley Park and Carnegie Building (swap).”  cburney@durangoherald.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2R1cmFuZ28tYW5kLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtcmVhY2gtZGVhbC10by1zd2FwLTktci1hZG1pbi1idWlsZGluZy1hbmQtcml2ZXItY2l0eS1oYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WBTV) - A huge fire destroyed a dental office in Huntersville on Wednesday night.  It happened at the Riccobene Family Dentistry on busy Gilead Road just about two blocks east of Interstate 77 and it kept firefighters busy for hours. Flames were shooting through the roof of the dentist office which was under renovation  Around 50 firefighters battled this fire from the inside and from above. Then, crews spent several hours putting out hot spots and making sure it didn’t reignite.  That fire was already raging when firefighters got the call around 9:30 p.m. They called in extra help and Medic was on standby.  Once they got the fire under control, Huntersville Fire spokesperson Bill Southard talked about some of the challenges they faced.  The fire started late Wednesday night.  “We were way behind as soon as we arrived. Crews worked extremely hard; we had some water supply issues initially due to traffic in the area,” Southard said. “I can’t tell you how amazing our part-time volunteer firefighters did today. A lot of people showed up - close to 50 firefighters, some from off duty - and they aggressively fought this fire.”  According to the Huntersville Fire Department, one of the problems crews encountered was people kept driving over their hoses which slowed the water supply. One of those hoses was even ruined.  *PLEASE READ* One thing we encountered this evening. TWICE this evening, vehicles drove over our large diameter hose. One hose was ruined & had to be replaced mid-fire. These hoses are what keeps water in the hands of FF’s actively fighting fire & is a serious safety issue. pic.twitter.com/Qa2uBDxpKI — Huntersville Fire (@Huntersville_FD) May 18, 2023  The dental office is right next to an O’Reilly Auto Parts store.

Klamath County Fire District No. 1 and Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue will each receive $1.5 million dollars. OSFM says these two agencies were selected to receive funding due to the increased risk of wildfire near their communities.    Over the last few decades, these regions have experienced more wildfires that have increased the demand for firefighters. This investment will help to lessen that need and provide highly-trained personnel to stop fires before they have a chance to grow and impact communities.  OSFM says there has been a decrease in the number of career and volunteer firefighters entering the field. With this investment, the hope is to create an accessible pathway into a fire career and increase diversity and inclusion.  “The fire service recognizes that our greatest asset is our people, and we are committed to building, developing, and nurturing the skills of these new apprentices while unlocking their full potential and preparing them for long and healthy careers,” Klamath County Fire District No. 1 Chief Greg Davis said. “Through targeted training initiatives, mentorship programs, coaching, and career progression opportunities, we aim to create a dynamic and engaged workforce that is equipped and capable to tackle any challenge the fire service is faced with.”    The apprenticeship program provides participants with 4,000 hours of training over two years. Apprentices learn the skills of basic emergency medical technician (EMT), applicable college-level math and writing coursework, and on-the-job training. During the program, apprentices also increase staffing at local fire agencies.  Funding for this program was made possible through Senate Bill 762, which was signed into law in 2021. This investment is part of a multi-pronged approach Oregon is taking to strategically invest in responding to and preventing wildfires. Learn more about the OSFM’s wildfire investments .    OSFM has also allocated $6-million in funding for the 2023 Wildfire Season, where local fire agencies can apply for up to $35,000 to hire additional firefighters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va3BpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vcmVnb24tc3RhdGUtZmlyZS1tYXJzaGFsLWFubm91bmNlcy0zbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWludG8tZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXItYXBwcmVudGljZXNoaXAtcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The store was evacuated and staff gathered in the parking lot, while a barrier of shopping carts was placed in a row across the parking lot entrance.  Fire Capt. Taylor Fogle of the Martins Ferry Volunteer Fire Department Ladder Company said the fire was doused quickly.  “We were dispatched on report of a possible structure fire, multiple calls,” he said. Dispatchers then clarified the fire was on the outside of the store.  “The fire here was typically on the outside. There was nothing involved in the structure itself. The structure is completely safe and sound. With the outside here, we’re not sure what caused it as of this point. We’ll be doing an investigation,” he said.  Fogle said the flames caused soot to form on one side of the building, but the fire itself did not damage the store. He said no injuries resulted, and they were able to extinguish the fire shortly after arriving.  He did not speculate about what was burning but said it was not a dumpster fire, although the dumpster was nearby.  “The garbage compactor was not involved. There was something here that was on the ground, we’re not sure what that is. We spoke with the manager. They’re going to be doing their own investigation to figure out what was there and what could have caused it,” he said.  Fogle pointed out a nearby exterior store camera, which would have recorded anyone who might have deliberately set a fire.  Kroger staff at the site made no comment, but the store was soon able to reopen. Responding police officers said the store was cleared as a safety precaution.  The Kroger corporate office did not respond to a request for comment.  The smoke was visible to residents, patrons of nearby businesses and motorists on Interstate 70 and Ohio 7.  Neighborhood resident Debbie Chesnick saw the early stages of the blaze.  “It was just a bunch of billowing black smoke that came out in puffs, and it kept getting blacker and blacker,” she said. “It was pretty scary for a minute there.

"fire","2018-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:24:00","Victims say they barely escaped the 2018 wildfire after the U.S. Forest Service decided to let the fire burn and failed to tell them to evacuate.  DENVER (CN) — Victims of the 2018 Roosevelt Fire on Wednesday asked the 10th Circuit to revive their lawsuit claiming the U.S. Forest Service considered resource benefits as a factor when it decided to let the manmade fire burn.  Starting on Sept. 15, 2018 in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, the manmade Roosevelt Fire burned Lincoln and Sublette counties of Wyoming, consuming 25,000 acres and destroying nearby property.  Steven Knezovich and his son were hunting in the area when the fire broke out, but forest rangers failed to adequately warn them to evacuate. When the fire rapidly grew, the men suffered burns and barely made it out alive. Several local property owners joined the Knezovich family in suing the federal government on Sept. 23, 2021.  A federal judge dismissed the case on Oct. 11, 2022. Knezovich appealed.  In its reply brief, the Forest Service argued it did not immediately tend to the Roosevelt Fire because the area was not easily accessible and therefore unsafe for firefighters. In addition, the Forest Service’s helicopter, needed to observe the area before entering, had been committed to another fire.  But Knezovich's attorney, Quentin Rhoades, contends the Forest Service wrongly factored in the resource benefits of letting the fire burn. Rhoades practices with the the Missoula firm Rhoades and Erickson.  “The problem is that it’s part of an overall bigger picture and that’s discretionary,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Nancy Moritz, appointed by Barack Obama. “You’re not suggesting that that initial decision was made based only on that factor.”  Rhoades maintained the federal government is prohibited from considering resource benefits at all when managing a manmade fire.  “What you can’t do as a firefighter in this case is say 'the fire might do the forest a lot of good if we just let it burn' — your judgment does not apply in this context,” Rhoades argued. “That’s not an abuse of discretion, it’s not a mistake, it's flatly prohibited.”  Department of Justice Attorney Levi Martin asked the court to follow the lead set by the 2016 Hardscrabble Ranch case and affirm. But the Hardscrabble case hinged on the Forest Service following a decision checklist, not avoiding a certain factor.  “When you’re directed to not consider something, that removes it, and that seems different from Hardscrabble to me,” observed U.S. Circuit Judge Veronica Rossman, appointed by Joe Biden.  Martin countered that any differences were minimal.  “It’s too fine a point to make a difference,” Martin said. “It’s the flipside of the same coin.” He added: “The fire was in a dangerous location, they couldn’t access it and they didn’t have the resources to address it,” Martin reminded the court.  But the panel wondered whether the question was best answered by a jury.  “Might they have fought this fire the exact same way, isn’t that a jury question,” prodded U.S. Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich, appointed by George W. Bush.  Knezovich requested the case be revived for further discovery.  Asked for comment, Forest Service press officer John Winn said in an email, “We respect the court's decision and we encourage all visitors to remember to check for current fire risk, weather events and be well prepared. The safety of visitors and adjacent communities to national forests is one of our top priorities.”  The court did not indicate when or how it will decide the case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9yb29zZXZlbHQtZmlyZS12aWN0aW1zLWFzay0xMHRoLWNpcmN1aXQtdG8tcmV2aXZlLWNsYWltcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcmVzdC1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The youngest is a newborn.  Example video title will go here for this video  TACOMA, Wash. — A Tacoma family of 11 sifted through what’s left of their belongings after the home they lived in was destroyed in a fire nearly one week ago.  “We put pieces of what we can together but even anything we are able to pull out is so smokey and damaged and charred,” said Destany Droge, who escaped from the burning home.  Sentimental pieces like Destany’s late grandmother’s Bible were destroyed. But on May 12, what matters most barely made it out.  “Live every day like it's your last because you never know. We were two seconds away from not making it out of there,” Doge said.  Around 4:30 a.m. on May 12, while everyone was asleep, Kaihla Koroshes woke up to flames.  “I saw some light and it took me a minute to realize it wasn’t the sunrise. I realized it was a fire and I ran out of my room and up the stairs and screamed for all of them to get up and the house was on fire,” said Koroshes.  Eleven people were inside the home including seven kids, the youngest is a newborn. Koroshes went back multiple times to get everyone out, including 15-year-old Kayli, but the home was engulfed.  Kayli was able to get the window open and her mother Destany told her to jump.  “I just kept screaming and no one could hear me. I laid there and I couldn't breathe so I opened the window and jumped out,” said Kaylianna Bezk.  Kayli made what would be a life-saving jump from the second-story window, but now has a long road to recovery. She is still suffering from lung issues and was on life support for nearly three days.  The fire is believed to have started on the back porch but the cause remains unknown.  The family’s dog made it out, but the cat is still missing. The biggest concern for the family is where they will stay next. The family of 11 is staying in an Airbnb, but needs to find a new house by Friday.  “Don’t take anything for granted because you could have everything one day and wake up the next with nothing,” Droge said.  The family set up a GoFundMe to help with expenses and to find permanent housing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdGFjb21hLWZhbWlseS1kaXNwbGFjZWQtaG9tZS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtZmlyZS8yODEtMTU4MWU3MDMtODdlNi00ZWU0LWE0ZmQtMGRmZmE5MDFiMGU50gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3RhY29tYS1mYW1pbHktZGlzcGxhY2VkLWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWZpcmUvMjgxLTE1ODFlNzAzLTg3ZTYtNGVlNC1hNGZkLTBkZmZhOTAxYjBlOQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While fire crews were on their way to the scene Bakersfield and Kern County’s Emergency Communications Center received calls saying there was a possible structure near the fire, Kern County Fire Department officials said. Firefighters upgraded the incident and requested more personnel.  At the scene, fire crews found the fire in a field of dead grass with four structures threatened and one of those was fully involved in the fire, according to officials. This prompted a second alarm response, which brought additional personnel and law enforcement to assist with traffic.  About one hour later at 2:17 p.m., the fire was put out, according to officials.

"fire","2023-07-05","14:00:00","{""Akron"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:11:29","A new No. 12 fire station will serve Akron's west side neighborhoods next year, replacing a building that functioned for decades along West Market Street near the rail crossing through the city's Wallhaven neighborhood.  City officials gathered Tuesday morning to break ground on the new fire station, which will be constructed just south of Wallhaven's central crossroads.  “Today was an exciting day for the entire Akron community and especially for the residents here in Ward 4,” Mayor Dan Horrigan said. “In 2018, we broke ground on Fire Station 2 in Middlebury, which was the first new fire station in Akron in 22 years. Now, just a few short years later, we’re happy to break ground on yet another new fire station — making it the third one in five years and marking our latest investment into Akron Fire.”  Station 12 will join Station 2 and Station 4 among the latest to be replaced. The city already has begun discussions to evaluate which station will be up next for replacement, the mayor's office said.  Here is what we know so far about the new No. 12 fire station:  Where will the new fire station be built?  The new No. 12 fire station will be at 112 S. Hawkins, close to the busy intersection of Market Street, Hawkins Avenue and Exchange Street. It will be just to the south of Westgate Circle and the Swensons Drive-In.  The city will install a new signal light directly in front of the fire station on South Hawkins Ave to alert drivers when emergency vehicles are exiting the property.  When will the fire station be ready?  Officials believe the new station will be fully operational in the summer of 2024.  It will be 14,959 square feet and cost approximately $9.5 million. The current fire station on West Market Street is 7,066 square feet.  The station will have nine beds and, at a minimum, will have a crew of six firefighter/medics, an engine, and a med unit.  It will feature three full apparatus bays as well as equipment decontamination facilities and an air-drying hose tower.  How is the city of Akron paying for the new fire station?  The funds paying for new fire station are generated from a ballot measure approved by Akron voters in 2017; the charter amendment known as Issue 4 created a .25% income tax to pay for roads and emergency services.  Fire Chief Joseph Natko said the new station is an investment in the city's safety that ""will serve this area for many years to come.”  “Station 12 has been serving the Akron community for 72 years, averaging almost 3,000 calls in 2022,” Natko said. “This new building will help our firefighter/medics better serve Akron and will keep our firefighters safer as they answer the call to protect our residents.""  What will happen to the old station?  The old station No. 12 will be decommissioned once its replacement is up and running, city officials said. Details about what the city plans to do with the property, which sits across from an Acme Fresh Market, were not immediately available.

"fire","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:38:48","PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh’s aging fire trucks are in such bad shape that the city has now been forced to buy used trucks from local volunteer fire departments.  It’s a potentially critical problem that could impact your safety.  Rick Earle discovered that a controversial decision to cancel a fire truck order last year is now having an impact on the failing fleet.  Earle: Have you seen this?  Anthony Coghill, Pittsburgh City Council: What is that, the old truck that we just bought?  Earle: Yes.  Coghill: How many years old is it?  Earle: 25.  Earle showed Coghill a Facebook post from the Emsworth Volunteer Fire Company that contains a picture of the 1998 American LaFrance engine that served the Borough of Emsworth for over 20 years.  The Facebook post indicates that the truck is now “onto its next life with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire.”  Earle: I’m assuming this truck is going into the Pittsburgh Fire History Museum?  Coghill: Yea, it’s going down to the Carnegie Science Center. No, it’s a serious problem.  The problem is so serious that the city has had to resort to buying used engines from volunteer departments. So far, they’ve purchased two. The city doesn’t have enough working fire trucks, so when one goes down, there’s no backup.  It’s a difficult predicament for a 630-member paid fire department.  Earle: Is this a little bit embarrassing?  Ralph Sicuro, Pittsburgh Fire Fighter Union President: Well, I wouldn’t say embarrassing. It’s a necessity when you have this lack of following a good plan of action to be able to replace our apparatus.  But the previous administration said they did have a plan.  Former Mayor Bill Peduto approved the purchase of three engines, with plans to buy two more trucks, but the Union balked at the purchase, claiming that the trucks didn’t meet the specifications needed to survive the hilly Pittsburgh terrain and the rugged winter weather.  The Peduto administration disagreed, saying that while not the top of the line, they would do just fine.  Peduto authorized the purchases, and the city ordered the trucks. But when Peduto lost the election, the new administration canceled the entire order.  Earle: If you had ordered them, you’d have them?  Sicuro: First of all, that would have absolutely had brought things in today, but they would not have lasted. They would not have been able to allow us to complete our mission. These were subpar apparatus.  After canceling the order last year, the city placed a new order for four new pumpers and two ladder trucks. But City Controller Michael Lamb said the city waited too long to place the new order.  “I’m not sure the cancellation was the problem, the problem was when they canceled, they didn’t order. They should have, they should have stepped up right at that moment and ordered new equipment,” said Lamb.  And now those ladder trucks won’t be in until July and Pumper trucks until next April, nearly a year away.  At times during the past couple of months, there have been no spare pumpers.  So when one goes down, firefighters have had to respond to calls in an SUV and wait for a pumper from a nearby station.  Earle: Is this a public safety crisis?  Sicuro: It is a crisis and the fact that if we don’t act, and we don’t develop a purchasing plan, remember, this is two years plus before we are going to get new apparatus in, so. Every day we allow this to go by without figuring out a plan and funding it, we’re going to be in a bigger problem.  Sicuro is now urging the city of Pittsburgh to implement an annual purchasing plan so this doesn’t ever happen again.  “We have to take action soon by getting an order in place, getting it paid for, and moving on to the next one to the next one, year after year, in order to replace the fleet, we currently have and have enough proper spare apparatus for when things go down,” said Sicuro.  “We need the administration to step up, pull the trigger. Let’s get a plan to renew this equipment because I said the next two years is going to be difficult. We’re going to be seeing more purchases like this,” said Lamb.  Councilman Coghill, who sits on the Equipment Leasing Authority that’s responsible for purchasing fire trucks and all other city vehicles, said he hears the message, loud and clear.  “We see the need. The administration sees the need as well. It’s a matter of finding the right monies in order to up the fleet. It’s going to be costly. It’s going to be tough decisions to be made by council, but to me, nothing’s more important than getting our public safety from point A to point B,” said Coghill.  Even with the addition of the two used fire trucks, Sicuro called it a band-aid solution.  Controller Lamb said the city will likely be forced to buy more used fire trucks just to get by until the new trucks come in.  Download the FREE WPXI News app for breaking news alerts.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""LauderdaleByTheSea"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:14:08","LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. – Judson Hopping is the chief of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea’s volunteer fire department, where firefighters are paid for calls they respond to.  Hopping recently had a hunch that something was not right.  He noticed Deputy Chief John Louvaris was paid for a call he didn’t respond to.  “I knew that people were signing up for calls that were not present for the calls,” said Hopping. “I was on shift and he was not there, but she gave him credit for it.”  He is talking about the department’s secretary, one of only two full-time employees, who kept track of the call sheets.  She is Cheryl Louvaris, the deputy chief’s wife.  “I had a suspicion that she was taking sheets home and having her husband sign for them,” Hopping said.  There were other irregularities, including missing supplies and equipment, so Hopping set up some cameras.  “I have her on camera talking to her husband, who was sitting in the office with her,” he said. “She kept telling him, ‘you were on this call, sign this’ and she went to hand him the sheet, and someone came in the office and she pulls it back.”  Hopping said he also caught John Louvaris stealing gas.  “That’s fuel we use for the ATV’s and Jet Skis, and what do we see him doing there? He’s putting gas into his personal truck,” said Hopping. “Walking from behind one of the apparatus with a five gallon gas can and walking over to his personal vehicle and dispensing the gasoline in his personal vehicle.”  Local 10 News’ Christina Vazquez asked Hopping if he thinks this is the first time Louvaris has done this, or if it’s the first time he was caught on camera.  “I believe that was the first time he was caught on camera,” Hopping replied.  Court records show that in 2009, John Louvaris faced a misdemeanor charge related to stealing gas. He plead no contest and agreed to pay just over $500 in restitution to an Oakland Park BP gas station. The restitution order can be seen at the bottom of this story.  Hopping said at the time, Louvaris was suspended, but he was allowed to come back to work when the matter was resolved.  He said last week the majority of department membership voted to fire John Louvaris, and the chief fired Cheryl Louvaris for this, and he says for showing a firefighters his, and another firefighter’s, personal and confidential information, to include financial data about their pensions.  “It puts a black eye on our department, for the actions of two people,” said Hopping. “I did catch it, I acted on my suspicions and I caught them.”  The video footage has been shared with the Broward Sheriff’s Office, which told Local 10 News they are looking into it.  Hopping said John Louvaris had been with the department since 2005 while Cheryl Louvaris was employed there beginning in 2008.  Local 10 News has confirmed with the mayor of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea and Pompano Beach Fire Rescue that the two municipalities are in final negotiations for Pompano Beach to provide fire services to Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, a change that could happen by late summer.  When asked if he thinks equipment, materials and supplies are disappearing from the station because of the upcoming change, Hopping responded, “I believe some of it does. I really think it has been going on for a while.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NhbDEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbGF1ZGVyZGFsZS1ieS10aGUtc2VhLXZvbHVudGVlci1maXJlLWNoaWVmLW5vdGljZWQtZGVwdXR5LWNoaWVmLXNlY3JldGFyeS13ZXJlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I just think they were just totally shocked and fear.""  Okandogs opened in 2014 to help the humane society when it ran out of space. Short originally wanted to care for a few dogs at a time, but things changed.  ""At the time, all shelters neutered and spayed at six or eight weeks.

""All dogs get spayed, neutered, microchipped, and rabies (shots), and all other shots that are required before they're released.""  Currently, Okandogs looks after 74 dogs and rescues more than 625 dogs a year.  Short asks people who want to adopt their dogs to have a fully fenced yard appropriate to the size of the dog. They will also need a daily plan that supports potty training, socializing and bonding time.  Information and Okandogs' adoption application can be found here.  As for the homeowner who lost his home and 25 dogs to the fire, Short says he didn't ask for the surviving dogs back.  ""He's disabled.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WOLO)— It’s been 100 years since a deadly fire killed 77 people who were unable to escape a Camden Schoolhouse in 1923.  Governor Henry McMaster and other local officials honored the lives lost at the site where the Cleveland School and Theatre once stood.  According to Chief John Bowers with the Camden Fire Department, the fire was started by an oil lamp that burst on the school’s stage during a play.  Bowers says the fire is considered the deadliest fire in South Carolina history and the National Fire Protection Association reports it as the fourth deadliest fire in U.S. history.  As people scrambled to exit the building, others rushed in to help — making it harder for everyone to escape.  Bowers says the coroner was also killed in the fire, making it even harder to identify those who died.  Sisters Phyllis Wainscott and Pamela Morris say their grandmother survived the fire. Their great uncle however, did not.  “To see the things that my grandmother talked about and to hear the facts that I had no idea it was so.. um… Some of the horrendous things that they actually went through, and the stairwell being so tight and packed. And people being thrown out the windows. Children, many children being saved that I’ve met today…their descendants…who were saved because they were thrown out of a window by an adult,” recalls Phyllis Wainscott along with her sister Pamela Morris.  Ann Seegars lost five family members to the fire.  “My mother in law’s mother, and brother and sister, and sister-in-law and child were all burned at one time. Plus there was other family members too,” says Seegars.  She recalls that her family didn’t speak about that night very often, saying, “I think it was such a tragedy until you would just get some facts, but not the horror of it.”  According to Chief Bowers, the Cleveland School Fire helped change fire codes and laws across the state and the nation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiY2NvbHVtYmlhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3LzEwMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1zY2hvb2wtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chief Shawn Esler of the Waterville Fire-Rescue Department said Wednesday the blaze was first reported at about 9:40 p.m. as a tree on fire, but firefighters then learned a building was on fire at 100 Silver St., the same address as an apartment building.  Firefighters found flames at the rear of the 1 1/2-story, two-bay garage used for storage, according to Esler. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly, he said.  “The fire appears to have originated in a designated smoking area and extended into the garage,” Esler wrote in an email. “Vegetation and leaves surrounding the garage contributed to the fire spread. The fire was contained to the building of origin.”  He said the fire is not considered suspicious and investigators are gathering more information.  “We will consider the fire undetermined until we speak with a few more people in the area,” Esler said.  He said the garage contained items for the apartment building, including furniture and building materials.  Winslow firefighters assisted city firefighters at the scene, and Oakland firefighters covered the city station, according to Esler.  No one was injured due to the fire, he said.

But the department is not monitoring the air quality around the site after the Monday fire, which burned for four hours before being contained. He said no more emissions are coming from the site since the fire was put out.  Madore also said responders prevented any water runoff used to fight the fire from entering local rivers. He said DEP staff will return to the site on Thursday.  Environmental activists have criticized Casella Waste Systems' management of the site and how it handles toxic sludge in recent years. Its proposed expansion and acceptance of out-of-state trash has also faced criticism from locals who worry about the landfill's environmental impact on their area.  Don't Waste ME's Ed Spencer, who lives in West Old Town, said both the state and Casella need to be more forthcoming about how such incidents happen and when they happen.  ""We want to know what happened and... exactly what is going on in as real time as possible,"" he said.  Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis said he is still looking for answers after tribal members complained about burning eyes and sore throats in the wake of the fire. He said it's an especially pressing issue as the region is right in the middle of the fiddlehead harvesting season.  ""So yeah, we had, we had a lot of concerns, and we still do,"" he said.  Francis says he is working with the tribe's local U.S. Environmental Protection Agency trustee to get information about the fire.  The tribe has raised concerns about the landfill's close proximity to the Penobscot River for years. Its Indian Island reservation is about four miles away.

Now it was the Marshall Fire Department’s turn to go inside.  On Tuesday evening the building’s interior was getting smoky, with the help of burning straw bales. In a back room, a pair of firefighters crouched down and aimed a hose like they would at a real fire scene.  “You want to get the ceiling,” said Fire Chief Quentin Brunsvold as he helped lead the training exercise.  As firefighters pointed the hose upward, the water knocked down ceiling tiles and insulation. Meanwhile, different groups of firefighters were preparing to do search and rescue training at the front of the building, and on the upper floor.  Getting to hold training at the former C&N Game Room Outlet on Tuesday was a good opportunity for the fire department, Brunsvold said.  “We don’t typically get a lot of commercial buildings available for this kind of work,” Brunsvold said.  The C&N building was eventually headed for demolition, but first Lockwood Motors had made it available for emergency responder training.  Brunsvold said the fire department had a variety of training exercises planned that night. The design of the building gave them a chance to use different tactics than they would use at a house fire.  “We don’t get a lot of practice cutting flat roofs,” he said. The fact that the building had a second story also opened up opportunities for aerial training.  The fire training did attract some attention from people in the neighborhood around East College Drive and Sunrise Lane. A few local residents gathered near the property to watch the fire trucks and the training exercises.  Brunsvold said the fire department had put the word out on social media about the training earlier in the day.  “We wanted everyone to know it’s just training,” he said. Although there was smoke at the property, there wasn’t a threat to the public.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnNoYWxsaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3Ntb2tlLWFuZC1maXJlLWJ1dC1qdXN0LXRyYWluaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Valley Air District encourages residents to be prepared and plan for potential poor air quality due to wildfire smoke that might reach the Valley as we head into the hotter, drier time of the year. Predicting the severity of the fire season is always challenging, particularly with ever-changing conditions and weather patterns.  The District reminds residents to change out air filters in their home and set up a Clean Air Room for when smoke impacts become severe. A Clean Air Room is a room in your home or apartment where you and your family can escape the worst of the smoke impacts from wildfires.  Residents can follow a few easy steps to create a Clean Air Room.  Choose a room where your entire family can relax and spend the majority of their time; prevent smoke from entering the room by tightly closing doors and windows. Stay cool. Run fans, window air conditioners or central air conditioning; filter the air in the room with a store-bought air purifier or create a DIY air purifier.  Also, avoid creating smoke or other particles indoors (no candles, no open flame cooking, no smoking); spend as much time as possible in the clean air room to get the most benefits; and remember cloth masks don’t work for wildfire smoke, choose N95 masks instead.  Hot and dry conditions throughout the San Joaquin Valley can create the potential for wildfires and lead to smoke impacts in the region. Due to historic rain and snow this past winter, there is the risk of an increased build-up of undergrowth and potential for significant dry vegetation during the summer months. This will present a higher risk for hotter, faster-moving fires in mountain communities surrounding the Valley, often sending smoke into the San Joaquin Valley.  Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter (PM), which can trigger asthma attacks, aggravate chronic bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Those with existing respiratory conditions are especially susceptible to the adverse health effects of this form of pollution. Anyone experiencing poor air quality due to wildfire smoke should move indoors to a filtered, air-conditioned environment with windows closed and contact their primary care provider for more information.  The public can check the District’s wildfire page at www.valleyair.org/wildfires for information about any wildfires affecting the Valley. In addition, anyone can follow air quality conditions by downloading the free “Valley Air” app on their mobile device.  For more information, visit www.valleyair.org or call the District office in Modesto at 209-557-6400.  The Valley Air District covers eight counties including San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and San Joaquin Valley air basin portions of Kern.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ha2RhbGVsZWFkZXIuY29tL25ld3MvdmFsbGV5LWFpci1kaXN0cmljdC11cmdlcy1maXJlLXNlYXNvbi1wcmVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP.

The fire at 118 White House School Road was reported at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Chief Don French of the Madison Fire Department.  The family of five, which includes three young children, was dining out at the time, leaving five dogs at home.  None of the pets was hurt because a passerby happened to spot the fire and let the dogs out of the single-story house before calling firefighters, French said.  The house was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, he said. A nearby pickup truck also sustained minor damage.  The blaze drew firefighters from Madison, Anson, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Starks. French said firefighters were at the scene until about 10 p.m.  The Office of State Fire Marshal has conducted an investigation, French said, and believes one of the family’s dogs inadvertently turned on one of the burners. It is not clear if the dog was trying to reach food on the stove.  “The stove wasn’t on when the homeowner left. They checked it,” French said. “We believe that the dog turned one of the valves on the stove, and there was something on top of the stove that probably caught fire. They said macaroni and cheese, or something like that.”  The family was with a relative Wednesday, French said, while the American Red Cross was trying to find a place for the family to stay.

Luckily, the fire didn't spread and was contained to the building where it started, he said.  There were no injuries.  He didn't say what could have been in the building. Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  The incident is being classified as a two-alarm at this time. The Indiana State fire marshal was on scene as of at least 5:30 a.m. to assist with the use of a drone.  Multiple roadways around the blaze had been closed, but by 7 a.m. the main closure was Northwest Fourth Street heading into downtown.  Larson said it's too early to talk about a cause, but firefighters will be on scene likely into the afternoon tamping down hot spots.  Contamination from the property was the subject of a lawsuit filed in August 2017 by public nonprofit broadcaster WNIN. At that time, WNIN’s studios were at the adjacent Historic Carpenter Home.  Pearl Cleaners applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.

(George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  New Zealand police say they plan to start removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where at least six people were killed in a fire  WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand police said Thursday they plan to start removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where at least six people were killed in a fire.  Police Inspector Dion Bennett said they were aiming to remove the first two bodies from Loafers Lodge on Thursday and the next two on Friday. Bennett said it's possible they could find more victims as officers continue their scene examination.  “The damage on the third floor is significant,” Bennett told reporters. “The debris is piled high, and there is much for them to move and search underneath.”  Police say the believe the fire was arson and have launched a homicide investigation.  Bennett said they haven't yet arrested anybody but they have a list of people they want to speak to and hope to quickly identify any suspects. He declined to say if they had found accelerant or other evidence of criminal behavior at the scene.  Police said there had been a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire on Tuesday. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The homicide investigation represents a change in outlook by police, who initially said they didn't believe the fire was deliberately lit.  Bennett said police had accounted for 92 people who were in the hostel and had a list of others who remained unaccounted for, although were not necessarily missing. Police had earlier said they expected that the final death toll would be fewer than 10 people.  News outlet RNZ identified Liam Hockings, a journalist, as one of the hostel's residents who was missing. Hockings is the brother of the BBC presenter Lucy Hockings.  The fire ripped through the building early Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or dived from windows.  The Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers. Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the nation's building codes did not require sprinklers in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  “I have asked the Minister for Housing to look particularly at issues around building regulations to see whether there’s anything more that we should be doing right at this point,"" Hipkins told reporters Wednesday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcG9saWNlLWhvc3RlbC1maXJlLWtpbGxlZC02LWFyc29uLTk5Mzg0Mzg40gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtcG9saWNlLWhvc3RlbC1maXJlLWtpbGxlZC02LWFyc29uLTk5Mzg0Mzg4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After that month of unanswered questions from residents about the state of their local fire department, a unanimous vote by the Fire Territory Advisory Board will have the Lakeville Volunteer Fire Department back up and running under a new administrative fire chief.  “The firemen themselves have one person to go to for paperwork, us as a fire territory board have one sole person we can go to, the administrative chief, to oversee that,” explains Patrick Howard, the Town of Lakeville Representative on the Fire Territory Board.  The administrative chief will act as a liaison between the volunteer firefighters and the board, which will help prevent logistic issues that caused the sudden shutdown in the first place.  Just last month, the department stopped fire service because paperwork issues caused issues with its insurance.  Volunteer firefighters will now need to be hired on as employees of Union Township in order to be properly insured.  “Until the non-for-profit can come back, the best course of action to get these men back out there and serving the community was to take them on as employees of Union Township, and at that point they can have insurance coverage again,” Howard says.  Once the administrative chief and the 14 volunteers who've applied are officially hired, Southwest Fire Territory won’t have to keep covering Lakeville calls.  “It will be directed to them that we do have our firemen in place, and we can respond to emergency calls,” Howard explains.  Southwest Fire Territory will still assist with mutual aid if needed.  The board expects to officially hire the chief and volunteer firefighters Friday, then the department can get back up and running.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzU3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xha2V2aWxsZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtdXBkYXRlLXB1YmxpYy1vbi1sb2NhbC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire erupted late Sunday night from a garage within a townhome complex on Aspen Court in White Bear Lake. A criminal complaint states 911 callers reported hearing “things blowing up.”  When police arrived, a man pointed officers in the direction of his son, 45-year-old Christian Thomas Dahm.  “He’s over there. He started the fire,” the man said.  Dahm was found naked except for a pair of pants around his ankles, and he fell limp when police handcuffed him and had to be carried away.  Christian Thomas Dahm (Courtesy of Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office)  The wife of Dahm’s father was rescued from the residence, though she had trouble breathing and had suffered some burn injuries. She was brought to Regions Hospital in critical condition and remained on a ventilator as of Tuesday, the complaint states.  While in custody, Dahm told an investigator that he was working on a fishing pole over a pan of motor oil when he lit a cigarette with a torch.  “All of a sudden, there was a fire,” Dahm told investigators.  Accounts from Dahm’s father and a neighbor indicate Dahm was yelling, throwing things around and making banging noises in the garage in the moments leading up to the fire.  Dahm’s father and his wife were allegedly concerned Dahm was high on methamphetamine and went to check on him. When they opened the door to the garage, Dahm’s father said it was “like everything exploded,” charging documents state.  A witness recalled seeing “flames hurling out of the garage.”  Dahm is charged with one count of negligent fires resulting in great bodily harm, but the complaint notes more charges could be added as the investigation unfolds. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.  At Dahm’s initial court appearance Wednesday morning, a judge set his bail at $50,000. He remains in custody, jail records show. His next hearing is scheduled for June 9.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4tY29ubmVjdGlvbi13aXRoLXdoaXRlLWJlYXItbGFrZS1mb3VycGxleC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

RELATED: Firefighters respond after fire breaks out at home just north of downtown  When fire crews arrived at the two-story home, located in the 800 block of W. Poplar Street, they found flames coming from the second floor.  “They did a search of the structure, and the search came back that nobody was actually inside at the time,” said Battalion Chief David Prado with SAFD.  Firefighters quickly began attacking the fire, which made its way into the attic.  Firefighters can be seen in the second floor window, trying to attack the flames which had burned into the attic. (KSAT 12 News)  Although they found the ground-floor doors and windows boarded up, they also found evidence that someone had found a way inside the house.  “Clothes, there’s food items,” Prado said. “So we do believe that people were squatting in this structure.”  Victor Villarreal, who lives across the street, says he knows for a fact that has been happening.  “Every day you see people going in and out,” Villarreal said. “They crawl up that drainpipe, go into the second story window and come back down and open the back door for everyone else.”  West Poplar house fire image. (KSAT)  Villarreal said he has called San Antonio police dozens of times during the five years he has lived in the neighborhood.  However, he says, the intruders are able to conceal themselves from officers.  According to SAPD records, officers have been called to the home for suspicious activity five times since the beginning of this year. It is unclear whether any of those calls resulted in arrests.  As of late Wednesday morning, police had not provided that information.  Villarreal said while the owners moved out a few years ago, the home has been a neighborhood fixture for generations.  Real estate records online show it was built in 1929.  “It’s sad because, like I said, it’s one of the oldest houses in the neighborhood,” Villarreal said. “I hate to see it go like that.”  Investigators, so far, have not determined the exact cause of the fire, nor have they made any arrests.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9maXJlLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtbG9va2luZy1pbnRvLXJlcG9ydHMtb2Ytc3F1YXR0ZXJzLXNlZW4taW5zaWRlLWhvbWUtdGhhdC1idXJuZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This time, 21-year-old Brandon Cambridge was the star man, scoring a match-winning brace in just his 3 rd career MLS appearance.  First Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey, Malanda, Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram  Charlotte FC dominated the early stages of the match with the lion’s share of possession. This dominance resulted in two big penalty shouts, both involving Enzo Copetti but neither of which was awarded by referee Tori Penso.  Ten minutes into the match, a passage of good play resulted in Brandt Bronico slipping Copetti in behind. His aggressive first touch got him on the wrong side of the defender, and it appeared he was barged over from behind. Penso and VAR didn’t share the opinion of the CLTFC players or home crowd, though, and no penalty was given.  It only took fifteen minutes for Copetti to be involved in yet another contentious decision. This time, Ashley Westwood played a well-weighted long ball over the top for Copetti, who took his first touch beyond the Chicago defender. The Argentine went down from a last-ditch sliding challenge, but again was not rewarded with a penalty.  Chicago got themselves back in the game following the first 25 minutes of CLTFC dominance. Kristijan Kahlina made an excellent point blank save in the 27th minute, but Kacper Przybylko was able to slot one past him two minutes later on a breakaway. Kahlina had initially made a high caliber 1v1 stop, but the unlucky rebound fell directly back to the Polish striker to pass into an empty net.  From there, the half wound down with a few half chances for both sides. The Crown dominated possession and the Fire mainly looked to play on the break, but neither could find a clear chance before halftime.  Second Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey (59’), Malanda (84’), Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram (90’)  Substitutions: Cambridge (59’), Tuiloma (84’), Hegardt (90’)  Charlotte FC came out of the gates hot again to start the second half, resulting in a similar narrative to the first. Copetti had two more potential penalties waved off – one a handball on the Chicago defender, one a pull-back on Copetti’s shirt – and the Crown couldn’t get on the board.  Head Coach Christian Lattanzio quickly made a tactical shift by bringing in winger Brandon Cambridge for defender Jaylin Lindsey at the 60th minute. Adilson Malanda shifted to right back and Derrick Jones to center back, which enabled Swiderski to play as the central attacking midfielder and Cambridge as the right winger.  The change paid immediate dividends when Justin Meram played a clever pass to Cambridge across the top of the box. Cambridge coolly side footed the ball into the far post with his weaker left foot for the equalizer and his first career MLS goal.  From there the Crown began pouring on the pressure. Cambridge played in an inch perfect cross that barely evaded Swiderski on the far post. Then, Swiderski whipped in a deep free kick for Jan Sobocinski, whose glancing header was well saved by Fire goalkeeper Chris Brady.  Eventually CLTFC got their reward for the sustained pressure, and it was again Cambridge in just his third MLS appearance who found the winner. Nathan Byrne curled in a good cross for the winger on the back post. He settled the ball down, took a good prep touch out of his feet, and passed into the far post with his left foot again to put Charlotte FC in the lead.  Down the stretch, Lattanzio made substitutions to secure the result, with Bill Tuiloma featuring for the first time in a few weeks following his recovery from a muscle injury and Chris Hegardt providing extra energy on the wing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZWZvb3RiYWxsY2x1Yi5jb20vbmV3cy9mdWxsLXRpbWUtY2hhcmxvdHRlLWZjLXNob3ctcmVzaWxpZW5jZS1pbi13aW4tb3Zlci1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225.

Mosser is currently working four-hour afternoon shifts while she is being trained.  Mosser’s start date was May 15.  Council approved a motion to pay bills totaling $37,494.33.  The Wellsville Foundation’s request for a road closure on Riverside between Seventh and Eighth streets on June 16 for a block party which will serve as a fundraiser for the foundation was approved.  Ordinances for prohibiting the use of electronic devices while operating a motor vehicle in the village and modifying the division of sewerage fund revenues were placed on first read.  An ordinance to increase appropriations for current expenses in the village passed on first read by emergency measure with an all-in-favor vote.  Also approved was an opportunity for village employees to meet with a representative from Globe Life to talk about what insurance coverage they need. Each employee will be eligible for $3,000 of accidental death insurance at no cost to them.  In her report Fiscal Officer Hoi Wah noted that the village has spent about $69,000 of the $70,000 grant received for the marina project and has completed just about everything that was on the list.  In his report Mayor Bob Boley asked everyone to spread the word that the ELCH Wellsville Clinic is open, and that Consumers National Bank will be open in the former Huntington location on May 30.  Boley requested that council draft an ordinance requiring signs be taken down within a week of the event they were posted for. The village is having issues with event signage being put up in the village and left up for months. A motion was approved to draft an ordinance that would require posters to have the signs removed within a week following the event or face a misdemeanor charge with up to a $150 fine. Council approved the motion with an all-in-favor vote.  The village is having issues with James Coppa, who was retained to redo the village gazebo, getting it completed.

Spanknebel and the Hadley Fire Department hosted Massachusetts State Fire Marshal Peter J. Ostroskey and a side-by-side prop that demonstrated the power of fire sprinklers to save lives and property.  The Department of Fire Services’ side-by-side sprinkler trailer set up at American Legion Post 271 on May 16, the third day of Home Fire Sprinkler Week. The trailer contains two rooms with identical furnishings. On room was protected by a single sprinkler head, and the other was not. Before a crowd of residents and municipal officials, DFS personnel ignited a small fire in the wastebasket of each room. The fire in the first room was completely extinguished within seconds, causing minimal damage. The fire in the second room grew unchecked, consuming everything inside and presenting unsurvivable conditions in about two minutes. Hadley firefighters extinguished it before it grew even further.  “Firefighters know that sprinklers protect people, pets, and property,” said Chief Spanknebel. “This demonstration lets residents see that fact for themselves. By containing or even extinguishing a fire while it’s still small, a single sprinkler head can give you time to use your home escape plan and get out safely. Firefighters are much less likely to be injured in a fire where sprinklers are in use, and the damage is much less likely to displace residents for an extended period of time.”  “Fire is fast, but sprinklers are faster,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Today’s demonstration made the safety benefits as clear as day. It also showed that a single sprinkler head uses much less water to suppress a small fire than firefighters have to use when they extinguish a big one. The products of combustion, from greenhouse gas emissions to burned synthetic materials in water runoff, are much lower when sprinklers are in play. If you’re building or buying a home, remember that sprinklers aren’t just safety tools – they’re green technology.”  Local fire departments can request the side-by-side sprinkler trailer for their own demonstrations through the Department of Fire Services’ web page.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) joins in cautioning Michiganders about the danger of fires under current weather conditions. In particular, EGLE notes that it is illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  For more details, check EGLE’s open burning webpage.  Warm temperatures, winds and winter buildup of dry grasses and leaves have pushed fire danger to very high levels across the Lower Peninsula.  Map showing where fire danger currently exists in Michigan.  “People need to be careful when doing any outdoor activity that could spark a wildfire,” said Don Klingler, Michigan Department of Natural Resources resource manager for the southern Lower Peninsula. “These fuels can ignite very easily.”  Nine out of 10 wildfires are caused by people, and yard debris burning is the top cause of wildfires in Michigan.  Burn permits will not be issued for the next few days, Klingler said. It’s always critical to check Michigan.gov/BurnPermit before you start your fire to make sure weather conditions allow for safe burning. In southern Lower Peninsula communities, consult local fire authorities.  Fire danger goes up when weather is hot and dry and increases even more when it’s windy. Windborne embers can travel far and fast, turning a small fire into a large one. Lightning strikes are also an issue if stormy weather is predicted.  Due to the increased fire danger, the DNR has suspended most prescribed burns over the next few days.  Snow is still present in parts of the Upper Peninsula, but people should exercise caution in areas without snow.  Safety tips to keep fires under control  When you’re working with fire or equipment outdoors, keep in mind that fires can take off very fast and that the remains of a fire smolder for some time. Here are some tips to keep it safe out there:  Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.

Naperville 911(PSAP) dispatched a general alarm assignment consisting of 11 pieces of fire apparatus and 25 personnel including an incident commander and incident safety officer to the reported address. Two occupants were home at the time, and both had safely evacuated the building prior to the fire department’s arrival.  At 12:31 p.m., the first vehicle arrived on scene and encountered heavy smoke coming from the basement. Fire crews stretched hose lines and began a search for the fire. As companies were advancing through the building they discovered a fire in the basement that had burned through the subfloor and was extending to the floors above. Additional handlines were deployed to contain the secondary fires, and at 12:54 p.m., the fire was deemed under control.

Rick Graves with Portland Fire & Rescue points out some of the fire damage to the May apartment building on May 17, 2023, in Portland, Ore. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said the third and fourth stories of The May apartments were gutted.  “And the first and second floors are going to have significant water damage,” he said. “If it’s deemed unsafe, people may not be able to enter and get their items.”  The fire started at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city. More than a half-dozen large hoses and several smaller hoses were trained on the building for hours as residents scrambled to safety.  Graves said the basement has been essentially turned into a swimming pool. Oil tanks used for the building’s furnace system are leaking. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services is looking into possible runoff into the stormwater system.  During a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Portland Fire & Rescue officials said they were considering sending an investigator through one of the building’s windows where they believe the fire may have started. The May apartments had a number of known electrical issues and code violations that appear to have gone unaddressed.  Structural engineers from the city are also on-site to review the safety of the building and neighboring structures. Fire officials on Wednesday said they are “very concerned” the building may collapse. Residents of two nearby apartment complexes have been allowed to briefly enter their apartment units, one by one, for up to five minutes to collect personal documents.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  The city said the owner of the damaged apartment building will need to hire an engineer to complete a full structural review and decide whether it should be repaired or demolished.  The Red Cross has organized a shelter at the University of Portland for the scores of displaced residents. An aid group called Team Farmer arrived on the scene Tuesday and provided 45 pizzas.  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Now that the smoke has cleared, it’s evident the unreinforced brick walls of the complex are bulging slightly.  “If the city engineer deems this a structure that is a danger, there will be an accelerated course put on it,” Graves said. “It’s usually fast-tracked on the demolition permit.”  The building’s fire alarm system was working during the fire, but many residents had grown weary of frequent false alarms and were ignoring it. So fire crews had to go floor by floor, alerting residents to exit the building immediately.  The fire spread aggressively, with explosive flashovers blowing windows out and sending shards of glass to the other side of a four-lane street. Graves said one firefighter was cut on his forehead.  “He lightly rubbed his forehead, looked at it, grunted, put his helmet back on, grabbed three saws at once and walked away,” Graves said. “He’s a monster.”  Another firefighter was sent to the hospital with an elevated blood pressure and is expected to be OK.  Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone said more than 80 firefighters responded to the scene, with help from dozens of others providing mutual emergency aid.  “I want to recognize and acknowledge the efforts and heroism displayed by the men and women of Portland Fire under the most hazardous of conditions,” Boone said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2FwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlLWRvd250b3duLXBvcnRsYW5kLW9yZWdvbi_SAV5odHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9hcGFydG1lbnQtZmlyZS1kb3dudG93bi1wb3J0bGFuZC1vcmVnb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

What You Need To Know Hadley Fire Department hosted a fire sprinkler demonstration to highlight the benefits of having them in homes    The department said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage because of the flammability of the items inside In Massachusetts, usually a building's size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system    The department said a sprinkler will only go off if a fire is in that room, as opposed to some movies where they all go off at once  They said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage today because of the flammability of items inside.  ""Fire growth is exponentially faster than what it used to be,"" said Fire Chief Michael Spanknebel. ""So we would have 12-15 minutes before we would start seeing really heavy fire conditions. In today, you saw it was 2-3 minutes where we were at flashover at the room because of all those, the foams and the plastics and everything that are in modern construction and modern homes for furniture.""  In Massachusetts, typically a building’s size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system. On Tuesday, the fire department demonstrated what a home with a sprinkler would look like during a fire vs. one without.  Spanknebel said there are many myths about sprinklers which prevent people from using them, so he hopes the visual aid can offer a different perspective.  ""I just think because they see the commercial side of it where you have galvanized piping and extensive installs for a Walmart or Home Depot, where you see huge heads and piping all over the place,"" he said. ""This is basically a rated PVC piping, looks like a plumbing that you put in your walls. It's all done basically like plumbing.""  Spanknebel said another myth they hope to address is one around the amount of water that goes off during a home fire.  ""If one sprinkler head goes off, all of them don't off go off like you see in the movies,"" he said. ""That single head that's tripped by the heat is the only unit that will go off and it will control that fire, low amounts of water, so you can how much it saved the furniture, saved the room.""  Spanknebel said a sprinkler system can also buy people more time in the event of an emergency.  ""So that you have the time to get your family out of the house,"" Spanknebel said. ""And it's also saving the firefighters that are coming to your home to try and extinguish the fire. So if that sprinkler head can control that, that's gonna allow us the time to get there if needed, if the head doesn't take care of itself, it's gonna allow the time to extinguish it completely.""

We might have had the scenario but we didn't have the smoke to go with it or the sound to go with it,"" Chief Scantlin stated.

The fire was called in just before 7 a.m. in the 9000 block of Wurzbach Road, not far from Datapoint Drive and Interstate 10.  Mark Trevino, a battalion chief with the San Antonio Fire Department, said they were able to do a partial search of the building and found nobody inside.  “As soon as we saw fire through the roof, we did what we could to do a search, as it has been known to have some people coming in and out,” Trevino said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.  The area, along with Wurzbach Road, was closed off to drivers as firefighters worked to put out hot spots.  “There’s hot spots right now since this is an older building and it’s a lot of wood structure. It’s got heavy wood floors and it’s built on different areas. There’s layer on top of layers so we have to get in there and tear into the building in order to get to the hot spots,” Trevino said.  Fire officials say the building will be demolished. Tuesday’s fire is the third time the fire department was called to the structure, as they responded back on Jan. 27 and previously on March 6, 2022.  “The structure is unstable. It’s unsafe so the city will have to go head and make it a hazard, so that it can’t get people involved and caught into,” Trevino said.  Anahi Martinez, a resident nearby, works at a building not far from the one that caught fire.  “I have a group chat with my work employees and my coworkers and they said there was a fire at the abandoned Japanese restaurant,” Martinez said. “I came out, I just saw all of the fire trucks, the ambulances.”  According to the San Antonio Fire Department website, as many as 14 units answered the call.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9maXJlZmlnaHRlcnMtcmVzcG9uZC10by1maXJlLWF0LWZvcm1lci1yZXN0YXVyYW50LW9uLW5vcnRod2VzdC1zaWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The location was off Turner Creek Road.  Bergstrom said fewer than 20 acres on private property were impacted. There were multiple burn piles, and the blaze initially started when one got out of control.  “Looking at the fuel models — types of ground material that could potentially ignite — the remoteness of the area, the terrain, lack of access, I called for a third alarm,” Bergstrom said. “This was not flat ground. This was steep timber terrain.”  Bergstrom said the “wildland model” for firefighting was activated for increased fire activity in this case. Different types of hoses came into play, for example, according to the chief.  “This doubled in size in less than 20 minutes,” Bergstrom said. “Structures were being threatened. Opting to go to a third alarm called in more resources, not just our immediate neighbors.”  In addition to Yamhill, agencies that responded to the callout were from Amity, Gaston, Grand Ronde Tribal, Lafayette, McMinnville and Tualatin Valley (Newberg).  There were 13 pieces of equipment and 35 firefighters on scene.  “This came extremely early in the year,” Bergstrom said of the fire. If this incident is any indication of the fire season that agencies might be facing this year, he said “it puts us on the ready.” He said this was the type of fire activity he would expect to see in June or July.  “Fuels have dried out,” the chief said. “We had an east wind and higher than normal temperature. The fuel moisture is dropping rapidly.”  In recent days, wildland fires were reported in the following locations: 21000 block of Dopp Road, Newberg; 3000 block Stoller Road, Dayton; 16000 block of Masonville Road, McMinnville; 28000 block of Andy Riggs Road, Grand Ronde, and 16000 block of Kings Grade Road, Newberg.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL25ld3NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZT9hcnRpY2xlVGl0bGU9dGhyZWUtYWxhcm0td2lsZGxhbmQtZmlyZS1idXJucy1ub3J0aHdlc3Qtb2YteWFtaGlsbC0tMTY4NDI1MTg1Ni0tNDYxMzctLTFob21lLW5ld3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-01","18:00:00","{""Quincy"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:33:57","QUINCY — Michele Talley said she got interested in firefighting right out of high school and has stayed interested ever since.  “I started as a volunteer firefighter in Southern California when I was 18,” she said. “When I got married and started a family, l left the fire service – and I missed it.”  So when she had the chance she started learning more about it.  “I went back to college, just to give myself something to do, and I started taking fire prevention, fire investigation classes, those kinds of things,” she said.  Talley has been a volunteer or on the paid staff in fire departments in three states. Currently, she is a lieutenant with Grant County Fire District 3 in Quincy, and earned certification as a fire marshal in April.  Her college instructor was part of the fire department in Apple Valley, California, a town that was big enough to have a paid staff.  “I got hired on there. It was mostly as an inspector, where you do fire and life safety inspections, public education kind of stuff, which I really enjoyed. I got my first taste of it then, back in my 20s,” she said.  Talley said she and husband Dave wanted a change and moved to the small Eastern Oregon town of Helix.  “I started volunteering at my local department and went up through the ranks, (became a) training officer, and became a district chief there,” she said.  The family came to Quincy when her husband accepted a job at Quincy High School.  “So I started all over as a volunteer here,” she said. “I got to recreate myself with each state.”  She joined GCFD 3 as a volunteer in 2009 and eventually was hired for a paid position as the firefighter retention coordinator. She’s been on the district’s paid staff for 10 years, she said.  “This is my 29th year,” she said, as a volunteer or on a department’s paid staff.  But as a veteran, Talley said she started thinking of the future.  “So I started thinking, ‘Okay, what are some things I can do, that if I can physically do this job, (will) still make a difference?’ Now this department still requires you to be a line firefighter. We’re just not big enough to have you stand alone in an (administration) role,” she said.  But she still wanted more skills, she said, and started thinking about the fire prevention and inspection work she had done in her 20s. Jim Kling, the district’s previous fire marshal, had announced his plans to retire. Talley started taking fire inspector certification classes and working with Kling to learn from his experience and expertise.  “It’s one thing to get the certification - okay yeah, I know where to find everything in this red binder, this fire code book - but another thing to actually apply it,” she said.  While there were classes, the certification process required a lot of studying on her own too, she said. Kling was fire marshal for more than 25 years, and was generous with his time and knowledge.  “It’s a lot of ongoing training. It really was a lot of shadowing Chief Kling prior to this and learning it in the field,” she said.  Kling still answers her questions, even after retirement.  “He’s still on speed dial,” Talley said.  A fire marshal does investigate the origin of a fire, but there’s a lot more to it than that. The fire marshal is involved in the entire construction or remodeling process, especially commercial buildings.  “I do everything from plan reviews for all new construction that comes in, with fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, things like that - the planning version of it too, what we call pre-construction systems - all the way through the testing of all those systems,” she said.  The fire marshal inspects fire hydrants during construction. If there’s a fuel tank in the project, she tests that. She conducts fire and life safety inspections.  “If you have a new business that comes in, before they open their doors I’m supposed to go through and do my walkthrough,” she said.  Existing businesses also are subject to inspections, and Talley said she likes to work with business owners to change anything that might need changing.  “I come from the education background, and I like working with people to teach them,” she said. “It’s like, ‘You want the safest building for your customers and your employees. And I want the same thing.’  “I don’t want to be the scary person. Yes, I have to enforce code, that’s part of my job, but I’m also here to educate them,” she said.  Talley is still learning herself, she said, and has found that contractors and building owners usually are willing to answer her questions about their systems and work with her. She cited the data centers currently under construction in Quincy as an example.  “Those are the cream of the crop contractors, and they’re excited about telling you about their projects. And they’re gracious. They know that I’m new and they’re not trying to pull a fast one. They want you to know how their systems work.”  It’s a great job, though, she said.  “It’s never the same day twice, that’s what I love about my job,” she said.  The fire service attracted her because it allows her to help her community, she said, and that’s what’s still attractive about it.  “I really enjoy what I do. I really feel like I’m making a difference,” she said, “and that’s what brings a lot of joy to my job.”  Cheryl Schweizer may be reached at cschweizer@columbiabasinherald.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29sdW1iaWFiYXNpbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi9taWNoZWxlLXRhbGxleS1maW5kcy1yZXdhcmRzLWZpcmUtc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

TEXAS CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Marathon Petroleum officials say they are still monitoring the air quality in the Texas City area after Monday's fire, in which we now know what was burning. According to Marathon Petroleum officials, hydrocarbon Naphtha is what was burning.  ""It's component that has a lot of waxes or paraffin's and benzene's or benzene that we know are carcinogens, so it's like a combination of what they're using to refine down and create several products,"" Tox Doc, Dr. Noreen Khan-Mayberry said.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says those smoke particles can be dangerous. But in a Facebook post on Monday, the Texas City Police Department announced a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community wasn't necessary. Normally, that decision comes from the Office of Emergency Management. They make the decision based on information they get from the company and also what they may see or experience when they have reps on site of the fire.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says this is reminiscent of the March 2019 ITC plant fire, in which our partners at the Texas Tribune uncovered high benzene levels lingered in the air for two weeks after public health measures and shelter-in-place warnings were lifted.  When it comes to Monday's Marathon plant fire, the experts we spoke to say if the company knew Naphtha was burning, a shelter-in-place should have been issued.  ""It's always easier to figure out after, even though, when they know which unit blows up or ignites, they know exactly what's in that unit and what's burning in those units. So they know that quickly. It's not like these are unlabeled and take them a long time to find out,"" Dr. Khan-Mayberry said.

Neither resident was home at the time of the fire, he said.  A call reporting the fire came into Stephens County 911 Dispatch just before 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 14, Bennett told WNEG.  He said, “The call came into our dispatch about 5 minutes before 8 p.m., and Carnes Creek, New Hope and Eastanollee volunteer fire departments were paged out. Carnes Creek put the first truck on scene within seven minutes of the call coming in.”  When the initial crew arrived on scene, there was heavy fire and smoke throughout the house, with the heaviest flames concentrated in the right, rear corner of the home.  Bennett said the decision was made to send a crew into the structure for an interior attack on the fire. Fire crews were able suppress the fire with the majority of the damage occurring in the rear quarter of the building, and much of the front portion of the home and belongings were saved from fire damage. Smoke damage was more widespread, Bennett said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for approximately 35 to 40 minutes before the home was secured and the fire crews could begin clean-up operations.  Bennett said there was no clear indication of how the fire started, and explained that the homeowner’s insurance company will decide the cause of the fire following its investigation.  Sunday’s fire was the third fire in a fairly small section of the county, and Bennett said that this year has seen an unusually-high number of fires throughout the county.  Bennett said, “This year, Stephens County Fire Services, and the City of Toccoa, have seen an unheard of amount of structure fires. I talked with some other captains and lieutenants in other counties, and told them how many (fire calls) we run, and they were amazed. For some reason, this year we’ve had a lot more than normal.”  Bennett said that arson does not appear to play a role in the large number of fires this year, but carelessness and inattention is definitely a factor.  He said, “A lot of it is just carelessness, or unintentional type things. We typically don’t see a lot of arson around here.”  Bennett added that the fires are not limited to a certain demographic.  He said, “It’s not just the elderly, not just young people.”  Bennett strongly urges citizens to make sure there are working fire alarms throughout their home, and to make a habit of checking for potential fire hazards prior to leaving the home, even for a short period of time.  The number one tip to prevent fires is smoke alarms, Bennett said, urging citizens to check and test their fire alarms on a regular basis. He also urged residents to be observant and make an extra effort to look for fire hazards.  He said, “Don’t leave the house without making one last lap through the house to make sure nothing is left on like hair dryers, the stove, ovens, or curling irons. That extra 30 seconds can save your home, your belongings, your pets.”  Bennett said that even items that may not have open flames, or may not seem hot enough to start a fire, can be dangerous if left unattended.  He said, “That curling iron you leave on, if it is next to a can of hairspray or something, that kind of thing is where problems start.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd25lZ3JhZGlvLmNvbS9jYXJuZXMtY3JlZWstZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

No one was hurt.Fire Chief Laurent McDonald said crews responded to an alarm at 11:38 a.m. at 30 Old Charlton Road. Firefighters were there until 4 p.m.  McDonald said there was a partial building and stored lumber at the site, which used to be the home of Stone's Saw Mill.  In addition, the property owner has been using the area to place old items there including a filled 53-foot box trailer, tires and plastic water tanks, as well as old televisions and computers.  “We’ve been working with DEP with the property to clean up some of the stuff,” McDonald said. “One of the property owners were there earlier in the morning, still continuing his cleanup efforts to basically, clean up the property and dispose stuff. About an hour after he left is when the fire was discovered.”  Despite being nothing of major value destroyed at the site, it was in the best interest to contain it and put it out, rather than just let it burn, McDonald said. The footprint of the fire was 100-feet-by-100-feet, he said.  “You wouldn’t let it burn because you have plastics,” McDonald said. “Fortunately, the owner started cleaning up the old tires and moved a bunch of them. There were still some there but they weren’t in the area that (was) involved.”  McDonald said they do not have a cause for the fire but they don’t think it’s suspicious. The investigation is ongoing, he said.  “It appears for all intent and purposes it’s accidental in nature,” McDonald said. “Because there were TV items and glass and bottles and whatnot, there’s different speculations you can go on. It may have been sunlight amplified through glass. We can’t really put a finger on the cause but we believe it to be accidental. But, where it started, it did get some of the heavy timbers and grass on the fire which spread to the remnants of the building.”  Aug. 31, 1992, the sawmill was destroyed by fire. The fire was discovered fully involved at 11:10 p.m., shooting flames 20 to 30 feet into the air. It smoldered all night and broke out again the next morning. The pile of slab wood that burned would have been ground into landscaping woodchips and sawdust for farms, while a stack of 30 15-foot logs, which would have been cut into 2,000 linear feet of planking, also burned. Firefighters from Oxford, Charlton, Webster, Leicester and Sutton responded to the late-night blaze as Auburn firefighters waited at the Oxford firehouse.  McDonald said the fire presents greater problems for cleanup.  “Fire is not a good way to dispose of anything because it causes great problems, plus what it does to the air,” McDonald said.  Monday, Oxford fire received mutual aid from Charlton, Dudley and Webster.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnYXJkbmVybmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3JlbW5hbnRzLW9mLW9sZC1zYXdtaWxsLXJhdmFnZWQtYnktZmlyZS1tb25kYXktb24tb2xkLWNoYXJsdG9uLXJvYWQvNzAyMTk0MDAwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At 1:53 p.m. fire companies were dispatched to MLK/Southard St for a fire in an abandoned commercial building. Once on site, a call for all hands on deck was made.  The fire would eventually reach five alarms, but there were no reported injuries from anyone within the building. A firefighter had to be transported to the hospital for vomiting, but nothing fire or injury related.  According to Trenton Fire Director Kenneth Douglas, five other city fire departments came to assist in extinguishing the flames.  “Pretty much went to defensive operations almost immediately due to the collapsing of the gym area,” Director Douglas said. “They tried to make an advance inside, but because of the heavy fire load, they were actually backed out and got out just before the collapse.”  Although the school has been closed since 2007, there were plans for the redevelopment of the property. Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora who arrived about 45 minutes after the first alarm, said a potential $50 million grant from HUD could turn the abandoned school into a spectacular senior housing residence.  “It’s an implementation grant that our housing authority is a finalist. No guarantees but if we make it, that would be one of the projects,” Gusciora explained.  Gusciora said any redevelopment had hoped to save many of the historic parts of the building, “especially all the wood floors,” Gusciora explained.  It is also reported that three additional small fires occurred at neighboring homes that were put out immediately by tenants or firefighters in the area.  The fire has since been deemed under control and a perimeter has been put around the building to keep people from entering.  Earlier this year, residents complained that students were entering the school and spending entire days inside. Police allegedly made attempts to prevent a constant flow of trespassers.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

Both children suffered burns over 70% of their bodies, said Destiny Davis, a granddaughter of homeowner Sharon Davis. Medical personnel at VCU Medical Center in Richmond continue to stabilize the kids, ages one and two.  “They’re going to be here for a couple of months,” Destiny Davis estimated. “They're going to have to learn to walk again.”  Her 72-year-old grandmother, who also was taken to VCU Medical Center for smoke inhalation, has been given a tube to help her breathe.  “She was able to squeeze my hand,” Destiny Davis said. “She’s going to be OK.”  All three, however, were still listed in critical condition at the hospital.  Sharon Davis and three of her great-grandchildren were in the home in the 1100 block of Covington Road when the fire broke out around 3:50 p.m. One of the children was able to get out, but fire officials said the other two were trapped upstairs and had to be rescued.  Sharon Davis had been helped by a neighbor and was standing in her yard when the authorities arrived.  Once everyone was out of the house, firefighters had the blaze under control in around 16 minutes. However, the damage inside was extensive.  “They lost everything,” Destinay Davis said, adding that a GoFundMe site was being established to help.  Kat McCay, owner of Old Towne’s Alibi and Loco Kitty in Petersburg, set up a special Venmo account Tuesday. One hundred percent of Tuesday’s profits are going to the family, McKay said.

Tuesday’s training is part of a weeklong training at State Fire School on campus and at training structures in the Toledo area.  On Tuesday, well over a dozen firefighters set up their gear at the top of Doyt Perry football stadium in Bowling Green for rope rescue training.  “There are water towers, there are antennas, there are quarries, there are steep ravines, there are lots of different potentials that are out there not just mountain climbing and cliffs like people you are going to apply these skills,” said the instructor and retired Columbus firefighter Gary Hamilton.  Zach Bukszar went over the forty-foot wall for the first time, a chemist by day, Bukszar is a volunteer firefighter back home in Twinsburg, Ohio.  “Um, terrifying, but I mean I got to watch everybody put everything together and make sure all those safety protocols are in place so I know that there is no real danger, it’s just you know getting initially over that edge is the biggest hard part, then once you are kind of in there and you can feel that you are supported it gets a lot easier,” Bukszar said.  Just up the road in Toledo, firefighters were picking apart an abandoned home, during the Street Smart Engine and Truck class.  “Trying to pass on knowledge to younger inexperienced firefighters to get them some real-world hands-on experience,” said Lt.

(WPRI) — All of Southern New England is under a Red Flag Warning and Fire Weather Watch due to the warm and dry conditions.  The R.I. Department of Emergency Management (DEM) is urging the public to be cautious and avoid outdoor burning since the conditions increase the chance of fires spreading more quickly. This means no campfires, charcoal or cooking fires, and using any devices that emit flames or embers.  Fire officials also believe many recent brush fires may have been started by improperly disposed cigarettes.  Crews are currently battling a brush fire in the woods off Fisher Street in Attleboro.  (Story continues below video.)  Rhode Island has seen its fair share of brush fires in the past month, including one that burned as many as 600 acres of land in Exeter.  “The last time we had the Red Flag Warnings is when we had that large fire in Exeter, so it’s definitely a ‘watch out’ situation for the fire community right now,” DEM Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin said.  “Being so recently that we just had large fires, having this Red Flag Warning again is putting us on a high alert absolutely,” he continued.  The DEM says if you see a brush fire to remain calm and call 911.

It is 19 years old. Would you put a Home Depot stove in a commercial building? The Viking stove at Station 2 cost the town $6,300.00 in 2001,” says Fierro. “MFD has never prioritized Viking stoves and Nautilus equipment over safety. The silly conversation about Viking stoves holds no merit; they are 20 years or older and have and continue to serve the town well.”  Regarding Nautilus Gym equipment, Fierro says it was acquired by a grant awarded in the 2001-2002 years that was written by Battalion Chief Durning.  “Most of our other equipment is donated by residents that are moving away, and they offer it to the Fire Department,” he says.  Fierro also states that the radios at Station 3 “do work and always work. If a repair is made or there is an issue, every Officer and Firefighter is issued a personal radio and a radio in the Engine; the backup plan has a backup plan. Our radios are not substandard; they still do the job, just not supportive, and challenging to get parts for they have timed out.”  Regarding the request for more firefighters, Fierro says hiring more firefighters is to replace retired members and keep everyone safe.  “To state we are not a serious department on what basis, I stand behind all our members and have a diverse team of Professional Firefighters that other departments admire; our training level is above and beyond,” he adds.  Fierro responded to comments made in the lawsuit about Fire House #3 conditions and also by resident Eileen Birmingham.  “Station 3 is not a “gulag,” I was stationed there for 11 years and enjoyed every minute of it. The people in the neighborhood I met and the flowers we planted all represent that we were happy and proud to be there. Hypothetically in my opinion, if you wanted to punish someone, you would move them to the busiest rig in town, Engine 1 or Truck 1, located at headquarters,” he said.  Fierro says the stove at Station 3 is approximately six years old.  “I remember it being delivered and installed, and it functions 100%. The Sunday gravy we cook on all three stoves tastes the same; i will verify that I’ve personally been at all three Firehouses over my career.”  Fierro writes that there are four paid studies stating that Station 3 is needed.  “Dismissing the studies because they do not fit one narrative is, at best, disappointing,” says Fierro. “Eileen [Birmingham] was given these studies and is quoted ‘I choose not to accept 20-year-old data,’ even though all reports say we are understaffed at 90 Firefighters.”  Fierro says no one has mentioned that the Firefighters 100% renovated Station 2 kitchen and two bathrooms and a Station 3 Bathroom, with the town only paying for material and firefighters doing all labor.  Fierro also writes that MFD staff is full of Montclair residents. He says that information about these buildings has become false and mentions “pop-in visits from the CFO to inspect the buildings, take photos, and interview members.”  “Traditionally, this request is made to the Chief’s office, and a guided tour is scheduled. We do not let people wander around restricted areas and living quarters with personal items left about. It would be irresponsible to our members. Yes, the building is public; however, some areas are not, similar to areas of Town Hall where the public is not allowed to enter at will or sit in on meetings and ask questions. I have had multiple members call and feel uncomfortable and are exploring formal complaints.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyaXN0YW5ldC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9tZmQtdW5pb24tcmVmdXRlcy1jbGFpbXMtcmVnYXJkaW5nLWZpcmUtaG91c2UtMy1hbmQtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An autopsy was expected to be performed at Albany Medical Center on Tuesday to positively determine the cause of death, Amsterdam Fire Chief Anthony Agresta said.  Another 51-year-old male resident of the second floor apartment was able to exit the building on his own and alerted police at the scene that his roommate was still inside.  Four individuals living in the first floor apartment were able to leave the building on their own and have been displaced by the fire. Five dogs and two cats were killed.  Multiple callers reported the fire around 6:48 p.m. on Monday. The second floor porch was fully involved when Amsterdam fire crews and police arrived on the scene.  The fire spread through the second floor apartment and entered the attic area of the two-family home. The first floor apartment sustained water damage.  Agresta confirmed the surviving roommate received medical attention following the fire, but declined to provide further details regarding the man’s condition or his identity.  “Unfortunately, I’m not able to confirm his identity,” Agresta said.

A fast response by firefighters confined the fire to the exterior balcony.  Columbus firefighters were sent to the apartment complex at 9:43 p.m. Monday on a report of an apartment fire at 3586 Nicholas Lane after a fire was reported on a second story balcony, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  Firefighters arrived on the scene in less than five minutes of the dispatch and reported a working fire with flames showing. Columbus police, also on the scene, assisted firefighters by notifying neighboring apartment occupants of the fire and aiding in the evacuation of the building, Wilson said. With an evacuation underway and additional firefighters enroute to the scene, the first arriving engine company charged a hose line and advanced into the second floor apartment. As crews entered the apartment, they found the interior of the apartment was clear of fire. Crews pushed to the balcony where they found fire burning up a vinyl sided wall. Firefighters extinguished the flames within seconds of their arrival on the balcony, Wilson said.  Firefighters removed a section of the balcony ceiling and confirmed that that fire was confined to the exterior balcony and did not extend into the apartment’s attic space or apartment’s interior living space.  Fire department investigators learned from the tenant that a family member had been smoking a cigarette on the balcony earlier in the evening and discarded it in a cardboard box that was being used to collect cigarette butts, Wilson said. Investigators said that the cardboard box had completely burned away but a large amount of cigarette butts were located in that location. Investigators ruled the fire accidental as a result of improper cigarette disposal.  Captain Troy Todd, Columbus Fire Department fire investigator, said that the department sees fires similar to this incident each year. “We have seen a number of significant-damage fires occur in the city from improper cigarette disposal. This type of fire is easily preventable if proper disposal takes place,” he said.  Damage from the fire is estimated at approximately $5,000.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include the Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services. No injuries were reported at the scene.  The Columbus Fire Department recommends that all smoking material be disposed of in a noncombustible container. The container should also be periodically emptied to prevent a collection of material within the container. Materials may be doused with water to confirm that the smoking materials are completely extinguished.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2NmZC1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWRpc2NhcmRlZC1jaWdhcmV0dGUtbGVhZHMtdG8tYXBhcnRtZW50LWJhbGNvbnktZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Worcester"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:59:19","It’s rare for very high fire danger classification in New England, especially over a large area, but Tuesday brings exactly that – from central Vermont and New Hampshire to just south of the Massachusetts Turnpike, including Worcester and Boston. The threat for brush fire development and growth is very high, owing to recent dry conditions, dry brush and dry air with warming temperatures.  Additionally, a gusty westerly wind to 30 mph for many and up to 40 mph on Cape Cod, becoming southwest late in the day, will contribute to fire spread and this can apply to both brush fires and building fires, as any type of fire thrives on wind to grow and spread. Though Tuesday morning clouds have been thinning for strengthening sun, wildfire smoke from distant fires in western Canada will thicken in our New England sky Tuesday, carried thousands of feet above our heads by the jet stream winds aloft, contributing to a colorful Tuesday evening sunset and Wednesday morning sunrise.  Though that smoke doesn’t directly make it to the ground, there’s just enough pollution in southern New England air for moderate air quality – noticed only by those with respiratory problems – and pollen continues to fill the air. A cold front dropping south from Canada will carry scattered showers from north to south Tuesday late evening and overnight, not arriving to southeastern New England until predawn Wednesday, dropping only hundredths of an inch of rain for communities that see them, and perhaps not surviving the trip at all for the southwest quarter of New England.  Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.  So, fire danger and pollen continues Wednesday, though a drop of about 20 degrees in daytime high temperature owing to the new, cooler air from Canada should mean the relative humidity of the air isn’t quite as dry. The busy, northerly breeze Wednesday will gust to 30 mph at times and will ensure high temperatures near 60 feel like the 50s even at the warmest time of day – a big drop from one day prior! As dry and fair weather continues, temperatures climb incrementally to the mid 60s, then around 70 degrees, respectively, on Thursday and Friday. A sluggish cold front will approach New England this weekend, though timing has been somewhat variable in the forecast. 24 hours ago, it looked like the front may arrive with scattered rain showers on Sunday.

The fire has since been determined arson by the Maine Forest Service, Farmington Fire Chief Timothy Hardy reported.  The Farmington Fire Department received the call around 6:30 p.m. on Monday evening, but it took time before they arrived at the scene due to the difficult location. Chief Hardy stated that the challenge was accessing the fire in order to put it out due to a lack of roads or trails in the area. It was impossible to get firetrucks directly to the fire, and Red Schoolhouse Road was blocked off for over two hours to allow firetrucks to reach as close to the scene as possible. Even so, the responding departments had to cut a trail through the trees to the fire.  There was also difficulty with water access. Firefighters used backpack pumps and hand tools to bring water to the remote site. ATVs with water tanks and pumps from the Farmington, Kingfield, and Jay Fire Departments were used to shuttle equipment and water back and forth.  Leaf litter and small trees were burned, although nothing large was reached by the fire, which was completely doused by around 9:30 p.m. when the responders left the site.  The Farmington Fire Department returned to the scene early Tuesday morning and saw that the fire was still out. The Maine Forest Service also returned on Tuesday to conduct investigations into the origins of the fire, which are still on-going. It has been officially determined that the fire was caused by arson.  Mutual aid partners from several surrounding towns were on the scene to assist Farmington, including the Jay Fire Department, Wilton Fire Department, Industry Volunteer Fire and Rescue, Temple Fire Department, New Sharon Fire Department and Kingfield Fire Department, as well as the Maine Forest Service. Mutual aid partners began to leave the scene between 8:30 and 9:30 p.m., as darkness began to set in.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHlidWxsZG9nLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpcmUtb2ZmLXdoaXN0bGVzdG9wLXRyYWlsLWNhdXNlZC1ieS1hcnNvbi1hdXRob3JpdGllcy1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Two officers had arrived to check on reports of a noise, and realized there was an active fire.  After calling for help, other officers joined in to form a human tower of top of an air conditioning register and passed Rebecca Dampier’s two children, Andrew Dampier and Alexandria Carter, down to safety. Rebecca then jumped and was caught by the officers.  Vermilion County Deputy Seth Moody received honors from Danville Police Chief Christopher Yates, along with Danville officers Jered Greer, Ayden Lamar, Scott Showers, and Damon Bellik.  Ironically, Rebecca’s father was a Chicago Firefighter for years, knew the movie Backdraft very well, and had passed some of that knowledge on to Rebecca.

Upon arrival at the scene, the fire department found the front porch engulfed in flames. Fire personnel immediately began an exterior attack, and disconnected electric and gas utilities.  Once the exterior fire was under control, firefighters worked to extinguish fire that spread into the structural part of the house, extending to the attic. Firefighters were able to enter the house and begin the interior attack.  Once inside, fire personnel reported the home unoccupied. A hole was cut into the roof to allow for ventilation. Once the fire was reported to be under control, with only a few smoldering areas remaining, firefighters conducted a secondary search. A small dog was found deceased in the house.  Interior crews then exited the house and firefighters continued to extinguish smoldering areas, and hot spots. Smoke continued to emanate from underneath the metal roof, so a portion of the roof was pulled back to extinguish the remaining embers.  The house sustained heavy damage. The fire department was able to protect all of the nearby exposures, and no civilian or firefighter injuries were reported.  The Pittsburg Fire Department, Pittsburg Police Department, Crawford County EMS, Kansas Gas Service, and Evergy responded to the scene.  The cause of the fire remains undetermined at this time.

"fire","2023-11-01","00:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:45:00","By Debbie Rogers  [email protected]  MILLBURY — Lake Township voters will most likely decide on funding a full-time fire department in November.  At Tuesday’s meeting, the trustees continued discussion on a possible 4.2-mill levy.  “If we’re going to put a levy on the ballot, we’ve got to start taking action pretty rapidly,” said Trustee Richard Welling.  According to the Wood County Auditor’s Office, an additional 4.2-mill levy would raise $1.2 million and cost the owner of a $100,000 home $147 per year.  Fire Chief Barrett Dorner said that the current personnel situation in the township is dire. The community needs to decide the direction for the future, he said.  “We’re willing to provide whatever service the community is willing to pay for,” he said, adding that more community question-and-answer sessions will be held.  “It’s not a scare tactic,” Dorner added. “We just need to be honest with you about what we can do now.”  Request for fire and EMS service is up 70% in the last eight years, he said.  “If that keeps going, our 1,600 runs a year right now will be almost 3,000 runs in 2031,” Dorner said. “We are going to continue our rapid growth, and hopefully it stays consistent and we don’t see a big spike.”  He said he wants to be up front about the department’s current capabilities.  There are two people on staff, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  They rely heavily on backup from neighboring departments.  The department has four levies, which total 4.8 mills, for financial support. The 2022 operating budget was $1.5 million.  Total annual payroll is $795,000, Dorner said  The department relies on administrative staff to respond to calls, when needed. That pulls people away from other responsibilities, such as grant writing, Dorner said.  Volunteers still work for the department, but they are mainly available at night and weekends.  “Those are our slowest time periods. Our busiest is 8 a.m.-8 p.m.,” Dorner said. “They’re available when we need them the least. I wish that wasn’t the case.”  Finding paramedics, especially ones to work part time, is incredibly difficult, right now, he added.  “One of the inspiring things that I’ve heard through all this … if we had full-time (positions open) we would have a line out the door of our people who want to work in Lake Township,” Dorner said. “That’s not everywhere.”  Another levy — or an addition to the proposed levy — is also being discussed.  “I want to bring dispatch back,” said Trustee Lorie Davis on Tuesday.  The township last operated dispatch in 2015. When costs became too high, the township contracted with the Wood County Sheriff’s Office.  Since then, the service has continued to improve, Dorner said on Tuesday.  “We are really reshaping fire dispatch in Wood County,” he said. “They’ve done an outstanding job of working with us.  Dorner said dispatch would cost at least another $500,000 and he requested more time to review the request.  Fiscal Officer Buddy Ritson said that if the trustees want to bring back dispatch and need a levy for it, there should be two separate requests.  “The fire fund is not healthy at this time,” Ritson said.  Building something from scratch right now will be expensive and take time, Dorner said.  After the meeting, Ritson said the township is paying $10,051 per month to the sheriff’s office for dispatch.  Davis said she strongly believes Lake Township should have its own emergency dispatch.  “I feel that dispatch is an important thing here in our own township,” Davis said.  The township, Northwood and Rossford commissioned a study last year to look into combining fire and EMS operations.  According to the study, which was released earlier this year, Lake Township has 54 personnel, with some full-time positions and mostly paid-on-call workers.  After the meeting, Dorner said the idea of combining the three departments is not dead. It’s just going to take too much time to come to fruition and Lake needs action now, he said.  Also at the meeting, the trustees:  • Approved $35,000 to Bowers Asphalt and Paving, Inc., Walbridge, to repair roads.  • Authorized $4,295 to Kaylor Plumbing, Wiring and Heating Inc., Genoa, for electrical repairs to the shelter house and kitchen in Friendship Park.  • Voted to buy firefighting foam from Advanced Eco Systems Inc., Tallmadge, for $1,478.  • Approved paying $1,437 to Speck Sales Inc. for two rear tires for the 2107 New Holland road mower.  • Voted to authorize the purchase and installation of new chain guards on the HI-WAY machine for $1,291. Gledhill Machinery Co., Galion, will do the work.  • Hired Mark Halliday and William Cook as firefighters for $10.10 an hour.  • Accepted resignations from Dakota Crabtree, Hunter Hayes, Tyler Clark and Amy Perry, who are EMTs and firefighters.  • Appointed Zachary Jenkins to the zoning commission for a five-year term.  • Reappointed Donald Nichols and John Sigurdson to the zoning board of appeals for a five-year term.  • Heard April department reports. Zoning issued five permits and collected $900. Police made three arrests and issued 15 citations. Fire and EMS had 92 calls. There were seven burials and three cremations at the cemetery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9mdWxsLXRpbWUtZmlyZS1hbmQtZW1zLWZvci1sYWtlLW1heS1iZS1vbi1ub3ZlbWJlci1iYWxsb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fire, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:    Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team.

Jasmine R. Miller was taken into custody last Thursday and charged with one count of arson — knowingly damaging by fire the dwelling of another without consent, a level-four felony, court records reviewed by Law&Crime show.  According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the Daily Journal, firefighters in Johnson County at about 2:09 a.m. on March 30, 2023, responded to a house fire at a residence located in the 200 block of Restin Road, approximately 120 miles south of Indianapolis. Detectives with the county sheriff’s office arrived about an hour after the fire started and began the search for Miller, who allegedly started the fire before taking her daughter and fleeing the scene on foot. The home reportedly belonged to her then-boyfriend, whose name was not included in the report.  Investigators said that Miller started the fire over an argument with her boyfriend that began on the evening of March 29 about her being at a casino, the Journal reported. During the argument, Miller reportedly sent a text to her boyfriend saying she was going to “drive his f—— truck through [his house].”  The boyfriend was afraid Miller might be serious and filed a report with the sheriff’s office. As a direct result of his report, deputies reportedly arrested Miller when she left the casino and charged her with operating a vehicle without a license.  Miller’s boyfriend picked her up from jail in the early morning hours of March 30 and the two reportedly continued to fight, with Miller blaming him for her arrest. Before they arrived back at the house, Miller reportedly declared that she would be packing her things and moving to her mother’s house.  Miller then proceeded to pack some of her belongings into garbage bags and began loading them into her boyfriend’s truck, per the Journal. While loading the truck, Miller’s boyfriend said he smelled smoke and when he went inside to investigate he saw that all of the clothing in his closet had been set aflame.  “He observed his clothes [that were] hanging from racks on the north wall were on fire,” the affidavit reportedly states.  According to the Journal, the boyfriend briefly confronted Miller before making sure the house was clear of kids and pets. While he was checking the house, Miller reportedly fled the area on foot with her young daughter in tow.  In an interview with detectives, Miller’s boyfriend reportedly said she kept butane torch lighters in the house which she used for smoking meth and likely used to light the fire. In a backyard a few houses away from the boyfriend’s home, investigators reportedly found a purse containing two butane torch lighters and casino player cards in Miller’s name.  An investigator with the White River Township Fire Department determined that the cause of the fire was “incendiary” and the source of ignition was “an open flame being introduced to clothing,” Indianapolis Fox affiliate WXIN reported.  Following her arrest, Miller was booked at the Johnson County Jail where she is currently being held on $100,000 cash-only bond, jail records show.  Have a tip we should know?

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.  ESPN's Tim Bontemps contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjYxNjIwL3NvdXJjZXMtNzZlcnMtZmlyZS1jb2FjaC1kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLXRocmVlLXNlYXNvbnPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2MTYyMC9zb3VyY2VzLTc2ZXJzLWZpcmUtY29hY2gtZG9jLXJpdmVycy10aHJlZS1zZWFzb25zP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

ODF said a fire detection camera that was set up last Fall, played a key role in alerting firefighters to the fire’s location.  Crews said the fire was stopped at half an acre, but if gone unnoticed could have grown much larger.  “We were able to see smoke from a portion of the state that previously wouldn’t have that early detection and we were able to get it at a half-acre rather than potentially having to wait overnight to have people return then see the smoke,” said ODF Public Affairs, Jessica Prakke.

Download the app.  On October 23, 2022, Jim Henterly sat on the passenger bench of a National Park Service AStar helicopter, peering out at the craggy expanse of North Cascades National Park. Next to him was a firefighter from the NOCA (North Cascades) wildland crew, and directly in front of them stood 6,102-foot Desolation Peak. It was an unorthodox move for the parks system to allow the helicopter into the backcountry, but a moderately active fire that had broken out late in the season near Ross Lake, less than 2 miles downhill from Desolation Peak, had closed the trails. On the summit, a cabin covered in silver tinfoil glimmered in the sun like a wrapped Christmas present in a sea of craggy peaks. The first dusting of snow that patched the ground and frosted the roof added to the impression.  It had been a month since Henterly, the resident fire lookout on Desolation, left for the season, unable to properly close the lookout cabin for the winter because of the ongoing wildfire activity. After his lookout season ended in September and he went home to Whatcom county, Henterly didn’t know if he’d return before the following June. But the Desolation Fire, as it became known, climbed halfway uphill toward the lookout cabin, threatening to burn it down. In an effort to preserve it, fire crews had wrapped the 14 ½ by 14 ½-foot wooden structure in a foil blanket. And now, with the threat of the fire passed, Jim returned to remove the foil, inspect the structure, and prepare it for the heavy snows of a North Cascades winter.  To his relief, Henterly, who has spent seven seasons scanning for smoke atop Desolation, found no damage to the lookout cabin or any of its equipment. The structure itself has stood atop Desolation for almost a century, but this latest fire isn’t the only thing that threatens its continued existence as the last staffed fire lookout in North Cascades National Park.  The Desolation Peak lookout armored against approaching flames. (Photo: Alex Depue)  The summer before, I spent some time with Henterly at Desolation, which is also one of the few remaining staffed lookouts in the entire state of Washington. After corresponding by email for months, I met him at the tail end of the season. After a rigorous 5-mile hike with nearly 5,000 feet of elevation gain, I made it to the ridgeline and got my first glimpse of the cabin. With the shutters propped up, the structure gave me the impression of a single-story pagoda, symbolism that added to my reverence of this place. A man with deeply kind eyes and the svelte body of a lifelong hiker in his sixties, Henterly was cleaning the cabin and readying it for winter when I arrived. A big storm was forecast to sweep into the region within days and the shutters of the mostly glass structure would need to be fastened.  The Desolation Peak fire lookout stands about a foot off the ground on cinder blocks, in the foreground of the twin-fanged peaks of Mt. Hozomeen. The box-like building is painted a light shade called “lookout gray,” and its shutters are raised during fire season to reveal windows on all sides. The interior of the small cabin is a calming green called “Irish meadows,” which, like the exterior color, the Forest Service used regularly for lookouts and the National Park Service maintains for historical continuity. Against the four walls are a lone cot, a desk with an ancient hand-crank coffee grinder, and a bookshelf. In the center of the room sits the Osborne Fire Finder, a device that resembles a high circular table with sights and a map, and can give ranges and bearings from any location within view. Its purpose is to pinpoint smoke and flames so that the operator can dispatch wildland firefighting crews to the blaze’s exact location.  Henterly trained for decades to earn his spot as a lookout at Desolation. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  As he went about stowing objects under the cabin, Henterly told me how he trained as a wildland firefighter and fire lookout for over 20 years to get this post. Some years standing watch as a lookout can be slow with very little fire activity, but these last few years have mirrored the amplified wildfire season that the rest of the West has experienced. Henterly told me about a fire a few years back that holds special significance to him, and he showed me how he used the Osborne Fire Finder to acquire the location by lining up the sights of two apertures that rotate around the map. That fire was classified a monitor-only situation because it was in the remote wilderness of the Arctic Creek drainage north of Mt. Prophet. On his small desk was the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio he used to call in the coordinates and updates to headquarters. Henterly’s job was to observe, document, and relay the life of the flame. Because he found it, the Fire Management Office designated it the Arctic Jim Fire.  Built in 1932, this lookout tower near the border of Washington and British Columbia has long stood as a symbol of firefighting in the West. A century atop a mountain has given this structure a character all its own, with remnants from previous tenants ranging from books and cups to maps and memorabilia. From the outside, it’s the only man-made object in sight, aside from an outhouse a few yards beyond. It’s not surprising that it has captured the imaginations of backpackers, writers, and historians for decades.  Jack Kerouac was the first to introduce me to fire lookouts through his novels Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels, both of which chronicled his experience as a fire lookout on Desolation in the summer of 1956. Notable nature writers Gary Snyder, Norman Maclean, Edward Abbey, and Phillip Connors have also written about the monk-like experience of living in a glass house on a mountaintop. These stories drew me to visit the historic Desolation Peak Lookout 13 years ago, and I’ve revisited the site a handful of times since, along with countless other lookouts across the region.  According to the Forest Fire Lookout Association (FFLA), fire lookouts proliferated between 1930 and 1950, when the Forest Service maintained more than 5,000 towers around the country, mostly concentrated in the forests of the western United States. During this era, Washington alone built 660 alpine lookouts. Since the 1950s, government agencies have torn down many of these lookouts due to disrepair or destruction in forest fires. A number of nonprofit preservation groups like the FFLA maintain some of the remaining structures for public enjoyment.  In a 2019 survey, the FFLA estimated that only around 300 lookout towers were still staffed in the United States, mostly by volunteers, and those small numbers continue to dwindle due to advances in technology. With the use of drones, satellites, aircraft, and even fixed camera systems, the role of fire lookout is quickly becoming obsolete. In Washington, only 93 lookout towers remain, and only a third of those ever host an actual person. Of these few, only a handful are paid, part-time positions within the National Park or National Forest services during any given fire season, which is usually between June and September. The heightened fire activity in the West has not led to higher staffing levels of fire lookouts. Not yet.  Henterly tells me a pivotal role of the lookout at Desolation is to relay radio messages from field crews to headquarters in the park. These radio dispatches, pertaining to ongoing wildfires, trail work, and even rescues, are too far away for headquarters to pick up. Jim constantly monitors every word that comes out of his handheld. It could be a firefighter Mayday, or a mishap that needs to be passed on. Every evening he relays his own report to HQ.  During the 2022 lookout season, Jim proved the importance of his work and the value of fire lookouts in general. During the height of the fire season, he monitored and reported on approximately 20 different wildfires, not only within North Cascades National Park, but also in the neighboring Pasayten Wilderness and in Canada. His dispatches provided critical information to fire crews and a low-cost alternative to the exorbitant financial costs of reconnaissance flights. Those flights are intermittent, and Jim’s constant attention, coupled with regular radio reports, provides vital information with little overhead. The work that Jim does, and the necessity of Desolation Lookout, is so vital that fire crews hiked to the peak last fall to wrap it in protective foil, so that its mission may continue in the future. With the growing fire seasons created by climate change, it seems that lookouts are more important than ever. Perhaps Jim and Desolation Lookout will inspire government agencies to invest, one more time, in the tried and true method of fighting fire by posting fire watchers to stand guard against our burning world.  (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  Meanwhile, the few remaining towers are garnering huge interest from outdoor enthusiasts, perhaps due to the fact that the role of the fire lookout is slowly fading into history. Backpackers can rent many of these structures overnight. Some are open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis and are often crammed full of campers during the height of summer. These communal barracks are especially sought-after for Pacific Northwest hikers, who ascend steep mountain terrain in droves for a chance to sleep protected amongst the high peaks. Regional blogs keep track of what lookouts are available to rent, which ones are free to stay in, and log the currently staffed locations, so visitors can hike to the cabins themselves and hear first-hand what it’s like to be a fire lookout.  The lives of lookout personnel require patience uncommon in our time, distilled with enduring focus. Every minute or so during my visit, Henterly returned his gaze to 360-degree scans of the surrounding landscape, stalling our conversation and creating stretches of silence that punctuated his stories. Much of the fire season has no sign of smoke, so his vigil can become endlessly repetitive. Luckily for Henterly, his view is inspiring. There are mountains on all sides, spreading out in ripples of ridgelines and glaciated peaks that comprise the northern expanse of the Cascade mountains.  It’s useful for lookouts to have personal interests to fill the quiet moments. For Henterly, drawing is a way to while away the daylight. With a pencil, he sketches finely detailed pictures that can fit into the palm of your hand. He’s drawn portraits of nature writers and mythical creatures, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s ents, which are enormous walking and talking trees. The sketches merge with his lookout tasks, as the contrast of light smoke on a dark landscape parallel the lead on white paper. Over the seasons, he’s turned his sketches into stickers that he’s posted around the cabin with quotes from his favorite authors.  On the doorpost, I noticed a sticker Henterly drew with John Muir’s quote, “One can make a day of any size.” It’s a fitting adage for a fire lookout. Because Henterly’s been lucky to staff this lookout for consecutive seasons, he’s grown familiar with this corner of the backcountry. He’s watched a black bear become a mother, guiding her cub through the blueberry bushes until it was finally big enough to venture out on its own. There are also two large ravens that perch on the rooftop of his cabin, and they too welcomed offspring to their avian family. Last year their chick went missing. Henterly recalled the peregrine falcon and Cooper’s hawk that preyed upon the ravens in previous seasons. He hoped the young raven went off on its own, like the young bear.  While the animals have become Henterly’s closest community, there are regular pilgrims, like me, that come to visit the lookout. After so much time alone, Henterly welcomes the opportunity to talk with other humans face-to-face. In these dwindling days of staffed lookouts, Henterly has become a storyteller, sharing the deep history of this place with people who have traveled from all over the world. He told me how Native Americans quarried stones for tools from this ridge for at least 9,000 years. In 1859, a Swiss topographer named Henry Custer explored the area with Native guides and created maps from their journeys. Early U.S. Forest rangers and firefighters, like Ed Pulaski, fought and sometimes gave their lives to protect the land. Trail crews, volunteering their time, maintain the trail and the lookout. Fire crews treasure it as an icon. A long line of lookouts has staffed this peak, including Jack Kerouac, with his vision of a coming generation of backpackers heading into the wilderness.  The lookout on a smoky evening. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  I noticed a quote by Barry Lopez on the cabin wall: “One of the great dreams of man must be to find some place between the extremes of nature and civilization where it is possible to live without regret.” That ignited a conversation with Henterly about the important work of environmental authors, Lopez and Gary Snyder, Thoreau and Emerson. Talking to Henterly, I felt blissfully lost. I had dreamt of this place for so long, and now I had experienced it personally, making it a small part of my own story. But I didn’t want to outstay my welcome, so I thanked Henterly for his hospitality and slowly began the trek to my campsite at the southern tip of Starvation Ridge. Henterly walked with me along the alpine meadow. We stopped to scan for the young black bear, and he invited me to return in the morning for a cup of black coffee and more talk of our shared interests.  Back at my camp, more than 15 miles in any direction from the nearest road, I watched the dark of the night unfurl like a blanket over Starvation Ridge as pinpricks of stars poked through the sky. My eyelids grew heavy. There on that primeval post, one of the last of the fire watchers stood guard against the elements. Though I couldn’t see the lookout from my campsite, I imagined the lone light of the tower burning like a lantern in a sea of darkened peaks. It’s been burning in my mind these past years, a beacon of inspiration that draws backpacking pilgrims like me to this vast wilderness. Its light will burn longer still: In June 2023, Jim Henterly will begin his eighth consecutive season as Desolation Peak’s fire lookout.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhY2twYWNrZXIuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvbGFzdC1maXJlLWxvb2tvdXQtbm9ydGgtY2FzY2FkZXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtcGFyay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 02:51:05","A voluntary safety recall announced Tuesday highlights a problem some Jeep Grand Cherokee owners have been dealing with for years.  Michigan-based automaker Chrysler announced on Tuesday the voluntary safety recall of Jeep Cherokees, model years 2014 to 2016, that the automaker says are at-risk of catching fire, even when their engines are turned off.  The recall centers around the “power liftgate module” system, which is a motor system that opens and closes the rear hatch or cargo compartment of the vehicles.  Chrysler told federal regulators that water can seep into these liftgate module systems, potentially sparking a fire.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “An electrical short in the power liftgate module may lead to a vehicle fire with the ignition on or off,” Chrysler said in its formal recall notice filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Photo of where a ""power liftgate module"" is located in a Jeep Cherokee's rear hatch, according to an NHTSA filing by Chrysler in 2015.  The recall applies to at least 132,000 Jeep Cherokee models, the automaker told regulators, but some media reports have estimated more than 200,000 models could be at risk.  There is no repair or remedy at this time to fix the problem, so Chrysler is advising all owners of these vehicles to park them outside until further notice.  “Owners are advised to park outside and away from structures until the recall repair is complete,” the automaker told regulators. “The remedy is currently under development.”  Consumer advocates say the “park outside” part of the recall announcement could be especially hard for some Chicago owners, who rely on indoor parking garages.  “In some of the recent recalls where there’s a park outside warning, we’re seeing vehicles turned away from parking garages, even folks who have a monthly contract are told they can’t park in the garage until the recall repair has been performed,” said Michael Brooks, the Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety.  Brooks said owners need to take the recall notice seriously.  “NHTSA doesn’t issue a lot of ‘park outside’ warnings, so when they do, it’s important that owners heed that,” Brooks said.  In its formal filings with regulators, Chrysler said it began investigating concerns over “cargo compartment fires” in these vehicles in 2022, but customer reports to the company about the problem date back to 2017.  The filings indicate Chrysler may have received dozens of reports of fires taking place, but as of April 27, the automaker said it is “not aware of any accidents or injuries potentially related to this issue.”  A 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Jeep Cherokee owners may feel a sense of deja vu over the liftgate problem.  Back in October 2015, Chrysler announced a safety recall regarding the same liftgate fire issue in 2014 and 2015 models of the Jeep Cherokee, according to prior NHTSA filings reviewed by NBC 5 Responds.  At that time, Chrysler said it would install water shields to prevent moisture from corroding the liftgate module, in order to prevent the risk of fire.  But now, Chrysler said “Vehicles repaired under the prior recalls will still need to have the new remedy performed,” once it’s developed.  “This exact same defect is still occurring,” Brooks said. “And it looks like between the time that first fix was implemented to today, there have been between 50-100 fires, it’s a little unclear from their filings. That’s a large number of vehicle fires.”  No timeline was shared by Chrysler for when a new remedy to the problem will be developed.  For more information, Jeep Cherokee owners can call Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) at 1-800-853-1403, or contact the NHTSA Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or visit www.nhtsa.gov.

"fire","2023-05-01","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:06:47","Fire can be a force for either good or bad. For instance, the words “all fired up!” usually connotes positive feelings whereas the phrase “you’re fired!” can mean that you have been involuntarily deselected from the workforce.  Fire can destroy or renew. A little of both took place at our farm recently.  A year ago last May an unpredicted and unpredictable derecho struck our region. Our farmstead, like many others, lost dozens of trees. The number of trees in our shelterbelt that were busted off or uprooted could officially be classified as “more than you can shake a stick at.”  Like many homeowners in our region, I quickly formed a close personal relationship with my chainsaw. We are eternally grateful for all the help we received from neighbors and friends who pitched in with the cleanup. The downed trees were pitched into a brush pile that grew to approximately the same size and tonnage as a house.  Last week I decided that it was time to burn the brush pile. It seemed fitting that it was almost a year to the day after the derecho.  One cannot simply conduct a major burn on a whim nowadays. One must alert the authorities so that they can be prepared in case things get out of hand. Another factor is that people who live hereabouts become nervous whenever they see a large plume of smoke rising into the sky. Such a thing is likely to be reported to the authorities, causing enormous amounts of undue consternation and perhaps a visit from your local fire department.  I watched the weather forecast closely and chose a day that promised light winds. Early on the morning of the burn I strolled down to the brush pile accompanied by our faithful farm dog, Bella.  “Don’t play with fire!” is an admonishment that’s often issued to little boys. This only serves to make fire seem all the more fascinating to the boy. Our family incinerated our household refuse when I was a kid and I frequently volunteered to tend the burn barrel. I thus acquired a deep respect for the way fire can behave. Liquid accelerants cost me more than one set of eyebrows.  A few well-placed wadded-up newspapers were all that was needed to ignite the brush pile. Within seconds the fire had leaped from twig to branch, roaring greedily as it gobbled the desiccated wood.  The heat quickly became surprisingly intense. Even at 50 feet away, Bella and I were beginning to feel quite toasty. We probably could have roasted weenies right where we stood.  Bella sat at my feet and peered up at me with an anxious expression that seemed to say, “Dad? Don’t you see what’s happening? Are you sure that everything is OK?”  I assured her that things were going exactly as planned. “But maybe we should back up a few yards,” I told her. “If we stand this close much longer, we’ll both soon be hot dogs.”  It was one of those rare mornings here on the prairie when the wind was virtually nonexistent. This happens about as often as a visit from Halley’s Comet.  Some of the trees in the brush pile were absolutely huge. One of them had a trunk that appeared to be the same diameter as a rear tractor tire. There could be no doubt that this tree was more than 100 years old. This meant there could also be no doubt that it had been planted by my great-grandfather Charlie Sveen, who homesteaded our farm.  Glancing at the garden hose at my feet, I thought about how Charlie had probably carried buckets of water to that tree to nurse it through long, hot summers. The tree had returned the favor by providing shelter from our relentless winds for multiple generations of my family.  And now it was going back to the atmosphere from whence it came via the rapacious flames of an ignoble brush pile fire.  Like a passionate new romance, a brush pile fire throws off tremendous amounts of heat and drama at the start. And like a romance, things eventually settle down to a slow smolder. That is when the real work begins.  I used a long-handled shovel to push wayward deadwood onto the glowing heap of coals as a fickle breeze pushed the lazy smoke in random directions. By the end of the day, I had absorbed more smoke than a side of bacon.  “Phew!” exclaimed my wife when I walked into the house, “You smell like you’re on fire!”  It’s gratifying to know that the spark is still there after more than 40 years.  — Jerry’s book, Dear County Agent Guy, is available at http://Workman.com and in bookstores nationwide","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnNoYWxsaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL29waW5pb24vbG9jYWwtY29sdW1ucy8yMDIzLzA1L3BsYXlpbmctd2l0aC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ohio has eight cities on highest home fire risk index.  Canton and Akron have made Hartford insurance company's index of ""top 150 U.S. cities with highest home fire risk.""  The insurer ranked Canton as No. 41 and Akron as No. 40 on its list.  The city it considered with the highest home fire risk was Modesto, California. Ohio had six other cities among the 150. Cincinnati was ranked No. 8 in the index. Youngstown was No. 16. Columbus was No. 39. Cleveland was No. 98, Dayton No. 113 and Toledo No. 122.  The Hartford said it each of the cities on its list of 150 will get $10,000 each to fund fire safety education for children.  More:Deadly rash of house fires in Ohio: 'We know that so many of these fires are preventable.'  Jeff Welch, an assistant director of media and public relations for the Hartford, says the company releases its index of 150 cities with the highest home fire risk once every three years as part of its Junior Fire Marshal Program to educate kids about fire risks. The first was in 2017 and the second in 2020.  Welch said the index covers all residential structures, including single-family homes, duplexes and multi-family units like apartment complexes. It doesn't include vehicle fires or fires at businesses.  Data crunched over three years  In the 2017 index, Welch said, Akron ranked 54th and Canton was not on the list. In the 2020 index, Canton was No. 72 and Akron was No. 33.  Messages seeking comment were left with the Canton and Akron fire departments.  Welch stressed that the index only indicates home fire risk for a particular city in relation to the others on the index.  “The ranking itself is all relative. You could be a safe city but (the) 109 cities below you are a little safer (in terms of home fire risk). It’s not saying (a city on the list) is a dangerous city. I wouldn't frame it that way and that's not how we frame it.”  Welch said, “It’s not an indication of anything to do with the fire department or response times ... or training."" He said the purpose of the index was to generate interest and support for fire safety education and to help educate people on what to do in the event of a fire.  Welch said the Hartford's data analysts come up with the rankings looking at the number of home fires in zip codes for a particular city per a certain number of people who live there according to Census data. They then contract with a polling firm to reach people around the country online and poll them on their behavior that may increase or reduce the risk of a fire. Welch said at least 100 people in each of the 150 cities on the list were surveyed.  Questions on the survey asked people if they engaged in behaviors that raised the risk of fires or mitigated the risk or impact of fires. Had they left something cooking on the stove for too long? Did they have a working fire extinguisher? Did they regularly replace the batteries of their smoke detectors? Did members of the household have an emergency escape plan?  Welch said the goal of the program was to identity the cities where children best need fire education that the Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program could target with the $10,000 grants.  ""We’re trying to identify where the fire safety gaps are through this index,"" he said, adding that the Junior Fire Marshal program has educated 112 million children the past 76 years. ”Really the goal is to educate these kids so they become fire safe adults.""

The house at 556 Northwest Drive off DuPont Road caught fire Saturday evening and was so badly damaged firefighters were unable to enter it to completely extinguish the blaze.  Smoke was seen at the site Sunday and Monday as well.  The cause of the fire is undetermined due to the extent of the damage but it remains under investigation, said Jason Baltic, deputy state fire marshal and chief investigator for the Fire Marshal’s office.  Washington Bottom Volunteer Fire Chief Garry Freed said Monday the fire appeared suspicious because there were no utilities on at the house.  It’s one of two structures owned by the DNR at the site, after it was transferred to the state by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the late ’60s or early ’70s.  Westfall said the DNR used to allow people to stay there in exchange for maintaining the property but it has moved away from that model. Both buildings were dilapidated before Saturday’s fire, he said.  “The agency has wanted to demolish the buildings for quite some time,” Westfall said.  The sticking point has been the demolition of the larger lockhouse along the river as well.  “It’s likely to be expensive,” he said.

WBZ News  Monday, firefighters tackled a 22-acre blaze at Breakheart Reservation in Saugus.  ""Right now, they are using water and hand tools to help put out the fire around the edge and working, we call it mopping up, you start putting out any hotspots,"" said DCR Fire Program Coordinator Alex Belote.  Fire officials say the combination of high winds and low humidity have fueled the flames. Both the Lynn Woods and Breakheart fires are 60% to 70% contained, but that could change.  ""With these high winds and really dry conditions, any heat on the inside has the potential to pick up an ember and throw it out of the unit,"" Belote said.

Despite the extremely wet winter the whole region experienced, Wilbourn said fire crews are still expecting to see active fires this summer.""We've got the taller grass. It's obviously been growing for a while, but then you see underneath, there's a lower-level grass. We call that a double growth. So obviously, there's been different parts of the season where we experienced rain and then we've had a lull to allow the grass to grow, then it goes back to rain, and now we're seeing hot weather again, so these are just different levels of growth that really creates a dense fuel load,"" Wilbourn said. ""The overall landscape and topography of our area in the flat region. It's going to be hot. Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer.

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""SantaRosa"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:14:00","SANTA ROSA -- Fire departments across the Bay Area say the record-setting wet weather at the beginning of the year is not a reason to take it easy this fire season.  In some ways, all that rain will create more work for residents to protect their homes from fire danger later this year.  ""The main thing, my understanding with fire, is the embers, it's not necessarily the flames,"" said Jake Lehrer, a Santa Rosa resident who designed his home to be hardened against fire risk almost 20 years ago. ""If nobody is here, overtime...it will start to grow and burn the house down.""  Lehrer knew he was living in a fire-prone area, so he asked the city for help adding features around his property, including a stucco house and a special deck. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, he added more layers of protection including new vents at the base of the house and a metal roof.  ""It's all protecting the house from embers flying,"" he explained.  The metal roof can block embers from getting under that surface. The home also has a non-venting attic. His deck is sealed in a way to keep embers from spreading so close to his house. While those long-term amenities to his home help, he still clears his property each year, not just trimming grass and weeds but removing dead trees.  The wet start to 2023 does not give him any comfort about the steps he will need to take this spring.  ""I would say the main thing is to keep fuel away from your house -- at 30 feet, 50 feet, any fuel,"" Lehrer said.  Santa Rosa Fire Department Fire Inspector Will Powers says residents need grass and weeds on their property knocked down under four inches ahead of fire season.  ""The first thing we're looking at is what's closest to the home,"" he told KPIX while visiting Lehrer's home. ""We're looking at the roof line. This resident here has trimmed this stuff away from the roof line. That is very crucial in creating that defensible safe.""  Late-season rain and the large amount of rainfall the region received will contribute to vegetation growth. Clearing fuels and cutting grass to create defensible space will require that vegetation get cut at least twice this year, compared to when drought conditions allow for the grass to only be cut once.  ""This is the time when we want residents thinking about the plans they need to make for what could potentially be a long, long summer,"" said Santa Rosa Fire Division Chief Fire Marshall Paul Lowenthal. ""Our community has been through some pretty significant events and are taking things a lot more seriously and it's preventing damage here locally.""  Lowenthal said they will likely declare the start of fire season in the beginning of June. Warmer weather happening this week will factor into that decision. Inspections of properties will begin the first and second week of June.  ""We definitely were caught off guard in 2017. In 2020, we saw the effects of what measures like the resident here has taken,"" Lowenthal told KPIX. ""It's great to see efforts like this. We still see a lot of homes that still need work done. But for every resident that does work like this, it's one less home that could potentially be damaged or destroyed.""  In 2020, there were 1,152 properties impacted by fire in Santa Rosa, but only 30 were destroyed, according to Lowenthal. He says that better prepared residents helped make the difference that fire season. That's why he wants to encourage the public to take important steps now to help them through the summer and fall.  Leaders at Con Fire add that they anticipate a more dangerous fire season will return sooner rather than later after a relative break in recent years. The abundance of vegetation and all the rain during the winter is part of why they are preparing for the worst.  The agency says there will likely be a greater crop of fuel this year and it will eventually dry out, that could lead to a busy and potentially dangerous fire season.  ""To me, the rain allows us to have drinking water. It doesn't help with fire,"" Lehrer said.

Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Crews battled a large fire in a five-story apartment building in downtown Portland on Tuesday.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  According to Portland Fire & Rescue, the fire started at about 10:30 a.m. at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city.  Smoke from an apartment fire in downtown Portland, Ore., May 16, 2023, is seen from the Wells Fargo Center in this provided photo. Courtesy of Arnold Benson  Several people were rescued from the building, and shortly afterward crews were ordered to withdraw from the building due to the fire’s growth.  Barbett Grace sat on the pavement and watched the building burn Tuesday. She lived on the third floor and said she didn’t notice the fire alarm at first because they’ve had several false alarms. Then she heard the fire trucks outside.  “So, I opened the door and it was dark and full of smoke,” Grace said. “I just went to the window and climbed out.”  Grace, 67, has arthritis, but she managed to get down the three stories using the building’s fire escape. She had been scheduled to move this week because her doctor worried she wouldn’t be able to use the fire escape. Now, she’s moving six blocks away, but will turn up empty-handed because all her possessions were destroyed in the fire.  Barbett Grace, 67, pictured here on May 16, 2023, lived on the third floor of The May apartments. She said she managed to escape the building using a fire escape after the apartments erupted in flames. Fire officials closed streets around the roughly 113-year-old building out of fear it may collapse from the fire. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  ”It’s mostly just stuff. The paperwork, my veterans paperwork, my drivers license, Social Security card — all of those are going to have to be replaced. And that’s going to be the biggest thing,” she said.  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said many people and animals had to scramble from the building as the fire quickly spread.  “Upon arrival some of the first arriving crews were actually just aggressively running the hallways, slamming doors saying, ‘This is not a false alarm. Get out, get out, get out!’” he said.  Two firefighters suffered minor medical issues, but no other injuries were reported.  Graves added that emergency vehicles moved away from the roughly 113-year-old building in case of a structural collapse. The streets around the building were also closed.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Most of Interstate 405 closed starting around noon Tuesday as smoke from the fire limited visibility on the freeway. The closure resulted in significantly snarled traffic throughout the city in the afternoon, even after the highway reopened.  Portland General Electric also cut power to the area as a precaution.  Firefighters monitored the building overnight into Wednesday morning. Portland’s city engineer will evaluate its stability on Wednesday.  Known issues  The May apartment building was constructed in 1910, according to property records.  Graves called it a “non-sprinkled building” that did have “sprinkled exits.” He said firefighters did not know if the sprinklers worked or whether they went off. An agreement from Aug. 8, 1974, notes The May had some sprinklers along the corridors, stairs and the basement, according to Ken Ray, a spokesperson with the city’s Bureau of Development Services. It also had hardwired smoke detectors, alarms and fire extinguishers, according to that same 1974 agreement.  The fire remains under investigation, though Graves said it appears it began on the third floor.  Records show the building had some documented issues in recent months. On Dec. 1, 2022, the city received a complaint stating the building had “severe leaks, mold, mildew” that there was “exposed electrical wiring” and that there were “no smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detectors.”  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  On Dec. 15, a Bureau of Development inspector went to the building and documented 10 violations that were sent in a letter to SkyNat Limited Partnership, the property’s owner. The violations included repairing emergency lighting on several floors, replacing an expired fire extinguisher, and addressing electrical extension cords in the lobby “daisy chained with other power strips or extension cords” that created a potential safety or fire hazard.  The city gave SkyNat two months to correct the violations.  ”Due to limited staffing, the Bureau of Development Services does not have the resources to re-inspect most buildings on the deadlines set in violation letters,” Ray said in a statement. “It is the property owner’s responsibility to fix the concerns and notify BDS for a re-inspection. That did not happen, and fines began accruing for the uncorrected violations.”  SkyNat paid fines in February and March and, as of April 27, still owes the city $1,723.  The Bureau of Development Services inquired last month about the 10 documented violations, and SkyNat told the city it was still fixing the violations. City inspectors returned to the property Monday and found most, but not all of the violations had been fixed.  According to its website, SkyNat is a family business with more than 500 residential units in Portland, Gresham, Vancouver and Tigard. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  When reached by OPB, a maintenance contractor for the company referred a request for comment to company officials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2018-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:16:30","WASHINGTON -- In partnership with Meta, FEMA’s Ready Campaign, the Ad Council and the U.S. Fire Administration co-launched a new virtual reality experience promoting fire safety awareness.  In “The Escape Plan,” users must work through various obstacles to make a timely escape from an apartment building fire. The free virtual reality experience lets users practice their fire escape skills on their own time and in a safe, controlled environment and can be used with virtual reality equipment. At the end of the experience, users can create their own fire escape plan and visit Ready.gov and Listo.gov in Spanish language to further prepare for home fires and other hazards.  While virtual reality equipment is recommended, but not required, a desktop version of “ The Escape Plan ” allows users to participate in the experience and practice fire safety anywhere there is internet connectivity.  “From our user-friendly FEMA App that provides real-time weather alerts and helps people prepare for common hazards, to the use of geospatial tools to identify the hardest hit communities following a disaster, FEMA continues to use every tool at our disposal to help people before, during and after disaster,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “We are excited to partner with Meta and the Ad Council on this new virtual reality tool and we are eager to further leverage technology to protect people and save lives.”  “You don’t have much time to act in the event of a fire,” said Michelle Hillman, Ad Council Chief Campaign Development Officer. “Being able to practice a fire safety and evacuation plan before the emergency arises will reduce the chance of panic and ultimately save lives.”  “At Meta we are building for the next generation of the internet, which is why our partnership with FEMA and the Ad Council to develop immersive experiences in Virtual and Augmented Reality like the Escape Plan is so important,” said Caitlin Ryan, VP Creative Shop EMEA – Meta. “In VR, mistakes can be made without real-world consequences, ensuring individuals can safely learn and are better prepared, ready to act quickly in a real emergency. The VR version of this product creates the sensation of being present in a virtual three-dimensional environment, allowing you to experience and learn what you need to do to escape a home fire. While the Escape Plan is a virtual experience, the impact will be real.”  Virtual reality is emerging as an effective way to augment professional and personal emergency training and can have advantages over large-scale training programs that take extensive time and resources. Experiences can be developed to simulate an environment, whether the setting be in an office, emergency room or in your own home, rather than placing the trainee in the potential path of harm.  “Proven technology like automatic fire sprinklers, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors save the lives of civilians every day, and the U.S. Fire Administration has long advocated for the use of immersive learning tools to protect our nation’s fire fighters and increase public safety education,” said U.S. Administrator Moore-Merrell. “It is our hope that ‘The Escape Plan’ and other technological advancements will protect even more people and help us to further address America’s persistent fire problem.”  “The Escape Plan” joins a suite of digital tools leveraged by FEMA to help people before, during and after disasters. Last year, the Ready Campaign launched an easy-to-use digital form to help individuals and families create an emergency plan on their phone or laptop.

His comments came after a man was taken into custody on Pillar Point.  Around 6:00 p.m. police responded to a County Route 59 home for a report of a “disturbance.” As they arrived, Sheriff Barnett said a deputy and a New York State trooper were shot at.  A perimeter was set up and an MRAP was deployed as Special Response Teams from Watertown City Police and the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, along with State Police responded.  Traffic was redirected at the intersection of County Route 59 and Stone Road. Neighbors were told to remain in their homes.  Around 9:00 p.m. the house caught fire. Barnett says it was engulfed in flames.  Mutual aid was requested from multiple volunteer fire departments in surrounding communities.  Around 10:30 p.m. police took a man into custody.  The fire was still being fought at that time.  Barnett says three police officers suffered minor injuries. He says none of them were shot. He did not say which departments the officers were with.

"fire","2023-05-02","14:00:00","{""MillHall"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:21:57","MILL HALL — Mill Hall Fire Company will temporarily stop conducting lift assists.  Announced during Bald Eagle Township’s supervisor meeting Monday, the fire company will temporarily stop responding to lift assists.  According to Mill Hall Fire Chief Tony Walker, the company voted to discontinue them for the time being during their May’s meeting. He added the issue is due to a lack of help as well as other issues he would not publicly address.  The fire company previously discontinued lift assists about six years ago. At that time they stopped due to lack of training and issues of liability, according to Walker.  “That was a big issue and that is part of this other one — why we quit doing them. I did leave that up to the company, so they voted,” he said.  Lift assists are involved when an individual is assisted up to a mobile position from the ground by emergency service officials. They are not treated or brought to a hospital for medical attention. An ambulance is dispatched for emergency specific incidents.  Since lift assists fall under a non-emergency, it falls back onto fire companies, according to Flemington Goodwill Hose Ambulance Chief Kim Shainline, who was in attendance during the meeting.  “If there is any form of question on if it is a medical issue, then an ambulance is dispatched,” she said.  Other municipalities have either stopped doing assists or have partnered with local ambulance stations, according to Walker. They signed up to be quick response services (QRS).  Firefighters are meant to be well rounded for such incidents, according to Walker. There are currently only two medically trained EMTs at Mill Hall Fire Company, he added.  Shainline was in attendance with other members of Goodwill Ambulance in order to set up Goodwill Hose as the next responding department. Currently, after the Mill Hall Fire Company, Goodwill EMS is the next to call for lift assists through dispatchers.  Goodwill Hose Fire Chief Gary Mellot is offering to take up the assists with Mill Hall being unable to, according to Shainline.  “Gary said they (Goodwill Hose) would still be interested in helping fulfill that need because now it is an unmet need for your community. Which could mean that person ends up sitting on the floor for a half hour to an hour or longer, and now it does become a medical emergency. What if there is no ambulance available for that patient?” she said.  More of a burden is being placed onto ambulance services who are taking care of emergencies with injured people, according to Shainline. Ambulances from Williamsport or State College are forced to pick up lift assists when Clinton County services are busy.  “That doesn’t make any sense to me, especially when there are firefighters around who are still doing the lift assists,” Shainline said.  The caller is indicated if they are in an emergency with a dispatcher. The dispatcher then has a list of questions signifying if it is an emergency or not. A patient is billed after three lift assists, according to Shainline. The first two have no charge.  With the lack of manpower for lifting assisting, Walker said the fire company partnered with Goodwill Hose as they were doing nine-tenths of the lift assists.  “They were doing most of them for us because we didn’t have anyone,” Walker said.  Supervisors had an issue of what is considered an emergency, since they have a year-long contract with Mill Hall Fire Company. Supervisor Stephen Tasselli said that Mill Hall is in a contract with them and should stick by it until it expires in December.  “A contract is a contract. I don’t want to hold a gun to your head because of one thing but it is what it is,” he said.  Bald Eagle Township tries to give every emergency service department in the area a stipend, according to Chairman Tuff Rine. Mill Hall Fire Company gets a major share due to the number of calls they receive in Bald Eagle Township.  “I can’t really tell you Bald Eagle Township can do anything other than ask that our communications center follows the call procedure that has been set up — somebody is calling to get lifted versus somebody who has fallen and broken their head open — I think it becomes a question of the communications center on who they should call,” Rine said. “If Mill Hall has decided that they are not going to do lift assists anymore, then I would think the communications center should flip to the other page and have Goodwill take care of it.”  The Mill Hall Fire Company has been dealing with issues regarding lift assists for almost a year and a half.  “Because of some issues that some monkey dug up which caused a lot of chaos within all the emergency services here in the county. That is why a lot of them quit doing them (lift assists),” Walker explained.  He added the fire departments and supervisors should meet and “hash something out.”  Tasselli urged that they are trying to support everybody with the issue. He added he hopes they can work together to come to a resolution.  “We are kind of in a catch 22 listening to everybody and trying to help out and communicate with you all to keep this service,” he said. “We also tried on a couple of occasions with services to try to go to Lock Haven… to get a back door for you guys besides Flemington and we were told ‘hey we can’t do that, you’re not allowed to do that’ from the city manager. We are kind of in the same boat you are but I think you guys are doing a good job communicating with what’s happening right now.”  Shainline asked for the supervisors’ approval for Goodwill Hose to be the next due for lift assists.  Colten Mellott, the deputy fire chief for Goodwill Hose, was also in attendance during the meeting Monday, representing the fire company. He explained how their officers have the minimum training requirements for lift assists. There are about three EMT trained members of the company, so far.  “We are here to help the community whether it’s Flemington Borough, Bald Eagle Township, Mill Hall, Lock Haven. We ran 81 calls this year and so far, we have not dropped a single one. Our department’s ever expanding, we run an engine tanker, a traffic unit… and we have a rescue. We put medical equipment on board and we are working to get into QRS certification. All of our line officers, whether it’s from the fire chief down to the sergeant, all of them we require a minimum, you have to have first aid/CPR and most of our guys that are going are officers, so they have the minimum training requirements,” he explained.  They will ask the patient if they are hurt, and if they are, Goodwill Hose will contact an ambulance service for assessment. Mellott offered supervisors their service whenever they needed.  In other business:  There has been no progress with the Cottage Lane water line project.  At April’s supervisors meeting, Steve Gibson, the director of planning/county engineer attended to discuss the project. During that meeting, it was discussed that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will pay for engineering of the water lines once there is a project sponsor. A sponsor must be the entity that applies for the necessary loans. They will take on all financial responsibility if grant funding is not received. It is an issue that supervisors fear to take on currently.  As of Monday’s meeting, there is nothing new from Gibson or Suburban Water, according to supervisors.  “I thought Steve Gibson was supposed to get back to us with more details and present some options,” Tasselli said.  The only cost for the township would be legal fees according to supervisor Kenny McGhee’s summation of what Gibson stated.  “I am in favor of signing the application to get it started,” McGhee said. “The engineering is going to be paid for by DEP. They’re supplying it, and might as well use it.”  The project will not go anywhere until the application has a sponsor. Supervisors plan to contact Gibson about the application signage and making progress with Cottage Lane.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvbWlsbC1oYWxsLWZpcmUtY28tZGlzY29udGludWVzLWxpZnQtYXNzaXN0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR) is reminding the public to exercise caution and follow all state laws and local ordinances regarding open burning. The National Weather Service has issued Special Weather Statements for elevated fire weather and additional Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings are anticipated.  Open burning requires a permit from your town forest fire warden, and Vermonters should always check with their town forest fire warden before burning. When conditions are dry, town fire wardens can institute a burn ban in their respective town.  Find your town forest fire warden.  Most areas in Vermont have been 1” below normal rainfall for the last two weeks, with the last measurable rain on May 3. The weather forecast over the next few weeks does not indicate any signs of relief, with little to no precipitation forecasted.  The dry conditions call for extra attention when open burning—particularly with campfires—to reduce the risk of wildland fires.  FPR issues a daily Fire Danger Forecast for Vermont. Today’s forecast is high or very high. Get the most recent update:  Increased awareness can go a long way to limit the occurrence of wildland fires. Please help prevent wildfires by following these simple guidelines:  Be aware of the current weather conditions before igniting a fire.  Understand open burning laws.  Obtain a permit from your Town Forest Fire Warden.  Never leave an open fire unattended.  Never build a campfire on top of duff.  Use a camp stove to prevent escaped fires.  Extinguish fires completely before leaving. This can be done by dousing the fire in water, including all embers. Use a live, green branch to mix and stir the embers. If water is not available, use soil or sand to mix into the embers to cool them down. Continue to mix water and soil with the embers until the material is cool. Before leaving, use the back of your hand to check for heat in the campfire.    Find more Wildland Fire information from FPR online.  Source: May 15, 2023.

(WCIA) – What started as a final hurrah for newly graduated U of I students could follow some of them to court.  “There was one couch put in the middle of the street. Then all of a sudden there [were] 20 couches and it was kind-of the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” U of I senior Jared Kurland said.  Then, that pile of furniture was set on fire as hundreds of people watched. Students say the crowd started gathering just before midnight. By 12:15, the fire ignited at the intersection of S Oak and E Chalmers Streets in Champaign. By 1 a.m. Monday, multiple citations for open alcohol violations were issued.  “I mean, I probably inhaled half a couch just being in the vicinity because everything was going up in the air,” U of I senior Spencer Gallagher said.  That’s a sentence you don’t hear every day.  “Someone wanted to start a fire and that’s exactly what happened,” Kurland said.  300 people crowded around a residential intersection – some with alcohol, old furniture and lighter fluid in hand.  “It was terrifying. We were all texting each other being like, ‘does everybody have renters’ insurance?'” U of I senior Regan Sauer said.  That’s because it happened just a few feet from Sauer’s front lawn, in a pocket of Campustown known as “Seniorland.”  “We’ve had people over before but it’s never been this severe,” Sauer said. “We’re kind-of upset that this happened.”  And no one really knows why, except that it may have been part of a farewell tradition among new graduates.  “It’s kind-of the last thing all the seniors do. Then after this we all walked to the quad, have a good time there, and say our goodbyes to each other,” U of I senior Sahil Yemul said.  “There was a similar instance of this last year, though maybe not quite as large,” University of Illinois Police Department Communications Director Patrick Wade said in a statement.  “It wasn’t a good thing. I mean, it was cool to watch at least,” Gallagher said.  UIPD says the gathering is currently under investigation and could bring serious legal consequences. So far, six students have been given notices to appear in court.  “Luckily I didn’t get one but I was here when they were passing them out,” Kurland said.  Plus, they’re all feeling lucky no one was hurt. Students said it was a way to spend their last moments in Champaign together…  “It was probably not the safest thing to do but you can’t really do this anywhere else so everyone was just having a good time,” Yemul said.  …And simply, to dispose of items they don’t need anymore.  “There are all these old couches that people have and they want to get rid of them somehow. So they just brought them out there and set them on fire,” Kurland said.  It was eventually extinguished by the fire department, and Champaign Public Works crews cleared the road of debris. But that didn’t stop the house on that corner from receiving a notice for excessive trash, and partial responsibility for a mess created largely by strangers.  “That’s why we’re out here now trying to pick it up because we obviously don’t want to get in trouble with the city. We’re not troublemaker girls we just want to be on everybody’s good side,” Sauer said.  UIPD declined an interview because the investigation is ongoing.

The blaze occurred in the kitchen area of The Thai on North Mission Street just before 1 a.m.  Wenatchee Police Department Capt. Edgar Reinfeld says officers had to rescue both men as the fire raged, including the need to physically carry one of them from the building.  ""Officers arrived and immediately found one male just inside the building. Then, they discovered there was a second man in the structure and got them both out safely. Through an investigation it was learned that these two were cooking inside the restaurant after hours and that both were intoxicated while doing so.""  Police say the restaurant's owners told officers the pair were not authorized to be inside the restaurant, which was closed at the time of the fire.  Reinfeld says the employee's actions caused the fire but its exact source is still under investigation and that charges against the men are unlikely, but possible.  ""Most fire-related charges such as Reckless Burning or Arson - and in this case it would be considered a potential arson because it was an occupied building even though it was just the two of them inside the building - require an element of recklessness at the least, like someone saying 'this is a really bad idea but let's do it anyway', or the intent to actually cause a structure fire. And I'm not sure we're going to get to either one of those based on the evidence that we currently have on the fire, but if something else were to come to light, we would possibly file charges.""

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fre, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:  Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).  Visitors may continue to see smoke from the roadways and the risk of smoke continues to remain the biggest concern. Travelers should use caution throughout the impacted area.

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXNpZGVudHMtdm9pY2UtY29uY2VybnMtYWZ0ZXItcGFybWEtYXBhcnRtZW50LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWZpcmUv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Jlc2lkZW50cy12b2ljZS1jb25jZXJucy1hZnRlci1wYXJtYS1hcGFydG1lbnQtYnVpbGRpbmctZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3Bvc3RzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FjY2lkZW50LWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC9mb3JtZXItc291dGgtZ2xlbnMtZmFsbHMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1lYXJseS1tb3JuaW5nLWZpcmUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNzNiMTA2YS1mMjY3LTExZWQtOWVhZS1iZjNiYmYxNjIyODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
