Woman with gunshot wound dies after being pulled from Austin fire, Chicago police say  CHICAGO (WLS) -- A woman with a gunshot wound to her leg died after she was pulled from an apartment fire in the Austin neighborhood early Friday morning, Chicago police said.  Family identified the victim as 57-year-old Eunice Moman. They said she was a beloved mother and grandmother and had two great-grandchildren. She was described as a selfless friend, who would help anyone.  ""If your loved one was hurt, you would want them to do the right thing,"" Moman's cousin said.  Authorities responded at about 2:16 a.m. to the fire in the 200-block of South Lavergne Avenue. Neighbors called 911 after smelling smoke.  ""I woke up to smoke coming from under the floor, under the radiator board and it smelled plastic and I went through the whole house to see what was burning,"" resident Stacy Adams said. ""When I went outside, I looked outside from a window. I seen the smoke next door. The flames coming from next door on the third floor.""

That's where doctors discovered that she had been shot.  A downstairs neighbor said a gunshot was heard.  ""This is their mom, their grandmom. Nothing is good about this,"" Moman's cousin said. ""Just give them the love and support that they're going to need now and for the rest of their lives because the one that they would get it from is no longer here.""  Moman's downstairs neighbor, who did not want to give her name, said they were good friends. She heard some strange noises Friday morning and knew something was off.  ""I heard some noise, and I knocked on the ceiling to let me know if she was OK because that was our signal,"" she said. ""I heard something knock back like three times, and so I called her and I texted her and she didn't respond.""  Austin shooting: Woman shot to death at boyfriend's celebration of life; 6 others wounded  Police said they are conducting a death investigation. No one else was injured in the fire.

""When I saw them bring her out, I couldn't believe it,"" neighbor Rasheedah Warren said.  Moman was known to many around the neighborhood.  ""She meant a lot to me. She was like an auntie to me because that's my auntie's childhood best friend,"" Warren said. ""She didn't do nothing to nobody. She didn't do nothing to anybody. She would give you the clothes off her back.""  Neighbor Sharon Rainey also spoke fondly of Moman.  ""I was shocked, and I had to cry because that's my friend. She wasn't a bad person,"" she said.

When they arrived, they found a trailer attached to a truck engulfed in flames, according to Public Information Officer Captain Julio Reyes.  Emergency crews were dispatched to the scene near the intersection of 2135 East and Washington Dam Road at approximately 2:45 p.m. to the report of a fire with an injury.  Reyes said a male teenager with a mobile pressure washing business was at a job on private property to wash a dump truck. When he went to fuel the washer in the back of an enclosed utility trailer, it ignited.  Crews quickly extinguished the fire and the youth was treated on scene and released by Gold Cross Ambulance medical personnel.  “He had some singed hair but was otherwise fine,” Reyes told St. George News. “The trailer was completely ruined and the bed of the truck it was attached to has some damage. The paint on the dump truck he was going to pressure wash was also damaged a little.”  The cause of the fire was still under investigation, said Reyes, who relayed reports to St. George News from crews that had been on the scene.

Toni Yates has the details.  Man arrested in connection with anti-semitic graffiti, house fire in New Jersey  MANCHESTER, New Jersey (WABC) -- Police have arrested a man in connection with a bias crime spree that included a house fire and anti-semitic graffiti.  Ron Carr, 34, was arrested by Manchester Township Police and charged with 36 criminal counts including arson, and bias intimidation in the first degree.  Carr allegedly told police he torched the house and painted the swastikas because he thought the owners were Jewish.  Police received multiple calls about vandalism of homes in the Pine Lake Parks area on June 6. When officers arrived they found that the homes of 14 Jewish residents had graffiti scrawled on them including Nazi symbolism.  The next day police received a call about a fire in the same neighborhood and were told of a suspicious person on foot near the fire who matched the description of the vandalism suspect.  No one was injured in the fire, but the house was destroyed and three other homes were damaged.  You never think it can happen to you until it's you,"" said homeowner Brenda Rivas.  This was the Rivas' dream home. Not just for Brenda and Angel Rivas, but their two young daughters and Brenda's parents who poured their life savings into the home.  The couple sold their business to help pay for it.  ""It's been really hard for me, for my parents,"" Rivas said. ""That was their retirement, everything.""  Late Tuesday night that dream went up in flames.  ""I woke up at three, the whole house was engulfed in flames,"" neighbor Gil Lhotka said. ""It started collapsing.""  The Rivas family had no insurance but they have a community that has become their team. Yehuda Fryer's Company first cleaned away all the swastikas, then he and others got tons of donations to begin rebuilding the Rivas home.  ""Dumpsters, roofing, siding, everyone I called said sure, let me know when I can come,"" Yehuda Fryer said.  The attorney general's office is investigating the case.  ""No community in the State of New Jersey should feel vulnerable or anxious in the face of acts of intolerance,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said. ""No resident should feel their personal safety or their home is threatened by bigotry, persecution and violence.""  Carr is currently being held at a medical facility and will be transported to the Ocean County Jail pending his detention hearing.  First-degree charges carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $200,000.

(The 2.0 version released in fall 2022 added a removable base plate and ash pan for hassle-free cleanup; I tested the 19.5-inch Bonfire model(opens in a new tab) for groups of three to six people.) It isn't the first or only fire pit to promise smokeless burns — more on that momentarily — but its modern, lightweight design and ample selection of accessories make it stand out from the competition.  The Solo Stove looks like a sleek, if slightly plain stainless steel drum at face value. Its secret lies in its double-walled construction lined with vent holes, which creates extra airflow and a cool secondary combustion effect(opens in a new tab) that pumps out scorching oxygen. The resulting fires are so hot, their smoke burns almost completely away. I was never able to achieve 100 percent smokelessness with my Solo Stove, to be transparent, but I got this close when I opted for bone-dry hardwoods over damp or softer woods. (It's significantly and noticeably less smoky than a traditional campfire, at any rate.) It does go through quite a bit of fuel, since it burns so efficiently, so make sure you have plenty of wood or pellets on hand. The latter require a separate $50 adapter(opens in a new tab).  On the subject of accessories, you can choose from over a dozen different add-ons and tools to go with your Solo Stove. The cost can add up fast, but fortunately sales aren't hard to find. My Bonfire 2.0 review unit came with its $70 stand(opens in a new tab), which made me less worried about leaving a mark on the surface it sat on. I would also look into the $100 lid(opens in a new tab), which will keep the elements out when it's not being used, and the $225 heat deflector(opens in a new tab) for more ambient warmth.

The investigation is ongoing into the fire, and new information is being sought to move the case forward. Tips poured in after the fire, but none led to any arrests, according to a news release.  The subject of the search is a man on a bicycle who was seen on surveillance video in the area at the time of the fire. A cash reward of up to $5,000 is being offered for any tips that lead to an arrest, according to the Fire Department.  The fire, which burned for more than 19 hours, was reported at 7:13 p.m. on June 10. It required a 24-hour response and caused extensive damage to the old church, now the Phillips Chapel, and the neighboring Chauncey-Good Auditorium, which are both a part of the Redemption to the Nations Church campus. Parts of the buildings were later torn down.  Twenty-one of the department's 26 companies with more than 100 personnel responded to the three-alarm fire, in addition to multiple other local agencies. Firefighters first tried to attack the fire that appeared to be on both the first and third floors internally, but the building was evacuated because it was structurally unsound. No injuries were reported.  Surrounding roads were closed, and nearby residents were asked to shelter in place that night due to heavy smoke.

With a California campfire permit, dispersed campers are allowed to use pressurized liquid, fuel, propane, gas stoves, lanterns, and heaters possessing shut-off devices below 5000 feet. When using a portable stove, ensure the area is clear of grass and other vegetation and on a stable surface to prevent stoves from tipping and starting a fire.  Smoking is NOT permitted, except within an enclosed vehicle. Never throw cigarettes out of a vehicle window, use an ashtray instead.  Do Not Park a vehicle over dry grass, because the underside can get hot enough to ignite the vegetation. Ensure your vehicle is in good operating condition, tires are well inflated, and check for any dragging metal or chains from towed trailers.  No welding or operating acetylene or other torches with an open flame.

(KUSA) — With each new beginning, Della and Keith Gibson move further away from their old life – the pair just moved into their prefabricated home a week ago – their second home on their Old Town Superior property. Their first home was lost in the Marshall Fire.  “What are you doing?” Keith asked his wife.  “I’m just putting these snacks up here,” said Della, as she sorted food in her new cabinets.  Keith was at home and had minutes to gather their two dogs and get out.  “You couldn’t see to get on the road,” he said. “You just had to take a chance and leave, it was bad.”  Della was worried, and it took hours before she learned that Keith was okay because he doesn’t use a cell phone, he never has.  “It burned down, it burned down fast,” said Della.  “I don’t have one, I don’t want one,” said Keith.  The couple liked the old ways, but the Marshall Fire forced them to get used to something different, something new.  “At 82, you don’t expect to start all over,” said Keith.  They lived in an apartment in Lafayette for a year and a half.  “First time we ever had to live in an apartment,” laughed Keith.  “He doesn’t like it,” replied Della.  When the cause of the fire was announced on Thursday morning, they watched.  But this time, the new information won’t change their world.  “And there’s no criminal intent, act of god,” said Keith about the fact that officials said they will not file criminal charges against Xcel Energy or the property owners where there was a brush fire a week earlier.  “So you live with it, it happened,” said Della. “And now we pick up the pieces which we are doing with the help of a lot of people. I’m not going to dwell on it ‘cause it’s enough stress trying to get everything back together.”  As they go on, they’re looking at the good.  “Nicest kitchen I’ve ever had,” said Della.  In fact, she said it’s the nicest house she’s ever had. She loves all the cabinet space. Her old house only had four cabinets.  This new start is the one that feels like home again.

"fire","2023-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-09T10:14:09","Ray Township officials are in the process of upgrading their fire department by improving response time under a new dispatching deal and constructing a new fire station.  The township and Macomb County Board of Commissioners within the past two months have approved a $166,000, 17-month contract with the Sheriff’s Office to use its dispatching unit at the Communications and Technology Center, effective Aug. 1.  Township Fire Chief Mark Hoskin said the new arrangement will increase the department’s response time by three to five minutes because “it cuts out the middle-man,” Medstar ambulance. Medstar paramedics sometimes arrive before firefighters, he said.  “It’s going to shorten our response time; it’s safer because the dispatching will be maintained 24 hours a day,” Hoskin said.  The township’s 21-person paid on-call department responds to nearly 500 calls per year, more than one per day on average.  Currently, when COMTEC receives a 911 call from within Ray Township, it contacts Medstar which in turn calls township firefighters. Under the new system, COMTEC dispatchers will directly alert firefighters.  The deal goes through the end of 2024, when it can be revisited.  The county board approved it at its May meeting after the township Board of Trustees approved it in April.  The deal will have other benefits.  It will “allow the Ray Township Fire Department to have complete, end-to-end, emergency dispatch services which will allow for data sharing, direct communication, management of fire department resources, inter-operability with neighboring communities, and decrease response times in their community,” county officials wrote in documents. “Residents of Ray Township, visitors, and businesses who utilize 9-1-1 will benefit because there will no longer be a delay of dispatching resources.”  Firefighters also will benefit from “enhanced connectivity, mapping, and data sharing with dispatch and surrounding fire departments,” county officials said in documents. “Sheriff’s Office dispatch benefits by having the ability to directly dispatch Ray Township FD resources rather than relay information to a secondary PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point), which simplifies the process.”  Ray will be the 10th fire department in Macomb to contract with the county for dispatching. The others are Macomb, Clinton, Armada, Washington, Lenox and Harrison townships, the cities of Sterling Heights and Mount Clemens, and the village of New Haven, said Sheriff’s Commander Jason Abro.  For the Bruce Township Fire Department, which also serves the village of Romeo, COMTEC dispatchers contact the firefighters by radio, Abro said.  COMTEC provides police 911 services for the Sheriff’s Office jurisdiction, Sterling Heights, Clinton Township and the village of Armada.  The Sheriff’s jurisdiction for police response includes Macomb, Harrison, Washington and Lenox townships, and Mount Clemens and New Haven.  Meanwhile, township officials also are planning to build a new station/headquarters at the current site of the offices at 29 Mile and Wolcott roads, according to township Supervisor Joe Jarzyna.  Jarzyna said a new building will coinicde with the new dispatch service to modernize the department.  “The (existing) building has served its purpose but was built in the 1970s,” he said.  The township has secured a right-of-way from the Huron Clinton Metropark Authority for land to construct a new driveway. The Fire Department property is adjacent to Camp Rotary at Wolcott Mill Metropark, Jarzyna said.  The township will use its $420,000 allotment of American Rescue Plan Act monies to partially fund the project, which will cost an estimated $1.5 million to $1.75 million, Jarzyna said. The township will seek grants and potentially issue bonds to fund the rest of the cost, he added.  “We want to make it (new building) something we can be proud of,” Hoskins said. “It will boost the morale of the (fire) crews” and potentially attract new firefighters.  The fire truck bays on the new building would be drive-through, meaning the driver will not have to back in to park. Firefighters will be able to wash the trucks inside.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY29tYmRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzA5L3JheS10b3duc2hpcC1jb250cmFjdHMtZm9yLWZpcmUtZGlzcGF0Y2gtc2VydmljZS1wbGFubmluZy1vbi1uZXctZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9uL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hY29tYmRhaWx5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzA5L3JheS10b3duc2hpcC1jb250cmFjdHMtZm9yLWZpcmUtZGlzcGF0Y2gtc2VydmljZS1wbGFubmluZy1vbi1uZXctZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Since 2022 Eddy County Fire and Rescue (ECFR) transitioned from 11 volunteer fire districts to three paid centralized sections covering northern, southern and southwestern parts of the county.  On Tuesday Eddy County’s Board of County Commissioners approved a $1.1 million bid from Waide Construction of Roswell to add a training room, weight room and storage rooms to ECFR’s southern operations in Loving.  More:Hiker falls to death at El Capitan Peak in Guadalupe Mountains National Park  Mack said ECFR’s southern personnel cover nearly 60 miles of territory from Brantley Lake State Park to the Texas state line.  He said ECFR aids Loving, Culbertson and Reeves counties in Texas as needed.  “We have seen an increase over the years in (emergency) responses and expect it to continue to rise in the near future,” he said.  More:SENMC hosts Coffee with a First Responder event  Mack said ECFR chose Loving as the base of operations due to high call demands for emergency services.  In a memo to commissioners, Mack said construction at the fire station on Fourth Street would allow for more fire equipment and increased response times to southern portions of the county and the Village of Loving.  Eddy County Manager Roberta Gonzales said a $400,000 grant from the New Mexico State Fire Marshal’s office would pay for the addition along with $776,000 from the State Fire Fund.  According to the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (NMDHSEM), the Fire Service Bureau was responsible for handing out funds from the State Fire Fund to help fire departments across New Mexico in preparation for Insurance Service Office (ISO) surveys, read the agency’s website.  Kevin Willard, ECFR division chief of administration and Emergency Medical Services (EMS), said monies requested for the Loving work were to make sure Eddy County did not lose money for future grants.  “This will be for the engine bays (and) the workout facilities to keep up with ISO,” he said.  More:Loving commits to $450K construction of housing for firefighters  ISO classifies communities based on performance in emergency communications, fire response, suppression and water supply, read the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) website.  “Insurance companies purchasing this data use it to develop underwriting practices-so improved ratings can lead to lower insurance premiums for homes and businesses in many instances,” the website cited.  Gonzales said the Village of Loving provided around $560,000 to remodel sleeping quarters at the fire station.  Once a volunteer fire department, the Village of Loving turned over management of fire operations to Eddy County in 2021.

The federal lawsuit, filed May 19 in White Plains, accuses John Adorno, the owner of Universal Construction in Yorktown Heights, of dumping 10,000 cubic tons of material at the fire department property at 218 Oscawana Lake Road. It also names Metro Green, which recycles construction and excavation material at a facility in Mount Vernon.  The fire department said “an injustice would result” if Adorno and Metro Green are not ordered to pay for the cleanup.  According to a state report, Adorno told state Department of Environmental Conservation investigators who visited the site in 2016 that most of the waste came from Metro Green and the rest from a demolition project in the Bronx.  The material included asphalt, bricks, concrete and lumber. Testing by HDR Engineering, which was hired to clean the site, identified 11 semi-volatile organic compounds, seven metal compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides and materials containing asbestos.  A field report from a DEC official who visited the property in 2016 after complaints named a firefighter, Charlie Milo, who, it said, had given the contractor permission to dump.  The DEC eventually ruled that the fire department was operating a solid-waste management facility without a permit. Under a consent decree, the department paid a $5,000 fine and for the remediation, which was completed in 2021.  HDR said it removed 4,235 tons of fill and 83 tons of asbestos. The work delayed construction of the firehouse and increased costs, according to the department.  In January, the fire department asked state Judge Victor Grossman, who is based in Carmel, to compel Adorno to identify the owners of the sites where the waste originated; the contractors involved in the demolition and excavation; who arranged to have the material dumped at the property; and who drove it there.  Grossman issued an order in March requiring Adorno to provide documents and testimony in preparation for the federal lawsuit.  The lawsuit is the second involving contamination in Putnam Valley. In December, the Putnam Valley Central School District sued nearly two dozen companies in state court over the contamination of the well that supplies drinking water for students, faculty and staff at its elementary school. It blamed firefighting foams used by the fire department at its facilities on Canopus Hollow and Peekskill Hollow roads.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaGlnaGxhbmRzY3VycmVudC5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNi8wOS9wdXRuYW0tdmFsbGV5LWZpcmUtc3Vlcy1vdmVyLWR1bXBpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-06-03","14:00:00","{""Madison"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-09T16:17:47","A punctured or bent lithium-ion battery can produce enough heat to melt or ignite materials near the battery, even if the battery itself does not ignite.  MADISON, Wis. – The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) reminds the public of the dangers of throwing rechargeable batteries, electronics and other materials that could cause a fire in trash or recycling bins.  In the last month, there have been large, damaging fires at multiple Wisconsin recycling facilities. While it is hard to pinpoint the exact cause of each fire, many batteries, especially powerful lithium-ion batteries found in many electronics, can cause fires when not disposed of properly. These batteries hold a considerable charge even when they no longer provide enough energy to power the device, and when damaged, they can spark or heat up and cause a fire.  “It only takes one lithium-ion battery to cause a huge fire and put workers and fire crews at risk,” said Sarah Murray, DNR E-Cycle Wisconsin coordinator. “Recycling facilities that handle cans, bottles and paper are not designed to handle batteries and electronics. Paper, cardboard and other material can easily catch fire with a spark from a damaged battery or rechargeable device.”  If not caught early, these fires can quickly spread and injure workers or firefighters, cause major damage to equipment, or even destroy an entire facility. In the past month, fires have caused severe damage at recycling and solid waste facilities in Columbia County and Milwaukee.  “When you put electronics or rechargeable batteries in your recycling or trash container, you’re putting workers and facilities at risk,” said Greg Kaminski, Columbia County solid waste director. “Taking batteries and electronics to a drop-off site may be an extra step, but it’s really important.”  Some batteries, such as single-use alkaline batteries, are safe to put in the trash. But it’s important to understand your batteries and how to store and dispose of them.  “With so many devices in our homes powered by so many different shapes and types of batteries, we know it can be confusing,” Murray said. “We want to help everyone understand how to identify their batteries and where you can recycle batteries and electronics.”  The DNR encourages everyone to follow these tips:  Be aware that some batteries and battery-powered devices can pose significant hazards if damaged or tossed in the trash. Learn about the different types of batteries you have and how to manage them. The DNR has a household battery recycling guide to help.  Take used, rechargeable batteries to local collection sites. Check with battery retailers about their recycling programs or search for nearby sites through battery recycling organization Call2Recycle’s website or by calling 1-877-2-RECYCLE.  Recycle old electronics through E-Cycle Wisconsin. Many small electronics can be recycled for free or traded in for credit or cash. Visit the DNR’s list of collection sites and free mail-back programs.  Don’t put electronics or rechargeable batteries in trash or recycling containers. Most electronics are banned from landfills and incinerators, and they cannot be recycled at the same facilities that recycle plastics, glass and paper.  When storing batteries for recycling, tape the terminals or put each battery in an individual plastic bag, which prevents batteries from accidentally sparking if terminals touch.  Store damaged (swollen, bent, punctured or crushed) batteries or devices in sand or kitty litter and, if possible, contact the manufacturer or Call2Recycle for instructions.  Do not try to remove non-removable batteries from devices, as this could damage the battery and cause a fire.  Note that businesses and institutions have special requirements to determine which types of batteries they have and manage batteries according to hazardous waste regulations.  For more information, refer to the DNR webpage on properly handling used batteries.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vZG5yLndpc2NvbnNpbi5nb3YvbmV3c3Jvb20vcmVsZWFzZS83ODAwMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is renowned for being the longest burning fire in the world, having been alight for more than 6,000 years!  In this article, we’ll explore the history of Burning Mountain, its unique features, and the environmental impact of one of Earth’s most remarkable geological sites.  History of Burning Mountain  Burning Mountain is a part of the Burning Mountain Nature Reserve, which is overseen by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  Burning Mountain has been burning for over 6,000 years and is believed to have been ignited by a coal seam that runs beneath the mountain’s surface. There is no record of how the fire started, but Australian explorers, the Leyland Brothers, reported:  “The Aborigines named the mountain Wingen, which means ‘fire’. Their explanation of the origin of the burning mountain was that one day, a tribesman was lighting a fire on the mountainside when he was carried off deep into the earth by The Evil One. Unable to escape, he used his fire stick to set the mountain alight, so that the smoke might warn others to keep away.”  There are various myths about what ignited the fire, including Aborigine’s tale of a tribesman starting the fire with a fire stick. ©ChameleonsEye/Shutterstock.com  According to the NSW Government’s Environment and Heritage Group, suggested potential ignition sources include:  lightning strike  Aboriginal land management practices  campfires  natural forest fires  However, the widely accepted theory is that the oxidation of iron pyrites in the sulfurous coal material produced enough heat to ignite the coal.  More History of Burning Mountain  The Wonaruah tribe may have heated cote stones on the burning vent area work sites, making the rock material more pliable for reworking. Additionally, the region had a rich source of recrystallized, glassy slag, which, when turned into tools, often provides a sharp edge but is delicate and susceptible to blunting.  Burning Mountain, then known as Mount Wingen, was first observed by a non-Native person in 1828 when a nearby farm worker named Smart asserted that the region had an active volcano. The phenomenon was the subject of extensive debate, observation, and discussion before the renowned geologist Rev. C.P.N. Wilton, in 1829, properly identified it as a burning coal seam.  What is a Coal Seam Fire?  A coal seam fire is an underground fire that burns in a coal seam. This phenomenon occurs due to a buildup of heat and oxygen in the coal seam, which leads to the spontaneous ignition and combustion of the coal.  A coal seam in the Smoky Mountains, UT. ©rawaccess/Shutterstock.com  Coal seam fires can last for many years, with some even burning for centuries or even millennia. They are often found in coal mines but can also occur in natural coal deposits, where they can sometimes even burn unnoticed underground for long periods. This can be dangerous as it can cause ground subsidence, release toxic gases, and ultimately create hazardous conditions for those living there.  Aside from underground combustion, coal seam fires can also occur on the surface of the Earth because of human activities such as wildfires, coal mining operations, and electrical sparks. Coal seam fires are a significant environmental problem, emitting large amounts of greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) into the atmosphere while also causing damage to ecosystems and endangering human life.  There are other coal seam fires across the world besides Burning Mountain, including:  Centralia, Pennsylvania – a coal mine fire that has been burning since 1962  Jharia, Jharkhand, India – a coal field fire burning for nearly a century  The Laurel Run mine fire – burning since 1915  New Straitsville – burning since 1884  The coal seam in Centralia, Pennsylvania, has forced residents to abandon their homes. ©WhiteHotRanch/Shutterstock.com  Unique Features of Burning Mountain  Burning Mountain has a unique set of features:  The fire is currently burning 65 to 100 feet underground.  The fire at Mount Wingen is spreading in a southerly direction at a speed of 3.2 feet a year.  The coal seam is 6.5 feet thick.  The fire covers an area of about 4 miles.  There is no visible evidence of a burning fire, except some smoke, white ash, a sulfuric smell, warm ground, and no vegetation in the area where the fire is.  The temperature beneath the burning coal is around 1652°F.  The average temperature of the fumes escaping through the vents is between 212°F and 572°F.  Environmental Impact of Burning Man  The environmental impact of Burning Mountain is significant. The burning coal seam has impacted the local wildlife and vegetation in several ways. Animals have been displaced by the fire’s heat, smoke, and ash, while plants have been killed or stunted due to the lack of water and nutrients in the soil caused by the fire.  Plants  Unfortunately, there is no plant life at the vent site due to chemicals and the temperature. Therefore, an area of about 1.2 acres has been stripped of vegetation. Plans to reintroduce vegetation in areas where the ground has been cooled are underway. Plant colonization in the area includes the following plants:  Narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra)  Rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa)  Silky oak (Grevillea robusta)  Blunt-beard heath (Leucopogon muticus)  Animals  Plants and animals are being reintroduced into the Burning Mountain Reserves. Bats are a common sight in the area. ©Dave Montreuil/Shutterstock.com  There are various animals found in Burning Mountain Nature Reserve. A few examples include:  31 species of bird recorded in the area  Common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus)  Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)  Eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus)  Wallaroo (Macropus robustus)  Swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor)  Short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) – the only ground-dwelling mammal seen in the reserve  Bats (Chiroptera)  Eastern brown snake (Pseudonaia textilis textilis)  Bearded dragon (Amphibolurus barbatus)  Copper-tailed skink (Ctenotus taeniolatus)  Conclusion  Burning Mountain is truly a remarkable natural phenomenon. What makes this fire even more remarkable is its unique environment and geological features, which have helped preserve and contain the fire.  The environmental impacts of the fire have been significant, leading to air pollution and displacing local wildlife. However, thanks to ongoing efforts by authorities to protect the site, Burning Mountain remains stable and shows no sign of being extinguished anytime soon.

The new Station 7 is housed in a repurposed structure that was used while Station 2 in La Costa was rebuilt. That station reopened in its new quarters last October.  Carlsbad has a six-year lease with power company NRG for use of the property. The rent starts at $30,000 per year, subject to a 3% annual increase for a total of $194,052 over the six years, according to the city. The lease also has an extension option for an additional two years.  Station 7 is fully functional and can house a crew of seven, ladder truck and ambulance, city officials stated. It will also serve as headquarters for the city’s lifeguard service and can house two lifeguard trucks, two rescue watercraft and a small all-terrain vehicle.  “The city’s long-term plan is to find a site for a permanent Fire Station 7 to serve the city’s coastal area,” according to the city’s news release. “Quality of life and public safety are among the five goals in the City Council’s new 5-Year Strategic Plan, and the City Council has invested significant resources to increase the Fire Department’s capabilities in recent years.”  The temporary facility being used for Station 7 was originally located at Dove Library and cost $1,874,324 to install.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoY29hc3RjdXJyZW50LmNvbS9jYXJsc2JhZC8yMDIzLzA2L2NhcmxzYmFkLW9wZW5zLWZpcnN0LWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi13ZXN0LW9mLWludGVyc3RhdGUtNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As VPM News previously reported, City Council voted to move forward with the plans to build a new facility at 3000 E. Belt Blvd. in Southside. But council OK'd the site over rejections from the city’s Urban Design Committee, City Planning Commission, widespread community concern — and, apparently, without the correct zoning.  “There is no increase in public danger from fire ... as there will be the presence of trained emergency response personnel at all times the training facility is in operation,” said L. Dexter Goode, a senior capital projects manager with the city, at Wednesday’s hearing. “Nothing will be openly stored in the secured fenced area of the site that will pose a safety hazard of any type.”  Fire Chief Melvin Carter told the five-person board that renting time at facilities in other localities is too costly to remain feasible, due to both the expense and the removal of critical first responders from the city.  And the lack of guaranteed training space for Richmond's fire department is an ongoing problem.  ""Henrico isn't always available, nor is Chesterfield. And we have plans now to travel as far as Blackstone [in Nottoway County] to use training facilities,"" Carter said, ""when we are in dire need of our own training facility.""  Monica Esparza, a local activist and minister who has been a vocal opponent of the project, said during comment that this facility “exacerbates current racial disparities in land use, environmental health and city services.”  VPM News' Patrick Larsen contributed reporting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZwbS5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA2LTA5L3JpY2htb25kLWJvYXJkLXpvbmluZy1hcHBlYWxzLWhpY2tvcnktaGlsbC1maXJlLWZhY2lsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

San Bernardino County Fire responded to the blaze, reported at 7:32 p.m. on Thursday at 38338 Old Woman Springs Road.  Apple Valley Fire, the SBC Sheriff’s Department, and Southern California also responded.  An aerial map of the property reveals two large sections. The first section, on the property’s eastern flank, includes seven rows of abandoned vehicles in otherwise open space.  The second section, at the back of the property to the north, appeared more haphazard in layout and included additional abandoned vehicles, trees, and what looked like a building for storage.  Video recorded by Shannan Espinosa showed a neighbor with her dog watching as firefighters prepared to attack the fire as it consumed structures, trees, brush, a water tank, and a windmill.  At one point, the video captures a loud explosion causing Espinosa’s daughter to utter an expletive before saying, “Ah! My ear!”  “We heard the first explosion from inside our home about five city blocks down,” Espinosa said. “We jumped in my truck and drove down there. The flames were about 50 feet up in the air when we first drove up. I don’t believe anyone was evacuated at all. I saw over 10 fire trucks.”  Authorities have not released details about the fire, such as damages if residents were misplaced, if there were injuries, or the cause of the fire.  Thursday’s fire was the third emergency response incident at Moss Mobile Manor in less than three years.  This story is developing and will be updated as more information becomes available.  February fire  Just before 2 p.m. on Feb. 19, firefighters responded to a fire at Moss Mobile Manor.  Upon arrival, firefighters found at least two mobile homes on fire. The fire damaged four units before the blaze was contained, SBC Fire officials said.  The fire displaced about a half dozen residents, helped by the American Red Cross.  Apple Valley and Victorville fire departments assisted in battling the blaze. The sheriff’s department and SCE also responded.  Fire officials said no one was injured in the fire.  2020 shooting  SBC Sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a Yucaipa man at Moss Mobile Manor on Sept. 4, 2020, after authorities said he injured at least one person during an active shooter incident and refused to surrender during a four-hour standoff.  Joshua Beedie, 38, continued to fire a weapon from an unknown location inside Moss Mobile Manor as deputies from the Victor Valley Station in Adelanto arrived on the scene, sheriff’s officials said.  Responding deputies evacuated residents and started a search for the suspect, later identified as Beedie. Sheriff’s Aviation and California Highway Patrol helicopters assisted from above.  Authorities believed Beedie was hiding in a section of the mobile home park where abandoned cars and trailers are kept.  ""Sheriff's aviation, as well as deputies on the ground, made numerous (public address) announcements to get the suspect to surrender peacefully,"" sheriff’s officials said. ""The suspect continued to ignore their commands.""  Deputies with the sheriff's Specialized Enforcement Division responded and used three armored vehicles to approach Beedie's hiding area.  Deputies shot Beedie at approximately 1:30 p.m., about four hours after the Victor Valley Station deputies arrived.  Two rifles, an AR-15 and a sawed-off shotgun, were found next to Beedie, who was taken to a hospital where he later died, according to sheriff’s officials.  Sheriff’s officials said a preliminary investigation revealed that Beedie had shot at two people before deputies arrived. One person received minor injuries after being hit by the gunfire.  No deputies were injured during the incident.  Sheriff’s officials said Beedie was wanted for attempted murder and rape out of the Morongo Basin Station in Joshua Tree, about 45 miles southeast of Moss Mobile Manor.  It was unclear why Beedie went to the mobile home park or if his alleged actions were somehow linked to his wanted status.  Other fires  Fire officials said a fire at Moss Mobile Manor burned a single-wide trailer, two travel trailers, and a car on Oct. 17, 2011.  In June 2008, a mobile home and its surrounding property were burned in a fire at Moss Mobile Manor.

"fire","2020-10-05","Not Discerned","{""HappyCamp"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-09T07:06:01","Credit: Courtesy of Karen Mix  Credit: Courtesy of Karen Mix  During the week, Derek Cooper, superintendent of Happy Camp Union Elementary, lives in a trailer behind the school. On weekends, he drives 14 hours roundtrip to his home in Lake Tahoe.  He’d prefer to live full-time in the Siskiyou County community where he works, but after a fire ravaged the town almost three years ago, there is nothing to rent, nothing to buy, and no end in sight.  “Even if there was someplace to live here, I would not want to rent a house that a family could live in,” Cooper said. “So many people are still struggling.”  Long after the smoke has cleared in Happy Camp, school staff, students and families are grappling with trauma, uncertainty and a dire housing shortage that’s left many to suffer from long-term homelessness.  The town of 1,000 lost nearly 200 homes in the Slater fire, which tore through the heavily forested area near the Oregon border — much of which is Karuk tribal land – in fall 2020. Although some residents have brought in trailers, many have resorted to couch-surfing, doubling up with other families or living outdoors.  At Happy Camp Elementary, nearly half of the school’s families and staff lost their homes, a situation mirrored in other parts of California. Small towns devastated by wildfires are facing myriad hardships as they try to rebuild and recover.  The damage has played out in lower attendance rates, lower test scores, higher staff turnover and extreme difficulty in recruiting new teachers. In Happy Camp, for example, nearly half the student body was chronically absent the year following the fire.  “Homelessness is tough anywhere, but in rural areas, it’s a whole different ballgame,” said Tim Taylor, director of the Small School Districts’ Association. “There’s no social services. The school is the social service. And schools just don’t have the resources they need.”  Happy Camp school staff members have done their best to serve their students and families. Even while many staff members were experiencing their own housing challenges, they managed to secure half a dozen trailers, host an 11-week class for parents on helping their children cope with trauma, organized clothing drives and held fundraisers to buy furniture, food, gas and other essentials for families who lost their homes.  Perhaps the most important step was to host a barbecue every Tuesday night for anyone who wanted to come.  “The idea was to feed people,” Cooper said, “but also give people time to gather and talk, so they know they’re not alone.”  The exact number of homeless students in rural areas is difficult to gauge, but there’s no question the numbers have risen significantly in communities damaged by wildfires, said Brittany Collier, homeless student liaison at the Siskiyou County Office of Education.  Exacerbating the housing shortage, housing costs have risen sharply. Families who lost everything in a fire now find themselves unable to afford an apartment even if they can find one. A house in the town of Mount Shasta, for example, that rented for $850 a month less than a decade ago now rents for almost $2,000 a month, she said. As a result, some families have moved away, and others are relying on family, friends or even teachers for accommodations.  “People are opening their doors because there’s a need,” she said.  The state should do more to help rural schools struggling in the aftermath of wildfires, Cooper and others said. More counselors, more trailers and less red tape would be especially helpful in the first weeks after a fire. And longer term, help with rebuilding and hiring would help not just the school, but the whole community recover quicker.  The sheer volume of paperwork after a fire can be overwhelming for schools, Cooper said.  While the Department of Education can’t reduce the avalanche of emails and forms, it does offer grants for schools to hire temporary staff to help, department spokesperson Brody Fernandez said. It can also extend deadlines and help coordinate recovery efforts between school districts and local emergency agencies.  In a state that’s seen dozens of catastrophic wildfires the past few years, perhaps no school administrator has been as transient as Jimmie Eggers, superintendent of Big Creek Elementary in the mountains of eastern Fresno County.  Eggers was hired to lead the tiny K-8 district a few months after the Creek fire destroyed much of the town in September 2020. Because the fire damaged half the town’s homes, including those owned by the school, he and his wife lived in a 25-foot trailer behind the gym.  After a few months, they moved into a vacant office in the local U.S. Forest Service building. Eggers painted it, installed carpet and curtains and tried to make it home.  When an Airbnb unit opened up, they lived there for a few months. When another booking came up, they had to move out, relocating to a rental in Shaver Lake, 30 minutes south. This summer, they hope to move into newly rebuilt school housing — if it’s finished in time.  And he feels lucky —because many others in the community are still waiting for permanent housing. There aren’t many options. The 200-resident town, which is centered around a Southern California Edison hydroelectric plant, lost half its housing stock in the fire – including four of six homes owned by the school district. Rents in Shaver Lake, a popular vacation destination, average $3,000 a month. Fresno is a 90-minute drive west.  “It has been exceptionally stressful. That’s what people don’t understand. I — and many others — have essentially been homeless for two years,” he said. “Everyone says that after a fire, people will bounce back fast. That has not been the case.”  Happy Camp’s school campus escaped the fire unscathed, but that was not the case in Big Creek. The Creek fire scorched the playground, and firefighters destroyed the grass field when they used it as a staging area. A propane tank exploded, the gym and cafeteria were badly damaged, the pool filled with debris and countless school records were lost.  In addition to his superintendent duties, Eggers has been serving as a construction project manager, overseeing numerous rebuilding projects, all of which have been delayed due to Covid-related supply chain shortages and the remoteness of the location.  Housing and reconstruction, however, are not Eggers’ biggest concerns. Like Cooper, Eggers spends much of his time trying to address the mental health needs of students. After the fires, so many students suffered trauma upon trauma — losing homes, moving, impoverishment — that all aspects of the school have been impacted: attendance, discipline, academic achievement, overall morale.  And hiring teachers, counselors and other staff has not been easy, considering the town has zero housing vacancies.  “I’m recruiting, but I’m lucky if I get one applicant,” Eggers said.  And then came the snow. Big Creek saw so much snow last winter that Highway 168 — the only road to town — was closed for a month to everyone but residents, leaving some school staff unable to get to work. The school suffered damage from snow and rain, and must now contend with the threat of dangerously high water in the creeks.  But Eggers doesn’t plan to leave any time soon.  “I’m going to see this through,” he said. “This needs to be done right. I couldn’t leave this for someone else.”  When the Slater fire raced over the ridge toward the town of Happy Camp on a weekday morning, most of the town’s children were in school. If they hadn’t been, Cooper believes some would have died in the fire because evacuation would have been much more difficult.  Cooper was the last to leave the school on that terrifying day. It was three weeks before anyone could return to what remained of the town, and even years later, the recovery continues.  “What people don’t understand about the aftermath of a fire is the waiting,” Cooper said. “The waiting for insurance. The waiting for lawsuits. The waiting to rebuild. … It’s scary, and it’s tough.”  To get more reports like this one, to sign up for EdSource’s no-cost daily email on latest developments in education.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZWRzb3VyY2Uub3JnLzIwMjMvZnJ1c3RyYXRpb24tYWZ0ZXItdGhlLWZpcmUtcmVjb3ZlcnktZm9yLXJ1cmFsLXNjaG9vbHMtY2FuLWJlLWxvbmctYW5kLWNvbXBsZXgvNjkyMDg10gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9lZHNvdXJjZS5vcmcvMjAyMy9mcnVzdHJhdGlvbi1hZnRlci10aGUtZmlyZS1yZWNvdmVyeS1mb3ItcnVyYWwtc2Nob29scy1jYW4tYmUtbG9uZy1hbmQtY29tcGxleC82OTIwODU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-06-06","23:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-09T07:02:55","MARQUETTE — With Michigan experiencing an extended extreme level of fire danger, unprecedented weather conditions and recent wildfires, including a large one near downstate Grayling, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources is keeping a close eye on conditions.  Dan Heckman, a DNR plans section chief with the Incident Management Team, provided an update on the fire situation.  The lack of rain is the big story now, he said, although there are other factors regarding how quickly a fire can spread.  “Temperature, relative humidity, wind and rain play a big factor in this,” said Heckman, who pointed out that when materials like decomposing leaves, pine needles and grass blades acting as dense fuel sources dry out, it drives the intensity of fire levels.  “Low relative humidity really sucks the moisture out of those fuels,” Heckman said.  What has helped fire crews this month, he said, has been the relative low wind speeds.  However, that can change, with the speeds forecasted to be a little higher today, Heckman said.  “That’s why we see things such as the red flag warnings being issued,” he said.  The National Weather Service in Negaunee Township issued a red flag warning for the central and eastern Upper Peninsula for Wednesday, meaning strong winds, low relative humidity and dry fuels combined to create dangerous wildfire conditions.  Campfires, outdoor grills, smoking materials, chainsaws and all-terrain vehicles, the NWS said, have the potential to throw a spark and ignite a wildfire.  NWS forecasts a 30% chance of showers for Friday night, but otherwise, no rain is expected through early next week.  Heckman said that in the U.P., weather reports from the Seney area show that conditions are not as severe as those seen in the northern Lower Peninsula, but the initial spread index is slightly higher in Seney because of forecasted wind speeds.  He pointed out that fire danger ratings this season have been “very high” and “extreme” for the downstate Grayling and Mio areas, as well as the Seney area. The only areas in the state not in those categories are the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula and the tip of the Thumb downstate.  Paul Rogers, DNR fire prevention specialist, said that so far this fire season, over 600 acres have burned in Michigan due to wildfires.  “There’s been many, many smaller ones that the local volunteer fire departments have taken care of, and city fire departments,” Rogers said. “We greatly appreciate their help.”  Fire crews continued putting out hot spots within the Wilderness Trail Fire burn area on Tuesday as local roads reopened, the DNR reported in a news release. The fire, estimated at 2,418 acres in size, was 100% contained.  The DNR asks people to stay away from the area in Crawford County’s Grayling Township to give fire crews space to finish their work.  “We know it is interesting to see and that people are curious, but we want to make sure we have the room to get our work done safely,” said Mike Janisse, commander of the DNR Incident Management Team that has been assisting with the fire, in a statement. “Driving on the dry roads creates a great deal of dust, which makes for poor visibility.”  Roads also are narrow and there is little room for passing, the DNR said.  The DNR said the fire started about 1 p.m. Saturday near Staley Lake, escaping from a campfire on private property and quickly burning in a southwest direction through jack pine, mixed pine and oak in hilly, sandy terrain. The fire caused the evacuation of about 300 people until around 11 p.m. Saturday and closed I-75 in both directions Saturday afternoon and evening.  DNR ground crews working on the fire were assisted by many local agencies and air support, including water-bearing planes and helicopters from the U.S. Forest Service and the Michigan State Police.  Fire danger remains very high to extreme across the state, the DNR said, and the agency is not issuing permits for open burning at this time. People who must build a campfire or cooking fire are advised to keep a close eye on it at all times and keep it small. They should drench it with water, stir and drench again until it is cold to the touch before leaving it.  DNR firefighters statewide have fought more than two dozen fires in the past week. However, John Pepin, deputy public information officer with the DNR, indicated in an email that no U.P. fires have been reported to the DNR’s incident coordination center.  Rogers said that the DNR continues its prevention messaging, with electronic fire danger signs in high traffic areas, such as by the Mackinac Bridge and in Marquette and Escanaba.  “Even if we start getting rain — and we recommend this all the time — always check, either with your local fire department or with us, to see if we’re issuing permits,” Rogers said.  He provided another bit of advice with the current situation.  “The biggest thing right now is, just avoid burning,” Rogers said. “There’s no reason to be burning yard waste right now. Wait for some rain. Consider other alternatives. There’s mulching, composting.”  Other suggestions to avoid starting fires, he said, include clearing needles off a roof, avoiding stacking items against a cabin, trimming trees up to 8 to 9 feet off the ground so fire cannot travel up into them, keeping yards clean of waste debris and having water readily available.

On Thursday, June 8, the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety responded to a fire at the new Justice Center near the corner of West Kalamazoo Avenue and North Park Street.  The fire was extinguished by tradespeople on site using dry chemical, Public Information Officer Taylor Koopman told MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette on Friday, the day after the blaze.  Koopman said the fire marshal determined that cigarette butts were the cause of the fire. Fire Marshal Scott Brooks could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon.  No water was used to extinguish the fire. Minor damage occurred to a roof drain and some metal panels on the penthouse of the building. All damage was limited to the exterior of the building, Koopman said.  It is a non-smoking site and strict protocols are explained to tradespeople and all staff on the job site every morning, Koopman said.  The damage will cost about $25,000 to repair, including labor. The county is working with the general contractor, CSM, to schedule repair and determine who will be the financial responsible party, Koopman said.  County Administrator/Controller Kevin A. Catlin attended an all-tradespeople safety meeting at 8:30 a.m. Friday, June 9, to express his gratitude for everyone’s safety and hard work.  He reiterated that safety protocols are to be followed to mitigate incidents like this, Koopman said.  Work resumed at 9 a.m. Friday after the safety briefing.  “CSM expects there will be no construction delays. There are some lead times on the metal panels that need to be replaced,” Koopman said.  However, the work should not delay the opening of the justice center, she said. The facility is scheduled to be open in October 2023, Koopman said on Friday.  In March, the county said the building was expected to be done in September, and that is still the case, Koopman said. Officials plan to use September to train staff on the new audio/visual equipment, mechanical equipment, and different courts will begin moving operations over in October.  Want more Kalamazoo news?

The fire tore through the kitchen and left portions of the bedrooms badly damaged from smoke.  Candice Stanton, a close family friend of the Decubas', has created a account to help the family recover many of the items that were lost in the fire. The fund's goal is set at $10,000.  According to the GoFundMe, Stanton writes,  Luis is a single father raising two teenage girls on his own. This family is always willing to help others, and they go above and beyond to help.    Decubas works as a lunch duty assistant for the Fresno Unified School District. His youngest daughter is 10 years old and will be attending summer school this month. He said the fire burned all of his daughter's school supplies, including her laptop.  ""I'll have to replace that,"" he said.

A general alarm was dispatched to the reported structure fire. A general alarm assignment consists of three engines, two ladder trucks, one squad, two ambulances, and two shift commanders.  Within six minutes of the initial 911 call, Truck 10, Engine 6, and Car 4 arrived on scene of a two-story single-family home.

A neighbor had a garden hose on the exterior fire that had communicated to the siding and structure of the house. Companies verified that the fire had not spread to the interior and performed overhaul on the exterior of the house. The rest of the fire was extinguished with a pump can.  Within 10 minutes of the companies arriving on scene, command advised that the fire was extinguished. There was damage to the electric meter on the exterior of the home.

Sebastien Bourdais’ Hyperpole session came to a sudden end on Thursday evening when he brought the car to a halt on the Mulsanne Straight following a reported loss of fuel pressure.  The car then caught fire, although the Frenchman was able to put the flames out with a fire extinguisher and the aid of the marshals at the scene.  O’Gara told Sportscar365 that the fire caused no structural damage to the car, describing it as “pretty minimal.”  He added that the engine change, the second of the week, was a precautionary measure ahead of the race.  “It was kind of a flash thing and Seb took control and got the fire extinguishers and got it put out,” O’Gara said.  “So minimal damage, we’re changing the engine just to be on the safe side.  “Some soft stuff, hoses and looms that are going to melt easily, but no structural damage. No other hard parts of the car got destroyed.”  O’Gara said the the team was still in the process of determining the root cause of the problem.  “[It was] something on the engine and it was enough that they wanted to pull it and put a backup in, so backup engine is going in,” he explained.  “At least we have the warmup tomorrow to leak check the car and make sure everything is fine.”  O’Gara said Saturday’s 15-minute warmup session will serve a dual purpose, also bedding in new brakes.  “We’re going to start the engine here and it would be nice to go run it somewhere today,” he said.  “Obviously that’s not the reality, but we’ve got 15 minutes tomorrow.  “That 15 minutes we’re going to make sure nothing leaks, we’ll put new carbon brakes on and make sure those are bedded in and ready to go and we’ll go for it.”  The car returned to the garage during the fourth and final Free Practice session on Thursday night, after which initial observations about the damage level could be made.  “GM and Cadillac really wanted to have a first look at where the issue was and then get a game plan for how we attack it,” O’Gara said.  “When [the car] got released, [it] came back here and [we] started peeling bodywork off.  “It was pretty obvious what the issue was and then we just put a game plan together for pulling the car apart and what needed to be done to the tub as well as what other parts from Dallara and GM we’d need.  “Luckily we had everything on hand to get it back together.”  O’Gara clarified that it was a “conscious decision” not to work through the night for the engine swap, instead postponing the work to the Friday prior to the race instead.  “We could have worked all night and been to a better spot today, but I was really conscious of these guys having to do a 24-hour race over Saturday night,” he said.  “So we got the engine out last night, got the gearbox cleaned up and sent everybody home to rest.  “It won’t be late today when we’re done. So hopefully the guys get a decent night’s sleep tonight as well.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzY2FyMzY1LmNvbS9sZW1hbnMvd2VjL25vLTMtY2FkaWxsYWMtc3VmZmVyZWQtbWluaW1hbC1kYW1hZ2UtZnJvbS1oeXBlcnBvbGUtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Stewart.  According to court records and evidence presented at trial, during the early morning hours of September 30, 2021, the Montgomery Fire Department (MFD) responded to a fire reported inside First Baptist Church Montgomery. The MFD was able to extinguish the blaze, but only after the church sustained significant damage.  Surveillance videos taken from inside the church the day before the fire showed a woman carrying duffel bags and a plastic bag into the church during its Wednesday night service. Just after 2:00 a.m. on September 30, video showed the same individual removing silver containers from one of her bags and igniting multiple fires around the building. Investigators identified the vehicle driven by the suspect and obtained a tag number linking the vehicle to Yan. Law enforcement also learned that, on multiple occasions before the fire, church employees encountered someone matching Yan’s description on the church’s campus. During one encounter, a staff member escorted her off of church property due to her odd behavior. Investigators ultimately identified Yan as the same person encountered by the staff and in the surveillance videos.  During Yan’s arrest at a residence in Montgomery on October 4, 2021, agents found duffel bags identical to the ones seen in the church surveillance videos, as well as clothing matching the type worn by the suspect, gas containers, starter logs, and lighters. Officers also found a handgun. At the time of the arson and her arrest, Yan was in the United States illegally due to overstaying her non-immigrant visa and, therefore, could not lawfully possess a firearm.  Following the June 7, 2023, verdict, Yan faces a sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled for Yan in the coming months.  The Montgomery Fire/Rescue Bureau of Investigations, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Marshals Service Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigated this case, with assistance from the Montgomery Police Department.

(Photo courtesy of Salvatore Maurano)  The fire spread from the one-story, 30-by-60-foot pizzeria to an adjoining store, according to the FDNY spokesman.  The blaze was brought under control at 1:52 a.m., the spokesman said, adding that the cause and origin of the fire are under investigation.  A fire truck for Engine 164 was stationed outside the strip mall and firefighters were seen extending hoses and spraying water at Bario’s around 9 a.m.  Late on Friday morning, the incident remained under control. Units have been on scene monitoring conditions and have been utilized, but the incident has not been reopened, according to the FDNY spokesman.  Part of the strip mall remained cordoned off with caution tape.  The most extensive damage appears to be at Bario’s, where a light dangled from the ceiling above stacks of burnt cans and singed restaurant equipment.  The restaurant is under a full vacate order and the FDNY has requested a structural stability inspection due to the fire, according to the city Buildings Department website.  A comment related to the vacate order claims “there is extensive fire, smoke and water damage throughout with open and deflecting roof.”  Debris was scattered on the sidewalk outside adjoining businesses including Laundry Express Launderette, Honey Beauty & Wellness and Princess Nails.  A COMMUNITY STAPLE  Beginning as Brick Oven Pizza in 1989, Bario’s relocated about nine years later from a space in the Nome Shopping Plaza to larger quarters in the same strip mall. Coinciding with the move, the operation’s moniker was changed to an acronym of the partners’ first names, creating Bario’s.  A community staple, the restaurant is known for its charitable endeavors, in particular, its support for the NYPD. It also operates a vast number of private school lunch contracts on the borough.  Their pie is known as one of the more affordable ones on the Island.  A GoFundMe has been organized for the restaurant by Brendon Valentin who maintained that the owners, Mario Rapaglia and Alfred Pucciarelli, have participated in numerous charitable events and also donated to many people in need on Staten Island and in other boroughs.

The Vermont State Police and the Department of Motor Vehicles Enforcement & Safety Division are working in close coordination on various elements of the investigation.  The Vermont State Police provided the initial law enforcement response to this incident, which occurred at about 11:05 p.m. Thursday, June 1, 2023. Troopers will be interviewing involved parties and witnesses, and completing documentation of a non-collision vehicle emergency, which is standard procedure when VSP responds to vehicle fires.  DMV also responded to the scene and is performing an evaluation of the involved tanker truck due to its status as a commercial motor vehicle. This includes post-incident inspection and follow-up investigation as necessary, along with notification to other relevant government and private regulatory bodies as needed.  Work has been completed to repair the road surface and various cables including internet and electrical that were damaged in the blaze.  Investigators have determined that the natural gas tanker did not explode, as vehicles transporting compressed natural gas and other petrochemicals have a safety mechanism designed to off-gas the contents in a controlled manner in the case of a fire specifically to avoid a potentially catastrophic explosion.  “The investigation has been ongoing and comprehensive since the incident began,” said Captain Adam Pockette, DMV Safety Chief. “DMV and VSP have an excellent working relationship and assist each other whenever needed. Often our diverse focus areas result in our agencies working simultaneously on the same incident while concentrating on separate prongs of these multi-pronged investigations.”  The DMV Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Team is working in conjunction with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the State of Vermont HAZMAT Team to complete a comprehensive level one post-crash inspection investigation focusing on the driver, motor carrier, and vehicles involved. This incident remains under active investigation; the involved parties have been cooperating with the investigation.  The tanker involved in this incident is owned by KAG Merchant Gas Group LLC of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, and the operator is identified as Tyshawn Brown of Colchester.  The Vermont State Police continues to be interested in speaking to any witnesses to this incident. Motorists and others in the area who saw the fire or the tanker prior to the blaze are asked to call the Vermont State Police in New Haven at 802-388-4919 and ask for Sgt. Brittani Barone.  VSP and DMV will provide updates regarding the investigation into the cause of this fire as more information becomes available.  ***Update No. 1, 5:05 a.m. Friday, June 2, 2023***  Route 7 is back open. Motorists should use caution driving through the area as crews are still out working to clean up the scene.  Multiple fire departments quickly and successfully contained the fire, including Ferrisburgh Fire Department, Bristol Fire Department, Vergennes Fire Department, New Haven Fire Department, Addison Fire Department, Shelburne Fire Department, Charlotte Fire Department and Hinesburg Fire Department. AOT is also on scene assessing the roadway.  ***Initial news release, 12:35 a.m. Friday, June 2, 2023***  On June 1, 2023, at approximately 2304 hours the Vermont State Police responded to a natural gas tanker that had caught fire and exploded on Route 7 near Dakin Farm Road in the Town of Ferrisburgh. The tanker had been traveling southbound on Route 7 when a motorist behind the tanker observed sparks coming from under the trailer. The motorist was able to get in front of the tanker, stop it and alert the operator to the fire. The operator was able to get out and away from the tanker before it caught fire. No injuries occurred as a result of this incident.  Ferrisburgh Fire Department, Bristol Fire Department and Vergennes Fire Department are currently on scene. Motorists can expect delays and are encouraged to take alternative routes, as Route 7 will be shut down while first responders work to clear the scene. Green Mountain Power is also on scene, restoring power to the area.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmVybW9udGJpei5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL2p1bmUvMDkvdnNwLWRtdi1jb250aW51ZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXRhbmtlci1maXJlLXJvdXRlLTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Sheriff’s Office and District Attorney worked in partnership with the U.S. Forest Service and many experts to determine how and where the fire started and whether criminal charges were warranted. After an extensive investigation, they determined the fire originated at two unrelated locations and that no criminal charges were warranted. The full details of the investigation and recordings of the press conference are available on the Sheriff’s Office website.  The Boulder County Commissioners are grateful to the detectives and many experts who worked diligently to determine the origin of this devastating fire and to Sheriff Curtis Johnson, DA Michael Dougherty, and former Sheriff Joe Pelle for their leadership. Our community has suffered deep trauma from the Marshall Fire, which will take many years to heal from, and we recognize that today’s announcement may very well not bring about the closure that many community members are looking for. We know that the community has many questions and we appreciate the Sheriff’s Office making the reports and evidence available on their website in the interest of openness and transparency.  In the face of this tragedy, our community came together to recover and rebuild. That process started before today’s announcement and that process continues after today. But we should each take a moment to reflect on our own mental health and how today’s announcement has affected us.

Wrapped in caution tape, Port Leyden’s field day buildings are off-limits to the entire community including the village’s fire company.  “Our focus and everything right now is to protect the taxpayers and the village,” said Mayor Shawn Smith.  A recent inspection found black mold and water damage. The village plans to tear it down and put up a community pavilion.  The fire company, with supporters, is pushing back.  Though the building is owned by the village, the company says it takes care of it and raises money by renting it out - a handshake agreement from decades ago.  “All the people that have ever bought a raffle ticket from us, a piece of chicken, bought one of our fundraising tickets over the last 40, 50 years have paid for that. That’s their building. We’re only the custodians,” said Timothy Thayer, a board member for the fire company known as J.S. Koster House Company Inc.  The fire company offered to pay for fixes to the buildings.  “On June 5, the fire company had passed a motion at their monthly meeting to make the repairs required to make the building safe for the public,” said Jon Capron, president of J.S. Koster House Company Inc.  The village attorney says it’s not that simple.  “In order for work to be done on the buildings, we as a board actually have to pass a resolution moving forward with a request for bids on it,” said Ian Gilbert.  The issue has gotten heated at times. Both sides have sent letters to the other telling them to keep off the property, with the village attorney then digging up the deed and proving the village owns it all.  The village issued a cease and desist letter banning the fire company from holding any fundraisers on village property, things like barbecues or parties unless the village agrees.  The village maintains it’s protecting the taxpayers. The fire department says it doesn’t feel heard or appreciated.  Meetings with the village mayor, the president of the fire company board, and their lawyers, are already being scheduled to come up with a possible resolution. The first meeting is being held next week.  Copyright 2023 WWNY.

On Thursday, school officials held a special meeting to discuss future plans for the fire-ravaged school building. Around 180 students attend the school, but with the damages sustained, many say they’re worried about what the next school year will bring.  “It’s definitely nerve-racking not knowing what’s going to happen.

Ella Horinek is a senior at the school where her family has attended the school for generations. She said she’s sad she won’t be able to walk across the same stage as her great-grandpa. She also expressed concerns about being separated from classmates whom she’s known since elementary school.  “I mean we all might be separated due to some actions and that’s sad. Because even though some of my classmates, we don’t all get along, but we’ve all had that small-town class connection,” Ella said.

Designated as a protected wetland, the controlled burn is done to get rid of invasive plants and dry vegetation.  “The interest the fire department has in it beside conducting the burn themselves is that we do reduce the risk of fire in case those were to burn in an uncontrolled manner, would certainly be extremely dangerous,"" explained Fire Chief Jake Carrel. ""So, we do our best to mitigate that risk by burning those off.”  The chief tells FOX 11 the burn at the Fieldcrest property was delayed several times because of weather conditions. And despite those precautions and extra safety measures, things still got out of control.  “This was about 90 minutes into the burn,"" he said. ""We intentionally did this one very slowly, but, as you say, unfortunately, the heat from that fire did rise to the corner of that home and damaged the siding.”  A large portion of siding on the side exposed to the fire melted.      “I don't blame the fire department at all,"" said homeowner Jaime Schmitt. ""They did their job. They handled it very well, made sure that we were safe, did their best to contain it. It was out before I even knew it happened. It just, unfortunately, things get out of control this year.""  She says the fire department took responsibility, and the city agreed to pay to have the siding replaced. But according to Schmitt, when the estimates to repair the damage came in, the city's attitude changed.  “Going through their insurance, they did deem that they will only fix that side, and the amount that they came in at was $3,900, depreciated it down to $3,000,"" explained Schmitt.  She says the city's insurance company's offer doesn't even cover the cost of the damage.  To make matter worse, the Schmitts learned the siding on their home is obsolete, and the color is no longer available. So, unless they want their home to have mismatched siding, all of the material around the entire home would need to be replaced.  The estimate for that job is about $15,000 -- $12,000 less than what the city was offering.  “If I had damaged someone's house, I wouldn't be able to fix it to how I wanted to or the cheapest option. Anyone else would have to pay for the whole house,” said Schmitt. “We took the lowest bid, a contractor that was willing to work with us for a reasonable cost. So, we're really trying to work with them, but, unfortunately, the city just has not been helpful.”  FOX 11 reached out to Kaukauna Mayor Tony Penterman. In a text message, he said he reached out to Schmitt via email to discuss her claim and the next steps to resolve the issue.      While Schmitt confirms she received that email, she still thinks the city needs to pay to make her house whole again.  “At this point, I'll do whatever I need to do to get my house back to normal,"" said Schmitt. ""I just hope that they do what's right.”  Schmitt tells FOX 11 she and her husband don't want to have to pursue legal action against the city, but they are currently weighing all of their options if a resolution can't be reached.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFodHRwczovL2ZveDExb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hvbWUtZGFtYWdlZC1pbi1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtY29udHJvbGxlZC1idXJuLW1pc2hhcC1yZXNpZGVudHMtc2F5LWthdWthdW5hLXdvbnQtcGF5LWZvci1hbGwtdGhlLWRhbWFnZXMtd2V0bGFuZHMtc2lkaW5nLWNpdHktb2Yta2F1a2F1bmEtamFpbWUtc2NobWl0dC10b255LXBlbnRlcm1hbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to Joe Meinecke of the Tacoma Fire Department, two cars, two RVs and two boats were burned near 1321 Stewart Street shortly before 8 a.m., and no injuries were reported. Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the fire.  KOMO News asked the Tacoma Police Department (TPD) if it's investigating the fire, if the vehicles burned were stolen and who owns or is responsible for the land. The TPD said at 10:11 a.m. it was not involved with the investigation and fire crews will determine if the fire is ruled arson.    Nearby businesses said the encampment has been on the property for years, and they’ve been dealing with a number of safety issues, including fires, gunshots and thefts. The large encampment has multiple RVs, destroyed vehicles and garbage onsite. It's unclear how many people are living there.  ""I’m hoping this will be the last straw, maybe we can get something done now,"" Donovan Scott, whose longtime family business sits next to the encampment, said, ""I think all the neighbors are hoping for that.""  One business owner said a bullet went through the roof of their building, causing a leak, and they’ve had multiple catalytic converters stolen, prompting them to add fencing, lighting and security cameras to protect their business.    Multiple surrounding businesses in the area recently had a safety meeting to discuss the numerous issues they’ve been dealing with and have been trying to get action from city officials.  ""Hearing the gunshots one morning is kind of what triggered it for us to get together,"" Scott said, ""One of the neighbors just said that’s enough, we’ve got to get together and see if we can as a collective, maybe we can get something done.""  On Thursday afternoon, city crews were spotted accessing the site after the fire. City officials told KOMO their Homeless Engagement Alternatives Liaison (HEAL) Team were out at the site assessing the needs of those living at the encampment, and cleanup is expected to begin in about two weeks. City officials say they've been in the process of addressing the site for about a month.  So far this year, Tacoma fire said it has responded to 149 encampment fires, which officials say is about the same as previous years.

It also brought down the town’s ability to make calls and get online.  “I think if you talked to anybody that had a carrier in that steeple, they suffered a loss of service,” said Town Administrator Jeff Bridges.  Bridges said the June 2 fire destroyed cellular antennas owned by AT&T and Verizon inside the church’s steeple, causing widespread outages across town.  “People are giving up landlines so your cell phone is your connection to the world. When those connections are severed it’s distressing,” Bridges said.  Within hours, Bridges said Verizon and AT&T established temporary towers, known as “cells on wheels,” at a nearby vacant elementary school. The town and the carriers are working now on a more permanent solution.  Spencer fire  “Restoring connectivity by these companies is critical to you as a consumer and you as a person in your connection to the rest of the world,” Bridges said.  A Verizon spokesperson said service was restored within 24 hours using the temporary mobile cell site on Lake St.  “[Thursday] We’ve deployed an improved solution in the area that will provide the reliable network experience our customers in Spencer expect and deserve,” the spokesperson said.  Some residents, including Verizon customer Catherine Graves, said they were still having trouble making and receiving calls.  “My [service] is still terrible,” Graves said. “It just stinks when you leave your house and for a good two or three miles you can’t make a phone call.”  Bridges said the town’s building inspector is working with AT&T on a temporary tower on the church site and is awaiting the plans for review. Verizon and AT&T will be installing their antennas on that tower, he said.  “We look forward to getting the information on the new tower from AT&T for review to get service restored to a close to normal as possible,” Bridges said.

"fire","2021-12-30","Not Discerned","{""Boulder"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-08T16:48:07","BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Embers from a smoldering scrap wood fire set days earlier outside a home used by a Christian religious communal group along with a sparking power line caused a 2021 Colorado wildfire fanned by high winds that destroyed nearly 1,100 homes and left two people dead, authorities said Thursday.  Authorities spent 18 months investigating and determined criminal charges were not warranted for either The Twelve Tribes that occupied the home or the utility in charge of the power line, Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said at a news conference.  “If we were to tell you today we are filing charges, it would be wrong and unethical,"" Dougherty said.  The Dec. 30, 2021, blaze in heavily populated suburbs between Denver and Boulder caused $2 billion in damage, making it the most destructive in Colorado history. Two people were also found dead after what was known as the Marshall Fire.  The inferno erupted following months of drought amid a winter nearly devoid of snow and fed on bone-dry grassland surrounding fast-growing development in the area near the Rocky Mountain foothills. It spread rapidly in winds that gusted up to 100 mph (160 kph) in places.  For one woman who lost her home and watched the news conference, seeing photos and hearing about the fire all over again was almost as difficult as the fire's immediate aftermath.  “On top of trying figure out how it started, all this just stirs up all the same emotions. It makes you nauseous in re-remembering everything,” Barba Hickman said.  Experts say similar events will become more common as climate change warms the planet and suburbs grow in fire-prone areas.  The scrap wood fire — buried by residents Dec. 24 in a manner approved by firefighters who stopped by that day to investigate — was one cause when the powerful winds uncovered the buried embers six days later, Sheriff Curtis Johnson said at the news conference.  “Once they realized there was a fire and it was spreading, they attempted to put it out, but the winds were quickly spreading the flames faster than they could put it out,” said Johnson, who lost his home in the blaze and teared up during the news conference.  A loose Xcel Energy power line caused a separate fire less than half a mile (1 kilometer) away around the same time, Johnson said.  The two fires combined to cause the massively destructive blaze.  Xcel Energy strongly objected to the findings of the investigation, contending in a statement that it didn't have a chance to review what the company called “flawed"" analyses.  “We strongly disagree with any suggestion that Xcel Energy’s power lines caused the second ignition,” said a statement from spokesman Tyler Bryant. “We operate and maintain our electric system consistent with leading energy service practices.”  A worker at a Boulder deli run by The Twelve Tribes declined to comment or give their name Thursday when The Associated Press visited the restaurant. Members of the group — a Christian religious community thought to have 2,000 to 3,000 members worldwide — have repeatedly declined to discuss the fire or what happened since the 2021 blaze.  The fire that destroyed swaths of houses in the cities of Superior and Louisville, neighboring towns about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Denver, is blamed for the death of a 69-year-old man who lived near where investigators believed the fire started. The remains of a 91-year-old woman, who was last seen trying to rescue her dogs from her home in Superior, were also found.  Thousands of residents were at home the day before New Year’s Eve and used the suburban area’s extensive road network to escape amid smoke, flames and blowing embers, which spread the fire in the wind. Shifting winds caused the skies to turn from clear to smoky and then back again in an area filled with middle- and upper-middle class subdivisions surrounded by shopping centers, parks and schools.  As smoke filled the parking lot of a Costco warehouse store and debris whirled around, a sheriff’s deputy ordered people inside to leave their carts, evacuate the sprawling building and head toward Denver, away from the fire. Within hours, it destroyed 1,084 homes and seven commercial buildings, and damaged nearly 200 structures.  Old coal mines that smoldered underground in the area could not be ruled out as playing a role in the fire, but were not deemed to be part of the cause, investigators said.  The area includes an abandoned coal field where two underground fires, fueled by coal deposits, have slowly burned over the years.  The fire, which spanned 9.4 square miles (24 square kilometers), ranks as the most destructive in state history in terms of homes and other structures destroyed and damaged. The second-most destructive fire erupted in 2013 outside Colorado Springs, destroying 489 homes and killing two.  A lawsuit filed against Colorado’s largest utility, Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy, alleged that sparks from a power line started the blaze. It says witnesses saw a fire igniting near a power line in the area identified by investigators, with one witness videoing sparks flying from a malfunctioning power line and igniting a fire on the ground.  Hickman's husband expressed frustration the fire’s cause wasn’t pinned down more definitively.  “It doesn’t really provide any answers that help us. I guess I don’t know, it kind of leaves it open in my mind,” Rex Hickman said.  The Hickmans said they might be interested in joining litigation against Xcel Energy to try to recover costs, pointing to a California utility’s 2019 settlement for wildfire damages.  For now, the Hickmans have been settling into their new home in Charlottesville, Virginia, where they built a new home using insurance money. They plan to sell their vacant lot in Colorado.  “We were looking to get away from the fires in the West, and I have asthma pretty badly. The constant fires every summer is one of the reasons for us moving on,” Barba Hickman said.  The investigation took a long time for what was announced, but the decision not to pursue criminal charges seems appropriate, said Barney Thinnes, another homeowner who has had to rebuild.  “I’m with the sheriff. I just want to move forward with the whole thing,” Thinnes said.  Jesse Bedayn is a corps members for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

"fire","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T16:38:00","A team of firefighters has uncovered treasure hidden in their fire department that's nearly 12 decades old.  Captain Ryan Redmon and a group of six firefighters from the City of Marion Ohio Fire Department were on a mission to retrieve an old department cornerstone from a retired fire station that was about to be demolished, but they ended up finding something truly unexpected.  The Marion Fire Department (MFD) has recently been researching the history of their department, going back to 1848, by digging up some information — both figuratively and literally, Captain Redmon told Fox News Digital.  ALABAMA MUSEUM OF LOST LUGGAGE DISPLAYS UNPACKED 'TREASURES,' FROM OLD ARTIFACTS TO AUTOGRAPHED MEMORABILIA  On May 25, Redmon and the firefighters went down to the old Marion Fire Department Station No. 2, which was built in 1905, to excavate their department's cornerstone for preservation purposes before the building was scheduled to be torn down.  After spending nearly 30 minutes on the excavation, Redmon and his men quickly realized the cornerstone was deeper into the building than anticipated, so they called in professionals to complete the removal.  As Redmon and his team were about to leave, they pulled out one last brick and saw a copper box fall out of the sandstone, Redmon shared.  Redmon and the other firefighters on the scene took it back to the station excited to show everyone their new discovery.  ANCIENT ROMAN 'REFRIGERATOR' DISCOVERED IN MILITARY BARRACK WITH PRESERVED BONES: 'SHROUDED IN MYSTERY'  ""Obviously, everybody wanted us to open it right away, and we wanted to, trust me. It was killing us to see what was in there,"" Redmon commented.  The MFD has been working on the written history of their department, but nothing in their prior research led them to believe there would be a time capsule hidden in the 1905 fire station.  ""We've done so much history work around the station and I feel like we've got a pretty good grasp on our past and where we've been, and [to] discover something like [this], there's no written record of it,"" Redmon stated.  ""We scoured newspapers, we scoured old records [and] there was never any mention of a time capsule in there, so it was very exciting,"" he added.  SUNKEN JEWELS, BURIED TREASURE UNCOVERED IN THE BAHAMAS FROM ICONIC 17TH CENTURY SPANISH SHIPWRECK  The time capsule was placed near the cornerstone of the old MFD station on July 20, 1905, according to a letter found in the capsule written by the fire chief at the time, Redmon added.  ""Firemen aren't exactly known for being gentle, delicate creatures with things,"" Redmon joked. ""So we took it to the historical society in town.""

"fire","2023-06-08","Not Discerned","{""Eugene"", ""Oregon"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-09T03:00:00","EUGENE, Ore. – A person has been arrested and charged with arson on Thursday in connection with the fire that crippled Valley River Inn back in February.  Back on February 28, firefighters responded to a fire at Valley River Inn in Eugene that had started on the second floor and quickly spread to the third floor and the attic. Although fire crews were able to extinguish the blaze and no injuries were reported, the building suffered extensive damage including a partially-collapsed roof. The damage was so severe that the Valley River Inn was forced to shutter the building entirely and lay off dozens of people who worked there while repairs got underway.  On June 8, Eugene Police Department announced that an arrest had been made in connection with the fire. Eugene police reported that their Violent Crimes detectives arrested Morgan Christopher Immesoete, 47, of Cheshire without incident in Eugene on June 8. Police said Immesoete stands charged of first-degree arson, second-degree arson, reckless endangering, possession of methamphetamines and is being held in the Lane County Jail.  A spokesperson for the Eugene Police Department said they could not offer any additional details on the arrest or investigation as the effort to prosecute Immesoete begins.  Derek Sinclair and Daniel Woods work at a construction site right next to the hotel. They said they have noticed a lot of suspicious people in the area since they started their project back in January.  ""It doesn't surprise me with all the people and the homeless here,"" Sinclair said. ""We get a lot of chaos in here, a lot of hoodlums. Just, it don't surprise us at all.""  They said people have gone into their site, left needles and other drug paraphernalia behind and even slept under their heavy machinery.  Sinclair said even with the hotel boarded up, he still sees people walking around the job site and the inn property when they should not be there.  A spokesperson for Valley River Inn said the property will be closed until some point in 2024 while they repair and restore its historic architecture. On June 6, the inn's property management company announced 62 employees will be laid off at the end of the month.  In a statement, a spokesperson for the hotel said:  ""Valley River Inn sustained damage from a fire earlier this year. As a result, the iconic property will undergo a complete restoration of its historic Northwestern architectural details and the hotel will temporarily close to allow for this necessary work to take place. Hotel management has implemented steps to provide support and resources to its staff. Renovations are expected to continue into 2024 and an update on reopening will be provided at a later date.""  The prolonged closure of the inn has forced groups who typically use the venue to find other places to hold their events.  Eugene-based non-profit Bags of Love, who provides children in need with care packages full of necessities and comfort items, typically holds a large fundraiser dinner at the venue every October.  Misty Hall, executive director of the organization, said they had to find a new location in April when the inn could not say when the place would be repaired. The search was a scramblem as there are not a lot of venues in Eugene for large-scale events.  The group was able to find a new place for their fundraiser, she said, but it came at cost.  ""Our new venue will be able to host the capacity that we need,"" Hall said. ""It's going to be more expensive than what Valley River Inn -- what we'd typically paid at Valley River Inn. So we are going to have to eat some of that cost -- and it does impact our fundraising abilities.""  As for the future of the hotel, the construction workers said they would like to see the hotel open again, but understand it will take some time.  ""As far as the timeframe, that's surprising, holy cow — a hotel, shut down for for multiple years, two years,"" Woods said. ""But then in the aspect of what we see in construction, it makes sense. Takes a long time to put stuff back together, to rehabilitate, to repair -- it takes time.""  Hall said they would consider returning to the Valley River Inn in the future.  ""Valley River Inn has been great to us in the past, so we would definitely be open to looking at their venue, should they recover from this and have a venue space as well,"" Hall said. ""But we are open to other places. And in Eugene, it's kinda in short supply.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXppLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N1c3BlY3QtYXJyZXN0ZWQtY2hhcmdlZC13aXRoLWFyc29uLWluLXZhbGxleS1yaXZlci1pbm4tZmlyZS1wZW9wbGUtcmVhY3QvYXJ0aWNsZV81MmRlZjdlZS0wNjMzLTExZWUtYmEzNi1lNzkwNDA4ZDlkNWYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Adolfo Orozco-Garcia stood with attorney Dominic Gentile, who represented Orozco-Garcia and a corporate ownership entity, Las Vegas Dragon Hotel LLC, in a confidential settlement in March of more than a dozen civil damages lawsuits that arose from the smoky pre-dawn fire at the low-budget Alpine Apartments.  Orozco-Garcia spoke in court only to enter his plea. He and Gentile declined outside court to comment.  Gentile told Clark County District Court Judge Tierra Jones he will continue to represent Orozco-Garcia, 46, in the criminal case, which is likely to be scheduled next year and could result in decades in prison if Orozco-Garcia is convicted. Gentile previously said his client was indigent following the civil settlement and would seek a court-appointed public defender.  Jones scheduled a trial-setting hearing June 20 before Judge Jacqueline Bluth. Orozco-Garcia remains free on bond.  Some of the 50 people who lived in the converted 41-unit former downtown motel died of smoke inhalation, and others, including a pregnant woman, were injured jumping from second-floor windows.  Inspectors later found an exit door bolted shut, a faulty fire sprinkler system and missing or defective smoke detectors.  The fire was traced to an unattended stove in a first-floor apartment that may have been used for warmth on a cold winter night. Residents later complained the building lacked heat, and city officials tallied 42 fire code violations.  The fire spurred city officials to launch an inspection program focusing on aging multi-unit and extended-stay buildings converted from motels or hotels to apartments. The Alpine property has since been rebuilt, rebranded and reopened under new ownership.  The fire was the deadliest in the Las Vegas area since November 1980, when 87 people died and more than 700 were injured in a spectacular blaze at the MGM Grand Hotel on the Strip, which is in Clark County jurisdiction. That hotel became Bally’s Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and was rebranded in December by owner Caesars Entertainment as the Horseshoe Las Vegas.  A fire three months later, in February 1981, killed eight people at the Hilton Hotel east of Las Vegas Boulevard. That hotel is now the Westgate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVVMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L293bmVyLXZlZ2FzLWFwYXJ0bWVudC02LWRpZWQtZmlyZS1wbGVhZHMtZ3VpbHR5LTk5OTQyNTMy0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvVVMvd2lyZVN0b3J5L293bmVyLXZlZ2FzLWFwYXJ0bWVudC02LWRpZWQtZmlyZS1wbGVhZHMtZ3VpbHR5LTk5OTQyNTMy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The area has heavy vegetation, providing the fire with a large amount of fuel.  About 10 minutes later, authorities reported the fire had grown to about an acre. A helitanker had been requested to fly over the blaze, but firefighters canceled that request as they anticipated being able to extinguish the flames with the units on site, according to the department.    The department said that the fire's forward progress had been stopped at around 1:44 p.m. and that no injuries or structure damage had been reported at that time. The fire has been dubbed the Pacific Fire.

The new facility, Fire Station 27, will also serve as a substation for the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office.  ""We were in dire need of a new fire station and substation out here for the sheriff’s department,"" said Santa Barbara County Fire Captain Scott Safechuck. ""The original station was built in the early 50s and has had some minor remodeling to it, but this is a state-of-the-art facility.""  Thursday's celebration at the new fire station included appearances by Santa Barbara County supervisors Das Williams and Bob Nelson, as well as Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown.  ""The collaborative efforts that they have done really made the decision to make a combined station in New Cuyama a no-brainer. It makes perfect sense. We have another substation in Lompoc that is also a combined station which is a great facility that is also working out well. It is not only cost-effective, but it brings our two agencies together,"" Sheriff Brown said.  Those at the ribbon-cutting ceremony reflected on how the Cuyama Valley has historically presented challenges for first responders as the North County Sheriff's Office is more than an hour away from most response calls in New Cuyama.  Capt. Safechuck added that establishing a combined service station will improve emergency response.  ""It is able to house firefighters and the sheriff’s substation can facilitate law enforcement needs out here. But we get fires out here. We work with the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, Kern County, San Luis County. It is kind of a convergence of corners of different counties here,"" he explained.  Supervisor Das Williams says their service efforts in the Cuyama Valley are far from over.  ""Some things to come along those lines is the replacement of the Foothill Bridge,"" Williams said. ""That is going to be really important for folks to get around during storms or weather challenges, and so these guys at General Services and Public Works will be doing other, other, other jobs to help us in the county.""  Safechuck says the opening of Fire Station 27 is coming at the perfect time, as their department has already started to see an increase in response calls as we transition into peak fire season.  Santa Barbara County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig says the cost of the new station was $8 million.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYnkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9yaWJib24tY3V0dGluZy1jZXJlbW9ueS1mb3ItbmV3LWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1hbmQtc2hlcmlmZi1zdWJzdGF0aW9uLWluLW5ldy1jdXlhbWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""This is like our second home for a lot of our churchgoers,” said Greg Smithson.  For six decades, the Dallas Indian Revival Center is where some of life’s most precious moments have played out.  It's where Smithson and his wife, Carrie, were married. Today, it’s where he serves as a deacon and oversees the children’s ministry.  “We were able to see kids from small kids to growing up to even have families of their own now,” he said.  They’re generations of memories that are now reduced to ash.  Late Wednesday, Dallas Fire-Rescue responded to a fire call at the church. Investigators determined roofers working with a torch accidentally ignited the building.  “I saw the smoke coming from south Dallas,” said Pastor Patrick Osage.  By the time Osage arrived, the roof had collapsed. He said he immediately knew the building was a total loss.  ""It's hard, especially because of the history of the church, how long it's been here, you know, 60 years of American Indian community gathering here, praising God,” he said.  Though they managed to save a few photos, inside little else remains. Still, there are signs of hope.  “The building is just a building. The church is the people who gather here to praise God, fellowship together and help each other out in times of need,” said Osage.  Sunday, Osage said the congregation will gather in the shadow of the sanctuary for their 11 a.m. worship service.  Then together, they'll figure out how to rebuild, creating a new home for the memories forever in their hearts.  ""I’m excited to see what God has planned for us,” he said.  Osage set up a GoFundMe to help with the rebuilding process.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kYWxsYXMtYW1lcmljYW4taW5kaWFuLWNodXJjaC1wbGVkZ2VzLXRvLXJlYnVpbGQtYWZ0ZXItZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95cy1zYW5jdHVhcnkvMzI3Mzk2Ny_SAX9odHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZGFsbGFzLWFtZXJpY2FuLWluZGlhbi1jaHVyY2gtcGxlZGdlcy10by1yZWJ1aWxkLWFmdGVyLWZpcmUtZGVzdHJveXMtc2FuY3R1YXJ5LzMyNzM5NjcvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dispatch advised that this fire was on the roof of the structure. Crews arrived on scene at 11:57 A.M. and found light smoke from the roof of the commercial building. Crews accessed the roof from the ladder truck and found there was roofing material that was burning. Crews deployed a handline and quickly extinguished the fire. Crews then began checking for fire extension. Charleston Fire Department assisted on the roof with checking for any fire extension. There was moderate damage to the roofing material around one of the electrical cabinets on the roof. There was some minor water damage to the interior of the factory that affected 1 drying line for product.  All units cleared the scene at 1:28 P.M.  The cause of this fire was determined to be caused by welding that was being done around the cabinet area. The company that was doing the welding were following all safety procedures, as they had fire extinguishers on the roof that slowed the spread of fire prior to the fire department arriving.

But let’s not get lost and lose sight of the Columbus Crew’s quiet climb up the Eastern Conference standings.  While all of us await more news of arguably soccer’s greatest joining the league, it’s time to turn our attention toward the Crew’s Saturday night clash with long-time rival Chicago Fire FC at Soldier Field.  Three Things To Know  33 – Winners of two straight, the Black & Gold enter this weekend leading the league with 33 goals scored to date. In those two most recent wins, Columbus has a combined seven goals. The point is: this team is built for aggressive, attacking soccer, and it’s no surprise the side is getting hot as Cucho Hernández is in form. Cucho has either a goal or an assist in his last seven starts, and has scored in consecutive games. To date, he has three goals and seven assists. Lucas Zelarayán has seven goals and assists, and Christian Ramirez enters the contest with five goals and an assist. His brace last Saturday helped the team beat Charlotte FC, 4-2, and now the trio are hoping to carry their momentum into Chicagoland.  1.5 — Averaging 1.5 points per match, the Crew currently sits fifth in the Eastern Conference standings and has one game left before the midway point in the 2023 regular season. Head coach Wilfried Nancy’s team has navigated through a variety of obstacles, including notable injuries and in-match adversity. Yet, even when a number of first and second-year players in the squad, the Black & Gold have looked confident and comfortable. It’s important that continues into the final six matches until next month’s Leagues Cup break. This Columbus side is a work in progress that’s trending upward. That’s a great place to be in.  14 — Respectfully, the Fire been nothing more than a simmer to start 2023. On Tuesday night, the club lost, 4-1, at home to Houston Dynamo FC in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup quarterfinals, and Chicago is searching for its first league win since May 13. With 17 points from the first 16 games, the team sits 14th in the Eastern Conference standings. It’ll be interesting to see how Fire head coach Frank Klopas treats this match as his players have a shortened week and have only been under his leadership since May 8.  When They Last Met  The last away meeting was a legendary debut for Cucho. On July 9, 2022, the Crew trailed, 2-0, at halftime at Soldier Field. Derrick Etienne Jr. scored two goals midway through the second half before Cucho produced the game winner in the 83rd minute for Columbus to claim all three points in a wild 3-2 comeback win. The teams met at Lower.com Field in September and the match ended in a 0-0 draw.

More than 50 firefighters were called around 6:25 p.m. to 144 Didama St. after 911 callers reported seeing flames and smoke coming from the house.  When they arrived, firefighters saw heavy fire coming from the first floor that extended soon after to the second floor, Deputy Fire Chief James Farewell said.  It took firefighters about 20 minutes to extinguish the flames. The house, which was vacant, took heavy damage, Farewell said.  A power line that had burned off from the front of the house had temporarily taken a firetruck out of service after the power line landed near it, Farewell said. National Grid crews cut power to the pole in about 15 minutes.  Flames spread to two neighboring houses but damage was minimal, Farewell said. Residents in those homes will be able to return tonight.  No one was injured, Farewell said. Investigators are working to determine what caused the fire.

This weekend’s blaze comes after another house fire on May 4th, which was caused by a battery-powered scooter, fire officials say.  “Unfortunately we expect to see more,” said Chief Freedman. “These two fires alone have displaced almost a dozen people and sent three of them to the hospital. If you, a family member, or roommate have a scooter, e-bike, or other device powered by lithium-ion batteries, it’s extremely important to understand the hazards involved and take the right steps to avoid them.”  Now, officials are urging the community to remain safe when using lithium-ion batteries, especially larger ones, like those used by scooters and e-bikes. They offer the following tips:  Have a working smoke alarm installed on every level of your home.  Only use the device’s original batteries and charging equipment from its manufacturer.  Charge the battery directly into a wall outlet, without an extension cord or power strip.  When possible, store scooters and e-bikes outdoors. If it has to be inside, keep them away from doors, windows, and stairs.  Charge only one battery at a time.  If the battery is damaged or shows other strange changes, including smoking or leaking, stop using it immediately.  If you need to dispose of the battery, recycle it at a designated station, which can be located here.  “Lithium-ion batteries store a tremendous amount of power,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “When they burn, they burn extremely hot and extremely fast. A fire like this can ignite nearby combustibles, furniture, and the structure itself, just as we’ve seen in these two recent fires. It’s vitally important to use, store, and charge them according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remain nearby when they’re charging, and to disconnect them from the power source once they’re charged.”  Download the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.

South Zanesville Fire Chief Russell Taylor said his crews responded to a house fire that began just before 11 a.m. at 285 Washington, which he said was fully involved upon their arrival.  The dry and windy conditions eventually helped it spread to homes at 291 and 293 Washington. Area crews fought the blazes for most of six hours before returning to station around 5 p.m., Taylor said.  Low water supply forced Taylor, who was commander at the scene at the request of the Roseville Volunteer Fire Department, to deploy the Muskingum County Tanker Task Force. Resources from nearby Perry County were also activated.  ""Some hydrants didn't work, and some were working and not putting out much,"" Taylor said. ""It's a danger time (for fires) because it's dry and grass is crispy. It's not 'red alert,' but everything has gone dry and the problem there was water supply.""  The homes at 285 and 291 were deemed total losses, while the home at 293 received moderate damage. Two adults and a grandchild were in the 285 home at the time of the fire, while a male and two females were in 291. The structure at 293 included three adults and six children.  ""The lady (at 285) told us she was watching TV, then the TV flickered,"" Taylor explained. ""She smelled smoke like something was burning, and the bedroom wall was on fire and it spread.""  No residents were injured, but several pets, mostly cats, were lost, Taylor said. In addition, a firefighter suffered minor injuries as the result of a trip hazard.  Zemba Brothers had already began cleanup of the sites on Thursday evening, due to the danger at the site. The Village of Roseville is recommending a boil advisory, due to the amount of water used on Thursday.  Taylor said no foul play is suspected, although the incident remains under investigation by the State Fire Marshal. The residents at 285 and 291 ""lost everything,"" Taylor said.  The continued run of dry, windy conditions are only adding to the local fire risk, Taylor said. He said residents should use common sense more than ever, such as avoiding the use of too many extension cords and keeping up on maintenance.  Taylor said it was the biggest fire, in terms of intensity and fire load, that his crew had fought in some time. He's hoping it's not a sign of things to come, but the weather conditions aren't helping.

If you're enjoying this article, you'll love my daily morning newsletter, How To LA. Every weekday, you'll get fresh, community-driven stories that catch you up with our independent local news. Subscribe  Southern Californians are enjoying a respite from wildfires as frequent storms and cool temperatures keep what feels like a wet blanket over much of the Southland.  Fast-growing chaparral plants such as grasses and mustard are soaking up the moisture and shooting up in height, taking advantage of the saturated soil and lack of drought.  But those lush, verdant hillsides will soon dry out, as May Gray and June Gloom drop off and Santa Ana winds return. That will leave tinder-dry conditions throughout much of the county and the potential for numerous “flash fires” — sudden, intense fires that rip through vegetation and can be caused by a single spark.  “When we talk about grassy fuels people say, ‘It's just grass,’ but when you're looking at some of this grass, it’s 7, 8, 10 feet tall,” said Los Angeles County Fire Captain Sheila Kelliher Berkoh.  “On a hot day, when the wind is blowing, we can still see some pretty big fires. We had one out in the Antelope Valley that got to 1,300 acres pretty quick and it was all flash fuels,” she said.  These fast-moving fires are often caused by people — sometimes from cigarettes being thrown out of cars or sparks from machinery and vehicles. They can quickly burn structures and homes but are less likely to grow into the megawatt blazes that have become the norm. But if a big enough grass fire keeps burning under the right conditions, Kelliher Berkoh says it could take off.  “If you just try to light a log, it's not going to light, but you put a bunch of light flashy fuels under there, you're going to generate enough heat to finally get that big log burning,” she said.  Where’s all that snow?  Most of it is still in the mountains. The Southern Sierra Nevada snowpack is at 435% of normal for this time of year , indicating a gradual melt so far. That’s good news for forested areas around timberline where snow is still on the ground, where the slow-melting snowpack has given higher elevations a buffer against massive forest fires.  The National Interagency Fire Center predicts large fire activity will be below normal in the higher elevations through September as the snowpack continues to melt and keeps soil moisture high.  The risk of wildfires in Southern California increases from June to July as temperatures go up. (Courtesy of the National Interagency Fire Center)  What is SoCal’s fire outlook?  Experts say the potential for a significant fire will remain below normal across the region in June, except in areas across the San Joaquin Valley and deserts, which dry out faster.  The National Interagency Fire Center experts also expect the marine layer to remain deep throughout the month, keeping our fire potential low. The fire risk will rise in July as the marine layer becomes shallow and the scrub brush dries out.    Create defensible space before it's too late  The green grasses around your home will soon become a liability, so start your brush clearance now.  “If you provide the defense, we'll provide the offense,” Kelliher Berkoh said. “And the defense is brush clearance from about 200 feet away from your home, getting all those flashy grassy fuels knocked down to about two to three inches only,” she said.  She recommends removing debris from underneath bushes and trimming trees that touch the roof. To prevent flying embers from getting stuck and setting your house on fire, fix holes or spaces around your attic or between your roofline and house.  “If we did get a high wind day and those flashy fuels ignite as that fire blows by, it will keep embers from getting stuck in your house and causing an after ignition,” she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vbGFpc3QuY29tL25ld3MvY2xpbWF0ZS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9pdHMtYmVlbi1hLXdldC15ZWFyLWJ1dC1mbGFzaC1maXJlcy1saWtlbHktaW4tc29jYWwtd2hlbi1ob3QtdGVtcHMtcmV0dXJu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  WASHINGTON, USA — The intense fires burning in Canada have blanketed the east coast in thick smoke, which is a reminder that fire season in Washington is right around the corner.  There is widespread concern about the severity of the upcoming fire season after this year's dry spring.  University of Washington Professor Daniel Jaffe studies and teaches courses in atmospheric sciences. He says the East Coast smoke is a reminder to be prepared.  “The most important message is to be prepared, expect smoke if we don’t get it that’s great but be prepared with N95s and air purifiers,” Jaffe said.  Jaffe said that smoke doesn’t have to originate in Washington to cause a problem.  “These absolutely will become more common occurrences as we get warmer and we dry out, we dry out the fuels, we increase the likelihood of having large wildfires,” Jaffe said.  The Washington Department of Natural Resources Wildfire Communications Manager Thomas Kyle-Wilward echoed Jaffe's statement.  “We’re seeing a lot of these hotter, drier summers and it’s becoming kind of commonplace for us to see larger fires on the landscape each year,” Kyle-Wilward said.  While it's difficult to predict, Kyle-Wilward said this year's dry spring will have an impact on the fire season.  “This year without that more of a typical spring – with a lack of precipitation and dry areas of the state through May, we’re instead going to be right in the thick of it with another year that we’ll probably have some smoke impacts at some points during the year,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW5nNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNoL3NjaWVuY2UvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvc21va2UtZmlsbGVkLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29ucy1tb3JlLWNvbW1vbi10ZW1wZXJhdHVyZXMtdHJlbmQtd2FybWVyLzI4MS1iOWY4OWI2MS0wNWFiLTQ5YjctYjc1Mi01OTlhMzc0ZjlhZDXSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2luZzUuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3RlY2gvc2NpZW5jZS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9zbW9rZS1maWxsZWQtZmlyZS1zZWFzb25zLW1vcmUtY29tbW9uLXRlbXBlcmF0dXJlcy10cmVuZC13YXJtZXIvMjgxLWI5Zjg5YjYxLTA1YWItNDliNy1iNzUyLTU5OWEzNzRmOWFkNQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Charlene Randolph, an instructor, returned to see what was left of New Phoenix Pottery.  “It’s trash,” said Randolph, “We went in there for a minute and the ceiling fell down on my head and another student’s head, and I said, ‘Get out. Everybody out’. So it’s really unsafe to be in there and just a lot of work. People put their heart and soul in things we create here, and you just have to let it go.”  Some report first spotting the flames shooting up from the roof above a consignment shop, and tensions are running high.  “They noticed the fire or something started so they just ran out with their dogs and they called the owner, but they didn’t call 911,” said Eva Hamilton, a business partner at Central Tae Kwon Do, “So somebody else called 911.”  It took firefighters almost four hours to extinguish the flames, and now merchants who have struggled to stay in business in recent years are facing an even greater challenge.

The cool, wet spring has helped limit fire activity but Lewis and Clark Sheriff Leo Dutton and Wolf Creek-Craig Volunteer Fire Chief Rocky Infanger say people who plan to burn debris should still exercise caution.  ""What we're looking at is closing debris burning for July and August, the two hottest months of the year. Try to reduce the number of unwanted fires,"" said Infanger.  Even though Lewis and Clark County has seen a wet spring so far, public officials don't want the public to forget how dry it can get.  ""What we'd like to do is have people prepared for wildfire season, regardless of what the start is. Human-caused fires are one of our biggest problems, be it an escape campfire, or a debris burn that somebody thought was out, and a week later it ignites something and takes off. So what we're trying to do is reduce those starts,"" said Infanger.  Sheriff Dutton says residents who live in areas susceptible to wildfire should have a plan and be ready to evacuate if their home is threatened by fire.  ""The best thing to do to avoid panic is training, and we train for evacuations, we work with other agencies, fire departments, other law enforcement agencies. Those will be critical in these times. We hope that we don't have any fires, but if we do, we're counting on citizens to be trained to help us,"" said Dutton.  Dutton and Wolf Creek Craig Volunteer Fire Department Chief Rocky Infanger stressed that when they close open burning, it applies to large organic waste fires and pile burning, and it doesn't impact small recreational and campfires.  ""One thing important to note is this is not a restriction on campfires, on recreational fires. This is organic material that people would burn,"" said Dutton.  While burning remains open for now, it is important to remember that if you do plan to burn you need a permit, and need to activate it before each fire.  ""The idea came from the fire department, I wholeheartedly support it, is to shut open debris burning down for these two months, and see how it goes. If it's raining in the entire month of July, then all of the experts are going to re-examine what we've done and see if we need to keep it close, but chances are they're not going to,"" said Dutton.

Superintendent John Hall said Thursday the cause of the fire does not appear to be suspicious, however the official cause of the fire remains under investigation.  Clean up crews were on site Thursday using large fans to remove the smell of smoke from the building located at 203 E. Plaquemine Street in Jennings. Crews were also working to clean out the ventilation system, duct work and other areas affected by smoke and water.  Email newsletter signup  Although the fire was contained to a small area in the attic, Hall said smoke damage was reported throughout the building. Water damage was reported to at least four rooms, including the carpet.  The fire also interrupted internet and telephone service to the office, which will remain closed through the weekend to allow cleanup work to continue.  Summer school programs at Jennings Elementary School were also canceled Thursday because of the lack of internet, telephone and intercom systems. They are expected to resume next week.  An ACT Boot Camp scheduled for Friday will be held.  Hall said he received a call from the Jennings Police Department around 7:25 p.m. Wednesday reporting that the School Board office was on fire.  “It appears the attic above the restrooms caught on fire and it had been smoldering for a long time and slowly built up,” he said. “We are very fortunate that the fire contained itself to a 4 foot by 4 foot area in the attic and that it stayed in the attic.”  He described the damages as “mild” with damages estimated at $50,000 to $100,000.  Installation, some walls and carpet will have to be replaced. Portable restrooms will also have to be used while repairs are made to the restrooms, which were damaged in the fire.  Hall said the fire is more an inconvenience than anything for the more than 30 employees who work in the central office.  “We still have a business to run and payroll to do, but without internet it has been hard to keep up and running,” he said.  The fire was first reported by a Jennings police officer who was a block away from the building and saw the smoke.  “I will definitely be buying him lunch for many, many weeks,” Hall joked. “I thank him so much for being observant and taking action.”  Hall also praised the Jennings Fire Department for their quick response in putting the fire out.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FucHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDgvZmlyZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtdHJ5aW5nLXRvLWRldGVybWluZS1zb3VyY2Utb2YtamVmZi1kYXZpcy1zY2hvb2wtYm9hcmQtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The money comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, specially from its Staffing For Adequate Emergency Response Grants (SAFER) program. The program is aimed at funding fire departments to help them increase or maintain the number of firefighters available in their communities.  The City of Oakland is currently dealing with a historic $360 million budget deficit, which Mayor Sheng Thao has proposed to solve with a two-year budget plan called the One Oakland Budget. The budget calls for, in part, spending reductions across city departments.  Get a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area’s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.  The budget prioritizes avoiding layoffs, but it would have meant the Oakland Fire Department would have had to suspend one of its engine companies. That could have meant potentially slower response times to fires reported by Oakland residents in the affected district.  In order to avoid this outcome, members of the OFD with the assistance of the City Council applied for the SAFER program.  Winning the grant means two things. First, OFD won’t need to brown out any of its engine companies. And second, the money will cover the salary and fringe benefits for 35 new firefighters over three years.  “Now we don’t have to select a neighborhood fire house that will have to go without, that would run the chance of having a delayed response time from their fire department because that company is browned out,” said Fire Chief Reginald Freeman. “Now we don’t have to have that conversation. And now we don’t have to risk the lives of any of our residents, particularly on an EMS call, because we’re delayed in getting there because a company is coming from a neighboring district.”  Freeman also noted this will help provide relief to firefighters already with the OFD, many of whom are working mandatory overtime of up to 11 days in a row.  Friday, June 9, is also Freeman’s last day with the OFD before his retirement from public service. In honor of his service, Mayor Sheng Thao presented him with a Mayor’s Proclamation during the gathering.  Following that, City Administrator Jestin Johnson announced that Deputy Chief Damon Covington would step up as interim fire chief.  Covington has been with the OFD since 2001, when he started as a firefighter paramedic.  “I’m humbled to be there today,” said Covington. “And please know that Oakland will continue on the trajectory that Chief Freeman has put us on. And we’re going to continue to accomplish and achieve the things that he set forth for us.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvb2FrbGFuZC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtZmVkZXJhbC1ncmFudC8zMjQ4MTYyL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvb2FrbGFuZC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtZmVkZXJhbC1ncmFudC8zMjQ4MTYyLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(AP Photo/Christian Chavez, File)  A federal judge in Mexico has charged another migrant for his suspected role in the March blaze at a border detention center that left 40 dead and dozens more wounded  MEXICO CITY -- A federal judge in Mexico has charged another Venezuelan migrant for his alleged role in the March blaze at a Mexican detention center that left 40 dead and dozens more wounded.  Mexico prosecutor's office said Thursday in a statement that a man identified as Carlos “C” was charged with homicide, injuries and damages caused by the fire in a migrant detention facility in Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.  Authorities identified him, along with another migrant from Venezuela, as one of the people who allegedly started the fire, which was the deadliest ever at a Mexican immigration facility.  The tragic blaze and its aftermath captured global attention earlier this year as loved ones across the Hemisphere mourned and demanded justice for the victims.  It also sparked controversy and intense criticism about the treatment of migrants by both Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and American authorities, which have constantly pressured the Mexican government to ward off rising arrivals of people from across Latin America and the Caribbean.  On March 27, a small number of the migrants being held in the detention facility started a fire in their cell apparently to protest conditions. Their highly flammable mattresses quickly filled the area with smoke and guards fled without unlocking their cell, security camera videos show.  In response, authorities have already opened criminal proceedings against Francisco Garduño, head of Mexico's National Migration Institute, and another director for unlawful exercise of public service and failure to perform their duties, which resulted in death by asphyxiation of many migrants.  Authorities also detained six other immigration officers, a private security guard and the other migrant, charging them with homicide and for other injuries caused by the fire. Following the fire, NMI closed small- and medium-sized detention facilities similar to the one in Ciudad Juárez, and began a review of conditions in larger facilities.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbWV4aWNvLWNoYXJnZXMtbWlncmFudC1kZXRlbnRpb24tY2VudGVyLWZpcmUta2lsbGVkLTQwLTk5OTQ3NTc20gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3RvcnkvbWV4aWNvLWNoYXJnZXMtbWlncmFudC1kZXRlbnRpb24tY2VudGVyLWZpcmUta2lsbGVkLTQwLTk5OTQ3NTc2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The entire fire area was in patrol and monitor status. Crews are continuing to patrol the northern perimeter looking for and extinguishing hot spots. A drone flew an infrared mapping flight over the west side of the fire east of Indian Creek. Data collected showed that the line is still holding. The east side of the fire, where firefighters worked to protect several residences is in monitor status.  A handcrew was flown up to the Black Mountain Lookout yesterday by helicopter. The crew removed the fire resistant wrapping used to protect the lookout in the initial days of the fire.  On Thursday crew activity will look much like it did Wednesday. The two main areas firefighters will be watching will be the west side at Indian Creek and the northeast side above Beaver Creek. A warmer and drier weather pattern is developing and fire activity is expected to increase over the next few days. A southwest wind will tend to push the fire back into itself over most of the fire area. Very little heat has been observed across the northern portion of the fire for several days.  The complexity of fighting the Pass Fire is decreasing and fire managers are preparing to transition to a smaller type 3 organization. This change will bring the resources assigned into alignment with current and projected needs to meet the objectives and continue to protect values at risk.  Weather: Southwest winds have reestablished over the fire area bringing decreased humidity and an increase in temperature. Winds will be 10-15 mph over the fire.  Aviation Restrictions: ATemporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is still in place over the Pass Fire. All non-fire aircraft are restricted. This includes civilian drones. Unauthorized aircraft in the area will ground firefighting aircraft, hindering firefighting efforts.  Closures: The Gila National Forest remains open.

Dallas Evenstad, age 34, is charged with second-degree murder and first-degree assault for the early morning fire on Sunday, June 4.  Fire crews and sheriff's deputies responded around 3:30 a.m. for the fire on Cambridge Drive, which runs along the west side of Goose Lake, about 40 miles north of the Twin Cities. As deputies responded, they were told by dispatch that a woman, who had been seriously burned, told rescuers that the fire had been intentionally set.  At the scene, deputies spoke with another victim, a 69-year-old man, who was ""screaming in pain"" but able to tell investigators what happened.  According to the charges, the man and woman were in bed at their home when a man they identified as Evenstad entered the room and doused both victims with gas, and lit a flame.  The 69-year-old man was rushed to Hennepin County Medical Center where he later died. The charges state the victim had severe burns over 80 to 90 percent of his body, the medical examiner determined. The other victim, a 42-year-old woman, later told deputies the same version of events, saying she was in bed and woke up to the smell of gasoline and a man in the bedroom. After escaping the fire, without a phone, she drove to a neighbor's home to get help.  She was rushed to Regions Hospital where deputies say she suffered second and third-degree burns.  The 69-year-old victim's daughter arrived at the scene and told deputies that she and her father were familiar with Evenstad. According to the charges, the daughter said Evenstad had threatened her in the past.  Evenstad was arrested shortly after when a Crosby man reported to police that Evenstad had shown up to his home shirtless, less than two hours after the fire, and asked if he could ""crash"" there.  Investigators found that Evenstad had been driving a vehicle stolen out of Waite Park, Minnesota. Inside the vehicle, deputies found a pink and gray lighter and a shirt that smelled of gasoline.  The charges don't spell out Evenstad's exact relationship to the family or any motive behind the attack.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDkuY29tL25ld3MvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtd2l0aC1zZXR0aW5nLWNvdXBsZS1vbi1maXJlLWF0LWNlbnRyYWwtbWlubmVzb3RhLWhvbWXSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g5LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbi1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtc2V0dGluZy1jb3VwbGUtb24tZmlyZS1hdC1jZW50cmFsLW1pbm5lc290YS1ob21lLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to Isaacs, crews spent roughly two hours putting out the fire. No casualties were reported, and no one appears to have been in the building at the time of the fire, he said.  “It is hard to say how long it was going on at that time,” Isaacs said. “The morning is low traffic so it had a head start before anybody notified us.”  Stir Fry Group, the company that owns the restaurant, said the loss extends past just the building.  “The meat is the primary food cost and then into beer, wine and liquor that’s held on-site, plus the loss of sales revenue,” said Nathan Buckmaster, regional manager for the Stir Fry Group.  Buckmaster said in addition to the loss of the building and inventory, there is the staff to consider.  “We have a staff of maybe 40 people, including several managers, that have families that need to be supported as well,” Buckmaster said. “So this is a monstrous loss.”  According to Isaacs, 19 departments and 64 firefighters assisted in the fire. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is also assisting in the investigation into the fire.

Lewis County is experiencing unseasonably dry conditions and an unusual amount of runaway burn piles.  “After careful review of the current and extended weather forecast, the Lewis County Commissioners, Community Development Director and Fire Marshal have determined that current weather conditions within Lewis County have created substantial fire danger,” said Lewis County Fire Marshal Doyle Sanford.  Recreational campfires in designated campgrounds and on private lands are still allowed if:  The campfire is no greater than 3 feet in diameter inside a ring constructed of metal, stone or brick 8 inches above the surface,  The campfire has an area at least 10 feet around it cleared of all flammable materials and at least 20 feet of clearance from overhead flammable materials or fuels, and  The campfire is attended at all times by a responsible person with the ability to extinguish the fire with a shovel and a 5-gallon bucket of water or garden hose.  If building a campfire, the fire marshal says it’s important to completely extinguish the fire by pouring water or moist soil in them and stirring with a shovel until all parts are cool to the touch.  The burning restriction applies to applicants with a current open burning permit, which now expire at 12:00 midnight June 8.  The burn ban will be in place until the conditions improve.

The video above is from ABC13's Live Streaming Channel.  Firefighters from Klein and Ponderosa responded just after 6 p.m. to the London Park Apartments in the 145000 block of Bammel North Houston near Walters Road.  Video shared with ABC13 showed intense flames taking over multiple apartments. The fire started at the height of the storm, resident Emma Johnson said.  How it started was too close for Dra-kkar Wesley.  ""The transformer exploded and landed on the corner of my patio,"" he said.  The father then grabbed his three children and got out.  Deputy Chief Steve Kramer of Klein Volunteer Fire Department said their response was a little slower than usual due to traffic buildup caused by power outages at intersections. Seventy-two firefighters were on scene, fighting the fire from the ground and above by way of a tower ladder truck.  Eight units were destroyed, Kramer said. Eight more had water and smoke damage, and everyone escaped unharmed.  While residents believe weather is to blame, the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office will make that determination after an investigation.

It's coming from CTW Greenwaste Recycling – a local company that takes in organic waste and composts it into a 100% recycled amendment for farming.

""Our house just smells of kind of like cigarette smoke, kind of just lingers all morning until we get the air purifiers going and the fans,"" said Kristen Marion, a Gilbert resident. ""It's been annoying.""  The state climatologist for Arizona says the smoke gets trapped by night temperatures, then gets pushed out in the morning.  ""What that does is it traps some of that soot from that smoldering pile of mulch, and so as it accumulates through the night, we can smell it better in the morning because then our winds start to pick up and shift it, and those winds come from the east and shift it to the 60 and Gilbert and into the metro area, and we can absolutely smell it,"" Saffell said.

""It's a really weird year in that no fire restrictions are in effect right now,"" said Randi Shaffer, Deputy Public Affairs Officer with the U.S. Forest Service.  Right now, there are only small area closures around three wildfires that are currently burning in addition to the existing year-round camping and campfire ban, the boundaries of which were expanded in May to cut down on human-caused fires.  Reggie Roakes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Flagstaff, attributes this year's unusual fire season to the area's record-breaking winter snowfall followed by extensive snowmelt and extended showers.  This has created ample moisture for the area and kept wildfire fuels from drying out early, he said.  In normal years, the area is usually under Stage 2 full fire restrictions by this point in the season, Shaffer said.  ""We'd typically be at the point where we're not allowing campfires for dispersed camping or allowing campfires for campground camping,"" she said.  Rangers are still patrolling the forest as the agency continues with public outreach to educate those who may be used to camping in the newly restricted areas.  Shaffer emphasizes that mindful camping, like fully extinguishing campfires and ensuring its cold to the touch before leaving, is still vital to keeping the area safe and fire-free.  ""Just because there are no fire restrictions in effect doesn't mean the best practices of having a campfire out in the forest don't still apply,"" she said.

Every summer and fall, wildfires in America wreck homes, air quality and lives. While many of the current fires in Canada were caused by lightning that landed on dry forests, here in the States, lightning is rarely the culprit. An astonishing 80 percent are caused by human carelessness. That means they could have been prevented with smarter behavior in our increasingly flammable wild lands. With so much smoke polluting the air so early in the fire season, maybe we can finally stop thinking of wildfires as out of our control.  In the American West, evidence of fire foolishness is all around us. Nearly two years ago, the Caldor fire was allegedly started by a father and son who appear to have gone out shooting in a dry forest during California’s peak fire season, while smoke from the massive Dixie fire still hung heavy in the air. The Caldor fire scorched nearly 222,000 acres, destroyed 1,005 structures, injured multiple people and sent my husband and me packing ahead of the evacuation order.  When I drive past the moonscaped mountains and blackened tree skeletons where lush green forest used to be before the fire, I still get sad, then mad.  Lives lost. Landscapes destroyed. Habitats gone. And yet we continue to find new ways to be fire foolish in the wild lands. A gender-reveal party with a pyrotechnic smoke bomb on a high-heat, low-humidity day.

MCAS Cherry Point leaders and representatives from Office in Charge of Construction Florence, Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, and Cherry Point firefighter legacy ceremonially broke ground on the patch of land at the corner of Roosevelt Boulevard and Oak Street for Military Construction Project 142A and B.    The project scope includes the design and construction of two facilities that will replace the air station’s Main Fire Station. The new Main Fire Station will be a one-story 29,000-square-foot facility outfitted with state-of-the-art fittings and functions. The project includes the construction of a satellite fire station of 16,000 square feet located about a mile west of the main station along Roosevelt Boulevard. The two, more than 80-year-old buildings that currently house Fire and Emergency Services also will be demolished as a part of the project.  “This is exciting for us. The devastation of Hurricane Florence brought about this opportunity to build these facilities back better."" Cmdr. J.D. Patton, Operations officer for OICC Florence  According to Cherry Point Fire Chief Josh Boudreau, the facilities’ design concepts centered around firefighter-related disease prevention, functionality, and quality-of-life, and will include technically advanced filtration systems, negative-pressure vestibules, decontamination corridors, gear cleaning and storage areas, and fitness and recreation spaces.    “It is no exaggeration that our firefighters will spend half of their time, for 20, 25 or 30 years, on duty in these stations, doing what we love,” Boudreau said.    The package of projects is remarkable for the OICC, as it represents a great opportunity to improve the air station’s capabilities and bring multiple facilities up-to date.    “This is exciting for us. The devastation of Hurricane Florence brought about this opportunity to build these facilities back better,” said Cmdr. J.D. Patton, Operations officer for OICC Florence. “These projects are effectively replacing base infrastructure and will serve the station for a very long time.”    Site construction for the P-142B portion of the contract marked the official start the project, which got underway in April. P-142 is projected to be completed by late summer 2024. It is one of the five major recovery projects that was awarded to Whiting-Turner in August 2020. The $149 million-package of projects includes construction of six additional replacement facilities: the Provost Marshal’s Office, a headquarters support squadron building, two new fire stations, a motor transportation and communication shop, and a replacement range operations center at an outlying field.    Of the projects in progress, P-162 is on target to be completed first, by the fall. It is the construction of two facilities that will house the air station and wing support squadrons and PMO. P-246 that got underway in August 2022 will replace the Range Operations Center and tower currently located at Bombing Target 11. It is projected to be completed in the summer of 2024.

It happened on Forest Hills Road in the Lake Forest Hills neighborhood.  Captain Eric Prosswimmer with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department believes there was an electrical problem in the house’s attic that sparked the fire.  Firefighters got to the scene around 8:45 a.m. and put the fire out within thirty minutes.  According to JFRD, one person was home when the fire broke out and managed to make it out of the house before first responders got there.  Prosswimmer said it was crucial firefighters got that fire out quickly.  “The fact that it was contained in the attic space itself lent a hand to us and extinguishing it,” he said. “Once you get water in there, it turns into steam, and it does not have a lot of places to go. There is not a lot of oxygen feeding the fire.”  Homeowners said a tree fell on the house in May 2022 and have been working to get it repaired before this fire. That included running into serious issues with a company hired to do the job.  The Red Cross is helping them for the time being because of the damage the fire caused, but the house is salvageable.  “We have pulled ceilings, we have turned some stuff up to get to [the fire] and get water on it,” Prosswimmer said. “[At] the peak of the roof, [the fire] stops pretty much there.

(KTVZ) – A California man had just refueled his twin-engine plane at Bend Municipal Airport and was taxiing away to fly home Thursday afternoon when a wing tip clipped the metal support for the awning over the fuel pumps, sparking an intense fire that destroyed the plane, heavily damaged the pumps and prompted area road closures and evacuations.  But the pilot and passenger got out of the 1978 Cessna 340 A and escaped injury, and the safety elements of the fuel pumps kept a far worse situation - an explosion - from happening, officials said.  The first Bend Fire & Rescue crews to arrive found the aircraft fueling station fully ablaze and flames spreading to the plane parked beside it, Fire Marshal Dan Derlacki said.  With the closest buildings 50 feet away from the tanks, crews were able to quickly put a lot of water on the fire and stop its spread to any other structures or aircraft, Derlacki said.  Initial concerns of the fuel tanks exploding prompted the evacuation of areas up to 1 ½ miles away and closure of Powell Butte Highway for a short time, until the fire was out. The airport’s air traffic was shut down until 5 p.m. to ensure the safety of those on the ground and those landing.  By the time the fierce fire was out, the plane was heavily damaged, but no injuries were reported. The black smoke plume was visible for several miles in all directions.  Derlacki said investigators determined that the plane clipped the corner metal support for the awning as it taxied away. The wing immediately ignited, and the burning fuel from the aircraft spread to the pumps.  The initial alarm came in around 1:40 p.m. Deschutes County sheriff's deputies closed the Powell Butte Highway and evacuated the area within a 1 to 1.5-mile radius, to avoid inhaling any fumes or smoke.  ""Area residents were notified via the Emergency Preparedness Network, due to the unknown caustic fumes and volatility of the (fuel) that was currently burning at a high rate,"" Sergeant Jason Wall said.  ""Evacuation notices were lifted relatively quickly as the fire was mitigated, and the smoke plume dissipated,"" he added.  Redmond Fire & Rescue responded with one of their aircraft rescue firefighting engines (ARFF) from the Redmond Airport. The specialty fire truck is equipped with AFFF foam designed for aircraft and flammable fuel fires. The foam was used to complete extinguishing of the plane fire and prevent the vapors from the reminding fuel from reigniting.  The fire was reported extinguished by 3 p.m.  ""With the protected design of these tanks and fueling station, the tanks were equipped with over pressure relief valves on top and shut-off valves in the system,"" Derlacki said in a later news release. ""The vents allowed the vapors from the fuel inside to escape and not allow it to build up pressure inside. This pressure would’ve led to the tanks exploding.  ""The shut off valves kept the remaining fuel inside tanks and not spilling out,"" he said. ""Two above-ground tanks supply the fuel pumps; one had 6,000 gallons of aviation fuel in it, the other 3,000 gallons of jet fuel. Approximately 180 gallons of fuel was in the aircraft and was still leaking after the fire. Maintenance crews from Leading Edge Aviation worked to secure that leak. All water runoff was contained on site and did not appear to pose any further threat.  ""Estimated value of the aircraft is $300,000 and is a complete loss. The fuel tanks and pump station are valued at $500,000. The loss on the pump system is estimated at $250,000,"" Derlacki added.  Earlier, Wall had urged people to “please avoid the area. If you are currently in the area, please evacuate in a calm and orderly manner.”  “We are recommending the community avoid the inhalation of fumes/smoke by evacuating at least 1 to 1.5 miles from the area,” Wall added in the initial, brief news release. “At this time, Powell Butte Highway is closed to the public until the area is rendered safe.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2t0dnouY29tL25ld3MvYmVuZC8yMDIzLzA2LzA4L3BsYW5lcy13aW5nLWNsaXBzLWJlbmQtYWlycG9ydC1mdWVsLXB1bXBzLWF3bmluZy1zdXBwb3J0LWlnbml0ZXMtZmlyZS1wcm9tcHRpbmctYXJlYS1ldmFjdWF0aW9uLXJvYWQtY2xvc3VyZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As of 9 p.m., the Harmony Ridge Fire, located at mile marker 42 just off Interstate-15 east of New Harmony, was 70 percent contained and is no longer a threat to any structures in the area. That was not the case about two hours prior when voluntary evacuations were in place and several homes were threatened.  “Between air and the guys on the ground, is what helped wrap this up pretty quickly,” Paula Imlay told KSL5TV.  The fire was called in around 5 p.m. on Thursday. Two airplanes and one bucketed helicopter were immediately dispatched to the scene to create a barrier for the fire to run into in order to give ground crews the ability to safely get it under control. Initially, the fire was threatening 5 primary/secondary homes and communication towers and evacuations were voluntary.  “We don’t want to put firefighters in front of an active moving fire,” Imlay said explaining why air resources were used on the 3-5 acre fire.  Buckets of water were dropped on the fire from above by the helicopter, as well as lines of retardant were dropped by the fixed-wing aircrafts.  This approach allows for firefighters to create a line of defense against the fire, compared to battling the fire alongside it as it burns.  At this time the cause of the fire is under investigation.  Imlay urged the public to avoid the area to allow fire crews to finish moping up the fire.

"fire","2009-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Halifax"", ""NovaScotia"", ""Canada""}","2023-06-08T20:15:00","When will the smoke clear?  That’s what so many people in the eastern US are asking after winds swept smoke from wildfires in Canada into major cities including New York and Philadelphia earlier this week. It’s caused air quality to plummet. For part of the week, New York had the worst air pollution of any major city in the world, and officials across the East have urged residents to stay indoors.  But perhaps a more important question is: When will it happen again?  While the path of smoke is influenced by local weather and hard to forecast, it’s clear that wildfires like those in Canada are getting worse as the planet warms. And where there’s fire, there’s smoke. So while scary events like this are temporary, they may also become more common. These fires are not an outlier as much as a harbinger of what’s to come.  I spoke about this with Morgan Crowley, a fire scientist with Canada’s Forest Service, who’s involved in monitoring wildfires. She has advice for East Coasters who are experiencing fire smoke for the first time and is working on a project to help Canada be more prepared during future outbreaks. One hopeful takeaway from our conversation is that firefighters are more prepared than ever.  Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. During our conversation, Crowley referenced notes from two other Canadian government scientists: Lynn Johnston and Mark de Jong.  The new normal  Benji Jones  How surprising is it to see so many fires in eastern Canada?  Morgan Crowley  Fires in eastern Canada are not unexpected. Last year, for example, Newfoundland had a couple of fires that cut off access to some communities, even though it was a relatively quiet fire season everywhere else. There was a big fire in 2009 that impacted Halifax.  But usually, there’s lower fire activity in the region. Part of the problem is that we saw very little snow in the east this year, and then we had a really dry spring, in the east particularly. That’s not surprising — we know these conditions are going to become more common — but it’s really unfortunate.  Benji Jones  So is climate change making this the new normal?  Morgan Crowley  We do expect to see more events like this.  Climate change is going to impact Canada more than other regions because it’s closer to the poles. In the west, we expect longer fire seasons. And across Canada in general, we expect fire seasons to get more extreme. The annual area of burned regions is expected to increase — some predictions suggest it could as much as double by 2100.  We’re facing this reality now. The spring burn in Canada is already high, like what people say you might expect in the fall. Many provinces and territories are already in critical fire situations — meaning they might have out-of-control fires close to communities that are prompting evacuations — which makes resource sharing challenging. Parts of Canada are starting the season strapped.  What’s also happening is that across the country, people are moving to forested areas. Fire activity might be shifting with climate change, but communities are also moving into new areas. Our wildland-urban interface is growing.  Benji Jones  How do the fires in the east — the ones impacting US cities like New York and Philadelphia — differ from those out west?  Morgan Crowley  What’s different in the east is that fires are mostly in regions where people are living, such as near Halifax in Nova Scotia [whereas in the west they’re often in more rural areas]. So when a fire breaks out, it’s going to affect communities, some of which are really vulnerable. We have concerns in Canada that we’re gonna see more frequent fires in remote Indigenous communities located in fire-prone areas.  Explain it like I’m 5: Why does warming make fires worse?  Benji Jones  What is the most basic way to understand the mechanism through which climate change is making these fires worse?  Morgan Crowley  With climate change, it’s hotter. So our forests are drier. That means they’re more stressed out, and there’s more dead fuel. They’re basically a tinderbox when lightning strikes. [Drier vegetation burns more easily.]  There have also been studies showing that with a warming climate, there’s going to be more thunderstorms and lightning storms, so there’s going to be more lightning. Hundreds of fires can be lit with one lightning storm. That just increases our likelihood of fires getting out of control because you can’t respond to every single fire.  Benji Jones  Could climate change impact smoke patterns, too? Asking as a New Yorker.  Morgan Crowley  It’s hard to say how winds are changing, but as you can imagine, climate change is shifting everything related to weather. And if there’s more extreme fire behavior, there’s going to be more extreme smoke, and it could come into the States.  How to prepare for more extreme fire seasons  Benji Jones  Scientists know more than ever — they understand that climate change will worsen wildfires. Can we use that info to prepare?  Morgan Crowley  Yes, absolutely. Monitoring and forecasts are getting better and becoming more accessible.  Canada, for example, is launching a satellite specifically designed for monitoring fires — not just detecting them but also providing information about their behavior. This is important because existing satellites don’t pass over when fires are at their most extreme, which is late in the afternoon.  This new satellite will show what the fire is doing then and provide that information faster than existing satellites. These data will be available within 30 minutes of the satellites passing over, so they can be used by fire agencies for fire management and decision-making.  Benji Jones  Beyond confronting climate change and burning fewer fossil fuels, what can we do to bring down the risk of these fires?  Morgan Crowley  That’s a tricky thing because fires are also a natural part of our ecosystem. We can’t put out every fire and we don’t want to put out every fire. Fires are part of the ecology of boreal forests. But obviously, when it comes to mitigating fires there are different responses, and limiting the impacts on communities is the priority.  As for smoke, it’s going to be a reality of more fires in the future so we should prepare for it, such as by making clean air shelters and better air-quality indices, so people really understand whether it’s safe to go outside.  Benji Jones  What is your message for people in US cities who are experiencing wildfire smoke for the first time?  Morgan Crowley  This is our potential future. It’s real. It’s really important that we prepare for our future and find ways to reduce the effects on our vulnerable populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vY2xpbWF0ZS8yMDIzLzYvOC8yMzc1Mzk4MC9jYW5hZGEtZmlyZXMtc21va2UtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYWlyLXF1YWxpdHnSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy52b3guY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC9jbGltYXRlLzIwMjMvNi84LzIzNzUzOTgwL2NhbmFkYS1maXJlcy1zbW9rZS1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1haXItcXVhbGl0eQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In September 2021, a fire broke out at the Ponderosa Pet Resort, killing 75 dogs belonging to 59 families. None of the facility’s staff members were on-site at the time, and there was no sprinkler system.  The City of Georgetown told KXAN after it happened that its fire code, as well as federal and state standards, did not require sprinkler systems for a facility of this type and size.  Months after the incident, Georgetown City Council unanimously approved amendments to the fire code, creating stricter fire precautions for pet care facilities.  Round Rock City Council also recently approved changes to the fire safety requirements for dog daycare facilities.  Austin is the latest Central Texas city to take up amendments to change its fire code and create more safety standards for pet boarding facilities.

Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said in a Thursday press conference that investigators determined that the fire originated from a buried fire that was lit on a private property six days prior to the fire and an unmoored powerline maintained by Xcel Energy.  “While it took time, I can confidently say we know what happened and why,” Johnson said of the 18-month investigation.  Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said during the same press conference that no criminal charges would be filed against either property, as there was insufficient or no evidence of criminal or reckless intent.  The Marshall fire broke out south of Boulder on Dec. 30, 2021 amid persistent and extremely high winds focused close to the base of the foothills. It ultimately destroyed 1,084 homes and seven commercial structures, damaging another 149 homes and 30 commercial structures.  Two people died in the fire, one in the Marshall area and one in Superior.  According to Johnson, the first ignition source for the fire was at 5325 Eldorado Springs Drive, the Twelve Tribes community, from a buried fire that had been lit on Dec. 24. A community member called with concerns about the fire on Dec. 24 and firefighters responded, according to the investigation summary and review.  On that day, the weather was cool, rainy and overcast, there was a water source nearby and the residents planned to bury the fire with dirt. Around 5 p.m., the fire had burned down to coals and a resident covered the fire with dirt — but did not add water to extinguish them.  A photo of the fire lit at the Twelve Tribes community on Dec. 24 that firefighters were called out to. Responders at the time determined the fire was being burned responsibly. Materials provided by Boulder County Sheriff's Office and District Attorney's Office  Residents said they never saw smoke or other indications the fire continued to burn. According to investigators, the extraordinarily high winds on Dec. 30 uncovered the buried fire and exposed still-smoldering embers to fresh oxygen. According to fire experts consulted during the investigation, under certain conditions buried fires can continue to smolder for weeks or even months.  Investigators found no evidence that residents started any other active fires between Dec. 24-30. Once the residents spotted the fire on their property, they also tried to extinguish the fire but it was quickly carried away by the high winds.  A burning shed on the property, which went viral at the time as the potential source of the fire, was found to have no electrical wiring and was not on fire when responders first arrived on the scene.  As for the second ignition point, investigators pinpointed the start to the Marshall Mesa trailhead. The most probable cause was found to be hot particles discharged from Xcel Energy power lines.  The county’s initial investigation focused on the possibility that the second fire was caused by an ember cast from the Eldorado Springs Fire, but it was determined that it was highly improbable that an ember could have traveled over 2,000 feet against prevailing winds to start a second fire.  Red spots on this map show the two spots where investigators believe the Marshall fire began. Materials provided by Boulder County Sheriff's Office and District Attorney's Office  While there were some reports of downed power lines, the only line that went down on Dec. 30 was a communications line that investigators determined did not carry sufficient electrical current to have started a fire.  Using a motion-activated trail camera, a series of photographs showed that between 10:30-11:10 a.m. on Dec. 30, one of three Xcel power lines that run across the top of power poles along the highway came unmoored and sagged low enough to contact a support brace. Investigators found “significant evidence” of electrical arcing.  Tyler Bryant, a spokesperson for Xcel Energy, said in an emailed statement that the company believes the second fire burned in an area already burned by the first ignition and did not cause damage to any homes or businesses.  “We strongly disagree with any suggestion that Xcel Energy’s power lines caused the second ignition, which according to the report started 80 to 110 feet away from Xcel Energy’s power lines in an area with underground coal fire activity,” he said. “Xcel Energy did not have the opportunity to review and comment on the analyses relied on by the Sheriff’s Office and believes those analyses are flawed and their conclusions are incorrect.”  According to the county’s report, Xcel Energy received an opportunity to meet with investigators and provide information, but the company did not produce data or evidence that caused investigators to change their conclusions.  However, investigators found no evidence of criminally negligent or reckless system design or maintenance. It appears the extraordinarily high winds cause the powerline to disconnect and contact other lines, discharging hot particles into a receptive fuel bed.  The unmoored wire from an Xcel Energy powerline that investigators say caused the second ignition in the Marshall fire. Materials provided by Boulder County Sheriff's Office and District Attorney's Office  “We have reviewed our maintenance records and believe the system was properly maintained,” Bryant said. “We operate and maintain our electric system consistent with leading energy service practices and we’re proud of our employees and the work they do to deliver safe, reliable and clean energy to our communities.”  Johnson and Dougherty added that an underground coal fire as the source of ignition could not be ruled out. The specific coal seam running under the Marshall Mesa trailhead is actively burning, but the vents investigated did not have the conditions required to ignite a surface fire.  Doughterty emphasized that in either situation, the district attorney’s office would not have sufficient evidence to pursue a criminal investigation.  “A judge would dismiss this prosecution for not having enough evidence,” he said.  He did also note that a civil process does not have the same strict requirements, and that if additional information comes to light from civil litigation related to the fire his office would review and reconsider the evidence.  The investigation did not determine when or where the two fires might have merged.  A recording of the press conference will soon be available to the public on the sheriff’s office website, along with all investigation materials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvbmdtb250bGVhZGVyLmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JyZWFraW5nLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtcmV2ZWFsLXRoZS1jYXVzZXMtb2YtdGhlLW1hcnNoYWxsLWZpcmUtNzExNjgyNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If you, a family member, or roommate have a scooter, e-bike, or other device powered by lithium-ion batteries, it’s extremely important to understand the hazards involved and take the right steps to avoid them.”  The Medford Fire Department responded to the area of 54 Dartmouth St. at about 10:27 a.m. on June 3. On arrival, the first crews onscene observed heavy smoke and flames from the top floor of the 2½ story, two-family home. The fire grew rapidly, with second and third alarms being struck and firefighters from Arlington, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Melrose, Revere, Somerville, Stoneham, and Winchester responding as mutual aid. The fire was brought under control in about an hour and a half.  The origin and cause of the fire were investigated by the Medford Fire Department, Medford Police Department, and State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office. Based on an examination of the scene and interviews with witnesses, including those who were hospitalized, investigators determined that the fire began in a bedroom on the top floor, and started with a lithium-ion battery that was being charged in that area. The battery was used for an e-bike that was stored outdoors.  “Lithium-ion batteries store a tremendous amount of power,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “When they burn, they burn extremely hot and extremely fast. A fire like this can ignite nearby combustibles, furniture, and the structure itself, just as we’ve seen in these two recent fires. It’s vitally important to use, store, and charge them according to the manufacturer’s instructions, to remain nearby when they’re charging, and to disconnect them from the power source once they’re charged.”  Chief Freedman and State Fire Marshal Ostroskey offered these additional safety tips for lithium-ion batteries and the many devices they power:  Be sure you have working smoke alarms installed on every level of your home.  Use only the original equipment manufacturer’s batteries and charging equipment. Aftermarket or generic batteries and chargers may be cheaper but are more likely to pose a burn, fire, or explosion hazard.  Store scooters and e-bikes outdoors if possible. If you must store them indoors, keep them and their batteries clear of doors, windows, and stairways.  Charge the battery directly from a wall outlet, not an extension cord or power strip. Place it on a hard and stable surface, not a bed, couch, or pillow.  Charge only one battery or device at a time and unplug it when it’s fully charged. Don’t allow a charged battery to continue charging.  If you notice changes to the battery or the device, including damage, an unusual odor, a change in color, too much heat, change in shape, leaking, smoking, or not keeping a charge, stop using it right away.  If and when it’s time to dispose of the battery, don’t put it in the trash.

Violators may also be held personally responsible for reimbursement of fire suppression costs.  To further help to prevent wildfires, never throw cigarettes out of a vehicle window. Use an ashtray instead. Never park a vehicle over dry grass as the underside of a vehicle can get hot enough to ignite the vegetation. Make sure your vehicle is in good operating condition, tires are well inflated, and check for any dragging metal or chains from towed trailers.

Inside the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre headquarters in Manitoba’s capital, just east of the exact longitudinal centre of Canada, there are discussions on how best to battle blazes from coast to coast.  “It's definitely an unprecedented season,"" Jennifer Kamau, communications manager for the centre, said Tuesday.  “It started early and it accelerated very quickly.""  Federal officials warned this week that Canada could see its worst year for wildfire destruction. They said the risks from warm and dry conditions are forecasted to persist in nearly every province and territory through the summer.  ""This is a scary time for a lot of people,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday.  There were 415 active wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, and 238 were considered out of control. Evacuations have been widespread, occurring in nine provinces and territories, and have affected more than 100,000 people since early May.  It has meant long hours for people working at the centre, trying to figure out where firefighters and equipment are needed most at any given time, Kamau said.  The centre was created in 1982 and is a federally incorporated not-for-profit. It is owned and operated by the provincial and territorial agencies that are responsible for wildland management in their regions.  When fire season begins, it’s the epicentre for decisions about how firefighting resources will be shared across the country. That includes deciding how, when and where to move hundreds of firefighters, as well as equipment and aircraft.  There are weekly meetings with provinces and territories, Kamau explained, so they are aware what the fire and staff situation is everywhere.  When wildfires pick up in a region, local officials call the centre to see what extra resources are available. Kamau said the centre then finds what resources can be shared from elsewhere in the country and works to move those resources into the areas that need help most.  There have been difficult years before, she said, but this year is posing a significant challenge. Firefighters and equipment have largely been sent to Alberta, she said, but there’s also been need for help in Quebec, the Northwest Territories, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Nova Scotia.  The country is at its highest national preparedness level of five, which means demand for resources is extreme.  ""It's definitely been a busy season so far and it will probably set some records,” Kamau said.  The centre has reached out to international partners for help.  Kamau said agreements between the federal governments and other countries are crucial, especially as wildfires are expected to worsen. Opposite wildfire seasons in the Northern and Southern hemispheres mean firefighters from other countries are available, she said.  There are currently more than 950 international firefighters and other personnel in Canada from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Crews from Costa Rica are also scheduled to arrive soon.  Another 177 people are scheduled to arrive this week to help battle blazes, Michael Norton, director general of the Northern Forestry Centre, said Monday. An additional 300 could arrive in the coming weeks, he added, and there are ongoing discussions for getting even more help.  All hands are on deck as the current wildfire season roars forward, Kamau said. After these fires stop smouldering, she added, the centre is also looking at mitigating future fire risk.  The fire centre recently acquired the FireSmart Canada brand, which will be used to help educate homeowners on how to make their properties more resilient to wildfires.  ""We know wildfire risk is increasing everywhere so we want people to be better prepared.""

"fire","2023-07-25","22:00:00","{""Puyallup"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-08T04:07:30","Hot and dry conditions in Western Washington have already prompted a fire risk warning, brush fires in Vancouver, burn bans in some counties and strict admonishments from officials to watch for sparks and extinguish campfires properly.  And the hottest months of the year are still ahead.  The early fire risk west of the Cascades is worrying officials who are in the midst of their fire prep. And if hot, dry conditions continue as predictions show, Washington is facing a late summer where the entire state will be at an above-normal risk for significant blazes.  “We could be in this for a very long time,” said Angie Lane, assistant division manager for the Department of Natural Resources wildland fire management.  This is the earliest since 2006 that the National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a red flag warning west of the Cascades. The warning, in effect until 10 p.m. Tuesday, alerts residents that dry and windy conditions could easily start or spread fires.  Jacob DeFlitch, meteorologist at the National Weather Service, said the agency has concerns of heightened fire risk Tuesday and Wednesday. The greatest threat is the South Sound into Thurston and Lewis Counties.  DeFlitch said there could be clouds and a bit of rain later in the week, which could help alleviate some of the risks, but a red flag warning this early in the season is “unusual.”  Earlier this year, predictions showed Washington might fare OK this summer, Lane said. The snowpack was higher-than-normal, and the state was making its way out of a drought.  But then it got hot. May brought record high temperatures and very little precipitation for western Washington.  In the last month, DeFlitch said many parts of the region received less than 5% of the precipitation they normally see. A lack of precipitation dries out grasses, shrubs and trees – all fuel for fires.  The dryness plus the windy conditions expected early this week puts the state at a heightened risk for rapidly spreading flames.  The Department of Natural Resources is in the middle of its preparations for the wildfire season, Lane said. That includes finalizing its suppression plans and training firefighters.  Washington is currently at a preparedness level two out of five, a scale used by fire officials to determine how many resources are available to fight fires compared to the likelihood of a fire breaking out, Lane said.  It’s a “very active fire response,” which is not normal this early in the year on the west side of the state.  Eastern Washington is still relying on its snowpack and a wet spring to keep fire risks in check, but those won’t last forever, Lane said. The low-elevation grasslands in the Columbia Basin, for example, have already been active wildfire sites.  Resources to fight fires could be spread thin if both the eastern and western reaches of the state are badly parched this summer.  The department has enough staff on board and resources to deal with the current situation, Lane said, but her concern is for the sustainability of the staff, if conditions worsen.  The department has received new funding in recent years to increase their supplies, and those resources could come into service this year. Under 2021 legislation, the department added new firefighting aircraft, a new camera system that can help detect fires and more firefighters.  To help with wildfire suppression, officials are leaning on the public to take action and avoid risky behavior, such as dropping cigarette butts or parking vehicles on dry grass.  Fire officials are encouraging everyone to check local restrictions on burning before heading to a campsite and lighting a campfire. Whoever manages the land might have their own restrictions on how and when to burn.  Campers should never leave a fire unattended and always have a shovel or bucket of water close by, according to the department.  When using equipment like lawnmowers or weed-whackers, fire officials warn against setting them down in dry grass where anything might easily ignite. And they say cars or trucks towing trailers should ensure that no chains are dragging on the asphalt as one spark could set ablaze the dry grass near the road.  — By Laurel Demkovich, Washington State Standard  Washington State Standard is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

"fire","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""FinleyPoint"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-07T14:47:58","Smoke poured early into the Flathead this spring, well before late summer and autumn, when, alas, we’ve grown accustomed to daily air quality alerts and the outdoor restrictions they bring.  Raging wildfires, burning near and afar, and resulting toxic smoke are increasingly impacting this valley’s residents and tourists alike. And science tells us the number and duration of the fires will only grow worse as the planet continues to heat up.  Even the lethal flames and fumes from western Montana’s “Great Fire of 1910” — ranked as one of the largest and most intense forest fires in American history if not “anywhere in the world,” claiming 89 lives and three million timbered acres in two days’ time — didn’t persist for weeks on end like today’s wildfires.  It’s reached the point where wildfires are now the greatest source of air pollution in the United States.  So what’s a basecamp community like ours to do?  Donald Trump’s proposed remedy — “you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests” — garnered plenty of chuckles, but the former president wasn’t barking up the wrong tree.  President Joe Biden, in fact, took Trump’s hint last year —and expanded it in recent weeks — earmarking $1.8 billion to clean up 21 at-risk pockets of the West, including in our neck of the woods.  The administration labels them “hazardous fuels reduction projects,” combining federal, state and local resources to conduct prescribed burning, thinning, planting, you name it — cleaning the forests — including around the “particularly high-risk” communities of Stryker, Trego, Fortine, Eureka, Libby and Troy.  You can thank Montana’s legislature, in part, for holding Uncle Sam’s feet to the fire.  Annotated in 2021, Montana code dictates that catastrophic wildfires “resulting from inadequate federal land management activities to reduce fire risk has the potential to jeopardize Montanans’ inalienable right to a clean and healthful environment.”  The same law, I should point out, stipulates that every Montana property owner has a responsibility to mitigate fire hazards on his or her land. All of which won’t rid us of the acrid smoke sent this way from as far away as California and Canada, but it’s a good start.  Already in 2023, “apocalyptic” wildfires have blown up from British Columbia and Alberta (what we were inhaling a few weeks ago) to Nova Scotia, right on the heels of the Canadian government releasing its “Canada Wildfire Strategic Plan 2022-2027.”  Canada’s goals, which are similar to this country’s, are to better understand the science of wildfires — fire behavior, fire ecology, fire risks — in hopes of developing more effective forest management policies to reduce “fuel loading.”  The resulting policies will rely on a wide assortment of stakeholders: federal, state and local government agencies and indigenous communities, to our first responders and academic institutions.  In recent weeks, for example, a years-long wildfire study issued by the University of Montana’s College of Forestry and Conservation found that the West’s rapidly growing populations — not Mother Nature — are causing the most destructive wildfires.  “Humans are driving the negative impacts from wildfire,” explained the study’s lead author and UM fire ecologist Philip Higuera, whose team examined 15,001 western wildfires between 1999 and 2020.  “Human fingerprints are all over this,” he said. “We influence the when, the where and the why.”  Like continuing to build homes and commercial buildings in flammable ecosystems like ours. The study found three times as many houses and other structures burned in western wildfires from 2010 to 2020 compared to the previous decade.  “We have levers,” Higuera said. “As climate change makes vegetation more flammable, we advise carefully considering if and how we build in flammable vegetation.”  The Flathead Valley obviously experiences less structure loss than higher density areas. Still, during the past two summers along the east and west shores of Flathead Lake, the Elmo Fire (22,000-plus acres) and Boulder 2700 Fire (3,000 acres surrounding Finley Point) destroyed numerous homes, outbuildings and other structures.  (Lightning sparked the Elmo fire, whereas a 36-year-old Lake County man, Craig McCrea, was charged with three felony counts of arson after allegedly lighting the Boulder blaze with a torch).  Montana, like much of the West, is also experiencing longer fire seasons, often beginning in the spring and lasting well into the fall, given sparser autumn snowfall. Which presents a long list of health and safety challenges, especially for infants and children, pregnant women, the elderly, people working outdoors, and last but not least the firefighters manning the erratic and noxious front lines.  Much of the discussion I had recently with Montana Sen. Jon Tester, chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, surrounded securing pay hikes last year for federal wildland firefighters and smokejumpers. In addition, he helped enforce the presumption that certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases are related to battling wildfires.  Another bill of Tester’s that passed the U.S. Senate this year will boost firefighting capacity throughout Montana, including making federal funding available for additional crews, better equipment, and more firehouses.  “Montana’s firefighters are often the first line of defense when disaster strikes,” the senator observed when his legislation passed. “Firefighters have dangerous jobs, and it’s critical they have the equipment and personnel needed to safely handle emergencies.”  Let’s keep our fingers crossed that aforementioned federal and local firefighting inroads and partnerships, coupled with above-average precipitation that’s fallen over much of the West this year, will help keep the inevitable wildfires — and smoke — at bay for the remainder of 2023.

Royal Oak firefighters were called to the building at 414 E. Hudson, a block east of Main Street, at 4:25 p.m. Monday.  Royal Oak Fire Inspector Scott Gardner said all the employees had been evacuated from the building when firefighters arrived in two fire engines and a ladder truck.  There was a similar fire in a recycling baler at the company Sept. 20, 2022.  “Every so often you can get a contaminant like batteries that people put in with their paper for recycling that can ignite the paper,” Gardner said. “We suspect there was some foreign object in the paper that caused the fire.”  Other items, such as pieces of wood, in the paper can also cause a fire in a baler.  “You’d be surprised at some of the stuff people put in their recycling,” Gardner said.  The fire was confined to the baling machine and no one was injured, fire officials said.  Part of the process of recycling paper at the facility includes a hammer mill that smashes paper and other materials before the machine bales the recycled paper, Gardner said.  Though firefighters were unable to determine exactly what ignited the fire Monday, he added that 9 volt batteries are notorious for starting fires in waste paper.  The baler where Monday’s fire started is an L-shaped machine that is over two stories tall and about seven feet wide.  Fires at Royal Oak Recycling are somewhat common and building employees and Royal Oak firefighters are experienced in responding to them, Gardner said.  The first thing recycling employees do when baler fires happen is shut off all electrical power in the building, get everyone out of the building and do a head count.  “Then we showed up and dumped water and foam” into the baler, Gardner said. “All that paper in the baler is so dense the water sometimes doesn’t get into some of the paper because it’s soe (densely) packed.”  Firefighters extinguished the fire within 50 minutes.  “The machine had burn damage to the outside,” Gardner said, “but there was no structural damage to the building, which happens very rarely.”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9ha2xhbmRwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNy9maXJlLWF0LXJveWFsLW9hay1yZWN5Y2xpbmctc3RhcnRlZC1pbi1sYXJnZS1iYWxpbmctbWFjaGluZS_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVvYWtsYW5kcHJlc3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDcvZmlyZS1hdC1yb3lhbC1vYWstcmVjeWNsaW5nLXN0YXJ0ZWQtaW4tbGFyZ2UtYmFsaW5nLW1hY2hpbmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At Monday’s meeting of the Stanly County Board of Commissioners, Oakboro Volunteer Fire Department Fire Chief Rodney Eury spoke during public comments.  Eury referenced a letter Oakboro VFD sent to the county’s emergency manager requesting a four cent increase on the fire tax. The chief mentioned Oakboro “has the largest fire district served by one fire station” in the county other than Albemarle and West Stanly.  He called Oakboro VFD “the second busiest volunteer fire department,” saying call volume has increased 30% in the last five years and 75% in the last 10 years. According to Eury, Oakboro had 622 calls in 2022.  Noting Oakboro has zero debt, Eury said the increase is needed for new apparatus, including a second tanker truck and a new building for the new equipment.  Eury said the department also wants full-time staffing, which for four personnel to provide 24-hour coverage seven days a week at $15/hour would amount to $524,000 per year.  He noted Oakboro VFD has a fund balance of $1,082,236 and the tanker would cost between $350,000 and $400,000. The second tanker is necessary, he added, because water pressure to some of the hydrants is low.  Eury also mentioned having less volunteers, saying the younger generation “doesn’t seem to care about it.” The department has two people who work Monday through Friday, one from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. and the other from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  When asked about a new location, Eury said it could play a factor regarding whether the annual Fourth of July Celebration continues. Noting the event has happened for 65 years, he said Oakboro VFD “would like to see that tradition continue. It does help funding for us as well. We don’t want to see that go away.”  The department owns a gravel lot between West Third and Fourth streets, Eury said, where a new facility might go. The field across the street, he said, would stay open for the Fourth of July event, “as long as we have personnel willing to help do it.”  Commissioner Patty Crump asked when was the last time Oakboro received an increase. County Manager Andy Lucas said he had not asked for such in his 15 years as manager.  “We’re the lowest in the county. That doesn’t give a reason to go up. We are six and that is the lowest in the county,” Eury said.  Vice Chairman Mike Barbee said if commissioners asked for a four-cent increase in property tax, “they would hang us all and run us off…when the fire tax goes up in a district, that’s the same thing as a property tax.”  Eury said he and others in the department “all live in the district as well, so it ain’t that we’re exempt from it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNuYXBvbmxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDcvb2FrYm9yby1maXJlLWNoaWVmLWFza3MtY291bnR5LWZvci1maXJlLXRheC1pbmNyZWFzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Clare firefighters were called to Fair Salvage on East Grass Lake Road south of Clare at 3:14 p.m. to put out a fire that was likely caused by a spark from a piece of equipment, Clare Fire Chief Jim Chapman said.  Workers were moving scrap metal at the salvage yard when the fire started, and Chapman thinks a spark ignited car parts, gasoline or oil that was among the scrap metal.  A bucket loader scraping concrete could have created a spark that started the fire, Chapman said.  Clare firefighters were at what was called in as a barn fire when the blaze ignited at Fair Salvage, on standby as a group of Amish pulled about 1,700 bales of wet hay from the building because it had started to decompose like compost and was in danger of spontaneous combustion, Chapman said.  Aaron Stutzman of East Surrey Road in Clare contacted Chapman Tuesday because he was concerned that the hay he put in his barn would catch fire.  “The hay actually caramelizes and turns black,” Chapman said. “It smells like tobacco.  “When this occurs, it generates a lot of heat and the hay can spontaneously ignite. We were seeing temperatures over 200 degrees in the hay and it was actually giving off steam and/or smoke.”  Clare firefighters stood by with fire hoses ready in the event the hay caught fire, according to Chapman.  Chapman credited the assisting fire departments for mutual aid, giving Clare Fire time to respond to both situations.  Surrey Township and Harrison firefighters assisted at the barn as the owner and a neighbor removed the hay bales, Chapman said.  Surrey Township, Isabella Northeast and the Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Fire Department assisted at Fair Salvage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1vcm5pbmdzdW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDcvZmlyZS1icmVha3Mtb3V0LWF0LWlzYWJlbGxhLXNhbHZhZ2UteWFyZC_SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtb3JuaW5nc3VuLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzA3L2ZpcmUtYnJlYWtzLW91dC1hdC1pc2FiZWxsYS1zYWx2YWdlLXlhcmQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2020-02-01","Not Discerned","{""MontourFalls"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-08T03:39:00","SARATOGA SPRINGS — Embattled Saratoga Springs Fire Chief Joseph Dolan has denied any wrongdoing in his response to misconduct charges and a corresponding state police investigation, and may sue the city, the Department of Public Safety and anyone else related to the allegations once the investigations have concluded.  “Upon information and belief one or more of the charges asserted by OPS [Office of Public Safety] are frivolous; that is, they were asserted in bad faith, without any reasonable basis in law or fact and/or in an effort to harass or maliciously injure Chief Dolan,” states the response from Dolan.  Public Safety Commissioner James Montagnino declined to comment.  Dolan, a 25-year veteran of the department and chief of the department since January 2019, has been on leave without pay since the misconduct charges were filed against him on May 19 by the Public Safety Department. Prior to that, Dolan had been on paid leave since Feb. 1, following a complaint alleging that he double-dipped on pay when he did some work as a state fire trainer while still being paid for his primary job as the fire chief in Saratoga Springs. Montagnino, the elected official who oversees the city’s fire and police departments, received the initial complaint Jan. 27.  The 17-page response provided to the Gazette by Dolan’s attorney Brian Culnan, of Albany-based law firm O’Connell & Aronowitz, states that the complaint provided to the Public Safety Department should be viewed as “illegitimate” because Dolan, through his attorney, said it stems from a complaint provided by a firefighter in the department that Dolan issued a written counseling memorandum and therefore, Dolan’s attorney says, the complaint was retaliatory.  His attorney has referred to the investigation as a political hit job.  Montagnino said the internal investigation was prompted when a fellow firefighter, who has not been named, provided documents from a Freedom of Information Law request the firefighter received from the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  Documents related to the original complaint were not available.  In Dolan’s response to the allegations, he states that, under civil service law, the city cannot discipline him for anything 18 months prior to May 23. He also said other employees in the Public Safety Department have engaged in similar actions for which Dolan is accused of doing and that the work he performed was in relation to his duties as chief. He said the training sessions were conducted after hours during the week and weekends.  “Upon information and belief, in 2020, 2021 and 2022, Chief Dolan did not use all of the leave time allotted to him and per city policy he was not compensated for the unused leave time nor permitted to carry the accrued but unused leave time over to a subsequent year,” the response states. “Had this unused leave time been applied or reallocated, it would have covered some or all of the time questioned by OPS [Office of Public Safety] and the city of Saratoga Springs in the notice of discipline.”  The alleged misconduct charges and Dolan’s response include:  Dolan did not submit for leave time for the various days in 2020 and 2022 when he attended training at the State Academy of Fire Science in Montour Falls as a trainer for the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control and was paid by the city.  Dolan said he requested personal leave for the training in February 2020 but that “Assistant Chief Peter Shaw, who prepared the duty roster for those two days in Chief Dolan’s absence erroneously listed Chief Dolan as being present in Saratoga Springs.” The issue was never corrected, Dolan said. Dolan also said, for the training in October 2022, he was acting in his capacity as fire chief because as chief he is responsible for training firefighters and to do so had to “secure and maintain an instructor’s authorization for each course.”  Dolan did not take leave days in 2020 and 2021 for the times he provided training at the Saratoga County Fire Training Center.  Dolan said that in August 2020 he provided training to volunteer firefighters in Saratoga County at the training center in the evening after having completed an eight-hour work day for the city already. He also said he did not provide training at the center in March and April of 2021, but did provide training for city firefighters during the work day at Station No. 1.  Dolan did not take leave days in 2022 when he provided training at Troy Fire Department in his capacity as a trainer for the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  Dolan said no training took place in Troy in 2022 and he didn’t submit any vouchers to the state nor was he paid for that visit. Dolan’s response corrects the misconduct of one of the alleged incidents from Nov. 17 to Nov. 18, 2022. He said he took a personal leave day on Nov. 15, 2022 to receive an overview of Troy’s self-contained breathing apparatus trailer in his capacity as a state fire instructor. Dolan said he returned on Nov. 18, 2022 in his capacity as the city’s municipal training officer to determine whether the SCBA trailer was something the Saratoga Springs Fire Department could use.  Dolan defrauded the city and offered a false instrument for filing by falsely entering time worked into the employee time reporting system.  Dolan said any errors in the employee time reporting system were made inadvertently.  Dolan asked Montagnino to secure an over $62,000 Chevy Tahoe and was eventually given one to be used by fire captains to respond to scenes, but instead the chief used the SUV himself, including for personal reasons .  Dolan said his use of the vehicle was in line with the city’s 2011 policy regarding vehicle use and that the Department of Public Safety is looking to discipline him for a change in policy that is now the subject of an improper practice complaint to the state’s Public Employment Relations Board.  Dolan is also accused of not filing an Ethics Disclosure Report stating his employment with the state. He said that issue should be handled by the city’s Ethics Board as it’s within their jurisdiction.  The various misconduct charges, as alleged, could constitute both misdemeanors and felonies under criminal law statutes, including instances of grand larceny.  Dolan, who is also facing a criminal probe by state police for the misconduct charges, said the city should hold off on addressing the misconduct charges and allow the state police to investigate. He also said that, if and when he’s cleared of any criminal wrongdoing, he may sue the city for defamation and “malicious prosecution” and for costs associated with defending himself against the charges.

"fire","2023-06-03","Not Discerned","{""Mesa"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-08T05:17:00","MESA, AZ — It's been a week since the mulch fire at CTS Greenwaste in Mesa. At the site, smoke continues rising and flames are smoldering.  Community members who have been outside in the week since have noticed the lingering smoke.  “If you’re an early riser you notice it,” said Robert Monahan. “I went on a bike loop and had to turn around really quickly because it was burning my eyes.”  The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) says the smoke is moving west toward Chandler and Gilbert in the morning.  Thankfully, the department says the air quality levels have not exceeded federal standards. Most areas are still considered to be in the “good” air quality index though some are in “low moderate” AQI.  “If you’re smelling smoke, you're breathing smoke, but since they are short-term impacts the symptoms should be short-term as well, which can be a runny nose, your eyes may feel it, a little burning in your throat, but they are short-term impacts,” said ADEQ Air Quality Meteorologist Matt Pace.  ADEQ says the CTS Greenwaste site’s owner is now in charge of mitigating what is left of the smoldering materials.  In a statement to ABC15, CTS said:  “CTS Greenwaste Recycling is a small, family-owned and operated local company. We take in organic waste, primarily from landscaping, and compost it into a 100% recycled soil amendment for use in local farming operations. It helps make desert farming more sustainable by keeping local waste out of the landfill, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, improving water retention in the soil, and creating a carbon offset. We’ve invested over a decade of research in developing this sustainable farming solution, and as fifth-generation farmers, this has never been just a company to us; it was our life’s work.  The fire that started on May 31st, which is now largely under control, has been devastating to our business, our family, and our employees. Our entire crew has been working in shifts non-stop, 24 hours a day, to suppress the remaining fire and perform clean up; many of us are working 14-18 hour days to get this done.  The source of the fire is still unconfirmed. We have been encouraged by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s reports that the fire is not hazardous and that there is no federal health concern or air quality concern. At this point, we are completely focused on suppressing the fire. We have procedures in place to deal with this type of situation, and we’ll continue to follow those procedures to the tee. While the past few days have been overwhelming, we have had an outpouring of support from close family and friends who have loaned us equipment and personnel to help, and they have our deepest gratitude.  We expect the smoke to dissipate completely as soon as our cleanup is completed, which we hope will be within the next few days. Please bear with us as we continue to work around the clock.”  ADEQ tells ABC15 they’ll continue to monitor the air.  “We’re well below the standard,” said Pace. “But if you’re sensitive to smoke, you’re recommended to limit your outdoor activities.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzE1LmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlZ2lvbi1zb3V0aGVhc3QtdmFsbGV5L21lc2EvYS13ZWVrLWxhdGVyLWFpci1zdGlsbC1pbXBhY3RlZC1ieS1tZXNhLW11bGNoLWZpcmXSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxNS5jb20vbmV3cy9yZWdpb24tc291dGhlYXN0LXZhbGxleS9tZXNhL2Etd2Vlay1sYXRlci1haXItc3RpbGwtaW1wYWN0ZWQtYnktbWVzYS1tdWxjaC1maXJlP19hbXA9dHJ1ZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

During a training event, firefighters used training smoke in the wildland to give their crews a simulation on how to prepare to tackle those fires.  “Instead of having a real fire, we’re able to use those and it gives us an indicator of wind direction, how fast it’s moving. Things we look for in an actual fire,"" said Lieutenant Kyle Bylin with the East Pierce Fire and Rescue and Wildland team leader.  RELATED:  Bill Sandlian, Assistant Chief with the East Pierce Fire and Rescue, said the training smoke allows them to focus on wind directions and other conditions that firefighters will be working with when they get called to a brush fire.  This was a large-scale training where firefighters were put to the test on how to better communicate and train on safety zones and escape routes.  “Especially out here in the woods and the brush, with the wind being unpredictable, trees that are on fire and weaken by the fire, so that’s also a danger that we have to watch out for,"" said Sandlian.    Sandlian said last year the heat caused dangerous fire conditions that they expect again this year.  RELATED:  ""That’s why we’re out here preparing for this we’re toning our bodies to the heat, getting used to it, and doing the work and training in the heat so we acclimate to it, and yes, I think it’s going to be a long, hot, dry summer,"" said Sandlian.  After the fire season, we experienced last year, firefighters are bracing for a similar impact. With the staffing shortage these fire stations are still dealing with, officials said it puts a drain on their resources.  “One large incident can tap out multiple agencies within pierce county for one incident, and we had it a few years ago, we had multiple large fires going on at the same time, and it wiped out all resources,"" said Bylin.  Fire officials are also asking for the public's help in trying to prevent brush fires this summer. Some of those things include properly throwing away cigarette buds and if people are camping, putting out your campfires.

The agency responded to a fire call at 546 Summit Ave. at approximately 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, with 17 city firefighters battling the flames for approximately 90 minutes before the fire was under control.  “It went over about three lawns in the front and in the back,” Schenectady Fire Chief Don Mareno said. “Behind these buildings is an embankment that goes down to Lincoln Heights and that embankment was all on fire.”  A dilapidated garage in the site’s backyard caught ablaze during the incident and was extinguished by the fire department.  “The fire never made it in the house,” Mareno said. “There’s two houses there that are vacant and the fire never made it into any of those houses.”  The fire chief said the department is investigating the origin of the Tuesday fire.  “Obviously there’s nothing mechanical or electrical out there that will cause the fire, so we’re looking at if it was done intentionally or unintentionally,” Mareno said.  Mareno said that the poor air quality that the region is experiencing due to Canadian wildfires does not have an exacerbating impact on fires.  “The lack of rain is what’s causing all of these outdoor fires of varying degrees of intensity,” he said.  Mareno said, after the fire was quelled, firefighters stayed at the scene to ensure that any ensuing hotspots were extinguished.  “It took us a while to put it out because there was so much brush and dead trees,” he said. “It was burning pretty good when we got there.”  The fire was contained in an area where no city residents were living.  “Those houses are abandoned, dilapidated and structurally compromised,” Mareno said on Wednesday. “They probably should have been torn down years ago. But the fire did not damage any of those buildings.”  Contact Ted Remsnyder at [email protected]. Follow him on Twitter at @TedRemsnyder.

"fire","2017-12-05","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-07T21:24:49","With its new case against the utility, government authorities are dismissing a previous lawsuit against the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  LOS ANGELES (CN) — The United States brought a federal complaint against Southern California Edison on Wednesday, seeking more than $40 million in damages from the 2017 Creek Fire that ravaged the Angeles National Forest in Los Angeles County.  Among more than two dozen wildfires that tore through Southern California in December 2017, forcing about 230,000 residents from their homes and prompting then-Governor Jerry Brown Jr. to declare a state of emergency for LA and Ventura Counties, the Creek Fire was the second largest. It is unrelated to a blaze with the same name that ripped through Northern California in 2020.  After it ignited on Dec. 5, 2017, the Creek Fire spread rapidly because of the vegetation made bone dry by years of drought and because of the strong Santa Ana winds blowing through the steep canyons in the mountains north of LA. By the time it was contained, the Creek Fire had burned about 15,000 acres of land and destroyed at least 60 homes and 63 other structures. At least 55 homes and 26 structures suffered damage.  The U.S. notes that it has spent more than $40 million on restoration and rehabilitation, while also facing the ""intangible environmental damages and other costs"" whose value must be determined at trial.  ""SCE breached its duty of care and was negligent in causing the Creek Fire, including its failure to construct, maintain, and operate its power lines and equipment in a safe and effective working order [to] prevent fires and damage to the land and property of adjacent landowners, including the United States,"" the complaint states.  Signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Green, the lawsuit says the Creek Fire broke out because SCE's power lines and equipment ignited the dry vegetation. The federal government had previously sued the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power for damages from the Creek Fire, but documents Edison provided under subpoena in that litigation appeared to have changed the government's thinking.  The U.S. said in Wednesday's complaint that it is dropping its case against the LA Department of Water and Power in connection with the new lawsuit against Edison.  ""Our thoughts remain with the people affected by the Creek Fire and we will review the case and discuss it during court proceedings,"" said Jeff Monford, a spokesman for Edison International, the parent company of the Southern California utility. ""We remain committed to wildfire mitigation and safety through grid hardening, situational awareness and operational enhancements.""  The complaint accuses Southern California Edison of negligence, violations of California's Health and Safety Code and Civil Code, violations of California's Public Resources Code, trespass by fire, and claims strict liability and indemnity pursuant to the special use permit, as well as breach of the special use permit.  The U.S. seeks damages for real and personal property, fire-suppression costs, resource damages, as well as for the costs of rehabilitation, restoration, and reforestation of the burned areas. The government also seeks double or triple damages for the wrongful injury to U.S. timber, trees and underwood, as well as interest, penalties and the costs of the lawsuit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS91cy1zdWVzLXNvdXRoZXJuLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtZWRpc29uLWZvci1uZWdsaWdlbmNlLWluLTIwMTctY3JlZWstZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Patrols, lookouts, helicopters, and drones are being used to observe the fire’s progression. One area of concern is the Indian Creek drainage adjacent to the fireline. As the fire progressed to Indian Creek, it moved into the rocks and ran out of fuel but firefighters want to verify that it is holding. A drone was deployed to check that area again yesterday. The flight confirmed no further fire progression. Additional recon flights are scheduled for today to monitor movement and determine the location of hot spots.  Most of the fire movement is on the southern flank in the Gila Wilderness as it continues to back slowly down slope. An area previously fired in Burnt Corral Canyon to reduce available fuels is growing slowly. Precipitation has slowed the fire’s growth but fuels are expected to dry over the next few days and fire activity will increase. The north and east side of the fire is in monitor status and holding well. Today, a crew will remove the fire resistant wrapping from Black Mountain Lookout.  The Gila Las Cruces Incident Management Team will be transitioning to a smaller local team Saturday morning. The complexity of the fire has decreased and many of the resources are being released.  Containment percentage will continue to fluctuate as the fire grows within the planning area. However, the containment line will continue to hold.  Weather: Dryer air is moving in, with humidity values dropping. Southwest winds will be breezy with a few local gusts in the afternoon. Light to slightly breezy southwest winds will continue through the end of the work week.  Aviation Restrictions: ATemporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is still in place over the Pass Fire. All non-fire aircraft are restricted. This includes civilian drones. Unauthorized aircraft in the area will ground firefighting aircraft, hindering firefighting efforts.  Closures: The Gila National Forest remains open. Visitors are encouraged to use extreme caution when driving near the fire area due to the presence of firefighters and equipment.

"fire","2023-06-06","Not Discerned","{""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-07T17:37:36","MARSHFIELD, WI (OnFocus) – On Tuesday, June 6, a potential fire was averted thanks to the swift actions of a garbage truck driver. Observing smoke emanating from the trash collected earlier that morning, the driver promptly dumped the load in a vacant parking lot at Wildwood Park. It was later discovered that a smoldering fire had been caused by a discarded Milwaukee Tool battery.  The incident highlights the severe fire hazards associated with improper battery disposal. The connection between both terminals of a discarded battery can create a circuit, generating heat and potentially sparking a fire.  Fire Chief Pete Fletty emphasized the importance of recycling batteries, stating, “The worst thing you can do is throw a battery in your garbage, especially a 9-volt, because that can lead to a home fire.”  To prevent fires and protect our environment, it is crucial to adopt responsible practices for battery disposal. Instead of throwing batteries in the garbage, it is recommended to recycle them. Many communities have dedicated recycling programs and drop-off locations for batteries. Local businesses, such as Batteries Plus Bulbs in Stevens Point, are often equipped to handle battery recycling.  Fletty added that garbage fires are not uncommon and often caused by batteries.  To properly dispose of batteries, find a recycling facility near you.  We welcome your stories! Contact us at [email protected]!

""With traffic and highways and the infrastructure issues that we're running against in a big, fast-growing city, that's where we were looking back at response times … to have a better outcome,” Trojacek said.  According to an estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the City of Fort Worth welcomes about 50 people a day, bringing last year's population estimate to more than 956,000. And while the city is investing in new infrastructure to alleviate traffic in the years to come, the goal for the fire department is to cut out travel time for paramedics that respond to calls in the outskirts of the city.  “What this program does is essentially brings a credentialed paramedic to every doorstep throughout the city,” Trojacek said.  The program was launched less than a week ago and schedules one paramedic on each of the three shifts at seven fire stations. Currently, the department employs nearly 980 EMTs and 107 paramedics.  ""An EMT is trained to provide basic life support,"" according to Paulo Gonzalez, an EMT with the Fort Worth Fire Department. ""That includes CPR, that includes basic first aid, that includes patient assessment and oxygen administration, along with some basic medication administration.""  A paramedic can offer a greater level of care than what an EMT can provide, Trojacek said.  ""Whereas a paramedic within their scope, they are trained to provide I.V. access or intravenous administration for medication administration,"" Gonzalez said. ""They are able to provide advanced respiratory care through intubation and also advanced patient assessment and diagnosis.""  Three days after launching the program, the fire department put it into use, helping save a woman’s life.  On Monday, firefighters were called out to the 4200 block of Wayward Court in far north Fort Worth. The initial call was for smoke however, Gonzalez said the focus quickly changed.  “When we got off the truck, we saw that we had a female who was injured due to burns,” Gonzalez said.  According to a press release from the department, “When crews from Engine 37 arrived on scene they immediately saw that they had a burned patient and called for both MedStar and a helicopter because of the severity of the patient’s injuries. There was also a fire in the home that a neighbor was able to put out before the fire department’s arrival.”  While firefighters cleared an area for the helicopter to arrive, a paramedic helped provide advanced life support, or ALS, to the burn victim in minutes.  “The paramedic had to transition from a firefighting mode to a patient care mode, and he was able to do that, you know, pretty quickly and seamlessly,” Gonzalez said.  A seamless transition that provided the proper care to help the woman survive the helicopter ride to the hospital where she continues to recover.  “It’s just an overall better patient care treatment plan for our citizens,” Trojacek said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9mb3J0LXdvcnRoLWZpcmUtYWRkcy1wYXJhbWVkaWNzLWF0LTctZmlyZWhvdXNlcy10by1pbXByb3ZlLW1lZGljYWwtcmVzcG9uc2UvMzI3MjcxMy_SAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZm9ydC13b3J0aC1maXJlLWFkZHMtcGFyYW1lZGljcy1hdC03LWZpcmVob3VzZXMtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1tZWRpY2FsLXJlc3BvbnNlLzMyNzI3MTMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An investigation determined that he set the fire and he was also linked to two other recent fires in the town.  In addition to the latest fire, Marcus, was implicated in brush fires on May 15 on Maxwell Road and May 31 on Everett Road.  “It Seems like he was fascinated with lighting small fires,” Colonie police Lt Daniel Belles said. “They were small brush fires and one of them spread to a church.”  The Blessed Virgin Mary of Czestochowa Church, located at 250 Maxwell Road was significantly damaged when the fire spread from the brush to a storage shed on the property and eventually to the church itself. The church sustained extensive damage to its siding and roof.  The fires allegedly started when Marcus ignited seed pods from cottonwood trees that spread to extremely dry brush. The white fluffy fuzz is everywhere this time of year and with little rain, it has been a relevant factor in many local fires this year.  “I think he thought what he was doing was harmless and that was not the case,” Belles said.  On May 30, a Delmar man discarded the end of a marijuana cigarette into an area loaded with seed pods and caused a fire at two buildings of an apartment complex that left eight families homeless. The flames spread within minutes. He was arrested on June 2 for lying to police about the incident.  City officials in Albany warned of the dangers in a May 30 Times Union article after lit fuzz jumped into trees at Buckingham Pond.  The seeds consist of the white fluff, but also have actual seeds of the trees that contain oil. When ignited, they flare quickly and are light enough to float as they do so which causes the flames to spread fast.  In the Colonie cases there were no injuries.  Marcus was charged with criminal mischief and arson in the fourth degree (because it was damage to a structure), both felonies, and two counts of arson in the fifth degree and one count of reckless endangerment, all misdemeanors.  He was was arraigned in Colonie Town Court and released to the supervision of Albany County Probation, pending a future court appearance.  This is still an active and ongoing investigation.

"fire","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Alpena"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-08T05:37:21","ALPENA — As Michigan continues to experience dry weather and extreme wildfire conditions, local fire officials are urging residents to do all they can to keep their back yard bonfires contained.  Andy Marceau, community risk reduction officer of the Alpena City Fire Department, said residents of the county need to take proper care of their fires in this dry period.  “We are so dry,” Marceau said. “We are so in dire straits and we have to get the word out. We want people to enjoy summertime activities, but they have to do it safely.”  Fire officials have been called upon in recent weeks to investigate numerous reports of grass and camp fires, including one earlier this week in Sanborn Township fire originating from a burn barrel.  Amid the dry conditions, fog and smoke have blanketed Alpena this week too — along with the numerous spots in the Midwest and East Coast — due to wildfire smoke drifting in from Canada.  On Wednesday, Brooklyn, New York, experienced smoke and air pollution at a level of 320 on the Air Quality Index — a ranking that measures air quality — and was deemed hazardous. In all, an estimated 90 million people across 16 states were under air quality alerts.  Alpena’s air quality level was at 112 AQI on Wednesday night, a number considered unhealthy for sensitive groups.  If people are going to have backyard bonfires, Marceau advocates holding them in a proper fire ring. To start the fire, he recommends paper as kindling along with twigs. Marceau also urges people to use clean, dry wood in their bonfires, keep a water source nearby and when the night ends, pour the water and stir the fire to put it out completely.  In terms of burning yard debris, it’s illegal to burn any in the city; however, other townships allow the burning of brush when the DNR permits it.  “I live in a township just a mile up the road,” Marceau said. “I have a big pile of brush that I want to burn. I don’t dare burn it. You need to go to the DNR website to receive a burn permit.”  The DNR asks residents to look on its website and check the state map whether their county is permitted to burn yard debris.  On Wednesday, all of Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula was at brown level on the DNR’s map, which means debris burning is prohibited in all of the selected counties. For the past few weeks, it’s been mostly at a brown level.  “We want you to… roast marshmallows, whatever else you want to do,” Marceau said. “But at the end of the night, you’ve got to be a good citizen. It needs to be fully out.”  DNR officials estimate that they’re fought close to 200 wildfires already this season, covering more than 3,000 acres. The biggest one happened last weekend when a campfire on private land near Grayling sparked a wildfire that covered more than 2,400 acres.

Michael A. Yzkanin, 30, faces arson and related counts for setting fire April 15 to 573 Main St. in Gouldsboro.  The charges come about seven weeks after state police fire marshals accused him of setting fire to the former Gouldsboro Inn, 572 Main St., Lehigh Twp. on April 14. The vacant property is 240 feet from Yzkanin's home at 584 Main St.  Several other arson investigations remain open in Lackawanna and Wayne counties, in which Yzkanin was named a person of interest.  The other arsons in Gouldsboro are:  583 Main St., a home under renovation, reported around 3 a.m. April 14.  584 Main St., Yzkanin's home, where state police reported a fire in a stairwell to the basement around 6 a.m. April 16.  In Jessup, fires ruled arson were:  916 Church St., the former Library Pizza, a Jessup landmark that burned around 3 a.m. April 14.  609 4th Ave., a home under construction, that burned 10 p.m. April 15 and spread to two adjacent homes where a combined seven people were displaced.  His connection with the other fires in Lackawanna and Wayne counties remain under investigation, state police said.  According to a criminal complaint filed by Trooper Nicholas DeSantis, a state police fire marshal, passerby Jose Ingles saw smoke around 2:10 p.m. April 15 coming from 573 Main St., Lehigh Twp.  Then he saw a man flee into the woods. A state Game Commission officer who responded chased the man.  ""Blue jeans, green hoodie, stop!"" shouted the officer, according to body camera footage a trooper watched.  Yzkanin's fianceé, Karly Granza, told state police she saw a man wearing clothing similar to what Yzkanin had on when he left for work walking toward 573 Main St. shortly before the fire.  ""She didn't want to admit that it was him, but deep down she knew he was the one,"" DeSantis wrote in an affidavit, summarizing an interview with Granza.  DeSantis wrote no one can account for Yzkanin's whereabouts minutes prior to the fire, during the fire and immediately after it was discovered.  Yzkanin remains jailed in the Wayne County Correctional Facility in lieu of $520,000 bail set between the arson cases and an institutional vandalism case brought because authorities accused him of destroying sprinklers in his cell.  He has a preliminary hearing on the new arson counts tentatively scheduled Wednesday. A hearing on the earlier arson case was continued Tuesday. It has not been rescheduled. A hearing for the vandalism case is scheduled June 21.

Full responses include a minimum of five firefighting apparatus and crews. Since November 16, 2022, such responses had been limited to a single engine based on the reduced threat during winter months.  Con Fire also reminds of the now passed June 4 deadline for completion of all weed abatement and urges residents to protect their families, homes and neighbors by doing this important work if not already completed. These are the single most important things owners can do to ensure firefighters have the time and ability to better defend their properties from wildfires. If not already done, now is the time to ensure properties meet or exceed – and continue to meet or exceed throughout seasonal fire danger weather – all weed abatement and defensible space requirements.  Fire prevention inspectors this week are conducting compliance inspections across the district, and issuing citations if necessary for non-compliant properties that put owners and their neighbors in danger. After a brief notification process, properties in continued violation will be abated by the district at considerable owner expense that will appear as a tax lien on their property.  “Seasonal fire danger is once again upon us, later than in recent years, but potentially more dangerous with what will clearly be an abundant crop of dried fuels resulting from winter rains,” said Fire Chief Lewis Broschard, Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. “I urge all residents to prepare for wildfires now by practicing weed abatement and defensible space creation and reviewing plans for evacuation, including learning your new evacuation zone.”  “Experience shows the resident who abates weeds, creates defensible space, and hardens structures to resist wind blown embers today can make a difference. Owner preparation of properties is the single most effective thing that can be done to save homes and businesses from wildfire threats,” said Assistant Chief and Fire Marshal Chris Bachman, Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. “Investment in fire safe preparation today can buy the time tomorrow for firefighters to arrive and protect homes and businesses from wildfire loss.”  This year’s return to full vegetation fire responses comes a few weeks later than the previous year owing to extended rainy spring weather. Though a delayed start, spring rains, preceded by winter rains are resulting in an exceptional crop of vegetation across the county and the threat of a challenging wildfire season.  In addition to increasing response levels for all grass, vegetation and wildland fires, Con Fire is adjusting staffing levels, adding two Crew 12, 16-person hand crew teams for seven-day-per-week availability. Heavy equipment crews are also being upstaffed to provide early-season fire trail maintenance as well as vegetation fire responses.  Residents are encouraged to learn and note their zone for reference in an emergency by visiting cwsalerts.com/know-your-zone/. Detailed information on protecting homes and businesses from wildfire dangers, including weed abatement deadlines and preparing now for the possibility of evacuation can be found on the district’s website at https://www.cccfpd.org/wildfire-prep/.  Pittsburg Fire Highlights Importance of Weed Abatement and Defensible Space  An early season wildfire in Pittsburg, April 29, 2021, visually demonstrates the combined benefits of weed abatement and defensible space creation, and the importance of rapid and overwhelming responses by firefighters. In the fire pictured below, two of the homeowners had only just completed their weed abatement in recent days, well ahead of the deadline and with visible results.  In the above aerial photo from an early season, April 29, 2021, grass fire in south Pittsburg, the benefits of proper weed abatement and defensible space creation are clearly demonstrated in homes three and six, untouched by fire. Houses one, two, four and five all sustained damage to either accessory structures or outbuildings. The interdependence of neighbors on each other’s weed abatement is shown by the fire that burned from the partially unabated house four into neighboring house five.  The rapid response of Con Fire firefighters stopped the fire burning into house five by mere feet and protected all seven houses from damage or destruction. Had house five burned, it is  About Contra Costa County Fire Protection District – With implementation of a contract for service with the City of Pinole in March, 2023 and annexation of the former East Contra Costa Fire Protection District (ECCFPD) in July, 2022, Contra Costa Fire now provides fire and emergency medical services to more than 770,000 residents in 12 cities and 11 unincorporated areas across our expanded 557 square-mile jurisdiction.

"fire","2023-06-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T02:24:49","Then the first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all the green grass.  — Revelations 8:8  No one in Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, about 500 miles northeast of Ulster County, has yet reported hearing any trumpet blasts preceding the onset of the worst wildfire to strike anywhere in this part of the country in over 20 years. But then again, no one who has seen the inferno’s flames, which are said to have reached over 30 stories high, can rule out any sound until the hellscape has receded.  After eleven days and over 20,000 hectares consumed, the fire has not yet been stopped, though it has slowed down and been rained upon.  In the active and lurid prose favored by news organizations all over the world, the blaze roars, ravages, rages and devours, It’s eaten over 60 homes and cottages as well as 150 additional structures. Thousands of people living near Halifax, Nova Scotia’s main city, have been forced to flee for their lives, taking what precious possessions they can.  Which would normally be a Canadian problem. But a hazy, orange smoke has found us here in the Hudson Valley, where a sick sun hath risen for the second day in a row to shine a strange and apocalyptic light over inland and water.  Views from the Rhinecliff Bridge showcase a smoky haze hanging so thickly in all directions that it resembles the dusty penumbra of a desert sandstorm. This is particulate matter, dense and hanging in the air. In large amounts it can be hazardous to breathe.  Because wind conditions have been favorable to the blaze, this fallout of the fire has been lifted and delivered far and wide. Residents living anywhere in a thousand-mile swath east to west from Providence, Rhode Island to Chicago, Illinois and south from Norfolk, Virginia north to the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle border crossing and hundreds of miles further into Canada are living under a sour, burnt-toast-smelling, drifting shadow.  Under that cloud, an air-quality monitoring station has been quietly collecting data on the roof of the Andy Murphy Neighborhood Center on Broadway in Kingston since 2020.  “So it’s a weather station combined with air-quality monitoring,” says Eli Dueker, co-director of the Center for Environmental Sciences and Humanities at Bard College. Dueker and the community sciences lab staff installed the equipment on the Andy Murphy roof to measure the particulate content in the air.  “The EPA measures air quality in two ways,” explains Dueker. “particles that are 2.5 microns and smaller, they call that PM 2.5. Those are considered fine particulates, and 2.5 microns and above, what’s called PM 10.”  Fine particles, Dueker explains, are small enough to make it through the respiratory system. Some of them are so small they can even go directly into the bloodstream through the lungs.  “The coarser aerosols can also enter the body,” says Deuker. “Those particles are about ten microns. And they are the ones that can still cause irritation, but can’t get as deep into your respiratory system. So they’re not good, either. But they’re not the ones that EPA is most worried about in terms of long-term health effects. We’re looking at the small particles that are in the air that make this smoke so nasty.”  As a result of the smoke from Nova Scotia, the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Kingston, as provided by the Bard website, shows levels of fine particulate matter currently classified as “unhealthy.” The Bard outpost has assigned the present output a color code of fire-engine red on a six-color scale. The color green represents ‘good’ air quality, and a burgundy wine color represents levels of particulate matter considered hazardous. Amounts are also displayed in micrograms cubed. Current readings show the particulate amount is at ten times the safe level, As of the afternoon of June 7, 121.53 μg/m 3 was the current reading. A safe level is 12 μg/m 3 or lower.  It’s a perverse feature of particulate contamination that its minuscule size increases the danger.  “It’s gravity,” says Duerker. “The smaller the particle, the longer it stays in the air. So if you throw a ball in the air, right, it’s gonna come down much faster than the tiny microscopic droplet of water. So the smaller particles not only are worse for us, but they can travel further. That’s why we can have this-bad air quality and health concerns based on fires that are happening in Canada.”  According to the EPA the individuals more likely to be affected by particle pollution exposure are people with heart or lung diseases, people with diabetes, and those less than 18 years old.  “Fine particulates are the product of any kind of burning,” says Dueker. “So if you’re burning oil, gas or wood, the process of combustion is not complete, ever. And so it creates microscopic pieces of matter that get thrown into the air. I would say that wood smoke, that is probably worse than a cigarette.”  Dueker points out that most cigarettes come with a filter. Campfires do not.  In terms of the effect on human beings, Dueker considers wood fires worse than coal fires. “In the Hudson Valley, we love our fires,” says Dueker. “We love being outside and you know, I do just as much as anyone else, but it’s really the unfortunate reality.”  Word is finally coming out of Canada that the fires are coming under control, that the firefighters are traipsing through smoking dirt fields still hot to the touch to search for stubborn flames that might still be smoldering.  Until the wind swings around from the north, the Hudson Valley is stuck with particulate matter blown from across the Bay of Fundy showering down like a nuclear winter, too small to see up close with the naked eye but refracting a hazy light in the distance.  The Kingston Air Quality Initiative (KAQI) began in January 2020 as a partnership between Bard’s Community Sciences Lab and the City of Kingston Conservation Advisory Council’s air quality subcommittee.

"fire","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-08T02:48:00","CHARLOTTE — The Charlotte Fire Department is releasing more details about the investigation into a deadly fire last month.  Firefighters rescued 15 people on May 18 after the flames broke out at an apartment complex being built on Liberty Row Road near Fairview Road.  Two workers, Ruben Holmes and Demonte Sherrill, were killed.  Last month, Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said the fire began accidentally and started in a spray insulation foam trailer on the ground floor. Workers shared that same information with Channel 9 on May 18.  On Wednesday, Charlotte Fire said there isn’t any new information about the specific source that ignited the fire, but they discovered “multiple accidental heat sources were in the trailer.”  However, the department said the building that caught fire did not meet North Carolina fire code.  Per section 3313 of the state fire code, buildings required to have standpipes should have at least one standpipe for use during construction. According to Charlotte Fire, no active standpipe was installed, and the department said there’s no documentation showing one was installed or operational.  PREVIOUS STORIES:  According to Charlotte Fire, a standpipe is piping built into multi-story buildings to which fire hoses can be connected, which allows water to be manually used in a fire.  The department also cited state code section 3308.2 that requires a general contractor to contact the county fire marshal before building more than 40 feet in height at a construction site. At that height, the general contractor is usually requited to inform the fire marshal’s office of their progress.  Charlotte Fire said when the fire broke out on May 18, the building was at least six stories tall, four of which were built with wooden framing. The department hadn’t received any communication from the contractor or builder before that date, so no fire inspection had been performed, Charlotte Fire said.  The department cited a third state fire code, section 3311.1, that requires at least one temporary stairway to be built when a building is at least 50 feet or four stories tall. Investigators said at that point in the building’s construction, at least one exit was required by code. The building did meet that requirement.  That day, four Charlotte Fire trucks were damaged. The department said it doesn’t have much information about them still, but they will make sure they are safe before returning them to service.  “With those apparatus temporarily removed from service, there has been no lapse in emergency response to Charlotte residents, and Charlotte Fire is fully capable of achieving our mission,” a news release from Charlotte Fire reads.  Channel 9′s Glenn Counts spoke with the Director of UNC Charlotte’s Fire and Safety Engineering Technology Department Dr. Jeff Kimble.  Kimble said he was troubled by the lack of a standpipe. “It’s actually extremely handy for those people in the fire service,” Kimble explained.  This sentiment was echoed by Valarie Johnson, with the UNC School of Law.  “If there wasn’t an inspection that certainly doesn’t mean there would have been something found. But it raises the question of what would have been found given the severity of the fire and the loss of life,” Johnson said.  Matthews Fire Chief Rob Kinniburgh told Channel 9 that the building was at this most vulnerable period when the fire occurred.  “Once a fire was to start, there is very little other than human effort to slow that fire growth,” Kinniburgh said. “‘Would a standpipe have made a difference if one was working in this instance?’ It may have. But then again, it may not. The extremely rapid fire growth may not have afforded the firefighters the time they needed to get that standpipe in operation.”  (WATCH BELOW: Family, friends say final goodbyes to construction worker killed in SouthPark fire)  Family, friends say final goodbyes to construction worker killed in SouthPark fire  ©2023 Cox Media Group","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGhwYXJrLWZpcmUtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXNpdGUtd2FzbnQtdXAtbmMtZmlyZS1jb2RlLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtc2F5L1NCUFoyQkNSWFJBR0pHUk5MS1pHTFZGTTJVL9IBlQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc291dGhwYXJrLWZpcmUtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXNpdGUtd2FzbnQtdXAtbmMtZmlyZS1jb2RlLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtc2F5L1NCUFoyQkNSWFJBR0pHUk5MS1pHTFZGTTJVLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2016-05-03","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-07T21:13:00","Listen 8 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  One of environmentalism’s great challenges is not scientific but literary. The forces rendering our world uninhabitable can seem catastrophically intangible. How, then, are we to overcome our imaginative incapacity and conjure up their terrors and imminent dangers? “It has been suggested that one reason so many of us are attracted to disaster movies … is because they offer ways to visualize, and perhaps prepare for, such events ourselves,” writes journalist John Vaillant in “Fire Weather: A True Story From a Hotter World.” His book appeals for much the same reason — but the cataclysms for which it prepares us are not fictions.  Vaillant’s nemesis of choice is more elusive and more imperceptible than it may at first appear. “Our experience of fire occurs in the realm of the visible,” he writes, “but it is made possible by the invisible” — by oxygen in the atmosphere, declining humidity levels, rising temperatures and the ever-expanding catalogue of flammable petroleum products that we wear and use on a daily basis.  “Fire Weather” drags all of these abstractions into the spotlight, then turns its attention to another potent invisibility: Not only are the sources of increasing threats from fires out of sight and therefore out of mind (at least until rampant wildfires in Canada bathe the entire East Coast and Mid-Atlantic in toxic fumes), but environmental crises in general, and forest fires in particular, are unthinkably huge and horrific. A conflagration in the subarctic Canadian region of Alberta, in 2001, was so explosive that its volatility was, per Vaillant, “difficult to express in ordinary thermal terms.” “If you’re having trouble imagining a quarter of a million space heaters compressed into the length of a yardstick and then multiplied by several miles, you’re not alone,” he concedes. Chroniclers resorted to new units of measurement: Scientists determined that, at the fire’s peak, the energy it released was equivalent to the amount that would be released by “four Hiroshima bombs per minute.”  But even this comparison is unhelpfully notional. What does the energy of four atomic bombs look like? More palpable is the intimate, experiential language favored by a pilot who flew over the flames and remarked, almost lyrically, “I have to be careful because the plane is going to crumple up like a butterfly.”  Advertisement  Vaillant’s narrative, which also takes place in Alberta, begins in May 2016, when the region was unusually hot and dry. Fires are a regular and natural occurrence in that part of the world — they are the subarctic forest’s way of revitalizing itself, and native flora have adapted to withstand them — but in recent years, blazes have been unprecedentedly frequent and extreme. That spring, “winter snowfall had been far below average for two years running,” and a perfect storm was brewing. A fire was crackling, and winds were gusting toward the small city of Fort McMurray.  The city’s authorities had all of the relevant information at their fingertips, but as the flames advanced, they remained in a state of disbelief and paralysis. By the end of the debacle, the Fort McMurray fire was unspeakable because of its inhuman intensity; at the beginning, it was unspeakable because the mayor and the fire chief refused to speak about it. “Something that is ‘infandous’ is a thing too horrible to be named or uttered,” Vaillant writes. Everyone in charge in Fort McMurray found the looming inferno infandous, and “Fire Weather” slows almost to a standstill as the crisis builds, unbearable and looming. “The energy releasing at lunchtime on May 3 was equivalent to a nuclear explosion,” Vaillant reports. The fire was a “half mile west of the only road out of town.” Meanwhile, fire chief Darby Allen was still counseling residents to go about their day as usual. It is impossible to keep reading, impossible to stop.  By the afternoon, the smoke was visible on the horizon. A firefighter “in the midst of showing his pumper truck to a class of kindergarteners” turned and glimpsed a black mass. A wife and husband were packing up their belongings when the woman turned and cried, “The fire!” Her husband replied soothingly, “I know there’s a fire coming, but it’s not a big deal.” “No! You don’t understand,” she screamed. “The fire’s on our street!” An evacuation order was not issued until 2 p.m., by which time the suburbs were already engulfed. “The citizenry of Fort McMurray discovered that their city was burning mostly by personal observation and word of mouth.”  Advertisement  Tragic incongruities multiplied as evacuees clung to consoling mundanities, relics of the normal life they had been leading until just moments prior. The owner of a dry-cleaning store shrieked “Get out, get out, get out” on the phone to his wife, then turned to a client and asked if she could pick up her garments on Tuesday.  Given the ferocity of the blaze that bore down on the city, it is miraculous that there were no fire-related deaths during the sudden and haphazard exodus of 90,000 people that ensued. As a long line of cars wound down the highway, the streets behind them were rapidly becoming unrecognizable. “Neighborhoods once distinguished by tidy uniformity” were transforming into “suburban Hells rendered by Salvador Dali.” Household fixtures melted and writhed into monstrous forms. Soon, gas stations were exploding, and cars and propane tanks affixed to grills were no more than “flying shrapnel.” The fire “created its own weather,” as one harrowed survivor told Vaillant. Entire houses disappeared in close to five minutes. The same fire chief who had lately reassured residents started calling the fire “the beast.”  Normal tactics were paltry defenses against such a fiend. “Most of the hose streams deployed were evaporating long before they reached the flames,” and hydrants were running dry. The department of forestry, expert in combating conflagrations in the woods, teamed up with the fire department, expert in stamping out urban blazes, to face a situation that neither was equipped to handle: a forest fire in a city. Responders were forced to devise new strategies on the spot, many of them failures. The beast was not contained until a month later and “would not be declared fully extinguished until August of the following year.” “With the sole exception of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina,” Vaillant writes, “no modern North American city has been disinhabited for so long.”  Advertisement  “Fire Weather” mounts a systematic investigation into all the factors that conspired to wreak such havoc on Fort McMurray. A book about an isolated disaster thereby unfurls into a book about boreal forest ecosystems, the chemistry of combustion, the flammability of modern furniture, the history of environmental exploitation in Alberta, the climactic conditions that are making forest fires increasingly dangerous and ubiquitous, and much more — at times, too much more. I could have done without quite so many forays into the origins of climate science or quite so many reminders that the admittedly colossal mismanagement in Fort McMurray resembles the no less colossal mismanagement ongoing worldwide. Lectures about how officials in both local and global cases have turned a blind eye to impending catastrophe serve only to reiterate the obvious — and, worse, to transform an account of a painfully particular horror into a generic admonition. “Fire Weather” fails when it trades in familiar warnings, which are easily relegated to the dustbin of the mind. It succeeds when it concretizes the unimaginable in terms that seize readers by the throat.  There is a second nefarious immensity that is hard to picture, and it, too, is converted into something tangible and terrifying in “Fire Weather.” “When it comes to rapidly and radically altering a landscape along with the lives of those who live upon it,” Vaillant warns, “only a few things compare to a big boreal fire, and one of them is the profit motive.” The truth is, “we are fire’s kin — gas-driven, fuel-burning, heat-generating appetites who will burn as bright and hot as we can, stopping at nothing until we’re fully extinguished.” But even with the aid of a good metaphor, we may not feel the searing heat of our own rapaciousness until it is too late.

KNOX COUNTY, Ohio — A camp in Knox County called “Because I Said I Would” designed to help grieving teens and families who have lost loved ones or were affected by child abuse and suicidal ideation was burned to the ground on June 4.  The owner, Alex Sheen, said he is devastated and is calling for all community support during this time.  ""The reason why it weighs so heavy is because we need those things to help these people. It's not trivial. This has set us back years and that's why we're really upset. It has nothing to do with the material possessions. Who cares? Honestly, it's about the capacity to is taken away to serve these families and bereavement and youth facing mental health adversities,” Sheen said.  Sheen has been running the nonprofit with his family for over 10 years and finally launched their dream camp in February to support teens and families in overcoming hard times.  “Mental health crisis that we're going through is not some kind of clickbait article title. It is real.

There was no one on the property at the time but the fire took everything.  “There was nothing we could do even with our employee who was on scene first. It was already at a point of no return,” Sheen said.  The Bladensburg Fire Department reports over 40 firefighters from 11 agencies responded to the fire. It was declared a total loss.  “I think the most important thing is to try to get some temporary mobile office like if there was anybody who had that capacity who could rent us to us or lend it to us or give it to us so that we could just bridge the gap for the moment listen, we're, we're a resourceful bunch, right?

(KDVR) — The Boulder County Sheriff’s Office announced it will release details Thursday about what caused the Marshall Fire.  “It’s mixed feelings, because it won’t change what happened, but maybe it’ll bring closure to understand what happened,” said Jessica Carson, whose home burned down in the Marshall Fire on Dec. 30, 2021.  FOX31 and Channel 2 interviewed Carson back in December 2022, when her family moved into their newly built home on the same property where their house burned down just shy of a year before. She and one other neighbor are the only two back in the neighborhood, while several other homes are under construction and other lots are for sale.  “We have a yard and chickens, and we are excited to get some neighbors too,” Carson said.  On Wednesday, Carson learned then that the investigation into what caused the fire had finished.  “It won’t change the fact that we all lost our homes, but maybe it will add some closure for others,” Carson said.  She said she’s read and heard things about how the fire started but is anxious to hear the definite answer Thursday.  “It sounded like a mix of an uncontrolled burn, a windy day and faulty power lines,” Carson said “I think it was just the perfect storm.”  Kim and Mike Parks also lost everything in the fire, and say they’re anxious for Thursday’s announcement.  “It just kills you not to know.” says Mike Parks. “Nothing will change what happened, but the cause of it seems important, because that changes all of the next steps forward.”  SkyFOX view of people at locations destroyed by the Marshall Fire (KDVR)  Lawyer represents Marshall Fire victims, seeks class action  Attorney James Avery, with Denver Injury Law, said he’s representing several people who lost their homes in an attempt at a class-action lawsuit.

Carson said she awaits the answer.  “If anything, it answers the question that has always been out there,” Carson said. “Whenever someone asks me about the fire, that’s one of the questions, is: What caused it?

At around 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon, fire crews from the Phoenix Fire Department were called out to the area of 16th and Oak streets in Phoenix to respond to a three-alarm fire.  According to the Phoenix Fire Department, the fire spread quickly to surrounding structures and completely destroyed two homes and two sheds.  “Firefighters found several exterior fires that appeared to be driven by high winds which began to extend to several structures in the area,” Captain Joe Higgins said in an emailed statement.  According to an APS representative, half a dozen light poles were burned by the fire, causing a power outage that affected customers in the area. Crews deployed by APS were able to restore power and replace the damaged poles by Wednesday morning.  Samuel Bergstrom, a resident of the area for 61 years and owner of Sam’s Nursery was one of the properties affected by the fire. He recalled the initial moments after noticing the blaze.  “I was out here watering,” Bergstrom said. “I just started hosing down whatever I could get.”  Blake Merrell, a resident living with Bergstrom talked about the moments where both men fought against the flames.  “I couldn't even believe it, it was like a wall of flame,” Merrell said. “Luckily we were able to grab the hose and get everything wet and just get that little barrier of protection.”  More than 50 units responded to the blaze, with more than 150 firefighters attending to the fire at one moment. About 21 people were estimated to have been displaced as the fire spread across various properties on the street.  Phoenix Fire Department Captain Joe Higgins provided a report on the situation on Tuesday night in an alleyway near the scene of the fire. Two adults were reported to have been transported to a local hospital but are in stable condition.  After more than a day after the fire, the risk is still present for residents in the area. According to Merrell, residents were advised to be aware of a reigniting fire caused by embers.  “The fire department said we gotta watch out for fires springing back up,” Merrell said.  As for Bergstrom and his nursery, he estimates the total loss of plants to be around $100,000. But, he hopes that some of his plants will rise up from the ashes.  “$100,000 worth of plants went bye-bye. Some of them might come back but I’m not sure how many of them are going to come back,” Bergstrom said.  The cause of the fire was not been identified as of Wednesday afternoon, but the matter was under investigation by the Phoenix Fire Investigations Task Force.  A brochure from the Arizona Department of Health Services advises following these steps after a fire:  Call your insurance carrier immediately: Don’t settle claims or sign releases too quickly. Ensure the insurance will take care of security matters such as boarding up the property and taking time to know the losses.  Don’t settle claims or sign releases too quickly.

According to the Carpentersville Fire Department, crews were called to the 1700 block of Kingston Circle just before 4:15 p.m. Wednesday on reports of a fire.  Upon arrival, crews discovered four structures engulfed by flames and were able to put out the fire within an hour.  The cause of the fire remains unknown at this time.

That reported maintenance logjam is especially troubling to Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey, whose office prosecuted PG&E in the Camp Fire. The 2018 fire – blamed on PG&E’s failure to maintain its aging system -- destroyed the town of Paradise and left 85 people dead.  Five years later, Ramsey worries about the languishing maintenance, especially with all the added fuel from an unusually wet winter.  “I've seen the grass at this time of year twice as high and the brush …. has just exploded,” Ramsey said. “That means a very concerning fire year.”  Get a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area’s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.  But in a recent call to investors last month, PG&E’s CEO Patti Poppe touted the utility’s extensive fire mitigation efforts as grounds for optimism. She said PG&E’s strategy of cutting power immediately at the first sign of trouble helped reduce its fire risk by more than 90%.  “It gives me a lot of confidence heading into wildfire season that we are prepared,"" Poppe said in the May 4 earnings call. Restoring shareholder dividends, she said, will help obtain low cost financing needed to build on the progress.  But a skeptical Ramsey points to the findings of the state regulator-appointed monitor’s report, in April, by Filsinger Energy Partners, which highlights PG&E’s current backlog of 170,000 outstanding “maintenance tags” in high fire areas.  “A ‘maintenance tag’ is an identification that something out of the normal has been found,” explained Dan Mulkey, a retired senior consulting electrical engineer at PG&E who is now a consultant.  He says a utility must have detailed asset information to determine how quickly to make repairs on power poles and other vital components. “How dangerous is it?” he said, “That depends, mostly on the weather and how old it is.”  But according to the monitor, PG&E lacks precise age data on more than half of its lines. And its aging power poles account for half the company’s maintenance backlog.  Currently, the company is only replacing about half its goal of poles annually and only about 40 miles of its aging lines, the report noted. It’s target is 800 miles.  PG&E officials recently signaled to the monitor that the task is daunting.  “The magnitude of capital needed for asset replacement programs,” the report quotes unnamed PG&E managers as saying, “was far in excess of the amount of capital believed to be available.”  In a statement, PG&E says it continues to “aggressively work to reduce the backlog” while “continually removing more ignition risk from the highest wildfire risk areas in our system.”  Reducing the backlog, the utility says, along with keeping up addressing new issues, will help make more progress reducing fire risks.  But Ramsey said in a recent interview that he is far from satisfied.  “PG&E needs to step up their game,” he said, adding that he regularly talks to company officials about both the progress achieved and the challenges remaining. Based on what he has seen this year, he says, PG&E still has not done enough to justify paying dividends.  “We've warned them -- they've got the warning,’’ Ramsey said, “and they need to approach it like their hair is on fire.”  PG&E heads into fire season this year facing a backlog of 170,000 outstanding maintenance jobs in the high fire risk parts of its system, according to a report by the independent safety monitor.

Sacramento Metro Fire said it happened just before 5 a.m. Wednesday at a ghost kitchen, which is still under construction, in a shopping center along Madison Avenue.  It's called Commissary and Food Storage, a shared kitchen for chefs and restaurant owners who serve up food for online orders and delivery only.  Video released by the fire district Wednesday captured two suspects pulling up to the business in a white van, breaking glass out front and throwing the flammable fluid inside, igniting a fire. The video appears to show a flare being thrown.  Metro Fire said the suspects tried to ignite the whole place twice, but the fire never got big enough to alert the alarm or any other mechanisms to call 911. It ultimately burned itself out before crews arrived.  ""Breaking the window and throwing bombs in the place? Come on. The smoke was so dense in here it just ruined the whole place,"" said maintenance technician Nabih Massoud of the commercial kitchen.  From ruined grills to damaged air conditioning, ceiling panels and flooring, the total cost is around $120,000 in repairs needed before opening day next month.  ""To pick somebody that hasn't even gotten opened up yet, having a hard time getting going and doing that to them? It's horrible,"" said Massoud.  And it isn't the first time — they say surrounding businesses in the shopping center have repeatedly seen their windows broken by vandals with nothing stolen.  ""Four, five different places got things broken, windows. Now they're escalating to arson? Again, it doesn't make any sense someone would do that for no specific reason,"" said Massoud.  Sacramento Metro Fire told CBS13 of nine arson investigations their arson team has gone out on, this marks the fourth arson this week alone.  ""It is alarming for us and we start looking internally at how can we prevent these things. How can we get better messaging out?"" said spokesperson for the department, Capt. Parker Wilbourn.  An arson Sunday in Citrus Heights destroyed a home; a man who lived there was arrested for the crime.  So CBS13 asked: are arsons on the rise?  ""This is an uptick. We do have busy spurts,"" said Wilbourn.  In Sacramento, police are hoping now to arrest the suspects responsible on Madison Avenue. They're seen on video pulling up in a white van with a ladder rack. They left behind a huge and costly mess.  The owners of the ghost kitchen are glad no one was hurt, though this ordeal could delay their opening next month.  Investigators are seeking the public's help in identifying the two individuals in the video. Anyone who recognizes them is asked to contact Metro Fire's arson tip line at 916-859-3775 or email at arsontip@metrofire.ca.gov.  See photos of the Madison Avenue suspects below.

Nonetheless, the fire danger is not over and many cities are urging residents to limit water use and take extra precautions.  In southeast Michigan, the city of Saline is urging residents to limit outdoor watering for the next couple weeks. In Allen Park, the fire department is asking people to be extremely cautious with things like cigarette butts, barbecues, and other sources of fire ignition.  It's a serious issue that the DNR is taking steps to prevent. This week they not be issuing any open burn permits. They are also telling campers to keep fires small and to have their eyes open and water near at all times. They also suggest making sure that the burning wood is cool to the touch before you walk away.  Some campers enjoying the water and view at Proud Lake in Commerce Township say they will avoid fires altogether until rain rehydrates the grass.  ""It's very dry out there.

The fire, estimated at 2,418 acres in size, is now 100% contained.  The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is asking people to stay away from the area in Crawford County’s Grayling Township to give fire crews space to finish their work.  “We know it is interesting to see and that people are curious, but we want to make sure we have the room to get our work done safely,” said Mike Janisse, commander of the DNR Incident Management Team that has been assisting with the fire. “Driving on the dry roads creates a great deal of dust, which makes for poor visibility.” Roads also are narrow and there is little room for passing.  The fire started about 1 p.m. Saturday near Staley Lake, escaping from a campfire on private property. The fire quickly burned in a southwest direction through jack pine, mixed pine and oak in hilly, sandy terrain. The fire caused the evacuation of about 300 people until around 11 p.m. Saturday and closed I-75 in both directions Saturday afternoon and evening.  DNR ground crews working on the fire were assisted by many local agencies and air support including water-bearing planes and helicopters from the USDA Forest Service and the Michigan State Police.  Fire danger remains very high to extreme across the state. The DNR is not issuing permits for open burning at this time. If you must build a campfire or cooking fire, keep a close eye on it at all times and keep it small. Make sure you drench it with water, stir and drench again until it is cold to the touch before leaving it.  DNR firefighters statewide have fought more than two dozen fires in the past week.

States across the east, including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, issued air quality alerts, with officials recommending that people limit outdoor activity.  In New York City, where conditions were expected to deteriorate further through the day, residents were urged to limit their time outdoors, as public schools canceled outdoor activities.  Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season.  New York City had the worst air quality of any big city in the world on Wednesday, according to IQAir. Second worst was Lahore, Pakistan, while the next worst major US city, Detroit, Michigan, came in at 13th. Delhi, India, which consistently ranks among the worst cities for air pollution, was sixth worst.  The smell of smoke was detectable in New York on Tuesday evening as the sky turned orange-brown and visibility shrank before sunset. The smell persisted on Wednesday, and an air quality advisory was expected to remain in place until Wednesday night in much of central and eastern New York state. In New York City, schools canceled all outdoor events and residents were encouraged to wear face masks, which many had shed as the coronavirus pandemic waned.  “We recommend all New Yorkers limit outdoor activity to the greatest extent possible,” the mayor, Eric Adams, said.  “Those with pre-existing respiratory problems, like heart or breathing problems, as well as children and older adults, may be especially sensitive and should stay indoors at this time.”  00:36 Canada: wildfires rage across British Columbia – video  Adams said air conditions were expected to deteriorate throughout Wednesday afternoon and evening.  Almost the entire state of New Jersey was under an air quality alert, while hazy conditions and smoke from the wildfires were reported across the Great Lakes region from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York.  The smoke had drifted as far south as South Carolina, where officials recommended that people keep doors and windows closed.  A woman looks at the Manhattan skyline engulfed in haze on 7 June. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA  In Philadelphia, the smell of smoke prompted a spate of 911 calls on Tuesday night, 6ABC reported, as residents were asked to avoid going outdoors as much as possible.  Air-quality alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution – known as “PM 2.5” – which can irritate the lungs.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day’s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, usually, the smoke has been aloft and hasn’t affected people’s health, Austin said.  Experts, and some political leaders were highlighting links between the wildfires and the climate crisis.  A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US.

"fire","2023-06-07","Not Discerned","{""Detroit"", ""Michigan"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-07T16:13:14","Smoke from more than 100 wildfires burning across Canada has been rolling into North American cities far from the flames. New York City and Detroit were both listed among the five most polluted cities in the world because of the fires on June 7, 2023. The smoke has triggered air quality alerts in several states in recent weeks.  The Conversation asked Chris Migliaccio, a toxicologist at the University of Montana who studies the impact of wildfire smoke on human health, about the health risks people can face when smoke blows in from distant wildfires.  What’s in wildfire smoke that’s a problem?  When we talk about air quality, we often talk about PM2.5. That’s particulate matter 2.5 microns or smaller – small enough that it can travel deep into the lungs.  READ MORE: 10 tips for coping with wildfire smoke, from a public health expert  Exposure to PM2.5 from smoke or other air pollution, such as vehicle emissions, can exacerbate health conditions like asthma and reduce lung function in ways that can worsen existing respiratory problems and even heart disease.  But the term PM2.5 only tells you about size, not composition – what is burning can make a significant difference in the chemistry.  In the northern Rockies, where I live, most fires are fueled by vegetation, but not all vegetation is the same. If the fire is in the wildland urban interface, manufactured fuels from homes and vehicles may also be burning, and that’s going to create its own toxic chemistry, as well. Chemists often talk about volatile organic compounds, (VOCs), carbon monoxide and PAHs, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced when biomass and other matter burns having the potential to harm human health.  How does inhaling wildfire smoke harm human health?  If you have ever been around a campfire and got a blast of smoke in your face, you probably had some irritation. With exposure to wildfire smoke, you might get some irritation in the nose and throat and maybe some inflammation. If you’re healthy, your body for the most part will be able to handle it.  As with a lot of things, the dose makes the poison – almost anything can be harmful at a certain dose.  Generally, cells in the lungs called alveolar macrophages will pick up the particulates and clear them out – at reasonable doses. It’s when the system gets overwhelmed that you can have a problem.  One concern is that smoke can suppress macrophage function, altering it enough that you become more susceptible to respiratory infection. A colleague who looked at lag time in the effect of wildfire smoke exposure found an increase in influenza cases after a bad fire season. Studies in developing countries have also found increases in respiratory infections with people who are cooking on open fires in homes.  READ MORE: Gaps in U.S. wildfire smoke warning network leave many exposed  The stress of an inflammatory response can also exacerbate existing health problems. Being exposed to wood smoke won’t independently cause someone to have a heart attack, but if they have underlying risk factors, such as significant plaque buildup, the added stress can increase the risk.  Researchers are also studying potential effects on the brain and nervous system from inhaled particulate matter.  When smoke blows over long distances, does its toxicity change?  We know that the chemistry of wildfire smoke changes. The longer it’s in the atmosphere, the more the chemistry will be altered by ultraviolet light, but we still have a lot to learn.  Researchers have found that there seems to be a higher level of oxidation, so oxidants and free radicals are being generated the longer smoke is in the air. The specific health effects aren’t yet clear, but there’s some indication that more exposure leads to greater health effects.  The supposition is that more free radicals are generated the longer smoke is exposed to UV light, so there’s a greater potential for health harm. A lot of that, again, comes down to dose.  Chances are, if you’re a healthy individual, going for a bike ride or a hike in light haze won’t be a big deal, and your body will be able to recover.  If you’re doing that every day for a month in wildfire smoke, however, that raises more concerns. I’ve worked on studies with residents at Seeley Lake in Montana who were exposed to hazardous levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke for 49 days in 2017. We found a decrease in lung function a year later. No one was on oxygen, but there was a significant drop.  This is a relatively new area of research, and there’s still a lot we’re learning, especially with the increase in wildfire activity as the planet warms.  What precautions can people take to reduce their risk from wildfire smoke?  If there is smoke in the air, you want to decrease your exposure.  Can you completely avoid the smoke? Not unless you’re in a hermetically sealed home. The PM levels aren’t much different indoors and out unless you have a really good HVAC system, such as those with MERV 15 or better filters. But going inside decreases your activity, so your breathing rate is slower and the amount of smoke you’re inhaling is likely lower.  We also tend to advise people that if you’re in a susceptible group, such as those with asthma, create a safe space at home and in the office with a high-level stand-alone air filtration system to create a space with cleaner air.  Some masks can help. It doesn’t hurt to have a high-quality N95 mask. Just wearing a cloth mask won’t do much, though.

Parents who lost their 2 daughters in a 2022 horrific fire are demanding accountability from a LI town. Reply  Jillian and Lindsay Wiener both died in a horrific Noyac fire last August. (Courtesy Wiener family.)  NOYAC, NY — The family of two young women who died in a horrific Noyac fire in August have issued a scathing call out to Southampton Town officials, demanding accountability and reforms to the town's rental code.  Lewis Wiener issued a statement to Patch: ""Our daughers Jillian, then 21, and Lindsay, then 16, were killed in the fire on Spring Lane in Noyac last August. Over the months since that horrible night claimed the lives of our daughters and shattered our family irreparably, we have seen indifference, if not outright callousness, on the part of Southampton Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman, Southampton Town Attorney James Burke, and other local officials."" Wiener said what he and his family learned about the fire marshal's investigation and the facts surrounding their girls' deaths was gleaned not from public oficials but instead, from the numerous interviews they gave to the media.  ""No one ever had the courtesy — the basic human decency — of informing us of the facts that led to our daughters' deaths before they spoke with the media,"" Wiener said. ""The insensitivity and callousness of the town attorney and the town supervisor is nothing short of appalling and has only added to our family's pain."" Putting his own family's situation aside, Wiener said, the question the East End community should be asking as the summer's high rental season approaches is, ""Where is the expression of outrage and commitment to cracking down on illegal rentals?"" Wiener said. ""Where are your elected officials? Where is Jay Schneiderman? We've heard from Mr. Schneiderman the same thing that the residents of the Hamptons have heard on the issue of illegal rentals: nothing, silence, indifference,"" he said. ""Ask yourself, as we head into the summer rental season, are we any safer this year than we were last year? Has there been and will there by any meaningful crackdown on illegal rentals? As far as we can tell, the answer is 'no'.""  Residents of the East End can complain about illegal rentals but those complaints have and will continue to fall upon deaf ears, Wiener believes. ""How many other children will die because of Jay Schneiderman's and other elected officials' indifference and failure to take the issue of illegal rentals seriously? We all deserve better — our daughters deserved better,"" he said. ""We challenge Supervisor Schneiderman to prove us wrong and to publicly state what he and his administration are doing differently this year with respect to illegal rentals. We suspect we will hear nothing.""    Schneiderman responded to a request for response from Patch: ""The Wieners are understandably still stricken with grief over the loss of their daughters last August,"" he said. ""I personally called Mr. Wiener after the tragedy to express my deepest condolences. As a parent myself, it is hard to imagine the depth of grief they are experiencing. The town takes seriously the enforcement of our rental laws and other regulations and will continue to do so. As town supervisor, public safety is, and always has been, my highest priority."" Lisa Finn / Patch Town Attorney James Burke also spoke with Patch: The fire, he said, was ""the saddest thing that happened since I've been in the town attorney's office.""  Burke said after the fire, he and Southampton Town Chief Fire Marshal John Rankin, along with the Wieners' attorney Andy Alonso and friends of the Wieners spent hours looking through the charred ruins for a necklace the girls had given Alisa Wiener, their mother. Rankin, he said, found the necklace. The home, Burke said, ""was horrendous. The idea that anybody got out alive was amazing. It was behind horrible — the whole place was charred, black — everything was charred."" He added: ""You don't forget what you saw, opening that door. Outside, was beautiful Noyac in the summer. Then you opened the door into the gates of hell."" Burke said he has complete sympathy for the Wiener family. He said one critical problem during the fire was that backup batteries were missing from the fire detectors. ""Those girls would probably be alive if there were backup batteries,"" he said. The smoke detectors, which were wired, did not function during the fire, he said.  Burke said he lost his brother, a member of the FDNY, on 9/11. ""This is not something I take lightly,"" he said. Burke said any information Alonso asked for, he was given; Burke said he even asked if reports should be sent directly to the Wieners but Alonso said to give them to him and he'd pass along the information. Fire officials have said that the fire likely started in the outdoor kitchen but no definitive cause has been determined, Burke said. Burke said again that the ""brutal"" tragedy shouldn't have happened and wouldn't have, had the smoke detectors been working. The backup batteries were essential, he said, because when the fire broke out, it cut off the electricity so any wired smoke detectors wouldn't work. Lew Weiner woke to the sound of breaking glass as windows were blown out from the flames, Burke said. ""The girls were already in deep trouble by that point."" In November, the Wiener family filed a lawsuit against the owners of the illegal vacation property, as well as two online rental companies, stating that a lack of functioning smoke alarms led to the tragedy.  According to a complaint filed on Nov. 15 in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, the fire on Aug. 3 caused the deaths of Jillian Wiener, 21, and Lindsay Wiener, 19. The lawsuit was filed by Melville attorney Andres Alonso of Alonso Krangle LLP and Martin Grossman of the New York-based law office of Robert A. Cardali, P.C. against the owners of the home on Spring Lane, Pamela and Peter Miller, 3 Spring Lane LLC, and Homeaway.com Inc., and VRBO Holdings, Inc. ""They were two shining lights who brought joy to everyone they encountered,"" the suit said. ""Their loss cannot be measured. . . The Wiener family is left with a nightmare from which they cannot wake."" The girls' parents, Alisa and Lew Wiener are ""brokenhearted,"" the suit said; their brother Zachary is ""haunted by their loss and the notion that the girls could not be saved."" According to the suit, the rental home was unsafe, with no working fire alarms, smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors — and an outdoor kitchen, which had not been inspected, was not properly wired, and which was not compliant, that had been installed by the Millers. The home did not have the required rental permit, town officials told Patch after the blaze.  The complaint included a copy of the VRBO reservation, which stated that the home had a fire extinguisher, smoke detectors outside each bedroom door and in each bedroom, and carbon monoxide detectors outside each bedroom door and inside each bedroom. Those representations, the suit said, ""were false. . .the representations were particularly dangerous in that in some instances, there were what appeared to be smoke, or carbon monoxide detectors. . .lulling plaintiffs into a false sense of security. In fact, these 'alarms' were nothing more than the worthless carcasses of non-functioning alarms that had no power, had been disconnected, had their batteries removed, or were left with useless, lifeless batteries."" Had the Wiener family been informed, they would have not risked their daughters' lives by staying at the home, the suit said. The Wiener family was ""destroyed,"" the complaint states. ""Two young women will never have the chance to fully realize their great promise and left Alisa, Lew and Zach Wiener fractured in ways that can never be mended."" A spokesperson for VRBO did not respond to a request for comment at the time the suit was filed. Edward Burke, Jr., attorney for the Millers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Andy Alonso, attorney for the Wiener family, wrote a letter to Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney in early October, demanding answers as to why the office hadn't investigated the fire. ""The DA's homicide bureau is investigating this tragic fire,"" a representative for Tierney said Thursday. ""However, we can't comment further since this is an ongoing investigation."" In August, Ryan Murphy, public safety and emergency management administrator for Southampton Town, said the investigation had honed in on an area in the home. ""The focus of the investigation is to try to determine the cause and origin of the fire,"" he said. ""This far, the investigation seems to indicate that the outdoor kitchen area is the most likely origin of the fire."" The home had no valid rental permit, meaning that there had been no inspection of the property to ensure safety, Southampton Town officials told Patch.  Wiener, 60, his wife Alisa, 52, and his son Zachary, 23, as well as his daughters, were vacationing from Potomac, Maryland, Southampton Town police have said. The children slept on the second floor, and the parents slept on the first floor. Lewis Wiener awoke to the sound of glass breaking around 3:35 a.m. and screamed for his family to get out, police said. He and his wife escaped the burning home, police said. When they realized the children hadn’t exited the house, Wiener tried desperately to gain entry back in. Flames prevented him from getting back inside, police said. The couple's son Zachary escaped out of a second-story window, police said. Wiener previously told Patch that the vacation was meant to be a time of joy for his family, a time of making memories, as he is battling inoperable pancreatic cancer. ""Tragically, the two daughters were unable to escape,"" police said. The town issued 29 violations each to Pamela and Peter Miller as a result of conditions identified during the investigation, Murphy said. The Wieners' attorney maintained those issues included smoke detectors that had no batteries or were disconnected.  ""The property owners are currently in court still on those charges. I cannot speak to matters currently under litigation,"" Murphy said. Burke, Jr., attorney for the Millers, told Patch in a prior interview: ""It is impossible to put into words the magnitude of this tragedy nor describe the devastation. But the one thing I can say is that the Millers did not tamper or alter fire alarms or electrical wiring within this house, for this house was their home."" Burke didn't comment on whether the kitchen was up to code, or on questions about whether the Millers had insurance, responding: ""Nothing further at this time."" In his letter, Alonso said Lew Wiener, when awoken Aug. 3 by the sound of breaking glass, was ""confronted with a wall of flame coming from the outdoor kitchen located on the deck connected to the home."" Wiener suffered burns trying to rescue his daughters, while his wife suffered smoke inhalation, the letter said. Their son was also burned. ""These promising young women were robbed of their lives, which held so much promise,"" the letter said.  In the weeks and months since the fire, thousands have reached out to support the Wiener family during their darkest hour. Wiener, speaking with Patch, described his girls and the many lives they touched. Murphy told Patch in August that while the home was rented for the vacation, there was no rental permit on file for the home, and therefore, the property was not inspected. He also said he believes there was ""a violation on record from the building department,"" but did not specify what that violation was. Murphy said he didn't know how the rental was conducted.""I don't know how they engaged that rental,"" he said. However, firefighters at the scene did not recall hearing the fire alarms going off, he said.Murphy said property owners ""will be held accountable for renting without the benefit of a permit."" Murphy said town officials work diligently to make sure the town's rental code is enforced, but with the proliferation of home-sharing sites, ""it's a bit like whack a mole.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL25ldy15b3JrL3NvdXRoYW1wdG9uL2FmdGVyLWZpcmUta2lsbHMtMi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcGFyZW50cy1kZW1hbmQtcmVudGFsLWNvZGUtY3JhY2tkb3du0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9wYXRjaC5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmsvc291dGhhbXB0b24vYW1wLzMxNDA4MDc5L2FmdGVyLWxpLWZpcmUta2lsbHMtMi1kYXVnaHRlcnMtcGFyZW50cy1kZW1hbmQtcmVudGFsLWNvZGUtY3JhY2tkb3du?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Park rangers said the fire started at approximately 1:23 p.m. Friday on a houseboat that was moored on Wahweap Marina’s B dock, near the Latitude 37 Restaurant. As emergency crews responded, the flames spread to several other vessels. One witness told KSL TV they believe the fire started on an unoccupied boat before spreading to three others.  One of those vessels was pushed out of its boat slip and into the marina. That boat was stopped by the breakwater, which then caught fire.  “Due to fire damage at the Wahweap Marina, please use extreme caution in the area,” park rangers said. “Impacted areas are closed to public access. Staff are assessing which sections of the dock were not compromised by the fire and will advise when boat slips are cleared for safe harbor. The area where the fire occurred will remain closed until cleared by fire investigators.”  Park rangers said anyone found in violation of the closure may be subject to law enforcement action.  Two people were treated for smoke inhalation on scene by Kane County Emergency Medical Services personnel and were later released. No further injuries were reported.  Investigators are asking the public to submit any photos or videos taken in the area at the time of the fire. Those files can be submitted here.

"fire","2023-06-05","17:01:00","{""Eugene"", ""Oregon"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-07T01:52:00","EUGENE, Ore -- As the summer approaches, firefighters aren't just worried about the big wildfires, but also smaller brush fires.  Earlier in the week, firefighters from Eugene Springfield Fire have been keeping busy. On Monday, more than 20 reported brush, grass, bark dust, and other fires ignited in Eugene. One of those brush fires happened behind the 2125 Franklin Apartments on Garden Avenue and Walnut Street. The aftermath of the flames can still be seen on some of the trees.  The fire was reported at 5:01 in the morning. One resident, Jonathan Hobson lives right next door to Franklin Apartments. He had left his window open and smoke got in his house. His smoke detector didn't sound the alarm.  ""It was just super smoky, stinking up my apartment. I'm surprised my smoke alarm didn't go off, it was actually quite strong,"" he said.  Hobson had a front row seat to the action, and he said this wasn't the first time a brush fire happened close by. The fire department brought in four fire trucks to deal with the situation. The flames were burning trees and foliage right next to the Union-Pacific Railroad tracks. Eugene-Springfield Fire Deputy Chief Scott Bishop said firefighters had to be even more careful than usual.  ""There were at least three heavy freight trains that came through there both east and west. So we had to use them to help control the speed and slow them way down from there standard 40 to 45 miles an hour that they would come through that area for us,"" Bishop said. ""They also gave us ample warning to get our crews away from the tracks.""  The department said it was hard to get to, as there was a creek and vegetation in between Franklin Apartments and the flames. Firefighters fought the flames for six hours. According to firefighters there was no threat to the residents nearby. The cause of the fire is believed to be a homeless encampment nearby, a gas powered generator was left running in the area.  The hotter temperatures, drier conditions, and wind make brush fires like this more prevalent. Fortunately, Eugene Springfield Fire plans and prepares for these situations. The department said they have the equipment and man power necessary to deal with these situations and not feel overwhelmed. If they need assistance, they can also call nearby departments or districts. They also study weather patterns to predict where the next fires are likely to happen.  Deputy Chief Bishop said, ""We can't guarantee you when a fire is going to occur, but we can tell you at the end of the year the majority of fires happened in these areas, in these months. So using that information we're going to prepare ourselves as much as possible.""  In order to prevent brush fires from becoming an issue to start with the Department does ask people to stay vigilant and responsible. Just like the generator, gas powered equipment can easily ignite flames and start burning the surrounding plants and grass. Charcoal grills are also another big igniter.  ""People feel, everything is cool and out and they dump it in the garbage can. The garbage can is plastic, it's in a garage, the backyard close to a house. It's super common for us to find a fires started that way."" Deputy Chief Bishop said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXppLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V1Z2VuZS1zcHJpbmdmaWVsZC1maXJlLXJlYWR5LXRvLXRha2Utb24tYnJ1c2gtZmlyZXMtYXMtc3VtbWVyLWFwcHJvYWNoZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNzk5YWVlYy0wNGQ1LTExZWUtODkyMC02M2EyOGY0ZjdiNmQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KXAN Photo/Christian Marcelli)  The city allocated $25,000 to park enhancements, including agility equipment in the small-dog park, replaced equipment in the large-dog park and new waste cans. A seating area is also available near the newly installed memorial plaque.  The plaque features the names of the 75 pets lost in a fire at Ponderosa Pet Resort. At the time, the Georgetown Fire Department said the animals likely died from smoke inhalation.  “The improvements and memorial dedicated to the dogs lost in that fire and their families will ensure we honor and remember these members of our community for decades to come,” Mayor Josh Schroeder said in a release. “I remain proud of the steps City Council and our fire department took to update our fire code requirements and inspections for boarding facilities, which will help prevent tragedies like the one we experienced here from happening again.”  In response to the deadly fire, Georgetown City Council updated its city fire codes to require all animal care facilities to install fire alarms. Newly constructed animal facilities also have additional fire-protection requirements, per the city release.  The Georgetown Fire Department also added animal housing and care facilities to its list of annual, priority inspections. Existing facilities were also audited and inspected in the department’s service area following the fire.  “We are pleased to see the animal-care facilities begin the process of installing the fire alarm equipment,” Georgetown Fire Chief John Sullivan said in the release.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4YW4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZ2VvcmdldG93bi9tZW1vcmlhbC1ob25vcnMtZG9ncy1sb3N0LWluLWdlb3JnZXRvd24tcGV0LWZhY2lsaXR5LWZpcmUv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3hhbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9nZW9yZ2V0b3duL21lbW9yaWFsLWhvbm9ycy1kb2dzLWxvc3QtaW4tZ2VvcmdldG93bi1wZXQtZmFjaWxpdHktZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2003-01-18","Not Discerned","{""Canberra"", ""AustralianCapitalTerritory"", ""Australia""}","2023-06-06T18:39:56","John Vaillant Author of Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World  There was no name for the thing Tom Bates captured on video at the height of the notorious Australian bush fire season of 2002-2003. Prior to that sweltering afternoon, there was no such thing as “pyro-tornadogenesis,” because such a phenomenon—a tornado generated by a wildfire—was not known to occur on planet Earth. Wildfires in both hemispheres often whip up small twisters known as fire whirls, but as impressive as they are to behold, and as dangerous as they are to be near, they are relatively small and short-lived events—more like dust devils than full-blown cyclones. What Bates saw and filmed from a suburban rugby pitch just outside Canberra, in southeast Australia, was different. It occurred during a historic week of lightning-caused fires that killed 4 people, injured more than 400, and destroyed 500 homes west of Australia’s capital city.  On January 18, Bates and his neighbors in the Kambah neighborhood, about five miles southwest of downtown, were on high alert because local fires had advanced to within a mile and a half of their neighborhood. Looking northward that afternoon, toward the flames, Bates observed a large funnel cloud over Mount Arawang, one of several low, tree-covered peaks in the area that are laced with walking trails and surrounded by suburban homes.  Tornadoes are not unheard of in the region, but this one appeared to be rising up out of the fire itself, like an atmospheric Balrog. It was 4 in the afternoon, the ambient temperature was nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the air was so dark with smoke that it appeared to be nighttime. The year 2003 was before smartphones became widespread, but Bates had the presence of mind to get his video camera and record what would come to be a new kind of fire. “I’ve never in my life seen anything like it,” we hear Bates say as the funnel takes shape above the burning mountain. He struggles to describe what he is seeing, not because he lacks the words, but because no Earthling has ever witnessed what he is witnessing now: “Holy shit… Holy mackerel. It’s a big fireball. It’s gotta be rippin’ poor bastards’ houses up there.” Then, right before our eyes, Mount Arawang appears to detonate. The blinding flash, combined with the funnel cloud whirling above it, gives the impression of a nuclear blast. “Holy Jeezus,” Bates gasps. “This is bad news. It’s like a big fireball tornado.”  It is now clear that this monstrous thing, which Bates has just named, is headed directly toward him. Australians seem to have a gift for understatement, and, as the wind begins to hiss and roar through the camera mic, we hear Bates say, “This is rather frightening.” A moment later, tin roofing and other debris from the homes surrounding Mount Arawang begin clattering to earth all around him. Sticks and gravel are now flying in horizontal gusts. “I’m getting pelted with stuff. It’s stinging the daylights out of me,” he says, shortly before the video ends. “It’s just like being sandblasted.”  It was estimated later that, during the single blinding burst that caused Mount Arawang to briefly disappear, an area of roughly 300 acres ignited in less than a tenth of a second. Bates had managed to document the most dramatic instance of exterior flashover ever observed. The Canberra fire tornado of 2003 was rated an EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with horizontal winds of 160 miles per hour, roughly equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. As the first documented example of its kind, it was a milestone—another harbinger of 21st-century fire. But the Chisholm Fire, two years earlier in Alberta, Canada, had offered a preview. A funnel cloud was observed during that fire as well, and the resulting forest damage showed evidence of cyclonic action.  It took years of analysis for Australian fire experts to fully understand what Bates and his neighbors witnessed on that terrible January day. The term “pyro-tornadogenesis” did not enter the literature until nearly a decade after the event. A fire tornado, fire scientists would come to understand, is the delinquent offspring of a pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorm. While you can have a pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorm without a fire tornado, you cannot have a fire tornado without a pyrocumulonimbus. In this sense, a fire tornado is—so far—a wildfire’s most dramatic terrestrial expression. (There are other extraordinary things that wildfires can do now, but they take place in the upper atmosphere.) Both fire tornadoes and pyrocumulonimbus thunderstorms are generated by high-intensity wildfires burning in hilly terrain on exceptionally hot days that have been further energized by incoming high-pressure systems and, some believe, by massive infusions of superheated steam from rapidly burning forests. These events have the capacity to further amplify an already ferocious fire in shocking ways that human beings have no power to defend against.  Once this new, warmer, carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere had proved itself capable of conjuring up a fire tornado, the question in 2003 was: Could it happen again? Australia is vast, drought-prone and, in places, heavily wooded, a combination that has generated the largest bush fires and the longest, most destructive fire seasons anywhere on Earth. It is fair to say that Australia rarely has a “good” fire season, but some are worse than others; the devastating fire season of 1973-1974 blackened an area the size of France and Spain combined (nearly half a million square miles). The Black Saturday Fires in 2009 were some of the worst ever. February was so hot and dry that year—even for southern Australia —that fire officials in the state of Victoria declared the weather forecast “uncharted territory.” “There are no weather records,” said an official on ABC television, “that show the kind of fire conditions [predicted] tomorrow.” The ambient temperature in Melbourne that day—February 7—was 116 degrees Fahrenheit, a record that broke the previous high (set in 2003) by 4 degrees. The searing heat was attended by gale-force winds; residents compared the experience of going outside to standing in front of a giant hair dryer.  Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World A stunning account of a colossal wildfire and a panoramic exploration of the rapidly changing relationship between fire and humankind Buy  The Black Saturday Fires, concentrated in the hill country northeast of Melbourne, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and obliterated several small towns. One hundred and seventy-three people were killed. These fires, started variously by faulty power lines, lightning strikes and arsonists, were, as of that year, the most lethal and destructive bush fires in Australia’s dramatic fire history. While none of them generated a full-blown tornado, a fire service pilot estimated head fire heights at a hundred yards, and some victims perished in their cars, overtaken by flames even as they fled at highway speed. But there was another killing energy released by those fires that moved even faster—at the speed of light. So otherworldly were the fire conditions on Black Saturday that animals and people were killed by radiant heat alone, from hundreds of yards away, as if they had been felled by a death ray.  Afterward, a Royal Commission was ordered to investigate the disaster. One of the recommendations made was for a new fire danger category, because “Extreme” was deemed insufficient to express what had occurred on Black Saturday. The new, more dire classification is “Catastrophic,” or “Code Red.” In a document labeled “What you should do,” the Rural Fire Service for the state of New South Wales has shared a list of directives. The directive for “Catastrophic” fire could not be more stark: “For your survival, leaving early is the only option.”  And in 2013, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology had to add two new colors (pink and purple) in order to accommodate new temperature extremes previously capped at roughly 122 degrees Fahrenheit.  This is not planet Earth as we found it. This is a new place—a fire planet we have made, with an atmosphere more conducive to combustion than at any time in the past 3 million years. Human activities—mainly the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas—have pumped so much CO2 into the atmosphere that the planet has warmed by more than 1 degree Celsius since the late 1800s. The closest comparison we have to current levels of CO2 is the mid-Pliocene Warm Period. With the seas and continents close to their current configuration, the mid-Pliocene offers a useful analogue for our near future. At that time, our ancestors were still in Africa. Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) was laying the groundwork for us in present-day Ethiopia, walking upright and experimenting with the crudest of stone tools. The Pliocene world was certainly habitable, but in a dramatically different way—not so much because of who lived in it, but because of the amount of atmospheric CO2. In Lucy’s day, CO2 levels were around 400 parts per million, commensurate with ours right now, but average temperatures were 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer, the current prediction for the end of the century. With far less year-round ice, global sea levels were about 80 meters higher than today. Currently, almost half of the human population lives in coastal areas.  In 2009, the year of the Black Saturday Fires, the Keeling Curve—a measure of atmospheric CO2 concentrations—hit 390 parts per million, a 40 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 over preindustrial levels.  By then, temperature records around the world were being broken on an annual basis as fire seasons lengthened along with the lists of damage done and fatalities caused. 2017 appeared to be a turning point. That year, atmospheric CO2 hit 405 parts per million, a 45 percent increase over preindustrial levels. It was not yet April before more than 2,000 square miles of grassland had burned across the Great Plains, from Kansas to Texas, killing thousands of cattle and at least seven people. That summer, wildfires spread across several countries in Europe, and Greenland experienced its first significant fire. More than 100 people were killed in Spain and Portugal alone when the first pyrocumulus clouds ever observed there supercharged seasonal wildfires into firestorms. That same year, New Zealand experienced unusually intense wildfires while Chile and British Columbia, two huge coastal territories in opposite hemispheres, suffered the worst fire seasons in their respective histories. California, too, had one of its worst ever, including what was, then, the most destructive fire in state history: the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, a catastrophic blaze that destroyed 9,000 structures, killed 44 people and generated winds strong enough to flip cars.  And fires have continued to ravage the state. In 2018, the Northern Hemisphere experienced its first fire tornado in Redding, California. The Carr fire tornado, an EF3 firestorm with 165-mile-per-hour winds and peak temperatures of 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, killed five people, tossed a Ford F-150 through the air, and tore hundred-foot-tall transmission towers off their concrete moorings. Veteran Cal Fire members had never seen anything like it.  Get the latest Science stories in your inbox.

(WGGB/WSHM) - Western Mass News is learning more about the fire that destroyed a barn on Old Warren Road in Palmer Tuesday afternoon.  Palmer Fire crews called in neighboring departments for help with water supply and manpower. It took crews hours to battle the flames, and luckily, no one was hurt.  In the end, crews were unable to save the barn. All that is left standing amongst the rubble is the silo.  “First arriving crews on scene found a fully-involved barn, threatening the house that was next to it,” said Palmer Fire Chief William Bernat.  He told Western Mass News that was when the crews’ priority shifted.  “Our first priority was to contain and protect the exposure of the house,” he said.  That proved to be a successful effort, and Chief Bernat told us that the house was not damaged in the fire.  Palmer Fire Department received mutual aid from multiple Hampden and Hampshire County crews, including from Warren, Wilbraham, Three Rivers, Bondsville, Brimfield, Monson, Ware, and Belchertown  Chief Bernat told us that the barn’s location made it particularly difficult to fight the flames.  “This fire is out of our hydrant district, so we have to bring all of the water to the scene, so it requires a lot of tanker trucks to haul the water from our local fire hydrant system,” he explained. “That’s one of the drawbacks of this fire today.”  Chief Bernat added that the barn was mostly used for storage, meaning no animals were impacted by Tuesday’s fire.

The quick response by Allen police officers, paramedics, and civilians helped save lives following the mass shooting that took place at the Allen Premium Outlets on May 6, according to Hoffman. “If it were not for the training police and fire personnel had, I don’t think we would have been as fortunate.”  Even before paramedics were able to reach the victims, police officers used tactical combat medical techniques to stop the victims’ bleeding.  Dispatched at 3:37, Allen paramedics arrived on the scene, donned ballistic gear, and formed Rescue Task Forces (RTFs) with local police, which enabled them to reach their first patients only 12 minutes later, at 3:49 p.m.  RTFs are combined police and fire units used to provide care while a threat may still exist. Almost all care was provided while radio traffic indicated that there was still a concern about more than one shooter.  “Allen police and firefighters have jointly trained on how to respond to this type of situation since 2018,” said Allen Fire Chief Jonathan Boyd. “Our mutual aid partners and local hospitals all implemented their emergency protocols as well.”  Behind the scenes, Allen dispatchers coordinated the response including five ambulances from Allen as well as ambulances responding from McKinney, Plano, Fairview, Lucas, Prosper, and assistance from Frisco and Princeton as part of mutual aid protocols.  “There is no question that the entire public safety and medical community came together on this tragic day, implementing plans and training that has gone on quietly for years,” said Boyd. “One of the most difficult things we must deal with as first responders is that no matter how much we train or how quickly we respond we were not able to help everyone.

According to South Whidbey Fire/EMS Deputy Chief Terry Ney, firefighters responded to the flames at the Grimm Road address around 9:12 a.m. on Sunday, June 4.  Due perhaps to the close proximity of the Bayview fire station, a dozen firefighters were able to get the blaze under control in less than 10 minutes, according to Ney.

In addition, a barn on the property also had some charring on its exterior.  Firefighters were able to contain the damage to one room of the house, which has long been empty of occupants.

And at the request of CTS Green Waste, Rural Metro Fire has stopped further fire suppression efforts.  Rural Metro says it spent a total of three days on scene at the fire that started on May 31. The agency says the property owner is now planning on bringing in heavy equipment and its own water supply to extinguish the remaining smoldering material.  According to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, smoke in the area is not hazardous and the air quality will be monitored in the area. If you have any concerns or complaints, contact ADEQ here.  The fire originally broke out after a spontaneous combustion of organic material. Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management representative Tiffany Davila said that fires like this are considered “longer-duration” but aren’t necessarily cause for concern.

Investigators have since left the scene of the blast, but there were there all night and into the early morning hours, figuring out exactly what caused an explosion inside one of the apartments.  So far, the only update put out by Oak Forest police still says the dynamite explosion is of unknown origin, but that's not what residents are saying as they point to what they believe are sticks of dynamite found just outside the blast area.  ""Everybody is wondering: who keeps dynamite inside their house?"" Saul Delagarza, who heard the explosion, said.  ""This is a veteran's building,"" Reggie Odell said.

While neither police, ATF agents nor the state fire marshal, who all came in on the investigation, would confirm dynamite was behind the blast, Odell, who is a Vietnam veteran, took a picture of what appears to be two sticks of dynamite found in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.

Oak Forest city leaders said an unknown explosion just after 7 p.m. Tuesday night inside one a small, single-story apartment sparked a fire on the 5100-block of 160th Street.  ""I was just walking out of the bathroom and I heard a loud bang,"" Delagarza said. ""It was an explosion. The first thing I saw when I ran out was smoke coming out of the whole building.""  ""The punch was so loud. It had my ears ringing. And that's why I thought it was in our own building. I thought it was right here. And then came outside and found out it was next door,"" said Odell.  Video from inside the unit shows the extent of the blast, holes in the ceiling, insulation ripped from the walls and windows blown out.  Two people, a man and a woman, were also seriously injured. They were taken to Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn for treatment.  ""The fire department pulled the people out, the one lady had multiple wounds on her, face completely torn up,"" Delagarza said. ""The gentleman was able to walk, his face was completely torn up.""

Since 2012, this annual fire engine training has been hosted at Camp Williams in Bluffdale, Utah. Camp Williams is the ideal location for hands-on training that accurately represents the topography, terrain, and vegetation present across public lands in the lower elevations of the western United States.  Fire engines are the backbone of initial attack fire suppression, and fire training is vital to the safety and success of firefighters. This specialized training program is an intensive week-long course designed to enhance the knowledge, skills and abilities of firefighters with approximately three to four years of wildfire experience and features scenarios with real-world situations to use best practices for engine operations. Crews learned suppression tactics, polishing readiness skills, changing a flat tire, mobile attack, and laying hose lines. Members of the media were also invited on a field tour to learn more about the training program and conducted interviews with BLM Incident Commander Tommy Braun and Unified Fire Authority Lead Paul Story.  The training workshop hosted firefighters from the Bureau of Land Management, USDA Forest Service, National Park Service, Park City Fire Department and Unified Fire Authority. This year, attendance at this training program expanded with firefighters joining from other states, including New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona.  “We value our partnerships with Camp Williams and Unified Fire Authority for helping make this training a great success,” said BLM Incident Commander Tommy Braun.  Successful interagency partnerships are essential in the firefighting community because wildfire knows no boundaries. Working together enables us to better leverage resources and respond efficiently to emergency situations. The fire engine operator training workshop helps ensure the effective use of engines for managing fires safely and efficiently during both initial and extended attack.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsbS5nb3YvYmxvZy8yMDIzLTA2LTA2L3dpbGRsYW5kLWZpcmVmaWdodGVycy10dW5lLXBvbGlzaC1za2lsbHMtZmlyZS1lbmdpbmUtb3BlcmF0b3ItdHJhaW5pbmctd29ya3Nob3DSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nobody really has a plan, and they’re trying to figure something out. So the state actually is hosting three of these classes - north, central and south,” Bolinger said. “I know for the Fort Wayne class, they had 30 spots open and had 63 people sign up. So, it’s a concern for everyone.”Mayor Joe Thallemer asked if this was at charging stations where the battery fires were occurring.“No. Just scooters and cell phones and your electric cars. It’s all over the place, not necessarily at charging stations, just when they’re being used. When a car is involved in an accident,” Bolinger answered.Thallemer asked what was the answer and was it to just let the batteries burn.“Honestly, right now, some of the things I’m reading, if it crashes out in the country and catches fire, let it burn. If it’s sitting right here in front of City Hall, we have to do something with it. A lot, a lot, a lot of water is what it takes because of the way the batteries break down and then start the next cell on fire because that’s what they are - just individual cells in a big pack and you have to keep it from lighting up the next cell,” Bolinger said.There’s a few other possibilities, but that’s why he’s going to the class - to try to figure out what the Warsaw-Wayne Fire Department will do in those situations.“We have a lot of lakes,” City Councilman Mike Klondaris said.Thallemer said he would like a report back after Bolinger goes to the class, and Wayne Township Trustee Jeanie Stackhouse agreed.“It’s really so we can develop a best practice on what to do with them,” Bolinger said. “We’re very blessed that we don’t have the issues like some bigger cities where you have these lithium scooters bursting into flames in high-rise apartments or anything like that. But it’s the future and we’ve got to learn to deal with it.”The board approved all the travel requests.CARES (Community Assistance, Resources, Emergency Services) Director and EMS Chief Chris Fancil gave the board his monthly update on the CARES program.Referring to the June CARES flyer put together by CARES Coordinator Mikaela Bixler, Fancil said, “You can kind of see we’re still going down the same road we’ve been going down. A lot of community resource navigations. The sheriff’s office did a referral. We actually even did a referral for North Webster just because they had used every resource they could to deal with a situation where a lady was suffering from some mental illness issues. So Mikaela went out to see what she could do to help, and then that ended up being a Bowen Center/CARES collaboration to try to help that situation get resolved.”He said they had 12 new callers and 23 follow-ups in May.CARES will be hosting the National Alliance on Mental Illness “In Our Own Voice” at Warsaw City Hall Council Chambers, 102 S. Buffalo St., Warsaw, from 4 to 5:30 p.m. Thursday, June 8.“Really excited about that. The whole idea of that is to try to break down the stigma of mental health issues. We’re going to have some virtual speakers talking about their journey through the mental health process and what that looks like, how it’s affected them and how they’re trying to get their way out of that situation. The goal of that eventually would be to put together some local support groups that could help some folks,” Fancil said.By July 1, he reported they’re hoping to have the CARES resource website up and running.Thallemer said, “That’s been a significant effort on the CARES program’s part, as well as the rest of the community. I know Fellowship Missions was involved in that. Who else?”Fancil responded they’ve tried to involved the schools a little bit, they’ve been out to see the K21 Health Foundation a few times and they’ve sent out multiple requests for information so it all can be put together.“It’s pretty exciting really. As I said when we started that, we found everybody had a list and all the lists were only partially complete and most of them had a lot of not-in-business-anymore resources,” Fancil said. “The key to this is, if somebody is brave enough to ask for help, we want that resource to be there. So that’s why we’re putting this together. That’s the key.”He said they think it will be a really successful program.Board member Brandon Schmitt asked about the 12 new callers and who were they calling in to. Fancil said they were calling in to the CARES phone at 574-453-7901 or email at [email protected] . They’re also getting more referrals from the community as well, he said.In her monthly report for Lutheran EMS, Alicia Mediano said in April they were notified that their Mobile Integrated Health Program with their car seat safety program was nominated for an award by the Indiana EMS Association. In May, she said they found out that was awarded. Not only was that awarded, but a staff member also was awarded the Dispatcher of the Year Award. That person works for Lutheran part-time as an EMT as well.“Just very good representation of the care that this community is given from Lutheran EMS throughout the year.

With it brought 32,427 incidents in 2022, which is the highest in the organization’s history.  “This year was the busiest year we’ve ever experienced in the history of our organization over 32,000 runs. Fire calls were up over 12%, EMS calls are almost up by 5%,” said Chief David Hoback.  The continued demand for emergency services has grown for Roanoke Fire-EMS, which has impacted travel time.  “We look at structure fires out the door to front of the property, four minutes or less 90% of the time, we did meet that this year. However, trying to get all the apparatus there for the first alarm assignment, which is three engines and two ladders, we were off by a percent. Because we had 7 second alarm fires, one third alarm fire, we had some significant fires, those were only missed by maybe 45 seconds each time, it really wasn’t a huge difference. But you just got to expect some of that, especially when you have that increase in volume that you’re dealing with. Same thing for the EMS side our critical incidents we’re up this year. So we didn’t meet our benchmarks, we were down a couple of percent.”  Hoback said they are working to meet the challenge. Starting by studying where calls are coming from and where they can strategically place new vehicles to respond.  “We are getting a new ambulance down at the Mecca station down on 460, station 14, that will help enhance some things in that area that will get infused capacity into our system so we’re not stressed.”  A returning issue for the department is staffing.  “This whole year, we worked in a negative staffing profile, we were 28/29 people down in the field. We’re just now starting to get some of that infusion back but with the new people come new challenges because 50 to 60% of our people have less than five years tenure. So we really got to start growing our workforce, maturing theming, training them and setting them up for the succession that we’re going to need them to be in as they grow to be officers in the future.”  With time of the essence, Roanoke Fire-EMS and emergency organizations in the region are looking at ways speed up the hiring process.  “In looking at our physical abilities test, we know the one that we had before, it took eight weeks before we could even make an offer and we were losing people in eight weeks. So we’ve now through regionally both Roanoke County, Salem, all decided that we’re going to go to a different system. ...We got the station two construction project, we took down the Budget Inn on Williamson Road and we’re going to start the a and e work on that. And then we just got a lot of things that we’re going to start looking at as redefining our business model.”  Hoback said addressing all these challenges is a three to five year process.  “What may have worked five years ago, it’s not working in today’s environment. And we’ve got to be mindful that everything from how we train people to how we recruit people to how we bring people up in the organization, all that’s going to be looked at and take organizations input. It’s the men and women down here at the station level that really have that type of knowledge, take their input and then figure out what the right direction is.”  Copyright 2023 WDBJ.

(June 6, 2023) – Chicago Fire FC fell 4-1 to the Houston Dynamo in the quarterfinals of the 2023 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Ill. on Tuesday Night.  Chicago had the first dangerous chance of the game in the ninth minute when Arnaud Souquet found Xherdan Shaqiri on the right side. Shaqiri served a ball to the far post for Brian Gutiérrez, who couldn’t reach it in time, but the rebound bounced to Miguel Navarro inside the box. The Venezuelan defender took a shot that forced Andrew Tarbell to make a save.  Houston opened the scoring with a penalty kick in the 12th minute when Amine Bassi sent a powerful shot high and to the right of Spencer Richey. Houston scored again in the 33rd minute when Chase Gasper sent a long ball behind the defense for Aliyu Ibrahim, who ran onto it and carried it toward goal, where he placed it just inside the left post.  Souquet scored his first Chicago Fire goal of the year in the 40th minute after the team earned their first corner kick of the game. Shaqiri sent a precise cross into the right side of the box where the Frenchman redirected it with his head to the inside of the left post.  After finding its opening goal, the Fire started to gain momentum in the final third and had two strong appeals for penalty kicks in the second half. The first chance occurred when midfielder Gastón Giménez’s shot appeared to hit a Houston defender on the arm inside the 18-yard box. Shortly afterward, the Fire had an even stronger appeal for a penalty when Gutiérrez was clipped inside the box by goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell in the 52nd minute, but both appeals were waved off by the center referee.  With the Fire pushing its way back into the match, Houston would score twice against the run of play in the 59th and 74th minutes, respectively, to seal the victory and advance to the semifinals.  NEXT MATCH: Chicago returns to the lakefront to host the Columbus Crew in MLS play at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, June 10 at Soldier Field. The match will serve as the Club’s annual Pride Night and will feature special events, a Pride flag giveaway, and activities planned to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community. The match will be broadcast on Apple TV+, and transmitted locally in English on 890 WLS-AM and in Spanish on TUDN 1200 AM.  Notes:  Defender Arnaud Souquet scored his first career goal for the Club.  Midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri recorded his second assist in Open Cup play and his fifth across all competitions with the Fire.  Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup rosters are limited to 18 players, unlike 20-player Major League Soccer rosters.  The Fire lined up against Houston with the same XI that faced Austin FC in the Round of 32 on May 24 at TQL Stadium.  Forward Kei Kamara started for the third time in the 2023 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, playing in his 17th U.S. Open Cup game (10 starts).  Xherdan Shaqiri and Brian Gutiérrez once again teamed up from the outset to back up Kamara and guide the attack.  Maren Haile-Selassie and Federico Navarro earned their fourth 2023 U.S. Open Cup starts, while Gastón Giménez, Mauricio Pineda, Arnaud Souquet and Miguel Navarro all earned their third start of this year’s tournament.  Captain Rafael Czichos started in the backline for the second-straight Open Cup match.  Goalkeeper Spencer Richey backstopped the group from the outset for the fourth-straight 2023 Open Cup match.

Both recent and upcoming hot and dry weather, largely focused on the northern tier of the country, is driving the uptick in fire danger.  A wet winter and cool spring have suppressed wildfire activity across much of the West. Although acreage burned nationwide remains well below average so far this year, that may begin to shift in June. Recent intense heat waves may usher in an early fire season in the Pacific Northwest, which had a drier-than-normal winter. Fire danger has escalated in Michigan this past week, while a “flash drought” could develop in parts of the Midwest and Northeast.  A sneak preview of the risk the Northeast faces emerged Tuesday as the National Weather Service declared a “critical” fire danger in southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey because of low humidity, drought, gusty winds and the possibility of dry thunderstorms that unleash lightning but little rain. The Weather Service believes it’s the first time it has raised concerns about dry thunderstorms in the Northeast.  New Jersey has already seen multiple blazes erupt this spring.  A hot and dry Pacific Northwest  Along the northern tier of the West, fuels are quickly becoming more flammable and snow is melting rapidly.  Advertisement  “Despite it being only early June, vegetation is very dry [due to] our lack of precipitation,” the Weather Service in Seattle tweeted on Monday. “Fire danger will remain elevated through midweek.”  A red flag warning is in effect for the western slopes of the Cascades until 10 p.m. Tuesday, with elevated fire conditions possible over a larger swath of Washington.  ⚠️The Red Flag Warning has been expanded northward across the western Cascades through 10 PM this evening due to continued dry conditions. Minimum relative humidity values will once again drop below 30% this afternoon over much of the area. 🔥#WAwx pic.twitter.com/qX4iEDQdOD — NWS Seattle (@NWSSeattle) June 6, 2023  Parts of Washington and Oregon saw their hottest and driest May on record, according to Dan McEvoy, a climatologist at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev.  Snowpack also dramatically declined in May; areas that started the month with near or above normal snow water content were severely depleted by early June. Heightened wildfire potential is forecast for parts of the Pacific Northwest into September.  Michigan wildfires and fire danger  The Great Lakes states are the primary area of concern for fire danger in June. The zone of high-pressure plaguing Canada this spring has been oscillating into the region, bringing unusual heat.  Advertisement  Over the weekend, a wildfire near Grayling, Mich., burned about 2,400 acres and forced evacuations. It was 90 percent contained as of Monday, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.  “We’ve had very little rain over the last four weeks,” said Jeff Zoltowski, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gaylord, Mich.  The region is mostly forested, populated with jack pines that require wildfire or prescribed burns to open their cones and release seeds.  “They want to burn … but when it doesn’t rain for weeks on end, that leaves us in a bad spot,” he said.  A red flag warning is in effect until 9 p.m. Tuesday for parts of lower Michigan, with wildfire danger remaining high to extreme “all week long,” the Weather Service said. Record-breaking heat, wind and low humidity led to extreme conditions this past week across the state.  Fire danger is still Extreme throughout the state, and @NWSGaylord has issued a red flag warning. ⁰⁰Be careful out there, no open burning of yard debris and always have water on hand if you have a camp/cooking fire.    Drench, stir, and drench it again when done. pic.twitter.com/KBP1LBT3tV — Michigan Department of Natural Resources (@MichiganDNR) June 6, 2023  “If we stay in this dry pattern, it isn’t just the timber — grasses can start drying out or curing,” said Stephen Marien, a meteorologist and fire weather program manager for the Eastern Area Coordination Center in St. Paul, Minn. “I think we’re already seeing that — that’s what is unusual.”  Advertisement  The landscape is usually lush in early summer with more frequent precipitation from passing weather systems. Fire potential tends to be higher in spring before grasses turn green and then again in the autumn when leaf litter covers the ground, he said.  “East of the Mississippi, summertime is usually our down period,” he said.  ‘Flash drought’ possible in Midwest and Northeast  According to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor, there was a “huge expansion” of abnormal dryness over the last week from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and into New England. Drought is expected to develop or worsen in these areas in June.  Some parts of the Midwest, such as Michigan, northeast Ohio and parts of Wisconsin, have had less than a quarter of their normal precipitation over the past 30 days, while nearly the entire region is under 75 percent of normal, according to Beth Hall, director of the Midwestern Regional Climate Center.  “Technically, a rapid intensification of drought is already occurring in some areas,” she said in an email. “This is attributed to no or very little precipitation occurring for an extended period that is coinciding with above-normal temperatures and low humidity.”  The culprits again are unusual and persistent zones of high pressure in the middle of the continent that has been blocking any significant influx of moisture.  Advertisement  “There are several low-pressure systems that are going to move through the region, but if the atmosphere stays dry enough, we may not see too much in the way of precipitation and those ridges will quickly return,” she said.  Conditions in the Mid-Atlantic have also been very dry, especially in Pennsylvania, where some spots saw less than 10 percent of their normal precipitation last month.  While the northern fringe of the Northeast is forecast to see above-normal wildfire potential in July and August, that fire risk could expand south, contract or disappear altogether, depending on summer rainfall.  “The weather patterns east of the Mississippi are more dynamic,” Marien said. “So wildfire outlooks can change quickly.”  Jason Samenow contributed to this report.

"fire","2023-06-05","Not Discerned","{""SubletteCounty"", ""Wyoming"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T18:03:29","CHEYENNE — Wildfire season can cause concern for the general public, especially considering the increase in damage done by fires in the West. In spite of this, the state of Wyoming is confident in its ability to manage fires this season.  During a press briefing Monday, officials from state and federal agencies discussed the expectations and resources available for the upcoming fire season.  The National Significant Wildland Fire Potential Outlook has indicated that Wyoming is expected to have an average to normal fire season.  “The extra snow and moisture from this winter and spring is expected to help buffer the higher- than-normal temperatures that are predicted for this summer,” Interim State Forester Kelly Norris said. “As summer continues, and our fuels in the grasslands and in the mountains dry out, we expect to see an uptick in fire activity, especially in the late summer and into the fall.”  The event informed the public of the resources that the Wyoming State Forestry Division, Wyoming Rural Firefighters Association, state of Wyoming, Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service have access to when fighting fires this season.  “It makes such a difference to have you and the cooperation that we’ve established over the last several years,” Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon said when addressing the U.S. Forest Service, BLM and other federal partners.  All speakers made the point that between the resources of the agencies and collaboration with the public, fires can be contained or easier to contain once they break out.  “I think it’s important that everybody who enjoys Wyoming outdoors also remember it’s their responsibility to make sure that fires are out, and that they don’t do anything that will cause a fire,” Gordon said. “Fires are dangerous; we’ve lost far too many people.”  Gordon referred to the loss of BLM Colorado Craig Interagency Hotshot crew member Collin Hagan, who died on Aug. 11, 2022, fighting the Big Swamp Fire near Oakridge, for whom the attending crowd took a moment of silence.  “The number one goal is safety,” Wyoming BLM Director Andrew Archuleta said. “Safety of our public and safety of all of our wildland firefighters.”  Archuleta encouraged people to remove fuels from around their homes and respective properties to minimize risk.  “How can the public help?” Archuleta said. “Well, by cleaning fuels away from your home if you live in the urban interface, be fire safe, have an evacuation plan.”  Archuleta said that cooperation had led to the training of 900 local firefighters last year; they hope to train more than a thousand this year. They were also able to transfer three fire engines from BLM to rural fire departments.  The U.S. Forest Service has also been able to use federal funds to reduce risk of wildfires. USFS has partnered with BLM and the Casper airport to renovate an existing facility in order to load larger tankers and decrease response time.The Casper facility is expected to be fully operational by the 2024 fire year.  Collaboration between agencies limits concerns about whose fire it is to manage and allows for quicker response. Archuleta said that the response of rural firefighters makes all the difference.  The partnerships that they’ve built help the rural firefighters, as well, said Shad Cooper, the fire chief fire warden for Sublette County and president of the fire advisory board for Wyoming Rural Firefighters Association.  “The communities don’t really care what color the fire truck is,” Cooper said. “What they care about is that we respond, and we’re there to help our communities and minimize the impact and try to keep the unwanted fire small.”  Wyoming can also receive and give aid to neighboring states, should they require more resources. Uniquely, because of the 29 million acres of private land in Wyoming, the state has an emergency fire suppression account. Counties can apply for aid if they need support after a difficult fire season.  “It’s going to be a wonderful Wyoming summer,” Gordon said. “Hopefully, we will not have a bad fire season. But if we do, we have the tools, cooperation and personnel to do our best to make sure Wyoming stays safe.”  This story was published on June 6, 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHA6Ly9uZXdzbGouY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvd3lvbWluZy1leHBlY3QtYXZlcmFnZS1ub3JtYWwtZmlyZS1zZWFzb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","{""Claremont"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-06T19:06:17","Last winter, an apartment fire in Claremont, N.H., destroyed all of Levi Blake’s possessions, with the exception of two: the flag presented to Levi’s family at the funeral for his father, Vietnam War U.S. Army veteran Levi Leo Blake Jr., and Levi Jr.’s dog tags.  Levi Jr., a member of Claremont American Legion Post 29, died in 2009. His son, a member of Sons of The American Legion Squadron 29, still remembers what it felt like when he realized the flag had survived the fire.  “Goosebumps. That’s the first thing that comes to mine,” Levi said. “The fact is, everything in that fire was a 110-percent total loss. The flag case burned around the flag, but the flag didn’t burn. You figure it would. That flag shouldn’t have survived, but it did.”  Later on, Levi mentioned to members of Post 29 that his father’s flag had survived, but the display case had not. He asked whether or not something could be done to clean the flag.  “I said, ‘Bring it in,’” Post 29 honor guard commander Dennis Shea Jr. said. “When he brought it in, it was in a plastic bag, and it was soaking wet and smelled like a fire, obviously. We took it upon ourselves, (Post 29 Commander Steve Blish) and I, to take possession of that flag and told Levi not to worry about it, that we would have it cleaned and that we would get a new display case for him. And when did that, we would refold it.”  Shea said one of Post 29’s members, Joe Upperman, runs a series of laundry and dry-cleaning businesses in the area and cleaned it multiple times to make the flag presentable.  With Memorial Day approaching, Shea said the decision was made to return the flag to Levi during the post’s public observance of the holiday. “We could have done it two weeks before, but in order to have the whole honor guard there, and to present the flag, fold it and then present it to (Levi) with a crowd around, it seemed more appropriate to do it that way,” Shea said, adding that being able to give the flag back to Levi felt good.  “It was really emotional,” Shea said. “I’m usually the one in the honor guard that presents flags when there’s no military contingent available for a veteran’s funeral. So anytime I present a flag to a family member, it’s emotional.  “But this one was a little special in its own right because of the story and being involved with it from the beginning. And then being able to give this gentleman back his father’s casket’s flag, it’s special.”  It also was a special moment for Levi. “I felt beyond grateful and blessed,” he said. “Knowing that (the flag) is the only thing besides my father’s dog tags that survived the fire, I just know I was blessed. And I’m grateful for The American Legion. They’re just really good people, and I’m thankful for them.  “I don’t really know how to explain it, to be honest. I know my dad’s still with me, and I strongly feel that.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2lvbi5vcmcvZmxhZy8yNTkxNzEvZmxhZy1zdXJ2aXZlZC1maXJlLXJlLXByZXNlbnRlZC1mYW1pbHktdmV0ZXJhbi1pdC1ob25vcmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Brittany Kirksey, a mother of two, was inside sleeping in her Sunnyvale Lane home Sunday morning. Her boyfriend began coughing on the smoke, and he woke her up and told her it was time to get out of the house.  “The smoke was choking him and he got up and trying to wake me up like, ‘hey there’s smoke in the house!” recalled Kirksey. “He gets up to see, and the whole kitchen is already on fire by then. And he got me like, ‘Hey, the house is on fire. We got to go!'”  Kirksey and her boyfriend were able to escape the fire, and Mobile Fire Rescue arrived around 4:15 a.m. and put out the flames.  Kirksey walked WKRG through her home as reminisced her priceless memories.  “I had my diploma and stuff up there and my pictures,” said Kirksey as she pointed out what used to stay on the walls of her living room.  The living room led to the kitchen.  “This is my kitchen,” she pointed out. “This is where everything started.”  As she led WKRG through the home, she showed her living room, her dining room, her son’s bedroom and her bedroom.  “This is the room,” said Kirksey. “This is my room, I miss it.”  “It was just so scary,” she said remembering the fire. “I called 911. I didn’t know what to do.”  She shared what’s left of her home, still trying to save the last bits of pieces she was able to hold on to.  “Some things didn’t get burned, but from water damage and smoke damage, it ruined them,” Kirksey said going through her daughter’s bedroom.  Kirksey said her two children were spending the night at their cousin’s house, so they were not home at the time of the fire. She’s just glad that she, her boyfriend, and her dog were able to make it out safely.  Kirksey’s family has been without a home for the past two days, and she says it’s been difficult for them to go day by day.  “It’s hard,” said Kirksey. “I don’t even really know how I’m getting by. And I’m just gonna say it’s because of God. I’m just going day by day. I have my kids. I try to be strong for my kids, that’s why I’m not crying right now, I’ve shed so many tears. Face was swollen. But we’re just going day by day. I got to figure it out.”  “I’m feeling good,” said McKenslei Kriksey, Brittany’s 9-year-old daughter. “I just miss my home.”  “It’s a blessing that all my cousins are safe,” said Bryson Goldsmith, their cousin.  Brittany says she’s received a lot of support from the community, and that’s helping her get by.

The fire spread to other parts of the home.  “So pretty significant damage in the kitchen area.

Understory burn operations are scheduled to start on Wednesday, June 7, and may continue through June 16. Timing of the burn operations will depend on weather conditions, air quality, resource availability and onsite observations.  The public is advised to use caution when encountering firefighters working on the roadways and be prepared to stop for firefighters and emergency vehicles. Smoke may be visible from Nevada City, Camptonville and the Upper Ridge area near the North Columbia and North Bloomfield areas.  “This treatment is part of the ‘Inimim Forest Restoration Project, a multi-year partnership to improve forest health and resiliency, and reduce hazards that can fuel wildland fire,” said Acting Mother Lode Field Manager Jeff Horn. “These efforts will protect communities in the wildland-urban interface and improve fire resiliency.”  Understory burning will consist of approximately 150 acres in the area of Jackass Flats Road and Macnab Cypress Road in the ‘Inimim Forest. The prescribed fire has been prepared for understory burning through close coordination with the Yuba Watershed Institute, which performs mechanical treatments with crews and machinery to carefully thin dense hazardous tree covers and underlying brush to improve forest health.  The BLM, along with its partners, has an important role to play in reducing the threat of wildland fire on public lands across the United States. The prescribed burn is being done as a joint effort of the BLM, CAL FIRE, North San Juan Fire Department and the Yuba Watershed Institute. The burn is being closely coordinated with the Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District.  The ‘Inimim Forest is nearly 2,000 acres of BLM-managed public lands intermingled with private land on the San Juan Ridge, a 30-mile-long narrow ridge ranging from about 2,500 to 3,800 feet elevation between the South and Middle Yuba rivers.  Updates on this prescribed burn will be provided using the #RxBurn by the BLM through its social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter. For more information on the prescribed fire, please call the Mother Lode Field Office at 916-941-3101 or email the office at BLM_CA_Web_ML@blm.gov.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsbS5nb3YvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9ibG0tY29uZHVjdC1wcmVzY3JpYmVkLWZpcmUtaW5pbWltLWZvcmVzdC1uZXZhZGEtY291bnR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And while the pleasant temperatures are welcome, the dry conditions pose a fire risk.  Chardon Fire Chief Justin Geiss says it’s a dangerous time and we have to take precautions, to lower the chances of brush fires.  “With the lack of rainfall we’ve had, everyone has enjoyed the sunshine but unfortunately all the grass and leaves have become dried out and is very susceptible to catching fire,” he said. “Most of the time brush fires start from someone that’s burning something that shouldn’t have been burning in poor conditions, whether it be too dry or too windy and it generally gets away from them,” said Geiss.  The State Fire Marshall says open burns are not allowed during the months of March, April and May between 6am and 6pm.

"fire","2016-05-01","Not Discerned","{""WoodBuffalo"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}","2023-06-06T09:00:56","There was the instant that a clear blue sky was obliterated by “a towering black cloud shot through with streaks of orange and seething with flames,” transforming a sunny spring day into a long, dark night. There were the sounds of car tires, gas tanks and propane-fueled grills detonating in awful synchrony as the fire ripped through tightly packed neighborhoods. There was the spooky view from a nanny cam as flames tentatively lapped at a window before incinerating the entire house.  It is a gripping yarn, though the storytelling is at times slowed by Vaillant’s wanderings. There’s a painstaking history of the use of bitumen over the millenniums. There’s a discourse on the quasi-spiritual nature of fire in its many forms, which eventually meanders into a meditation on oxygen and human breathing. There’s a lengthy rehashing of the roots of climate science, activism and denialism.  With a few poignant exceptions — including the story of a Fort McMurray welder named Wayne McGrath, who valiantly tries to fight off the blaze and his own demons — “Fire Weather” lacks many memorable human characters. But Vaillant fills that void with an unforgettable protagonist: fire itself.  A raging wildfire is hard to fathom for anyone who has not stood in its path. Vaillant is clearly in awe as he lovingly details 009’s inner workings and apocalyptic fallout.  The forest surrounding Fort McMurray consisted largely of black spruces that were dripping with flammable sap. As the tall trees ignited, the fire inhaled oxygen from below. That spawned powerful and sustained winds that screamed up toward the treetops and then gusted embers and sparks hundreds of yards out from the fire, fueling its relentless growth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDYvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L2ZpcmUtd2VhdGhlci1qb2huLXZhaWxsYW50Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Based on criteria set forth in the county’s request for proposals, the Sonoma County Fire District proposal scored the higher of two proposals submitted to the county. The fire district’s base rate for ambulance transport was $800 lower than the other proposal.  Sonoma County Fire District promised to provide better wages and benefits to paramedics and emergency medical technicians than they currently receive. The fire district also has promised to improve staffing levels and provide better working conditions than the current ambulance agreement. The fire district has also committed to deploying more ambulance personnel and more ambulance units, while reducing staff workloads.  Based on the scores and the recommendation of the director of the Department of Health Services, the Board of Supervisors unanimously authorized the execution of a five-year contract with an optional five-year extension, which begins on Jan. 16, 2024.  “The Sonoma County Fire District came through with a very attractive proposal, and we’re confident that the district, with its dedicated paramedics and EMTs, will be outstanding community partners,” said Supervisor David Rabbitt, a member of the board’s EMS Ad Hoc Committee. “We look forward to working with the fire district as it assumes ambulance operations in central Sonoma County.”  American Medical Response, which currently operates ambulance service in EOA-1, has assured the county that it intends to continue to provide ambulance service until Jan. 15, 2024.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.  It’s important to keep in mind that electric vehicles are statistically less likely to catch on fire than gasoline-powered vehicles.  But electric vehicle fires can still happen, and sometimes they are worth noting as they have at times been traced back to battery problems leading to recalls, like in the case of the Chevy Bolt EV or, more recently, the Jaguar I-Pace.  Now we have learned of a Rivian R1T electric pickup truck catching on fire while charging at an Electrify America station in Mill Valley, California, last night.  A photo of the aftermath was shared on Reddit (via Thewildkin):  Interestingly, the battery pack doesn’t appear to be the problem here, but the damage indicates that the fire may have started around the charge port of the vehicle, which is located on the front driver side.  We contacted Rivian for a comment on the situation, and the company says that it is investigating the situation:  We are aware of the incident, and we are conducting a full investigation. Nobody was harmed, and at this time, it does not appear that the vehicle’s high voltage battery was involved.  We also contacted Electrify America, and we will update the article if we get a response.  Electrek’s Take  Obviously, this is being investigated and we are going to need more details. It could be the connector that got overheated. It could be a problem with the charge port. It could be a lot of things.  But a silver lining for Rivian is that despite what appeared to be a significant fire on the vehicle itself, it didn’t reach the battery pack. That’s fairly impressive.  It’s not only good for safety, but it will also help understand what happened with this vehicle since it is not burnt to a crisp.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMy8wNi8wNi9yaXZpYW4tZWxlY3RyaWMtcGlja3VwLWNhdWdodC1maXJlLXdoaWxlLWNoYXJnaW5nLWVsZWN0cmlmeS1hbWVyaWNhLXN0YXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Forest Fire Service staff say they will remain on the scene and continue to monitor control lines until ""significant precipitation occurs to ensure public safety.""  Officials say the cause of the fire remains under investigation.  All roads have reopened around the area.  This is a breaking news update. The story below is from a previous Action News report.  Chopper 6 was overhead Tuesday as smoke billowed from a wooded area of the township.  No injuries have been reported.  Roughly 75 firefighters responded to battle the terrain in Jackson Township, using bulldozers to dig trenches around the fire, hoping to contain it.  It's been a busy season for fire crews in New Jersey.  ""We've had nine major wildfires this season. Major wildfires are fires we consider to be 100 acres or larger.

Now its future is uncertain.  Over the last 80 years, The Old South Restaurant has been a staple in the Russellville community. Zach Summitt and his father took over nine years ago, he said the love of the place from the community made them want to become owners.  “We saw potential and we could tell everybody wanted to come here, they just needed a reason to come,” Summitt said.  However, on Tuesday, officials with the Russellville Fire Department said they received a call at 12:30 a.m. from someone who passed by the restaurant and saw smoke. Officials said once they arrived on scene the fire had already started, and it was coming mostly from the front and back of the business.  Officials with the department also say with the assistance of 14 firefighters they were able to get it under control after four hours and left the scene around 10 a.m.  Summitt said barely anything was saved inside the restaurant and he is in shock about how bad everything looks. He says part of the pain is knowing how much it meant to the community.  “The restaurant was built in 1947, it’s been through several owners, but the building has stayed the same and the name has stayed the same,” he said. “People have grown up here, some of their parents ate on the way from the hospital after the baby was born they stopped and ate in the Old South.”  Officials with the fire department said the cause of the fire is still to be determined.  “We’re trying to figure out if they can restore our camera system to see what happened,” Summitt said.  He said he hasn’t had time to think about himself as most of his thoughts are about his employees.  “We’re still just trying to get through the day right now as far as next stops, but the Russ Bus is trying to raise money for our employees,” Summitt said. “We have about 50 employees with us who have no place to work.”  One of the employees is waitress Juliette Bowden who has worked at the restaurant for 5 years. She said she received a call about the fire and couldn’t believe it.  “We could see the smoke from miles away,” Bowden added. “It felt like a piece of me was taken.”  Bowden said for her it was more than just a job.  “I had so many customers that helped me throughout the way and workers they built me up and they were here for my entire adult life and made me who I am,” Bowden said.  She also said she has had many memories in the restaurant.  “My grandma worked here, my mom worked here, I remember as a kid playing in the big booth up front,” Bowden said.  She said the restaurant was a staple in the community and she’s heartbroken.  “This restaurant holds dear to so many people and it’s just gone within one night and there’s nothing we can do,” Bowden said.  Despite everything that has happened to the restaurant, Summitt pointed out that its spirit and resilience is shown by the sign that is above the business that’s still standing. He said as he watched fire crews work to tame the fire, his eyes kept going to the sign and is grateful it’s still there.

Oakland Fire Department Station 28 responded as soon as the alarm came in, in the middle of the night. The fire started about 12:30 a.m.  Oakland Fire Dept. Public Information Officer Michael Hunt said there were no injuries, but most of the building was engulfed and over 40 firefighters worked to put out the raging flames.  The clubhouse entryway, kitchen, bar, indoor and outdoor dining room all suffered extensive damage. There was no damage to the golf course or any vegetation around the building.  Once the sun came up, the smell of charred wood and debris permeated the entire entranceway to the clubhouse, scorched trophies melted in a case next to the front door. Both the indoor bar and restaurant, as well as the entire kitchen and outdoor patio were destroyed by the fire.  The Mediterranean-style architecture with its redwood beams and ceramic tile roof couldn’t withstand the heat of the flames, and by daylight the debris of smoking and charred ruins had patrons and staff mourning the loss of this public course.  The Lake Chabot Golf Course is owned by the City of Oakland, and operated by Touchstone Golf which manages operations and employs about thirty staff.  Although the Pro Shop didn’t catch fire, smoke damage destroyed all the merchandise, according to Bodhi Young, the Assistant General Manager.  Young shared the 18-hole course is celebrating its 100th year and is still planning to hold a celebration later in the year.  The Lake Chabot Golf Course has been challenging golfers for decades with its changing elevations and the only par 6 hole west of the Mississippi.  Dave Killingsworth and Clarence Trayvick walked around the building and surveyed the damage. Both are volunteer leaders who run the Junior Golf Academy, the only free youth program in the Bay Area that teaches kids how to golf.  Trayvick shared, ‘We’ve lost everything! Shoes, uniforms, computers, clubs, we had a t-shirt printer – that’s all gone! We have nothing to offer any new kids who join because we don’t have any shoes, clubs or equipment they need to get started.  Trayvick shared they’re hoping the golfing community and others will help them replace the equipment for the Youth Golf Academy, sharing they’re putting together a ‘GoFundMe’ page for replacing equipment.  Killingsworth has been a volunteer with the program for over twenty years and shared… ""We’ve lost a lot of memories, including pictures and memorabilia from previous cohorts of youth golfers.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources determined one campfire on private property near Lake Staley was the source of the wildfire, which burned more than 2,400 acres.  Another story:  The person responsible for causing the wildfire could face fines as well as the costs related to the suppression of the fire.    “It’s a little risky to speculate who is going to be charged with what,"" said Patrick Ertel, a public information officer for the Michigan DNR.    Ertel said there are many ways to determine what that cost could be, because every situation is different.  But it is not uncommon for law enforcement to issue citations to individuals for causing a wildfire.  ""Each person is keeping track of their time on the fire,"" Ertel said. ""It goes to specific coding, mileage, fuel, all of those things are accounted for.""  ""But as a fire really begins to expand and we bring in partner resources, we will begin to keep track of which resources are coming in, whose air resources are going to what Lake to pick up water, logistics, food, all of those things go into really supporting the suppression of the fire,"" Ertel said.  ""And more importantly, all of those things are costs to protect the safety of our firefighters and the safety of the public,"" Ertel said.  As of Tuesday, the Michigan DNR has reopened the roads and lakes that closed while crews battled the wildfire.    But even though they are open, officials ask that you stay away for your own safety.  ""We would really like people to avoid the area, our crews are still working out there, there [is] potential for trees to fall over, snags to hit the roadway,"" said Laurie Abel, a public information officer for the Michigan DNR.  ""It's still dangerous even though it's not still orange and flaming, that ground is still hot,"" Abel said.    Ebel stresses that you should avoid the wildfire area until there is rainfall.  The Michigan DNR said they haven't seen dry conditions like what northern Michigan is experiencing in nearly 25 years.  ""This is an unprecedented situation that were having,"" Ertel said. ""The values that we monitor daily for fire risk, the moisture in the pine needles, the wind speed, the air temperature, relative humidity, they're showing values we haven’t seen in over 20 years.""

(KTVZ) -- With nearly two-dozen wildfires tackled allready this year -- about half of them escaped debris burns -- fire season on all lands protected by the Oregon Department of Forestry’s Central Oregon District will begin Friday at at 12:01 a.m., the agency announced Tuesday.  Starting this Friday, the district’s fire danger level will be “Moderate,” and the Industrial Fire Precaution Level (IFPL) will be I (one) in MH-4 and MH-1 (Hood River and Wasco counties).  Earlier this year, fire managers were optimistic regarding this year’s fire season due to the higher-than-normal snowpack. However, ""due to the decline in spring rain, rise in temperatures, and windy conditions, the fine fuels in the district have begun to dry significantly,"" ODF said in it's announcement.  So far this year, the district has experienced 22 fires, of which half were escaped debris burns. Debris burning is the No. 1 cause of human-caused fires. As we move into fire season, debris burning will be prohibited. ODF recommends covering your pile until the rainy fall when it’s safer to burn.  With that in mind, the Central Oregon District will begin implementing restrictions based on fire danger level. Moderate fire danger level restricts the following activities:  • No debris burning, including piles and debris burned in burn barrels.  • No fireworks on or within 1/8 of a mile of ODF-protected land.  • Exploding targets and tracer ammunition, or any bullet with a pyrotechnic charge in its base, are prohibited.  • No smoking while traveling through or working in any operation area.  In addition to the fire prevention requirements Under IFPL I (one), the following will go into effect:  • A Firewatch is required for a minimum of one hour during breaks and at the end of the operational period.  Additional fire restrictions or regulations may apply depending on the various fire risks throughout the fire season.  The Oregon Department of Forestry urges residents to not become complacent in wildfire prevention. The less human-caused fires we have, the less the district’s resources are strained.

Canada is dealing with a series of intense wildfires that have spread from the western provinces to Quebec, with hundreds of forest fires burning. The smoke has traveled into the United States, resulting in a number of air quality alerts issued since May.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a poor air quality alert for New England, a day after parts of Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota received a similar advisory. Last week, U.S. officials as far south as Maryland, Baltimore, Virginia and Pennsylvania reported being impacted by the wildfires.  Closer to home, fire crews responded to a brush fire in Plymouth Township, Luzerne County, around midday Tuesday, according to WBRE/WYOU.  A day earlier, crews responded to brush fires near Route 33, closing the highway's southbound side near the Monroe/Northampton county line.  More:Brushfires along Route 33 between Snydersville and Wind Gap back up traffic  Related:Dry weather in Poconos raises fire risk, affects farmers  Eastern Pennsylvania is under a red flag warning Tuesday, meaning that “critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now, or will shortly due to a combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. Any fires that develop may quickly get out of control and become difficult to contain,” according to the National Weather Service.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection declared a Code Orange Air Quality Action Day for fine particulate matter for Tuesday for multiple parts of the state, including Berks, Lehigh and Northampton counties.  Air quality alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution — known as “PM 2.5” — which can irritate the lungs.  Who should be careful?  Exposure to elevated fine particle pollution levels can affect the lungs and heart.  The air quality alerts caution “sensitive groups,"" a big category that includes children, older adults, and people with lung diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Kids, who often are encouraged to go out and play, “are more susceptible to smoke for a number of reasons,” said Laura Kate Bender, the lung association's National Assistant Vice President, healthy air. “Their lungs are still developing, they breathe in more air per unit of body weight.”  What can you do for now?  It's a good time to put off that yard work and outdoor exercise. If you go out, consider wearing an N95 mask to reduce your exposure to pollutants.  Stay inside, keeping your doors, windows and fireplaces shut. It's recommended that you run the air conditioning on a recirculation setting.  “If you have filters on your home HVAC system, you should make sure they’re up to date and high quality,” Hill said. “Some people, particularly those with underlying lung disease, or heart disease, should consider investing in air purifiers for their homes.”  The Associated Press contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2Nvbm9yZWNvcmQuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNi8wNi93aWxkZmlyZXMtaGF6eS1za2llcy1wb2Nvbm9zLWhvdy10by1zdGF5LXNhZmUtbW9ucm9lLWxlaGlnaC1ub3J0aGFtcHRvbi13YXluZS1waWtlLWNvdW50eS1wYS83MDI5NDk5NDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The forecast computer model in the map above shows where the thickest smoke is likely to be near the earth’s surface over the next several hours.  The level of particulate matter in the air from smoke on Wednesday was considered unhealthy from Detroit to Philadelphia, according to AirNow, a source for air quality data.  Air quality Good Hazardous Source: AirNow By Matthew Bloch and Bea Malsky  Roughly 150 fires were active in Quebec alone, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Many of these fires started days ago, if not weeks. But a storm system swirling off the coast of Nova Scotia in recent days forced the smoke from these fires south into the United States, and then east — toward some of the most densely populated areas in the country.  The weather pattern is expected to persist for the next several days, with haze likely to continue across the region.  A satellite image captured on Tuesday showed a large storm system in the right hand corner as fires burned, sending reddish-brown clouds of smoke across Canada and the United States. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Many of the fires in Quebec were ignited by lightning earlier this month, but above-normal temperatures and dry conditions have helped fuel outbreaks across the country since May.  Tracking wildfires in Canada Burned area Recent fire hotspots Source: Canadian Wildland Fire Information System By Martín González Gómez and Madison Dong  Fire season in Quebec and Canada usually starts in May, slightly before the typical start of fire activity in the United States. As of Tuesday, there were more than 400 fires actively burning throughout Canada, the country’s interagency fire center said, with 240 of them burning out of control.  So far there have been few major U.S. fire outbreaks.

More than 100 wildfires currently burning in Quebec are causing hazy conditions across much of the state. An Air Quality Health Advisory is in effect until tomorrow for Long Island, New York City Metro, Lower Hudson Valley, Upper Hudson Valley, Adirondacks, Eastern Lake Ontario, and Central New York regions.  ""When many New Yorkers walked outside today, the hazy skies caused by wildfire smoke were hard to miss,"" Governor Hochul said. ""New York State experts are monitoring our air quality every day to ensure New Yorkers have the latest information about current air quality in their communities and what they can do to protect themselves. I encourage New Yorkers, especially those sensitive to air quality, to take appropriate steps to help limit risk of exposure.""  Earlier today, a media availability was held with DEC and DOH experts to provide updates on the effects of the ongoing wildfires on air quality. Last week, a DEC Forest Ranger and expert wildland firefighter was deployed to assist with efforts to contain wildfires raging in eastern Canada. New York State often deploys highly trained wildland firefighters to help battle fires as part of interstate and international firefighting compacts. The DEC Forest Ranger is serving as the crew boss of an interstate Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact crew comprised of firefighters from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine to assist efforts in Nova Scotia. This is the first time a New York State Forest Ranger has been deployed to Canada since wildfires in Quebec in 2005.  Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos said, ""When these historic wildfires started in Canada, DEC meteorologists were closely monitoring weather patterns and other data to help inform air quality forecasts. DEC and our partners at the Department of Health will continue to keep the public informed with the latest on air quality alerts, and I also continue to hope that all the responding firefighters, including our Forest Ranger, remain safe while working to get these blazes under control.""  Acting State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, ""Given the heightened air pollution levels we are seeing across much of the state, the New York State Department of Health recommends that New Yorkers limit strenuous outdoor activity to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. People who are especially sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of pollutants, including the very young and those with pre-existing respiratory problems such as heart disease or asthma, should avoid spending time outdoors, if possible. Those who experience symptoms or have symptoms that worsen should consider consulting their personal physician.""  DEC and DOH issue Air Quality Health Advisories when DEC meteorologists predict levels of pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter are expected to exceed an Air Quality Index (AQI) value of 100. Today's advisory is due to fine particulate matter carried by the wind from the wildfires. The AQI was created as an easy way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale, with a higher AQI value indicating a greater health concern.  Fine Particulate Matter  Fine particulate matter consists of tiny solid particles or liquid droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. PM 2.5 can be made of many different types of particles and often come from processes that involve combustion (e.g. vehicle exhaust, power plants, and fires) and from chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  Exposure can cause short-term health effects, such as irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Exposure to elevated levels of fine particulate matter can also worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. People with heart or breathing problems, and children and the elderly may be particularly sensitive to PM 2.5.  When outdoor levels are elevated, going indoors may reduce exposure. If there are significant indoor sources of PM 2.5 (tobacco, candle or incense smoke, or fumes from cooking) levels inside may not be lower than outside. Some ways to reduce exposure are to minimize outdoor and indoor sources and avoid strenuous activities in areas where fine particle concentrations are high. Additional information on ozone and PM 2.5 is available on DEC's website and on DOH's website.  Here in New York, dry conditions along the Lake Ontario Plains, Leatherstocking Region, and Southern Tier are resulting in a ""high"" fire danger rating. A high fire danger means all fine, dead fuels ignite readily and fires start easily from most causes, including unattended brush and campfires. Fires may become serious and controlling them difficult unless attacked successfully while still small. The remainder of New York State is at a moderate level of fire danger. An updated fire danger map is available on the DEC website. While the statewide burn ban is no longer in effect, brush burning should only be done when absolutely necessary. Burning garbage or leaves is prohibited year-round in New York State.  Open burning is prohibited in New York, with these exceptions:  Campfires or any other outdoor fires less than 3 feet in height and 4 feet in length, width or diameter are allowed.  Small cooking fires are allowed.  Ceremonial or celebratory bonfires are allowed. Disposal of flags or religious items in a small-sized fire is allowed, if it is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation.  Only charcoal or dry, clean, untreated or unpainted wood can be burned.  Fires cannot be left unattended and must be fully extinguished.

The fire, which has been burning since May 27, is still out of control and covers an area of 24,980 hectares, or about 250 square kilometres.  But Scott Tingley, the director of forest protection for the provincial Department of Natural Resources, said Monday the rain has allowed firefighters to move from a more indirect approach of battling the flames to a direct approach.  He told CBC Radio's Information Morning Nova Scotia that before the rain began, when conditions were tinder-dry, temperatures high and the fire was dangerous to be close to, crews were building fire breaks to try to slow the spread of the blaze.  Now that the fire is starting to cool down, crews are working on the fire perimeter, removing anything that could fuel the flames, patrolling and identifying potentially problematic areas.  Tingley said the status of the fire will remain out of control until officials are confident there are no lingering hotspots that could flare up when the weather warms up again.  Barrington warden: 'We will rise again' Duration 0:58 From a local comfort centre, Barrington warden Eddie Nickerson said rebuilding the community ""isn't going to be a short process.""  The province said Monday there are about 150 Department of Natural Resources (DNR) firefighters working at the site and more than 40 from volunteer and municipal fire departments. Four helicopters are on the scene, as well as four water bombers from Montana.  In addition to the rain that fell throughout the weekend in the area, 15 to 25 millimetres are expected during the day Monday, with another five to 10 millimetres on Monday night and two to four millimetres expected on Tuesday, according to the Environment Canada forecast.  'Everybody's happy to see the rain'  Shelburne resident Louise Lindsay said the rain has buoyed the spirits of residents and firefighters.  ""Everybody's happy to see the rain,"" she told Information Morning Nova Scotia on Monday.  ""Things were encouraging yesterday because things that they had put out and would go back to check were actually still out, whereas on Saturday they went back to check places where they've been putting out hotspots and they were burning again. So the rain is making a difference.""  Lindsay said firefighters were treated to a surprise dinner at the Birchtown community hall over the weekend, where they got a standing ovation, a sit-down dinner and lobster rolls to go.  Schoolchildren in the area, who have been out of school for about a week, made posters that were put up along the power poles leading to the fire station to say thank you to the firefighters for their work, Lindsay said.

When I first moved here it caught on fire; I didn’t know it was vacant,” Thomas said. “I just recently found out that it was vacant and how it keeps catching fire; I have no clue.”  It’s a question that still lingers for many in the area.  “We had some neighbors that lived over there and they were pretty cool but some stuff started going on over there and they ended up leaving and left it vacant,” said Legion Johnson. “The landlord started clearing out the property and about a week or so later the house caught fire for the first time.”  Recently becoming vacant, Johnson said the fire itself was the least of her worries because of the quick response by the fire department.  “That was the main concern just making sure that the windows were all closed down and blocked off, because it would get pretty smokey,” she said. “That was more concerning than the actual fire itself.”  But still, for many neighbors, vacant houses are far too common in Rochester.  “I just want the city to get all the abandoned houses together,” Latisha Thomas said. “I’m actually trying to move and it’s hard to move because half of Rochester houses are abandoned.”  There’s no word on how the fire started.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoZWMuY29tL2xvY2FsL2hvdXNlLW9uLW1hbHZlcm4tc3RyZWV0LWRlc3Ryb3llZC1ieS1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Firefighters were initially dispatched on reports of a person trapped and unable to get out of the building.  Multiple people were assisted out of the three-story apartment building when Dayton firefighters arrived.

Read more  The Philadelphia region is under both flood advisories and fire watches on Tuesday, courtesy of the moon and what is becoming an ever-more-impressive dry spell.  “It’s kind of unusual,” Sarah Johnson, the warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service Office in Mount Holly, said Monday with perhaps a dash of understatement.  In addition, even in the absence local fires, Canadian wildfire smoke may reappear in the skies Tuesday, and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Council has issued a “code orange” air quality alert.  » READ MORE: The Philly region had an amazingly dry May  Advertisement  Unfortunately for those about up to here with watering their lawns, the flood advisories have nothing to do with the absent rains, although the weather service sees at least an outside shot at showers late Tuesday.  A flood advisory is in effect from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. for all the counties in the region bordering the Delaware River as nuisance tidal flooding is possible, the result of the tug of the waning, but still nearly full, moon, which is at about 95% fullness Monday. The weather service said the waters could make some roads impassable for a while.  More minor flooding was expected at the Shore, where an advisory was posted until 2 a.m.  Johnson said after two days of onshore winds that drove water landward, the moon still might have enough pull to set off minor flooding Tuesday night, but “the farther out we get from the full moon the less confidence we have.”  Rain is unlikely to contribute anything to flooding, given the growing precipitation deficits after Philly’s driest May on record.  The dryness will, however, contribute to the fire potential, she said. The foliage is getting dried out, humidities are forecast remain low on Tuesday, and the weather services has issued a fire watch for just about all of Pennsylvania and New Jersey until 8 p.m.  In addition, potentially fire-fanning wind gusts of up to 25 mph are expected.  In any event, wildfire smoke from the blazes in eastern Canada is forecast to filter across the region Tuesday morning, according to the interagency Air Quality partnership. It said that most of the smoke should stay above the surface but that fine-particulate levels “will become elevated at times.”  » READ MORE: Canadian smoke visited the region last week  While those levels shouldn’t be a threat to the healthy, they could be harmful to those with respiratory and heart conditions, thus the “code orange.”  The alert applies to Philly and its neighboring Pennsylvania counties.

Lawrence Stephen Chain, 58, faces felony counts of attempted arson and criminal endangerment as well as a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief in Flathead County District Court following his June 4 arrest. He remains held in the county jail.  Chain was identified as the man behind the wheel of a Toyota Tundra that drove recklessly twice through emergency responders as they battled the fire, according to court documents. The Tundra struck the mirror of a fire truck, ran over a hose and forced at least one first responder to jump out of the way, court documents said.  Deputies with the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office initially investigated the case as driving under the influence. Chain, court documents said, struggled to exit the truck and displayed poor balance. While he gave off the odor of an alcoholic beverage, he also smelled of fuel, court documents said.  Meanwhile, evidence of suspicious activity at the scene of the fire — first reported about 3:20 a.m. by a newspaper delivery person — was emerging. According to court documents, firefighters found an apparent trail of gas poured along the fence to the house as well as on the deck and the home itself. Emergency responders also discovered a gas can on the handrail of the deck.  Surveillance footage at the home showed a man with longer hair and wearing a sport coat breaking a mirror and windshield wipers of the Helena Flats homeowner’s silver Ford car, court documents said. While the homeowners failed to recognize the man, investigators did, according to court documents.  Chain, court documents said, also had a torch in plain view on the pickup’s passenger side floorboard and a gas tank in the bed.  Chain allegedly agreed to speak with authorities after receiving a Miranda warning. He admitted to vandalizing the Ford because he believed it to be his ex-partner’s vehicle, court documents said. Likewise, he believed his ex was renting the Helena Flats home and set it ablaze to “send her a message,” according to court documents.  His ex had recently filed for a temporary restraining order against him, he allegedly said.  While further investigation determined that Chain’s ex did own a vehicle matching that found at the scene, the vandalized Ford was not hers, court documents said. His ex similarly was not living at the Helena Flats home, according to court documents.  If convicted of attempted arson, Chain faces up to 20 years in Montana State Prison and a fine of $50,000. Felony criminal endangerment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars and a $50,000 fine. Misdemeanor criminal mischief is punishable by up to six months in county jail and a $1,500 fine.  Chain’s arraignment in district court has not yet been scheduled.

He got on the roof of a back porch and broke a window, using the hose and then a second hose from a neighbor to spray inside, tamping down the flames, Riddle said.  “The back room was engulfed,” he said.  Fire, police and an ambulance arrived, which was when Riddle said he was told to get off the roof.  A message left for the Wind Gap Fire Company Monday morning was not immediately returned.

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-06T01:31:00","New research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) shows that moving sheds farther away from homes is one way homeowners can reduce wildfire risk.  It makes sense that auxiliary structures on a property – whether they be sheds or gazebos – can fuel a fire. But researchers wanted to know how far these structures should be from homes in order to significantly reduce the risk of fire spreading from one structure to another.  Alexander Maranghides, a fire protection engineer at NIST, said the relationship between a building's exposure and the degree that it's fire-hardened with fire-resistant building materials ""will ultimately determine if a house ignites and gets lost or doesn't.”  The team of engineers looked at several factors that could impact a shed's ignition, including its construction materials, size, orientation and the amount of flammable materials contained inside. They also factored in environmental variables like temperature and wind speed.  The study found that when a small wooden or steel shed was placed 15 feet away from a home, it could reduce the heat exposure by more than a factor of three. Any closer than that is in the “danger zone,” according to Maranghides. Additionally, when a wooden shed was replaced with a steel shed, the fire spread was limited significantly.  “By making proper choices of construction materials and the minimum structure separation distance, you can significantly reduce the fire hazard,” said Shonali Nazare, a materials research engineer at NIST. “We cannot regulate what people are going to put in their shed so our recommendations on the materials, sizes or distance are critical.”  But the engineers caution that these results don't apply to all scenarios. The engineers ran their tests with fire-hardened homes on flat ground. Homes that are located on slopes or made of other materials might need more separation from corresponding sheds.  Maranghides said bigger tends to mean riskier when it comes to home-shed wildfire prevention.  “The bigger the shed, the bigger the exposure, the farther you need to move the shed back,” Maranghides said.  But moving a shed away from one home could put it closer to a neighbor’s home, a situation that's more likely in high-density communities. To help homeowners, NIST put together a Hazard Mitigation Methodology that focuses on three general solutions: reduce, relocate or remove.  “What we're seeing now is we really have to do everything if we want to be protected against those severe disasters,” Maranghides said.  While moving individual sheds to fire-safe distances is important, Maranghides stressed that communities need comprehensive wildfire resilience strategies that include regulations on how homes are built in the first place.  “You cannot pick and choose what you address, and you have to do this at a community level,"" Maranghides said. “Fire doesn't care about parcel ownership. My shed will burn your house down and your fence will ignite ten parcels downwind.”  Whether through homeowner associations or local governments, Maranghides said more shed regulations need to be put in place to reduce the risk they can pose.

The Heat had lost the two games that their opponent scored more efficiently by double-digits.  But they won Game 2 by three, pulling off another fourth-quarter comeback. Over their 20 playoff games, the Heat have been outscored in the first, second and third quarters, but are a plus-90 in the fourth. And they now have four playoff wins (second most in the 27 years for which we have play-by-play data) in games they trailed by at least eight points in the final period.  Over the 20 games, the bigger difference between the first-through-third-quarter Heat and the fourth-quarter Heat has been on defense …  Heat efficiency by quarter, 2023 playoffs  Period OffRtg DefRtg NetRtg +/- 1st quarter 110.9 111.5 -0.7 -1 2nd quarter 115.1 117.2 -2.1 -11 3rd quarter 116.3 117.6 -1.3 -12 1st-3rd 114.1 115.4 -1.4 -24 4th quarter 121.6 102.4 +19.3 +90  OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions  DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions  NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions  But Game 2 was all about offense. The Heat scored 111 points on just 86 offensive possessions, including 36 on 20* in that incredible fourth quarter.  * They made only 19 trips down the floor, but the final second of Game 2, after Caleb Martin rebounded Jamal Murray’s shot for the tie, counted as a possession in the official numbers.  The Heat shot 17-for-35 (48.6%) from 3-point range on Sunday and have now outscored the Nuggets by 35 points from 3-point range in the series. It’s a make-or-miss league and the Heat have worked hard to get their 3-point looks. They have really been moving the ball. But the Nuggets have also helped them by just not being very sharp defensively.  Here’s a bit of film on how Miami made (at least) 17 3s for just the eighth time this season (104 total games)…  1. Caught unawares  The Heat’s first 3-pointer of Game 2 came on their second possession, via a relatively simple out-of-bounds play. Max Strus inbounded the ball over the top to Bam Adebayo above the free throw line, then curled off two screens to a left-wing 3.  The issues for the Nuggets started with Jamal Murray, who seemed to be unaware that his man (Gabe Vincent) was setting the first screen. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope got caught in both screens, Murray wasn’t in position to switch the first one, and Michael Porter Jr. was late to switch out after the second one…  2. Switch confusion  Two minutes later, Strus got his second 3, via an empty corner pick-and-pop where he set a screen for Vincent. Because it was a small-small screen, it should have been a simple switch for the Nuggets. But while Caldwell-Pope switched onto Vincent, Porter stayed there, and Strus was wide open when he popped to the corner…  Later in the first quarter, Strus set an empty-corner screen for Jimmy Butler. Murray switched it, but Aaron Gordon stayed with Butler for just a beat, and Strus got another corner 3.  The Heat were 6-for-9 on corner 3s in Game 2, just the fourth time in the Nuggets’ last 62 games (the first time since their Game 4 loss in the first round) that they’ve allowed more than five corner 3s.  “We were by far our least disciplined game of these 16 or 17 playoff games,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said after Game 2. “So many breakdowns. They exploited every one of our breakdowns and scored.”  3. Rebounding 101  The Nuggets out-rebounded the Heat in Game 2. But every possession counts, and another Miami 3 came early in the second quarter when Haywood Highsmith came from the weak-side corner to grab an offensive board. Gordon didn’t get a body on him, and the ball eventually found Vincent on the right wing…  The Heat had just 11 second-chance points in Game 2, with nine of those 11 coming from beyond the arc.  4. 19 seconds of good defense is not enough  The first play of the fourth quarter started as a good defensive possession for the Nuggets. Christian Braun did a nice job of hedging a Duncan Robinson back-screen for Adebayo, closing out on Robinson, and then chasing him over a hand-off…  But an Adebayo screen dislodged Murray and a Vincent drive got the Denver defense scrambled. Murray was in decent position to contest a Robinson 3, but he overreacted to Robinson’s pump fake, allowing the Miami sharpshooter to step into another open look …  According to Second Spectrum tracking, 27 of the Heat’s 78 field goal attempts, an abnormally high 35%, came in the last seven seconds of the shot clock on Sunday. But after shooting 3-for-17 in the last seven seconds of the clock in Game 1, they were 13-for-27 (including 7-for-16 from 3-point range) in Game 2.  5. Same play, two breakdowns  That Robinson 3-pointer was followed by a possession where he scored five points. So the Nuggets were on high alert when the Heat ran a “delay” action on their third trip in the fourth quarter. With Adebayo handling the ball up top, Vincent set a screen for Robinson out of the left corner.  Reading the defense (Braun trailing him), Robinson cut into the paint instead of heading toward a hand-off from Adebayo. That pulled in Bruce Brown, who didn’t want to give up a layup. Braun tried to peel off, but it was too late, and the Heat had another wide-open corner 3…  The Heat ran the same exact action on the next possession. This time, Brown didn’t switch and Robinson got the layup with Jeff Green arriving a little too late from the weak side.  This was surely a tough film session for the Western Conference champs to endure. They lost this game by just three points, having made a lot of mistakes. But the Nuggets didn’t necessarily get here with defense. They ranked 15th on that end of the floor in the regular season, the sixth lowest ranking for any team that’s reached the Finals in the 27 years for which we have play-by-play data.  Only one of the other seven teams that have made the Finals after ranking lower than 12th defensively in the regular season has won the championship. That was the 2000-01 Lakers, who were the defending champs and flipped the switch defensively in the playoffs.  With the series moving to Miami for Game 3 on Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC), the Nuggets will have to find a switch themselves.  * * *","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy9maW5hbHMtZmlsbS1zdHVkeS1udWdnZXRzLWhlYXQtZ2FtZS0y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Courtesy Town of Oak Island)  OAK ISLAND — One home on 41st Street in Oak Island is a total loss to a fire, while its two neighboring properties also experienced structural damage from the flames.  No humans were injured during the fire, however, four dogs owned by the family at 318 NE 41st St. died during the incident.  The source of fire is still undetermined.  The Oak Island Fire Department were dispatched to the fire Sunday night and arrived six minutes later, but the entire home was already consumed by the blaze. The fire was contained within 45 minutes.  The department was assisted by Boiling Spring Lakes Fire and Rescue, Brunswick County EMS, Southport Fire Department, St. James Fire Department, Sunny Point Fire and Rescue, Supply Volunteer Fire Department, Winnabow Volunteer Fire Department the Oak Island Police Department.  In the announcement of the fire’s outcome, Oak Island also addressed concerns over water pressure in town hydrants. However, the town stated “at no point was the amount of pressure or volume flow from the fire hydrants an issue,” hindering response.  “The Fire Department has received questions over reported concerns of water pressure from the fire hydrants, and if they hindered response to this fire,” the town wrote in a press release. We believe this is due to misinformation spread on social media, as a result of conversations heard from bystanders at the scene.”  According to the town’s rundown of events, the first arriving unit began fighting the fire with an on-board water supply of 500 gallons, while a second unit worked to connect a supply hose from the hydrant. While the hydrant was being connected, the on-board water supply was exhausted, which caused a brief delay in water flow until the hydrant could be charged. The response actions listed above would simply not have been possible without regularly tested and properly working hydrants, according to the town.  Hydrant testing and maintenance is performed every year by the fire department in October and November. This is required by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to maintain the current Fire Protection Classification Rating.  Have comments or tips?

Casey said that when firefighters responded they had been told of a possible trapped person in the building, but that nobody was located during a search after the fire was extinguished. The cause of the fire has not been officially determined, and is still under investigation, Casey said.  Though the official investigation into the cause of the blaze is ongoing, Zulmarie Rodriguez, who lives in the first-floor apartment where the fire started, suggested that it was the result of a faulty stove. Rodriguez said at that time that they also had a cat that they were unable to get out of the house, and were waiting for firefighters to find it. After about an hour, a firefighter exited the building with Azrael the cat in his hands, scared, covered in soot, but very much alive and reunited with its owners after having hid somewhere in the house.  Nearby resident Nick Park said he was across the street from the house when he heard someone yelling that there was a fire, and he then observed smoke coming from the first-floor window. Another nearby resident had called 911, but when a response took some time, Park said he ran to get the attention of firefighters at the station just a few buildings down on West Sixth Street, who themselves responded to the scene.  Linda Silva said she was in her car on the corner of West Sixth and Boisvert streets when she saw the flames in her rearview mirror. After 911 was called, she said she went to give extra clothes to one of the building’s now displaced residents.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNS8yLWFsYXJtLWZpcmUtaW4tbG93ZWxsLWRpc3BsYWNlcy0xMi_SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5sb3dlbGxzdW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDUvMi1hbGFybS1maXJlLWluLWxvd2VsbC1kaXNwbGFjZXMtMTIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed the entire Valley in an elevated fire risk for Tuesday. The map outlook can be seen below.  Fire weather outlook from the SPC valid Tuesday, June 6, 2023.  There have already been numerous brush fires reported across the Valley the past couple of days due to the dry ground and gusty winds. Monday makes 16 days straight without any precipitation at the Youngstown/Warren Regional Airport, and officials are urging people to refrain from burning over the next couple days as more dry weather is in the forecast.  The risk for fires is easy to understand by looking at the forecast. On Tuesday afternoon, relative humidity values will be between 25%-30%, which means that the air will be dry. Additionally, wind gusts out of the northwest will be around 20-25 MPH, which can assist in the spread of fires.    Relative humidity values forecast by the Storm Team 27 Future Tracker for Tuesday, June 6, 2023.  Wind gusts forecast by the Storm Team 27 Future Tracker for Tuesday, June 6, 2023.  When is the last time there was a fire weather outlook? Interestingly enough, the last day there was an “elevated” fire risk in the Valley was back on April 20, 2023. This was during a 9-day long dry weather streak which featured multiple record breaking temperatures. However, this is not a very common weather event in our area.  Is there any chance of rain in the future to help with the fire activity? Unfortunately, there is little chance of any rain during the work week. There are slight chances of showers on Thursday and Friday, but that rain would do little to impact the growing rainfall deficit across the area. However, the best chance of showers in two weeks will be on Sunday, when a storm system is forecast to impact the Valley.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL3dlYXRoZXIvZWxldmF0ZWQtZmlyZS1yaXNrLWluLXRoZS1mb3JlY2FzdC_SAURodHRwczovL3d3dy53a2JuLmNvbS93ZWF0aGVyL2VsZXZhdGVkLWZpcmUtcmlzay1pbi10aGUtZm9yZWNhc3QvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 21 Road is now cleared to Snow Lake essentially widening the contingency fireline. A lot of slash was piled along the 59 Rd. after a similar operation. Crews have been chipping that debris and returning the biomass to the forest. Fire crews are patrolling and extinguishing hot spots along the contained fireline as necessary. Several small firing operations were conducted to better tie in the line and provide a buffer for private properties.  The primary operation of the day was firing along the southern edge of the fire. The goal is to create a continuous “straight” line, squaring up the southern and eastern flanks of the fire.

Resources have moved into the area to better evaluate the potential.  Weather: The next few days will begin sunny, with clouds building towards the afternoon. Overnight, an east push will slowly bring more surface moisture to the region, moving from east to west. The best chances for moisture will be for Tuesday. The higher moisture levels are expected to decrease smoke density.  Aviation Restrictions: ATemporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is still in place over the Pass Fire. All non-fire aircraft are restricted. This includes civilian drones. Unauthorized aircraft in the area will ground firefighting aircraft, hindering firefighting efforts.

Mason and Meridian Township have bans as well.  Chief Ball says dry conditions and the low humidity led to this extreme fire warning.  “What that does is makes the fire burn ten times as fast as what it would with the conditions we are facing. It makes it extremely dangerous for the firefighters they are out there in the heat battling a wildfire and with a fire that is burning very fast,” he said.  The U.S. federal government reports that 85% of all wildfires are caused by humans. Delhi is no different.  “Just recently in Edmonton over 300 acres started by a campfire. We had one yesterday again burn an acre, six cars and a camper all started by a campfire,” said Ball.  The chief says Delhi won’t be allowing any fires until the burn ban is lifted.  So what can people do to help?  “Taking away the brush that is sitting next to your house keeping your hedges trimmed just good landscaping and having a good water source nearby. Water hoses all around the house will help immensely,” he said.  The chief added that the best defense against a wildfire is a good offense.  “Have a plan for not just a fire inside your house but what happens if a wildfire encroaches your house do you have two ways out, do you have survival supplies in case you get stuck for an extended amount of time like a go bag.”  Before you have a campfire, or even use a grill, please check with your local fire departments to see if your city is currently under a burn ban.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndsbnMuY29tL25ld3MvbWljaGlnYW4taW4tZXh0cmVtZS1maXJlLWRhbmdlci1kbnItd2FybnMv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2xucy5jb20vbmV3cy9taWNoaWdhbi1pbi1leHRyZW1lLWZpcmUtZGFuZ2VyLWRuci13YXJucy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WBRC) - A home on Meadow Ridge Drive in Tuscaloosa caught on fire Monday morning.  Martin Hasse lived next door to the home and was waken up by a neighbor and the fire department.  “Suddenly there was a lot of banging on my bedroom windows,” he said.  Hasse said he had no idea what the commotion was until he stepped outside and saw the damage. The neighbor’s house was completely destroyed despite efforts from the Tuscaloosa and Duncanville fire departments. The fire also touched part of Hasse’s home, melting part of the siding.  “I was more in a state of shock. I grabbed the hose over here and started to spray the side of it down,” said Hasse.  The man who lost his house was not home at the time of the fire.  According to Holly Whigham, the Education Coordinator for the Tuscaloosa Fire Department, there is no clear answer as to what started the fire.  “Currently, the cause of the fire is under investigation and unknown at this time,” said Whigham.  “Definitely shocking. A new experience for me and I wasn’t sure if anybody was home and that was number one concern,” said Hasse.  And the number one relief on Meadow Ridge Drive Monday morning: no injuries. Neighbors are thankful they are talking about the loss of a home instead of a life.  “A house can be replaced. Siding can be replaced. People can’t,” said Hasse.

"fire","2016-12-02","Not Discerned","{""Hohoe"", ""Volta"", ""Ghana""}","2023-06-05T21:03:37","In the millions of years over which humans have been evolving, brain size has tripled, and behavior has become exponentially more elaborate. Early, small-brained hominins (members of the human family) made only simple stone tools. Later, brainier ancestors invented more sophisticated implements and developed more advanced subsistence strategies. As for behavioral complexity in our own eggheaded species, Homo sapiens, well, we went all out—developing technology that carried us to every corner of the planet, ceremonially burying our dead, forming extensive social networks and creating art, music and language rich in shared meaning. Scientists have long assumed that increasing brain size drove these technological and cognitive advances. Now startling new discoveries at a fossil site in South Africa are challenging this bedrock tenet of human evolution.  Researchers working in the Rising Star cave system near Johannesburg, South Africa, report that they have found evidence that the small-brained fossil human species Homo naledi engaged in several sophisticated behaviors that were previously associated exclusively with large-brained hominins. Describing their findings in three preprint papers that were posted on the server bioRxiv on June 5 and will be published in the journal eLife, they contend that H. naledi, whose brain was around a third of the size of our own, used fire as a light source, went to great lengths to bury its dead and engraved designs that were probably symbolic in the rock walls of the cave system. The findings are preliminary, but if future research bears them out, scientists may need to rethink how we became human.  H. naledi is a relatively recent addition to the pantheon of known hominin species. In 2013 and 2014 a team led by paleoanthropologist Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, now a National Geographic explorer in residence, recovered more than 1,500 fossil specimens belonging to at least 15 individuals from deep within Rising Star. The fossils revealed a hominin with an unexpected combination of old and new traits. It walked fully upright like modern humans do, and its hands were dexterous like ours. But its shoulders were built for climbing, and its teeth were shaped like those of earlier hominins in the genus Australopithecus, explains team member John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Most striking of all, H. naledi had a brain size of just 450 to 600 cubic centimeters. For comparison, H. sapiens brain size averages around 1,400 cubic centimeters. Berger and his team announced the discovery as a species new to science in 2015. Two years later they were able to establish the age of the fossils, dating them to between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago—surprisingly recent for a species with such a small brain and other primitive traits.  Controversy has roiled around H. naledi from the outset. The remains were found in parts of the cave system that are incredibly challenging to access today and that, as far as the team knows, were just as difficult to reach back when H. naledi visited. Hardly any bones of medium or large animals are known from the site, as might be expected if creatures, including H. naledi, unwittingly fell into the cave. And according to the discovery team, the site lacks any evidence that the bones were transported by rushing water. The implication, Berger and his collaborators argued, was that H. naledi individuals entered this subterranean cave system deliberately to deposit their dead. If that were the case, they must have used a light source—namely fire—to navigate Rising Star’s dark and treacherous tunnels, chutes and chambers. But mortuary behavior and control of fire have long been considered the exclusive purview of larger-brained hominins. Without any direct evidence of fire or deliberate interment of the bodies, the suggestion that H. naledi might have been surprisingly sophisticated, given its small brain size remained firmly in the realm of speculation.  A crosshatched design is one of many engravings that may have been made by H. naledi on the cave walls in Rising Star. Berger discovered the engravings in July 2022. Credit: Berger et al., 2023  Subsequent work in the cave has materially strengthened that case. Berger and his colleagues report evidence for burials in two locations in Rising Star, the Dinaledi Chamber and the Hill Antechamber. H. naledi corpses were intentionally placed in pits that had been dug in the ground, and the bodies were then covered with dirt. In one case, the corpse was arranged in the pit in a fetal position—a common feature of early H. sapiens burials. In another H. naledi burial, a rock that the team describes as stone-tool-like was found next to the hand of one of the deceased. If it is indeed a stone tool or other manufactured artifact, it’s the only one that has been discovered in association with H. naledi to date.  After finding the burials, Berger and Hawks set their sights on searching Rising Star for more clues to the culture of H. naledi. And this time Berger wanted to explore the cave system himself. A large man, he had never been able to get into the parts of Rising Star where the H. naledi remains are found—he just couldn’t fit through the tightest points on the route into the fossil chambers. Berger hired a team of skinny scientists to do all the exploration and excavation that led to the initial research publications. Then, last summer, after losing 55 pounds (25 kilograms), Berger finally ventured into the heart of Rising Star. And that’s when he noticed soot on the ceiling and charcoal and bits of burned bone on the floor, which indicated that fire had been used in the cave. At the same time, team member Keneiloe Molopyane of the University of the Witwatersrand, who was excavating another part of the cave system known as the Dragon’s Back, found a hearth. “Almost every space within these burial chambers, adjacent chambers and even the hallways ... has evidence of fire,” Berger says.  Berger also made another, arguably more astonishing discovery that day in Rising Star: designs carved in the cave walls. The engravings consist of isolated lines and geometric motifs, including crosses, squares, triangles, X’s, hash marks and scalariform, or ladderlike, shapes. The markings were deeply incised into dolomite rock in locations close to the burials in the Dinaledi Chamber and Hill Antechamber. Dolomite is a particularly hard rock that measures around 4.7 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness—“about halfway to a diamond,” Berger says. That means the engravers would have had to put considerable effort into making these marks. The engraved surfaces also appear to have been smoothed with hammerstones and polished with dirt or sand, according to the researchers. And some engraved areas gleam with a residue that may be the result of the rock being repeatedly touched.  If H. naledi, with its small brain, was burying its dead, using fire as a light source and creating engravings, then scientists may need to rethink the connection between brain size and behavior. We need to step back and try to understand “the social and community emotional dynamics that allow this kind of complex behavior without having this big, complex brain,” says team member Agustín Fuentes of Princeton University. Taking this perspective makes us think about human evolution in a new way, he adds, and reminds us that “we know a lot less than we thought we did.”  “It’s challenging our perceptions of what it means to be human, what it means to be intelligent enough to make art, what it means to communicate graphically,” says Genevieve von Petzinger, an authority on rock art, who was not involved in the new papers. Just 25 years earlier the conventional understanding was that Homo sapiens invented art in Europe 35,000 years ago. Over the past two decades researchers have uncovered evidence that our cousins the Neandertals and Denisovans made art, too. H. naledi had a much smaller brain than those hominins, though. Von Petzinger notes that the Rising Star findings are preliminary and that researchers have yet to carry out the detailed studies that will allow them to figure out “who was making what, where and when.” But, she adds, “I think as long as we approach this as being the start of a new and exciting conversation, then we’ve got nothing to lose by being open-minded about it.”  Some experts who were not involved in the new research think Berger and his colleagues are getting ahead of themselves. “I’m not convinced that the team have demonstrated that this was deliberate burial, i.e. the excavation of a shallow grave, deposit of a corpse in it and subsequent covering of that corpse with the sediment excavated,” says archaeologist Paul Pettitt of Durham University in England. A complete excavation of the remains would probably resolve the matter, he says, but the researchers’ “sensible” decision to leave some deposits intact for now means that “their data are partly investigated and, however impressive they are, sadly do not present a clear and unambiguous demonstration of deliberate burial.” Pettitt suggests that seasonal, low-energy movement of water in the cave system might have washed H. naledi’s remains into natural depressions in the ground.  Archaeologist Michael Petraglia of Griffith University in Australia thinks the researchers have made a good case for the burials, but he questions the claims that H. naledi was responsible for the engravings. One big problem is that scientists have yet to directly date the marks. The discovery team argues that there are no indications that any hominins other than H. naledi and modern cavers have entered the dark zone of Rising Star, where the fossil and archaeological materials have been found, and that the designs are therefore best attributed to H. naledi. Petraglia isn’t persuaded, however. “The evidence that Homo naledi made the rock engravings is weak. Though skeletal material and the engravings are in the same cave context, at present there is no way to directly associate them,” he says. The fire evidence is similarly problematic: the researchers have yet to publish dates for the material. “I have no reason to believe, at this stage, that Homo naledi controlled fire, and I await convincing scientific evidence to prove this is the case,” Petraglia says.  The team is working to obtain that evidence and more, including genetic material, which could reveal the relationships among the H. naledi individuals found at the site, for example. And the scientists are hoping to involve other researchers in their efforts as they think through how best to proceed with studying the wealth of material in the cave system.

Example video title will go here for this video  VANCOUVER, Wash. — Within the space of about two hours, firefighters in Vancouver responded to two fires that each threatened to spread toward nearby homes. Both temporarily resulted in evacuations.  The Vancouver Fire Department said that it first responded to reports of a brush fire on a hillside off the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail between Northeast Andresen Road and Northeast 86th Avenue around 2:15 p.m. on Monday.  ""Several witnesses calling 911 reported seeing flames approximately ten feet tall burning uphill through thick vegetation, being driven by strong winds,"" the agency said.  Fire units deployed from the trailhead off Andresen and began attacking the fire from below while more crews headed to the uphill side of the fire, working to protect homes along Northeast 16th Street.  The work was difficult due to thick brush, steep terrain and flames whipped into high activity by high winds. There were also several high-voltage overhead lines located just over top of the fire.  Ultimately, it took 17 fire units and about 35 firefighters to get the 2-acre fire under control. Crews with the Washington Department of Natural Resources responded to assist, with a firefighting helicopter placed on standby but never used.  During the firefight, authorities evacuated 12 nearby homes. They were allowed to return about three hours later, and there were no reported injuries.  The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Vancouver Fire Marshal's office.  While the response to the Burnt Bridge Creek brush fire was still going on, a second alarming fire broke out. A little after 3:30 p.m., callers on Northeast 56th Way near Andresen reported that several tall trees and a large shop had caught fire.  The flames were threatening several nearby homes, and they also had the potential to jump Andresen as the high winds pushed them east.  Vancouver Fire and Clark County Fire District 6 sent out a total of nine suppression units and six command staff. Authorities used a reverse 911 system to evacuate nearby homes.  With three engines pumping water continuously on the fires, crews were able to extinguish this fire with relative speed. Firefighters then surveyed the neighborhood to ensure that the wind had not spread it anywhere else.  All of the neighbors around this second fire were allowed to return to their homes as soon as the fire was out, and Vancouver Fire again reported no injuries.  ""Vancouver Fire would like to remind everyone to have a defensible space around your house,"" the agency said. ""Make sure the grass and trees near your house are trimmed. Make sure your gutters and roofs are clean and free of debris like dried natural vegetation.""

Syracuse firefighters responded to the call at 7:10 p.m. at 638 E. Division St., according to the Onondaga County 911 Center.  Smoke could be seen for miles pouring from the home.  When they arrived, firefighters saw heavy fire coming from the back of the house, Capt. Matt Craner, a spokesman for the Syracuse Fire Department, said. Firefighters first attempted to enter the house, but when they got inside, the boarded windows, doors and heavy flames caused them to fight the fire from the outside of the home, he said.  The home was abandoned and no one was inside, Craner said.  Syracuse Fire Chief Michael Monds, who was on the scene, said the fire spread quickly in the attic which was full of boxes, clothes, furnishings and other items. Part of the roof collapsed on the back end of the home, Craner said.  Craner said getting the fire under control was an intensive labor. Firefighters had to pull the boards off the windows and doors to create openings and move hoses and ladders to get in the best positions to fight the fire, he said.  Monds said they called in additional units to pull from a larger water main on Lodi and Park Streets due to low water pressure from the hydrants in the area.  Craner said he is unsure if anyone was injured during the fire at this time.  It took firefighters about 90 minutes to extinguish the flames, Craner said.  The home sustained fire, smoke and water damage, Craner said. The cause of the fire is being investigated, he said.  The house is a single-family bungalow built in 1890, according to county real estate records.  Syracuse firefighters work to put out a fire at a home at 638 E.

ATWATER, Calif. (KFSN) -- An early morning fire destroyed a family-owned business operating in Atwater since 1988.  First responders received calls of a fire at Atwater Feed a little after 1 am, early Sunday morning.  The business is located on Atwater Boulevard and Applegate Road.  ""Upon their arrival, they identified they had an active, well-established fire at the southwest corner of the building,"" said Cal Fire Atwater Battalion Chief Bobby Ayuso.  He said crews are still trying to clean up on Monday morning.  Pictures from its Facebook page show the family-owned business engulfed in flames.  The Merced County Fire Department also assisted with battling the fire.  Ayuso said early estimates of the damage are over $100,000. But that number is expected to rise as investigators go through the wreckage.  Ayuso said the building had been around for several decades, and this is a big loss to the Atwater community.  ""There is a lot of history with this building. So, it's definitely a hit to our community, and it's a prominent business owner in the area. We're very saddened that this happened,"" said Ayuso.  The fire is still under investigation. There is no suspect in custody, and arson does not appear to be a factor at this time.  Across the street, small business owner Christina Delos Reyes is devastated after seeing what's left of the business.  ""It just breaks my heart to see that everything they worked hard for, years, it's just now rubble,"" said Delos Reyes.  She said the owners are kind, always going out of their way to help people. And that kindness is also felt at her business.  ""We all look out for each other here. It's a small community. Atwater is full of small businesses, so if we look out for each other, it really helps out,"" said Delos Reyes.

Speaking at a  press conference under the protection of the County Fire Department roof, 1st District  Supervisor Das Williams was quick to address the precipitation outside: “Don’t be confused by a  drizzly day in June. We could have a big season before us.”    Part of preparing for that possible big season means adopting High Fire Season status, which  allows the county to receive the state funds necessary for an increased response. This will take  the form of a seasonal workforce that includes air crews, new fire engines, and more boots on  the ground. The Santa Barbara County Fire Department is working with multiple partners at the  city, county, and state level, and credit this collective effort with their ability to respond  effectively. “Fire has no political boundary. It affects everywhere and everyone. That’s why we  come and work together. it wouldn’t be possible otherwise,” said John Owens, chief for  CalFire’s San Luis Obispo Unit.    It’s not just up to the officials to keep the community safe. “It’s a shared responsibility; we all  need to do everything in our power to prevent these fires,” said 3rd District Supervisor Joan  Hartmann. The speakers all stressed the importance of clearing defensible space around  homes and being hyper-aware of fire-causing activities, which can be as simple as starting a  car too close to dry vegetation. The fire department will be conducting property inspections at  urban interface areas to make sure that zone regulations are being followed.    Santa Barbara County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig emphasized the Firewise program, which is  focused on community preparedness and response. “Go get your neighbor’s numbers; it’s that  easy,” said 2nd District Supervisor Laura Capps.

The fire did not displace anyone from their home.  According to Tipp City Fire & Emergency Services (TCFES) responded to 130 S. First St., on a report of a shed fire with flames showing and electric service wires exposed to the flames on Sunday, June 4, at 11:01 a.m,. The resident noticed the fire and immediately called 911, said a TCFES press release. The resident was met by fire units on scene and advised that he was OK. An active fire was located in the shed of the South First Street property owned by Jennifer R. Hartley, along the wood fencing and in the backyard toys on the backside of the house.  Upon arrival Engine 32 found heavy fire and smoke conditions in the back yard. The fire had already burned the electric service drop wire in two pieces and it was on the ground in the back yard. Engine 32 set incident command and crews performed fire attack and secured the perimeter simultaneously. The live wires prevented crews from going into the back yard and down the alley. The fire was originally dispatched as a miscellaneous fire involving a shed.  A mutual aid fire truck was requested by incident command and Troy Fire responded with Ladder 11. One TCFES person responded from home. The fire spread and involved the 130 S. First St. house, the garage at 126 S. First St., and a grass fire on the levy. The crews extinguished the fire and performed salvage and overhaul after Tipp City Electric dropped the live electric line and secured power.  Crews were on the scene for approximately two hours.  The fire is deemed unintentional by TCFES. The cause of the fire is unauthorized burning in a fire pit.  Damages are estimated a $20,000 to the property and $4,000 to the contents.  “Recreational campfires are permitted within the regulations located in chapter 92 of the Tipp City Code of Ordinances. As a reminder, at a minimum all recreational fires should be attended continuously. Burning for waste disposal is prohibited in the city of Tipp City,” said the press release.

The Chelmsford Fire Department responded to the blaze after an alarm was activated around 8:40 p.m. Crews discovered “a large volume of dark smoke” behind the plaza, leading firefighters to assume there was a working fire above the ceiling tiles, Fire Chief Gary Ryan said. After observing smoke migration through several units, Ryan said they entered the electrical room at the back of the plaza, which was the source of the fire.  “We were able to make entry into the room,” Ryan said, “and that’s when we found the cables that were charred.”  The department advised locals to avoid Summer Street and requested National Grid shut off the plaza’s power. The scene was cleared at 11:21 p.m. Sunday.  Power at eight of the plaza’s 25 businesses had yet to be restored as of Monday afternoon, Ryan said. That included Summer Street Grocers, restaurants Amici Trattoria and Herradura Vieja, Center Deli, gyms 9Round Fitness Chelmsford and Get In Shape For Women, Hairloom Studio and Paramount Plus Cleaners.  No one was injured in the blaze, but some of the storefronts incurred minimal damage from firefighters using forced entry and smoke infiltrating, Ryan said. The Westford Fire Department was initially called to the scene for possible “personnel search and rescue,” but they were not needed, according to alerts at the time.  Ryan said the cause of the fire is under investigation, and multiple parties are still “trying to figure out what happened.”  “It has the sprinkler system, which is the highest form of protection you can have,” Ryan said of Summer Street Crossing. “It has a fire alarm system, which is monitored, so that’s how we got the call … It’s a lot of cables. Trying to get in there, we had to wait for the smoke to clear.”  At around 2:30 p.m. Monday, Ryan and the Chelmsford Police Department were still on scene, partly “because a lot of people are coming by for their favorite places to eat,” Ryan said. The Department of Public Works also issued signage at the front of the plaza to notify residents of the situation, he added, and the Health Department and building inspector have assisted.  Officials placed the fire alarm system back into service shortly before 4 p.m. Monday, Ryan said.  “If you asked me yesterday, last night, I didn’t think we’d be in the position to be talking about businesses opening tomorrow,” Ryan said then. “A lot of people are pulling together. It’s been a long night, long day, but I think potentially we’ll have some businesses open tomorrow.”  Ryan said he was hopeful that the majority of businesses would be back up and running soon, pending inspections, and he anticipated employees would return Monday night to prepare for those inspections on Tuesday.  “The owners and management of these establishments have expressed their sincere appreciation for everyone’s support and understanding during this challenging period,” Ryan wrote in an email.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNS9lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWZpcmUtYXQtY2hlbG1zZm9yZHMtc3VtbWVyLXN0cmVldC1jcm9zc2luZy1sZWF2ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy13aXRob3V0LXBvd2VyL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wNS9lbGVjdHJpY2FsLWZpcmUtYXQtY2hlbG1zZm9yZHMtc3VtbWVyLXN0cmVldC1jcm9zc2luZy1sZWF2ZXMtYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy13aXRob3V0LXBvd2VyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The couple lived in the apartment with Bria’s three kids but thankfully this morning the children were staying at another place. Everything inside the apartment on Southwest Parkway was destroyed including all the computers and equipment the couple uses for their home-based media production and entertainment companies.  “Literally, you had DJ mixers, productions boards, keyboards, different things like that. Pretty much everything to run an entire media suite or production studio,” said Price.  The College Station Fire Department determined the origin of the fire was the horizontal vent that ran from the dryer to the outside wall near the front door. According to the National Fire Protection Association, these types of fires can be caused by improper cleaning and maintenance.  Consumer Reports has these four tips to help minimize similar risks in your home.  Bria and Branden say a big lesson learned from this tragedy is making sure that personal belongings are covered by insurance. It’s something they’re now urging other renters to review sooner than later.  “Make sure to check out your insurance policy and make sure it covers everything because just the one that you get through the apartments that they require to pay only covers their property.”  It’s common for apartment complexes to require insurance that protects the building and property but any additional insurance to cover personal losses is up to the tenants. The couple says when they first moved into the complex, they were aware of this and didn’t have much to insure at the time, but as their companies grew and they purchased more electronics, they admittedly failed to insure those newer belongings.  The couple is thankful they survived, and they’re thankful for the immediate help they received in the days following the fire but they admit, getting back on their feet has been tougher than they could have ever imagined.  “In the days and weeks that progressed I’m just going to be frank, it was very tough,” said Price.  The couple says the American Red Cross and College Station Fire’s CART team were very helpful with immediate needs but in the days and weeks that followed the fire, they learned resources available were tough to access because they moved in with family members in another county.

The call for the fire at 548 Gildea Drive came in about 9 p.m., according to Allegheny Township Deputy Fire Chief Todd Glunt.

The burns will cover approximately 10 acres of grassland and coastal sage scrub located on Watt and 13th Street on the Northside of the base.  These controlled burns are part of the fire department's Wildland Fire Academy and will involve multiple training evolutions ranging in size from half an acre to one acre. Operations will continue throughout the day until training objective completion. The training enhances the skills of newly assigned firefighters and bulldozer operators in handling wildland fires.  U.S. Space Force Col. Robert Long, Space Launch Delta 30 commander, authorized the training and prescribed burns. ""Periodic prescribed burns are required to effectively manage our natural resources, in accordance with SLD 30’s Wildland Fire Management Plan,” explained Long. ""Over the past 40 years, SLD 30 has successfully completed more than 60 prescribed burns, covering over 6,000 acres.

"fire","2023-06-05","13:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-05T18:54:22","Gov. Gretchen Whitmer warned Michigan residents on Monday not to set fires outside because of the dry conditions that led over the weekend to a fire southeast of Grayling that has already consumed 2,400 acres.  Michigan remains at an extreme risk for wildfires, the state Department of Natural Resources warned Monday. The vast majority of the state is listed at ""extreme"" or ""very high"" risk of a fire, according to a U.S. Forest Service map of fire conditions.  ""It has been a very dry spring, and we want people to know, you know: Do not have fires outside right now,"" Whitmer told reporters at a Flint automotive event on Monday. ""It's just that things are too dry, and it could be a very dangerous situation.""  The current extreme level of fire danger is unprecedented for this time of year, said Kerry Heckman, DNR incident management team public information officer, particularly the amount of dry material available to fuel a fire.  It has been more than a month since most of Michigan received significant rainfall and there isn't one in the forecast. The ground is covered with fuels like dried grass and pine needles.  Michigan firefighters are still fighting a fire southeast of Grayling that is the largest to sweep through the state this year, but that's not why it is so alarming to the state wildlands fire team.  ""The next one is right around the corner,"" said Laurie Abel, a Michigan Department of Natural Resources spokesperson. ""And it could be bigger.""  Conditions are so dry a single spark could unleash a blaze.  ""It can be as minimal as a lawnmower blade hitting a rock that causes a spark,"" Heckan said. ""The potential for it to ignite is nearly 100%.""  Among the areas with a ""high"" risk of fire — below the extreme and very high risk throughout the rest of the state — in the lower peninsula are the Monroe County area, Detroit/Grosse Pointe, the Thumb area near Verona Township, the Hart area in west Michigan and the Atlanta area in northeast Michigan, according to the forest Service map. The Port Hope area in the Thumb region was the only moderate area in the lower peninsula.  Most of the Upper Peninsula was at extreme or very high risk of fire as well.  The Grayling fire is more than 90% contained as of Monday evening. Crews from Wisconsin have joined Michigan fire fighters to combat the blaze. They are extinguishing hot spots and smoky spots on Monday and hope to soon transition from extinguishing the fire to cleaning up after it.  Dozens of structures including 35 residences and 58 outbuildings, as well as 38 vehicles, 12 campers and three boats have been damaged or destroyed by the fire, Abel said. The department does not estimate the cost of the damage nor does it determine whether to pursue fines or charges for igniting wildfires, according to DNR officials.  Recreation areas at Kneff and Staley lakes have reopened as well as railroad tracks north of 4 Mile Road following inspection, according to the DNR. Roads within the 2,400-acre fire in Grayling Township are expected to open Tuesday, the department said.  But residents and visitors are being warned to stay out of blackened areas because dead trees could pose a hazard and the ground still may be warm in some areas. People should stay on the roads and keep their pets on leashes, according to the DNR.  “Please avoid the area if possible,” said Mike Janisse, commander of the DNR Incident Management Team assisting with the fire.“A newly burned area can be very interesting to look at, but make sure you stay a safe distance away from the burned area,” Janisse said in a statement.  The fire was started by a campfire on private land at roughly 1 p.m. Saturday. It started in an area heavy with jack pine trees, which are flammable, said Kathleen Lavey, a DNR spokesperson.  But climate change is predicted to make these conditions more common. Scientists warn Michigan will experience more frequent summer droughts and warmer average temperatures as the climate warms.  A team of DNR fire management experts is working on a plan to prepare the department for future wildfire seasons, Heckman said. Forecasting how climate change will impact fires is part of that plan.  ""Things like that are on our radar and they're actively working towards determining how we can best prepare ourselves,"" Heckman said.  For now, the department has stopped issuing burn permits for yard debris in the northern half of the Lower Peninsula and the Upper Peninsula. Heckman said southern Michigan residents should check with their local municipalities and fire departments about burn permits.  ""People can still have campfires or cookfires, but they should do so with extreme caution and make sure everything is fully, fully extinguished and cool before they walk away,"" she said.  ckthompson@detroitnews.com  Staff Writer Kalea Hall contributed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9taWNoaWdhbi8yMDIzLzA2LzA1L3VucHJlY2VkZW50ZWQtZHJ5LWNvbmRpdGlvbnMtbGVhZC10by1nb3Zlcm5vci1ncmV0Y2hlbi13aGl0bWVyLXdhcm5pbmctZG8tbm90LWhhdmUtZmlyZXMtb3V0c2lkZS83MDI4OTIxMjAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Champion fire Chief Tom Dempsey said crews were called out at 6:30 p.m. to the dead end of Nezbar Drive, which is off State Road, where a wooded area was on fire.  “We did find a campsite that was in the middle of the woods. We are suspecting there may have been an unattended fire,” he said.  Dempsey said crews from many neighboring fire departments assisted at the scene as 70 acres were on fire at one time.  For the first time, Dempsey said he called the Ohio Division of Forestry to the scene, which brought a bulldozer. The forestry crews dug fire lines in the ground with the bulldozer to prevent the fire from spreading.  Dempsey said forestry crews left the scene at 6:30 a.m. Monday.  He said only one home was nearby, and it was safe from the fire. He said the concern was to keep the fire from spreading near the Kuszmaul Allotment housing development, located east of the fire.  Dempsey said the wind shifted, and the fire moved in different directions but stayed in the woods. He said two brush units blew out tires when attempting to get through the wooded terrain because of access issues.  He said the wooded area where the fire was had a lot of brush, as well as creeks and wetlands. Because the fire continued into the night, drone technology and thermal imaging equipment were used to examine the scene.  Crews were at the scene overnight from Sunday evening to 4 a.m. Monday.  Dempsey said while people are allowed to have small campfires, he said they must be careful especially in dry conditions.  May was the sixth driest May on record, with only 1.3 inches of rain the entire month, according to the National Weather Service in Cleveland, which takes measurements at the Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport in Vienna. Fifteen days in a row with no rainfall has been reported, and no rain is in the forecast until at least the weekend, according to the weather service.  The airport reported an official precipitation deficit of 0.59 inches for the year, but that will get higher as the dry streak continues.  “It is important that people check and extinguish campfires properly with water. If it is left overnight, the wind can blow the embers and start the fire up again,” Dempsey said.  On Saturday, the Windsor Fire Department called for assistance from three counties to battle a 50-acre field fire in southern Ashtabula County.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDYvY2FtcGZpcmUtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVkLWFzLWNhdXNlLW9mLTcwLWFjcmUtYnJ1c2gtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So far, fires have charred 9.39 million acres, 17 times the 20-year average. That is larger than the area of Connecticut.  ""We are already seeing one of the worst wildfire seasons on record, and we must prepare for a long summer,"" said Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, at a press conference.  Stretched resources forced the center to reach out to other countries for help. Crews arrived from as far away as New Zealand and South Africa.

""Potential for emerging significant wildland fires is high to extreme and expected to remain so.""  So far this year, 2,247 fires have burned in Canada.

""The roots of this trace all the way back to this past winter, where much of Canada, like the Northeast United States, saw little to no snow compared to average.""  The FOX Forecast Center also said that tree damage from Hurricane Fiona means lots of fuel, especially in eastern parts of the country.  Then, this May was one of the warmest and driest on record, according to officials. The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts showed that much of western and central Canada experienced its warmest May on record in 84 years of record-taking. That dried out the brush and primed it for fire season.  ACTIVE FIRE SEASON FORECAST IN US FOR PACIFIC NORTHWEST, MIDWEST WHILE SOUTHWEST GETS A BREAK  Wildfires for the record books  The fires set a record in May, according to the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service. More than 6.5 million acres were charred in the month alone.  Wildfires also produced a record amount of smoke emissions for the month of May, breaking records in British Colombia , Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories and Nova Scotia.  One of the more stark examples involves the province of Saskatchewan. CAMS said the previous record for wildfire smoke emissions for May in Saskatchewan was 2 Megatonnes, while emissions for May 2023 catapulted to 23 Megatonnes.

Then, at the beginning of June, scores of new fires raged in the eastern Canadian province of Quebec, some of which were ignited by lightning.  The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite captured this view of smoke billowing from the fires on June 3. Shortly after the fires started, about 5,000 residents were ordered to evacuate near the city of Sept-Îles in the province’s east. As the fires grew, evacuations were extended to an additional 9,000 people in surrounding communities and in western Quebec’s Val-d’Or and Normétal municipalities. As of June 5, more than 150 wildfires were active in Quebec.  Smoke from the blazes prompted air quality warnings across Quebec and Ontario. On June 4, the air quality index for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) was classified as unhealthy in southern Quebec and eastern Ontario, according to NOAA’s Aerosol Watch. Fine particulate matter from the smoke blew down to the U.S. Midwest, where it made the air quality unhealthy for sensitive groups in parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan.  Fire season in Quebec usually starts in late May. In an average year, only 247 hectares (a square mile) of area would be burned by June 5, according to Quebec’s fire prevention agency (SOPFEU). But so far this year, 160,000 hectares (600 square miles) have burned.  The fire prevention agency said the fierce start to the season has in part been due to high temperatures and dry conditions in the province.

It says it can only attack between 20 to 30 fires at a time until reinforcement arrives.  ""We took charge of 35 fires today, compared to 21 yesterday. We chose specific fires to protect our critical infrastructures, but above all to protect our population,"" said Public Security Minister François Bonnardel at a news conference Sunday.  ""All our resources are concentrated on these fires.""  Armed forces and firefighters from outside the province started arriving Saturday to help local firefighters. About 100 soldiers are on the ground and 550 more firefighters are on the way.  On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Twitter that France will send 100 firefighters as reinforcements to help combat the fires burning throughout Quebec.  The backup should allow the provincial fire authority, the Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU), to change its strategy — which currently aims to protect cities and infrastructure — to go on the attack and put out the fires for good.  Forest access bans  Quebec's Forestry Ministry banned access to more forests and closed roads as of 8 a.m. Sunday as fires continue to burn across the province.  Access to forests in northern Quebec, Côte-Nord, Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Mauricie, Outaouais, Lanaudière and the Laurentians are limited. A list of closed parks and forests is available on the government's website .  The ministry says it is necessary to restrict access to forests to lower the risk of new fires and to help make firefighting operations easier.  The risk of new forest fires is also prompting the agency that manages Quebec's provincial parks network, the Société des établissements de plein air du Québec (SEPAQ), to ban or limit access to 13 of its parks. They include the La Vérendrye and the Laurentides wildlife reserves, and a full list of closed parks is available.  State of emergency  Val d'Or and a nearby town in Abitibi-Ouest are the latest municipalities to proceed with evacuations because of the forest fires. Val d'Or has declared a state of emergency.  The city issued an evacuation order for people living in the sectors of Louvicourt, Lac Wyeth, Lac Guéguen, Lac Matchi-Manitou and Lac Villebon, ""given that two out-of-control fires are raging on the east side of the Louvicourt sector and due to poor air quality,"" it said in a news release.  Evacuees can head over to the Fournier Multisport Center, which is also sheltering people from the Anishinaabe Nation of Lac Simon and the Algonquin community of Kiticisakik forced to leave their homes Saturday.  Those in Val d'Or's urban core are not affected by the evacuation notice as fires don't threaten the area, though the air quality is still considered very bad and residents are encouraged to stay indoors.  The town of Normétal in Abitibi-Ouest is also under an evacuation order. Officials redirected the 754 residents south of the town to either Dupuy or La Sarre.  Heavy smoke from forest fires hangs in the air on Route 117 toward Val d'Or, Que. ( Boualem Hadjouti/Radio-Canada)  In total, about 14,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in communities near forest fires, including Sept-Îles on Quebec's North Shore, the neighbouring Innu community of Mani-Utenam and Lebel-sur-Quévillon in Northern Quebec.  The city of Sept-Îles has renewed a local state of emergency for five days, but no new evacuations will take place Sunday.  Evacuation notices for the Moisie, Les Plages and Lac Daigle sectors will be maintained for at least another 24 hours.  Mayor of Sept-Îles Steeve Beaupré says he doesn't want people to return to their homes and have to be evacuated again. But, he is optimistic on the evolution of fires by Nipissis River as they are slowing down.  Though temperatures are cooler, a change of winds and having less rain than expected in the forecast at the beginning of the week is causing concern, he said.  Hospitalizations, air evacuations  Manon Asselin, the general director of the CISSS Côte-Nord, said 47 people needed acute care and were transported to hospitals in Montreal and Quebec City by air evacuation.  No more air evacuations are planned and authorities say they are preparing to evacuate patients by road if needed.

Since 2021, one match has been played on the main Court Philippe Chatrier in the evenings and broadcast exclusively by Amazon's Prime Video in France.  Three out of the four Grand Slams -- the Australian Open, the French Open and the U.S. Open -- currently schedule night sessions with raucous fans ensuring a carnival atmosphere, especially if a local player is in action.  Wimbledon's Centre Court had a retractable roof installed in 2009, allowing play to continue at the grasscourt major during rain and into the night up until a locally-imposed curfew of 11 p.m. BST.  In the first two years in Paris, only one women's match got the honours of a night session. This year, one of the eight matches so far scheduled to start at 2030 local time has been a women's game.  The start was brought forward to avoid play finishing too late but, on Saturday, Alexander Zverev played his last point against Frances Tiafoe after midnight.  ""When we play five sets, it can go until two in the morning. That's not so healthy for the player who wins the match and then has to play again the next day, like now,"" said the German, who will take part in his third night session on Monday when he plays Grigor Dimitrov in the fourth round.  ""You need to get a massage, an ice bath, talk to the press, go back to the hotel and you don't fall asleep before 4 or 5 a.m. It's not good for your body.""  Zverev is advocating for more women's matches to be scheduled for the late slot as, with their matches being played over the best of three sets instead of best of five for the men, they tend to play fewer hours.  ""I think you can let the women play more in the night sessions because they play a maximum of three sets,"" Zverev told a press conference that started shortly before 1:30 a.m.  MAURESMO DEFENDS SCHEDULING  Although world number one and defending champion Iga Swiatek defends gender equality, she admitted she did not like playing at night.  Her speedy wins so far have made her an unlikely candidate for the night spot as she has been spending barely an hour on court as she bulldozes her way towards a third title in four years at Roland Garros.  Tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who last year said men's matches had more appeal than women's, stood her ground on Sunday.  ""I've always said, from the outset, that it's the quality of the line-up that decides the night session,"" she told reporters.  ""As far as the women's matches are concerned, we've also made sure to showcase them in the middle of the afternoon on the main courts, starting the programme on Centre Court and the Lenglen with the men's matches.""

"fire","2023-06-04","19:00:00","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T20:53:18","CHICAGO (June 4, 2023) – Chicago Fire FC II earned three points on the road for the second time this season following a 4-2 victory at Columbus Crew 2 on Sunday. Harold Osorio recorded a hat trick of assists on goals by Justin Reynolds, Richard Fleming III and Luka Prpa, while Billy Hency added a goal with help from Noeh Hernandez. The Fire recorded its third win of the season as Columbus dropped its third decision in a row.  Chicago took the initiative on the opening whistle, recording a pair of shots early as the home side tried to find its footing. A high press by the Fire’s forwards rattled the Columbus defense, almost conceding a goal in the 18th minute when Hernandez tipped a back pass to goalkeeper Brady Scott.  The visitors’ intense pressure paid off in the 26th minute. Noah Egan intercepted a pass in the midfield and played the ball to Osorio. The midfielder took a pair of touches to slip a through ball to an open Reynolds on the left wing, who pinched in and finished top left. The Homegrown defender’s opening goal was also his first in nearly 1,600 minutes of MLS NEXT Pro action since 2022.  The press did not relent and the Fire once again took advantage of a turnover. Only a minute after the restart, Osorio stepped in front of a short goal kick and quickly found Richard Fleming III in the box, who simply turned and slipped the ball past Scott for a 2-0 lead. “Trip’s” goal was his first of the year and third all time with Chicago Fire II, scoring twice in 2022 and adding four assists.  Although the first half turned into a back-and-forth affair after the second goal, the Fire continued to take advantage of Columbus’ urgency to get back in the game. One minute into stoppage time, Omari Glasgow got on the end of a lofted pass and passed to the near post for an incoming Hency, who just missed the Fire’s third goal of the afternoon.  Hency had another chance a minute later that he couldn’t capitalize on, but the forward eventually had a third opportunity that he did not miss. Seconds after his second chance, he partnered with Hernandez on a give-and-go to rifle a shot from outside the box and into the net. His goal tied him with Osorio for the team’s golden boot with three, and preceded the referee’s whistle as the Fire went into the locker room in a high mood.  Columbus started the second half on the front foot, looking to cut into a three-goal deficit. In the 52nd minute, Jake Morris found some room in the box to place a shot on target that Mihajlo Mišković was able to parry. But the rebound fell in front of Morris, who took a harder shot that Mišković once again saved. The goalkeeper recorded six saves on the day, keeping Columbus at bay throughout the match.  The Fire continued to exploit the Crew’s position throughout the half and cashed in anew in the 65th minute. Osorio alertly charged a short pass in the midfield and broke for goal. The run caught the defense flat footed and left the Salvadoran midfielder in a one-on-one duel with Scott. But rather than scoring his fourth goal of the year, Osorio instead played the ball into the path of an open Luka Prpa, who tapped the pass home for his first goal of the season and a 4-0 lead.  A wounded Crew kept sending numbers forward and at last answered back in the 70th minute. A foul on the right wing gave the home side a free kick, which Morris turned into an assist upon finding Marco Micaletto in the box. The Anglo-Italian midfielder volleyed a ball that finally beat Mišković for Columbus’ first of the afternoon.  The home side kept pushing throughout the rest of the match, eventually earning another chance deep into injury time. After a foul near the top of the box, Isaiah Parente stepped up to take a free kick that he snuck through the wall and into the net for Columbus’ second. But it was too little, too late – the referee blew his whistle midway through the goal celebration, wrapping up the Fire’s first victory against Columbus in MLS NEXT Pro play.  Chicago Fire II will remain on the road Sunday, June 11, when the team takes on New England Revolution II at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

(KTVZ) – A fire destroyed a motor home at Thousand Trails RV Park south of Sunriver late Saturday afternoon and was spreading to grass and trees when the first fire crew arrived to slow its spread, helping save other RVs and campers, La Pine fire officials said.  When the alarm of an RV fire with wildland involvement at the resort on South Century Drive came in shortly before 4 p.m., both La Pine Rural Fire Protection District crews were on other emergency calls, Captain Ty Miller said.  Fortunately, he said, the La Pine district was able to get an attack water tender to the fire after diverting a member from another alarm, he said. Mutual-aid help was sought from Sunriver Fire, which was able to send an engine and crew.  The first arriving La Pine unit, with one member aboard, found the RV fully engulfed and flames spreading to grass and halfway up nearby trees, Miller said. But that crew member was able to slow the wildland fire’s progress while awaiting other units to finish putting out the RV blaze.  “These actions helped save many other RVs and campers in its path,” Miller said in a news release.  A U.S. Forest Service Crew also responded and put out five small pot fires ahead of the main blaze.  Occupants of the large 2005 motor home were able to escape safely with their two dogs before it was consumed by flames, Miller said.  They reported the fire after noticing the power went out and smelling smoke. They came out of the RV to find flames coming from the rear driver’s side.  The RV was a complete loss, Miller said, but firefighters were able to salvage some personal belongings. The American Red Cross was contacted, as the owners did live in the motor home full-time, the fire captain sad.  No injuries were reported. The cause of the fire is under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2t0dnouY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS8yMDIzLzA2LzA0L2ZpcmUtZGVzdHJveXMtbW90b3ItaG9tZS1hdC10aG91c2FuZC10cmFpbHMtcnYtcmVzb3J0LW5lYXItc3Vucml2ZXItc3ByZWFkcy10by1ncmFzcy10cmVlcy1iZWZvcmUtY3Jld3Mtc3RvcC1pdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2009-07-24","22:00:00","{""BowlingGreen"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T22:05:45","By JAN LARSON McLAUGHLIN  BG Independent News  When they were kids, Kayla Laumann and Dolly Morgan didn’t dream of being firefighters. That just wasn’t something girls thought was possible.  There were no role models for female firefighters – either in the community or on the silver screen. Fire departments were almost exclusively male, and forget about seeing brave female figures fighting blazes on TV shows or in movies. Those roles were saved for macho, muscle-bound men.  Across the nation, the number of female firefighters is still small, with women making up about 5% of career firefighters, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.  In Bowling Green, the fire division has had no women firefighters/paramedics – until now.  Laumann and Morgan recently completed their training at the Ohio Fire Academy, along with two men joining BGFD, Bodie Bankey and Dan Pereira.  Bowling Green Fire Chief Bill Moorman is pleased to finally have females on the force.  “Women are more than capable of being firefighters,” he said. “It’s not about brute strength, it’s about doing it right.”  Both Laumann and Morgan graduated in the top 5% of the fire academy training.  “Nothing is given to anyone in the fire service,” Moorman said. “These women have proven they are qualified to be firefighters in Bowling Green. They are more than capable.”  Moorman said BGFD went so long without female staff because Bowling Green isn’t a large department.  “We are kind of an unknown entity. We haven’t had a lot of female candidates,” the chief said.  But more new firefighters – of both genders – are becoming familiar with BGFD during a fairly new paramedic ride-along program through Owens Community College.  Laumann, from Perrysburg, became acquainted with the fire division during her ride-alongs in Bowling Green.  “It was very inclusive. I felt really at home here,” said Laumann, who has worked with the fire departments in Perrysburg Township and Sylvania. “They truly want to fully progress the department.”  Laumann convinced Morgan, from Brownstown, Michigan, that she should also apply for a position with BGFD.  “She said the guys were very excited to have women apply,” said Morgan, who has worked with fire departments in Rossford and Swanton.  Neither woman dreamed of being firefighters when they were children, since the profession didn’t seem open to women.  “I never thought of it as a career till I saw a female firefighter,” Laumann said.  “The career in media is notoriously male dominated,” Morgan said, predicting that will change as more women enter the fire service. “Seeing people in the profession will change that.”  The physical requirements for firefighting are tough – for either gender. That may discourage some women from considering the job.  “It’s very physically demanding, so some think they can’t do it,” Morgan said.  “Some women see it as intimidating,” Laumann said.  For Morgan, the toughest requirement is “throwing ladders.” Firefighters have to be able to get a ladder off the truck, carry it to a structure, and put it up against the building – by themselves.  For Laumann, the most physically demanding job is maneuvering hoses. “Moving hose can be a lot,” she said. “It’s all upper body sometimes.”  But Moorman pointed out that 85% of the emergency calls to BGFD are for EMS. And the addition of female paramedics will be helpful in many incidents, such as those calls involving violence against women, the chief said.  “There definitely have been a lot of situations when a female firefighter would be good,” Moorman said.  The addition of women firefighters in Bowling Green has necessitated some building modifications at the East Court Street fire station where Laumann and Morgan work. BGFD Deputy Chief Tony Zmarzly explained that when the station was built in 1984, there were no living accommodations made for female firefighters.  The firefighters work 24-hour shifts, so an extra bunk room has been constructed on the station’s second floor, as well as female restrooms and showers.  Zmarzly said the male firefighters are pleased to have female firefighters join the division.  “I think everybody is really excited about the change. There’s new energy,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHA6Ly9iZ2luZGVwZW5kZW50bWVkaWEub3JnL2J1cm5pbmctYmFycmllcnMtYmctZmlyZS1kaXZpc2lvbi1oaXJlcy1pdHMtZmlyc3QtZmVtYWxlLWZpcmVmaWdodGVycy1wYXJhbWVkaWNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

WINDSOR, Ohio — Despite Ohio's burn ban having been lifted at the end of May, the Windsor Fire Department is warning residents that open burns in the area still aren't permitted due to EPA rules. As a result, all fires that are found or reported will be extinguished.  ""There is no open burning allowed right now regardless of the burn ban being lifted,"" the fire department wrote on its Facebook page. ""We have extinguished another fire today. There are EPA rules that currently prohibit open burns and we will extinguish any fires we are notified of or find. If you have any questions please feel free to contact the Fire Department. 440-536-6216.""  The Fire Department's post comes two days after departments from three different counties battled a large brush fire near the Ashtabula County-Geauga County border. The Windsor Fire Department announced that crews finished extinguishing the fire at 4:30 a.m. on Saturday, after first responding at 3 p.m. on Friday.  It is not clear how the fire located at the 4300 block of U.S. Route 322 in Windsor Township started. The fire resulted in roughly 50 acres in the area burning.  The fire occurred as the region has gone about two weeks without any rain, with scorching hot temperatures leading to drought-like conditions. There were also no hydrants near the burn, meaning crews were forced to use water from a nearby pond.  ""A brush fire will rapidly become something more,"" Windsor Assistant Fire Chief Callie Mallory warned, noting buildings could be at risk.

According to Memphis Police, when officers arrived, they found Wiggins standing outside of the church that appeared to have been involved in a fire due to the front of the church being burned.  Fire officials and police did not provide the name of the church.  Police said Wiggins was wearing clothes when they spoke to him, and he informed them that he slept inside the church and decided to start a fire in the church because it smelled like mold and mildew when he woke up.  Police said Wiggins used paper to ignite the fire.  Officers took Wiggins to Regional One Hospital for medical treatment of his hands, which appeared to be burned.

"fire","2023-06-04","Not Discerned","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T10:04:19","Springfield Fire Chief Ed Canny recalled that his father originally wanted him to go into accounting, a field where most of his siblings ended up.  When Canny later showed interest in being a firefighter, though, his father, Ed, encouraged him.  ""(My father retired) as a captain,"" said Canny, during a recent interview at Station 1. ""We actually worked together for a short period of time. We were never on the same rig together, but we were at a few fires together.  More:Canny gets nod as new fire chief; Scarlette, Dahl, Brown to stay in current roles  ""His last assignment was at Station 10 (at the Illinois State Fairgrounds) and I was at Station 3 on North Grand Avenue, so we both served on the north end of Springfield, and we ran into each other.  ""Everybody in our generation wanted to be a fireman and a policeman. Having a father actually in the profession caused that spark to grow even more. We always talk about how the fire and police departments are families. That is truly the case.""  Canny's father spent 30 years with SFD and had a second career as a Springfield realtor. He died in 2017.  Now Ed Canny, 49, faces a city council vote as the new chief Tuesday. He was tabbed a couple of weeks ago by Mayor Misty Buscher to replace Chief Brandon Blough, a move made after her April 4 election victory over incumbent Mayor Jim Langfelder.  Canny has the third most seniority on the fire department and had served as fire marshal, as well as chief of the department's fire safety division, since 2019.  A popular choice among the rank-and-file, Canny, who was a year behind Blough at Ursuline Academy, most likely faces an undramatic confirmation vote.  Other issues, like the size of new fire rigs, which won't be able to navigate some underpasses in the city, could prove to be knottier.  Also looming is a question about whether the city gets into the medical transport business, an idea that has been around the last couple of years but has gotten more serious attention after the death of Earl L. Moore Jr. on Dec. 18. Two emergency medical services workers have been charged with first-degree murder.  While there is an air of familiarity to the task at hand, Canny admitted the last couple of weeks have been ""overwhelming in a good way.""  ""There's been a little bit of a learning curve,"" Canny acknowledged. ""There are a lot of new faces, so we're all learning who we are and where we fit in. My command staff hasn't changed. We're all still working and still making sure those firehouses get built and make sure the firetrucks come in.""  New firehouses, trucks  Those new firehouses include Station 6 at 11th and Ash streets and Station 8 at Rickard Road and Lawrence Avenue, both replace existing firehouses, and the new Station 13 at Spaulding Orchard Road just west of Illinois 4.  Ground was broken on stations 6 and 8 in early May.  ""We haven't built a firehouse in close to 30 years,"" Canny said. ""(Station 12 at 2925 S. Koke Mill Rd.) was built because we were expanding west, and it was at the edge of the city (then). Now we have all of the commercial development out there. The city has expanded, but we haven't pushed our rigs out further.  ""Our goal is to make sure our response times stay equitable throughout the city and that means spacing our houses out, but in order to do so, we have to move. We're making a little move with (Station 6, from 2156 S. Ninth St.), a pretty substantial move with (Station 8, from West Monroe Street just off Chatham Road) and the new house, the one on the far southwest (Station 13), that's going to serve those people well. They've been underserved for years.""  More:'It's been a long, long road to get to this point.' Groundbreakings for firehouses slated  One of the first fires Canny has had to put out is one involving newly ordered firetrucks, specifically ladder trucks, not fitting under the 12-foot underpass at Third Street and Capitol Avenue.  Canny said it is a combination of things. Fire rigs are larger now and there was a preference, by the previous administration at least, to stay with the same manufacturer, Pierce.  ""Should someone have known that it wasn't going to fit? Yes, but could we have done anything about it? Probably not, if we wanted to stay with Pierce,"" he acknowledged. ""I don't know about other manufacturers, if they could have gotten us something different. It's an operational thing that we're going to have to adapt to now and moving forward because those rigs are bigger and that's across the board. They have bulked them up in order to work as the utility vehicle that they are.""  Canny pointed out there are ""lots of viaducts in Springfield we cannot fit under, and we just find alternative routes. The question has been raised, do we move this truck (from Station 1) out somewhere else. We're still looking at that.""  Buscher said one of the first conversations she had with Canny was about the firetrucks and their utility.  It was a matter, she contended, that could have been avoided.  ""This particular truck delivery was taken prior to my administration,"" Buscher said, ""so it is here, we took it, we paid for it, it is ours. We do have to figure out how to deal with the truck. The training mechanism is just to teach all of our drivers not to go down Capitol Avenue, so there wouldn't be an accident.""  Buscher, who was endorsed by the firefighter union in the election, said she has already expressed concerns that when the Third Street corridor is converted into a green way with the railroad move to 10th Street the overpass should be made taller ""so that we can get to calls in a fast, efficient manner.""  New role for SFD?  Asked about the fire department's role in possibly being a transport company, Canny reiterated what Buscher said last month, that any unfair labor practice would need to be addressed first.  ""That is our first priority and then we need to move to the big question on where SFD fits in the realm of providing transport care, if we're going to be a transport agency,"" Canny said. ""What does SFD look like five years from now? That is something that will have to be worked out between the fire department, the mayor, the ambulance companies, the hospitals. There are a lot of layers involved. It's not going to happen overnight.""  More:SPD Officer Warnisher saves woman from fire at home on North Seventh Street  Buscher has said that while she's not for or against the idea, she had concerns regarding SFD personnel administering care in ambulances if they were needed on other calls.  All SFD on-shift personnel are a minimum of EMT-B (Basic) or above, with a large percentage advanced EMT or EMT intermediate, which is about a half step below a paramedic.  What started discussions with the city's three ambulance companies - America, LifeStar and MedicsFirst - was assistance firefighters were providing from houses to the hospitals on regular calls ""because they didn't have enough paramedics to make that ambulance an advanced unit,"" Canny said. ""Those are calls we wouldn't have normally ridden in on and we were basically supplementing the ambulance so they could transport.""  The concern arose, Canny acknowledged, because union members felt they were doing work outside of what their contract allowed them do.  Building trust  Buscher said the new director of Community Relations Ethan Posey has already met with Canny and Springfield Police Chief Ken Scarlette about recruitment ideas and particularly recruitment of minorities.  Part of that pull, she said, was his work with School District 186 students as a special education F.A.C.E. (Family and Community Engagement) liaison.  ""I think Director Posey will be a great addition to the team,"" Canny said. ""His role as community relations director is going to allow him to interact with a lot more people in the community. How we hire is through a civil service process with testing, so just making people more aware of the process and how it gets done and answering questions and just being able to steer people in the right direction will be great for the fire department.""  Getting youth involved early on in the Fire Explorers program, Buscher added, ""is a good idea because then they can see themselves in those career fields.""  For Canny, and other SFD firefighters, like Deputy Division Chief Eric Helms and Division Chief Nick Zummo, it was part of growing up. Helms' late father, Matt, who retired as a division chief, was part of the SFD, as was Zummo's father, Vince Sr., a retired driver engineer. Nick Zummo's brother, Vince, is a driver engineer. Canny's brother, Mike, is a fire captain.  ""What the Zummo brothers told me,"" Buscher said, ""is that you would watch dad go to work and you'd say hi to him at the fire station if you're out getting groceries with mom and you'd see the other firefighters. It's something as a child you got used to seeing and that's what you wanted to be.""  Buscher said she knew Chief Canny's father through being a realtor. Buscher's husband, Mike, is a realtor.  The mayor got to know Canny's father further as city Treasurer because he was in charge of the firefighters' credit union. Chief Canny took over that role from his father ""so I had conversations with him monthly and just had a good relationship with him. Our sworn firefighters had a lot of faith in him and preferred his leadership style and that's the way we went.""  More:Buscher, Van Meter make their cases in 'State of Great Springfield' speeches  Ward 1 Ald. Chuck Redpath Sr. said during Tuesday's committee of the whole meeting that he has known the Canny family a long time and Canny will bring ""common sense"" to his leadership role.  ""The city will be well served (by Canny),"" Redpath said.  Asked about his leadership style, Canny cited the Golden Rule.  ""I have always felt that you need to treat others as you want to be treated, so with that said, the people around me, under me, they will be treated as I want to be treated,"" he said. ""I'll try to build trust with the community and in the fire department. We have a great job and leading them is not difficult.  ""All the men and women of the SFD have leadership qualities. It's built within them. It takes a special person to run inside a burning building to do CPR on people you don't know. I think it will flow naturally. Let my people do what they need to do and get them the resources that they need to do their jobs.""  UPDATE: This story has been corrected.

The building’s current owner granted permission and a group of off-duty firefighters used hammers and chisels around the sandstone cornerstone until they found something amazing inside — the 118-year-old time capsule.  After consulting the Ohio Historical Society about what steps they may need to take to preserve its historical value, the department set up a public event for the opening.  On May 31, community members gathered around downtown Marion to check out the capsule to see what was stored inside.  According to the department, the box held:  Nine turn-of-the-century era Marion Fire Department badges.

According to law enforcement radio traffic:  Water call  Kenosha emergency crews were called to the lakefront along with a boat from Coast Guard Station Kenosha and Pleasant Prairie units after a report of a single male who was first reported on a boat but could not identify his location.  Units responded to the shoreline stretching from Eichelman Park to Pleasant Prairie. The individual was eventually located in the water about 20 yards off shore, which was too close to shore for the Coast Guard boat. Pleasant Prairie was requested to use a shore boat.  The individual was reported out of the boat and on land by about 3:25 p.m.  Bristol fire  A structure fire was reported Sunday afternoon at 3:23 p.m. at 9826 191th Ave. in Bristol.

The decks of boats docked at Wahweap Marina on Lake Powell smoldered as black plumes of smoke wafted into the air above the lake and the red rock walls that form its perimeter, video from observers shows.  Robert Wilkes, the owner of Skylite Houseboat Management, said the fire began in the early afternoon and grew for about an hour and a half. Wilkes, a trained firefighter, used a garden hose and worked with park rangers, who he said arrived soon after the boats ignited, to help put out the fire.  “I started pulling boats off the dock trying to create a gap so it didn’t act like a tree line,” he said.  As of Friday evening, the fire had been extinguished and contained, said Lisa Cesaro, a spokesperson with Aramark Destinations, which maintains the marina.  “The cause of the fire is being investigated and information will be released by the National Park Service when available,” Cesaro said.  The Park Service did not immediately respond to requests from The Associated Press seeking comment.  Wilkes said he had not heard of anyone injured. But he said one of his management company’s boats had been destroyed.  Throughout the spring, boaters have returned their vessels to the marina after an abnormally wet winter elevated lake levels that had previously hit historic lows. More than 2 million visitors go boating on Lake Powell annually, according to the National Park Service.  Park rangers previously responded to houseboat fires several times in recent years, including in 2022, 2015 and 2011.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3VzZWJvYXRzLWNhdGNoLWZpcmUtYXQtcG9wdWxhci1kZXN0aW5hdGlvbi1sYWtlLXBvd2VsbC1vbi11dGFoLWFyaXpvbmEtbGluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire was initially reported to the Zion Fire & Rescue Department at 8:32 p.m. Saturday in the 2000 block of Joppa Avenue.  Upon arrival, firefighters found one residence was already well involved and the blaze was spreading to a second residence next door. The fire spread rapidly to the interior of the second residence, causing significant damage.  Crews quickly were able to confirm that no occupants were inside the homes.  A free flowing natural gas leak from one of the home’s residential meters was feeding the fire and increasing fire growth and spread. Upon quickly determining that the occupants and pets were no longer in either house along with the rapid spread of the gas-fed fire, an interior attack was determined not initially to be a safe option.  An exterior fire attack including the use of aerial ladder truck was necessary until the gas company could arrive and mitigate the gas leak. Crews were then able to enter both structures and ensure all areas of fire were extinguished.  Fire personnel contained the fire to the two homes, eventually extinguishing both fires.  There was extensive damage to both structures and both families displaced. Red Cross assistance was offered to both and accepted by one of the families.  Gas and electric eventually were shut off to both buildings. Fire investigators were called to the scene to assist with attempting to determine the origin and cause of the fire. The homes were secured by a board up company following conclusion of the incident.  Including Zion Fire crews there were 15 units on scene with 29 personnel.

In the event that fire moves to the west, this will improve the ability of firefighters to hold fire at the road. Fireline supervisors are working with property owners in the same area to thin vegetation to make the properties more resilient to fire.  The northern fire perimeter has been declared contained and is in patrol status. Firefighters are searching for, and extinguishing hot spots as they are found. A chipper will be deployed on the 59 Road today and firefighters will begin to chip vegetation that was previously cut.  The southern portion, burning in the Gila Wilderness, is expected to continue to burn southward to the Middle Fork of the Gila River where a change in fuel type is expected to hold the fire.  This naturally ignited fire is burning at low intensity and eliminating surface fuels that can carry fire into stands of timber in times when the landscape is more receptive to intense wildfire. Current fuel moisture and weather are allowing for the reduction of the “ladder” fuels on fire prone landscapes. When timber burns, fires are hotter and more intense, damaging the vegetation, timber, soil and ultimately the wildlife.  Weather: The next few days will begin sunny, with clouds building in the afternoon. Overnight, an easterly will slowly bring more surface moisture to the region.  Aviation Restrictions: ATemporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is still in place over the Pass Fire. All non-fire aircraft are restricted. This includes civilian drones. Unauthorized aircraft in the area will ground firefighting aircraft, hindering firefighting efforts.  Closures: The Gila National Forest remains open.

It took crews more than five hours to put out.  Example video title will go here for this video  HAZELWOOD, Mo. — Authorities are investigating the cause of a massive fire that decimated a Hazelwood bar.  The fire at Bar 270 had firefighters working for hours on Saturday night.  Battalion Chief Dan Leichenauer, with the Hazelwood Fire Department, said no one was injured in the fire.  He said the only people in the building at the time were employees preparing to open up for the night.  According to Leichenauer, the fire started in the kitchen, and it took crews five hours to completely put it out.  ""We were here from roughly 8 p.m. to 1:30, 2 o'clock in the morning,"" he said.  Leichenauer described Saturday as a ""late night"" for many across north St. Louis County.  ""They had fire showing through here to the roof and heavy smoke, black smoke that was coming out all the doorways and windows,"" he said.  Daylight revealed the shattered windows, collapsed roof and soot that now took over Bar 270.  The fire the night before was so big, that according to Leichenauer, crews attempted to enter in the back of the building but pulled out because of the heavy fire and smoke conditions.  ""I would expect the building is completely destroyed and most likely will have to be taken down,"" he said.  Leichenauer said that's because what they were dealing with 24 hours ago was so massive.  ""We ended up setting up a defensive operation. We had multiple aerials. We had roughly 60 firefighters on scene,"" he said.  The sheer volume of the smoke coming from the bar almost covered Highway 270, according to Leichenauer.  ""The smoke was not moving away from the area, was not going up in the air. It was just hanging,"" he said.  Leichenauer said that meant extra manpower was necessary.  ""That's why we use mutual aid with everybody else from Florissant to Berkeley, Pattonville,"" he said.  Not everyone who came to help was there in uniform though.  Danny Cunningham, the president of St. Louis First Responder Canteen, had four volunteers on the scene.  ""I don't know how many bags of ice and stuff they went through, to be honest. We just kept bringing it out and running to QuikTrip and picking up more,"" he said.  Cunningham's team provided the first responders with water, Gatorade and snacks, all things you won't find on fire department trucks.  ""They've got a limited space, so they carry some basic water, maybe equivalent to a half a case of water, so when they run out, they run out,"" he said.  With cups still on the ground and pieces of the bar spread across the parking lot, the long night for many across North County proved to be a community effort.  ""We love to hear the 'thank you' from the firefighters. That's why we keep doing what we do. I know last night there was departments from all over North County that were there as well. Seeing them all work together is amazing,"" Cunningham said.  ""We always appreciate all the things they do for everybody. We have a lot of community support that comes out and takes care of us while we were out here on those long fires,"" Leichenauer said.  As for what's next for the business, code enforcement will now take over.  According to Leichenauer, code enforcement will work with the property owners and decide if the building is salvageable or needs to be taken down.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaGF6ZWx3b29kLWJhci1jYXRjaGVzLWZpcmUtbXVsdGlwbGUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudHMtaGVscC1wdXQtaXQtb3V0LzYzLTk5N2UzZDkzLTBlZGMtNDllZC05M2Q2LTI5YTU3NTcwZDMwYdIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2hhemVsd29vZC1iYXItY2F0Y2hlcy1maXJlLW11bHRpcGxlLWRlcGFydG1lbnRzLWhlbHAtcHV0LWl0LW91dC82My05OTdlM2Q5My0wZWRjLTQ5ZWQtOTNkNi0yOWE1NzU3MGQzMGE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The National Weather Service issued a Red Flag Warning for most of our area for Sunday.  The Warning is issued when fire weather conditions are critical. A map of current fire conditions in the state from the shows much of the Mitten is at either ""extreme"" or ""very high"" risk of fire.  Officials say there's more to being careful in these conditions than simply not having any outdoor fires. Outdoor barbecue grills, chain saws, gas-powered vehicles, and cigarettes could all potentially provide enough spark to start a fire. The parched conditions are the result of an unusually dry spell that started in early May. We've had fifteen consecutive days without rain, and twenty-five of the last twenty-six days have been dry. Only about a third of an inch of rain fell on the one rainy day.  Typically during that same period, we would see at least three inches of rain. Unfortunately, the situation will likely get worse before it gets better. The weather forecast calls for continued dry conditions for the next several days. Additionally, dew points -- a measure of how much moisture is in the atmosphere -- are also expected to be relatively low.  We're not the only ones seeing a high fire danger due to dry conditions. In eastern Canada, wildfires are burning in the province of Quebec. A northeast breeze is expected to bring smoke from those fires to our sky over the next few days. Unlike the smoke from wildfires in western Canada a couple of weeks ago which stayed in the upper atmosphere, the smoke from the Quebec fires is expected to be closer to the ground; close enough that we might even be able to smell it from time to time.

Captain Butch Campbell responded to the fire and said they were able to get it under control around 10 a.m. Sunday. When he arrived at the flea market Saturday, Campbell said the outer buildings had caught fire.  “There’s multiple buildings outside the main building. The fire was on those buildings when we first arrived and the fire had spread to the buildings right up against the main buildings,” Campbell said.  There are no known injuries, but the cause of the fire is still under investigation. Campbell said departments worked together to avoid any injuries to the public.  “The Alcoa Police Department, the Blount County Sheriff’s Department did a great job trying to keep people out of the area, and keep them away and keep them safe,” Campbell said.  Vendors at the flea market, like Pat Hatcher, tried to save some of their items from the fire.  “My heart is breaking, my heart is breaking.

That’s when he sprang into action, running through the building’s front door as some residents were exiting, finding an unconscious man who he pulled out of the burning building.  Young then went back in the building and helped another man down the stairs and through the thick smoke, he said. He said he then tried to go further into the building, following the sound of someone calling for help, but was “hit with a wall of smoke.”  Not being able to see or breathe, Young said he somehow found his way back outside.  Young’s girlfriend, Allexis Martin, eventually pulled him to an ambulance that had arrived on the scene at that time.  Martin said Young had been in the building for 10 to 15 minutes trying to locate and help residents to safety.  Young was eventually one of the 13 people taken by ambulance to the hospital for smoke inhalation. He was released about three hours later, he said.  Other than the hair burning off his hands, Young said he didn’t sustain any other injuries.  “I got very, very lucky,” he said. “It could’ve been a lot worse.”  The fire was contained by Hartford firefighters Saturday evening, and it is being investigated by the Fire Marshal's office.  Hartford's Special Services Unit and American Red Cross are working to assist families displaced by the fire, since the building was deemed unhabitable.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vY2FwaXRhbHJlZ2lvbi9hcnRpY2xlL2hhcnRmb3JkLW92ZXJuaWdodC1maXJlLWV2ZXJncmVlbi1hdmVudWUtMTMtaHVydC0xODEzNDM4My5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The East Pierce County Fire Department has responded to 16 brush fires far this year, according to staff.    “The wind is definitely a concern, especially when it’s dry because any small fires are going to get pushed by the wind,” East Pierce County Fire Department Assistant Chief Bill Sandlian stated.  The East Pierce County Fire Department said it’s prepared for potential brush fires with three brush trucks in its fleet and add staff when needed.  In Kent, Puget Sound Fire recently got a new "" "" that carries 400 gallons of water.

We were waiting for the call of when we'd have to evacuate,” Broyles explained. “We finally got AC this year! Growing up in Washington we never had AC units because it was never this hot during the summer.”  Residents say knowing what could happen has led them to take precautions like keeping the lawn watered and clearing brush within 30 feet of the house. East Pierce County Fire adds it learned lessons from that experience that has since helped with how they respond to brush fires. That includes training earlier in the year.  “We have regular and ongoing communications with our neighboring departments about availability of resources,” Assistant Chief Sandlian added. “Have a great summer, enjoy the weather but be fire safe about it.”  East Pierce County Fire and the NWS are reminding people to avoid burning when it's windy or during low humidity, and to look up local burn bans and regulations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9QFodHRwczovL2tvbW9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudHMtcHJlcGFyZS1icnVzaC1maXJlLXdpbGRmaXJlLXJlc3BvbnNlLW5hdGlvbmFsLXdlYXRoZXItc2VydmljZS1kcnktY29uZGl0aW9ucy1waWVyY2UtY291bnR5LWtpbmctY291bnR5LXN1bW5lci1rZW50LXB1Z2V0LXNvdW5kLXNhZmV0eS10cmFpbmluZy13ZWF0aGVyLXBhdHRlcm5zLXJpc2stc3VtbWVyLXNwcmluZy1zZWFzb24tcHJlY2F1dGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fire crews in New Jersey on Saturday had almost completely contained one major fire and were reporting good progress in battling another blaze that for a time threatened several dozen homes.  New Jersey Forest Fire Service officials said Saturday that the ‘Flatiron wildfire’ blaze in Medford in Burlington County started just after midnight and was burning toward 40 homes before crews managed to move the blaze away from the structures.  Residents weren’t evacuated but were protected within their homes, some using garden hoses to help as crews worked in the backyards to conduct backfires and burnout operations, officials said.  Officials on Saturday afternoon reported “significant progress” in fighting the fire; they said four structures still threatened were being protected by local fire crews. A structure set apart from the homes and described as some type of gazebo in the forest was earlier reported destroyed.  Officials said Saturday afternoon that the new blaze had burned about 180 acres (73 hectares) and was 60 percent contained. Officials earlier reported only 20 percent containment but said they hoped that would increase once the flames burned the rest of a 220-acre containment area bordered by such things as roads, canals and streams.  Firefighters said the earlier fire burning in the Bass River State Forest, which stretches across Ocean and Burlington counties in the Pinelands, had been almost completely contained. The blaze, the largest in the state this year, had burned about 5,550 acres (2,246 hectares) since Wednesday.  About 40 people were evacuated as a precaution on Thursday from a camping area and a long stretch of New Jersey’s Garden State Parkway, the state’s major north- south highway, was closed but was reopened Friday morning.

"fire","2023-07-27","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-04T18:28:00","After a quiet May for wildfires, the Wildland Fire Potential heats up into summer. The National Interagency Fire Center forecasts high fire activity across the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes and upper Midwest as well as eastern Alaska. California and the Desert Southwest are forecast to get a break after a tough couple of seasons.  HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER  Year-to-date, the U.S. has seen fire across only half the acres normally burned over a 10-year average. Even the number of fires is only at 82% of normal. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index is at its lowest since 2020, 74 on a scale of 500, down from a 10-year peak of 202 in November 2022, according to the center.  Almost 60% of the country is not in drought conditions, and less than 20% is under moderate to exceptional drought.  HERE'S WHEN THE SUNSHINE STATE'S RAINY SEASON GETS UNDERWAY  Across the West, though, late spring delivered warm temperatures leading to rapid snowmelt and increased vegetation which becomes fuel for fires. The Great Lakes, Midwest, Mississippi Valley and Northeast dried out with below-normal rainfall, leaving the areas in high threat.  The High Plains, Texas, the Southwest and the Southeast saw above-normal rainfall and are in good shape heading into wildfire season.  With NOAA's Climate Prediction Center calling for a warmer than normal West, South and East Coast. Paired with below normal chance of rain west of the Cascades, inland Oregon and Washington start the summer under above-average risk.  STATE FARM STOPS OFFERING HOME, PROPERTY INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA AMID SKYROCKETING DISASTER RISKS  The high risk creeps across the rangeland into Idaho, Nevada and Montana into August and likely through September.  Warm temperatures from the Midwest to the Northeast will dry out grasses and brush, leading to a higher fire risk through summer.  The expected below-normal monsoon season for the Southwest and Central Rockies will mean less water. But after the dousing parade of atmospheric river-fueled storms and the reduced risk of lightning setting off fires, wildfire risk continues below average.  The South stays at average risk despite the onset of El Niño, which generally tamps out tropical storm development in the Atlantic, meaning less rainfall.  7 FACTS ABOUT MONSOON SEASON  The Great Lakes stay dry with below-average expected rainfall, which keeps those states in high fire danger. That threat heads into the Northeast as summer continues.  The center calls for a slightly higher-than-average fire season across much of Alaska after heavy winter snows led to impressive snowpack, now snowmelt. The fire threat backs off later in summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2VhcnRoLXNwYWNlL2FjdGl2ZS1maXJlLXNlYXNvbi1mb3JlY2FzdGVkLXBhY2lmaWMtbm9ydGh3ZXN0LW1pZHdlc3TSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3h3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lYXJ0aC1zcGFjZS9hY3RpdmUtZmlyZS1zZWFzb24tZm9yZWNhc3RlZC1wYWNpZmljLW5vcnRod2VzdC1taWR3ZXN0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Boyle  Published in May 2023  I see our academic world differently since reading my friend Bryan Alexander’s book Universities on Fire. Climate change is now my higher education lens and filter. Rising sea levels, ever-rising temperatures, wildfires, drought and extreme weather events provide the context in which the future of the university will play out.  Most Popular Stories Most Popular  What Universities on Fire has needed is a fictional complement—a great novel (or TV show or movie) that places climate change at the core of its narrative arc.  Of course, the fictional adaptation of Universities on Fire would ideally be set on a college campus. While not situated in academia, T. C. Boyle’s new novel, Blue Skies, is my current nomination for the novel to pair with Alexander’s indispensable book. (In keeping the academic theme, one of the main characters in Blue Skies is a perpetual Ph.D. student—so there’s that).  What makes Blue Skies so good is precisely why Apple TV’s recent Extrapolations show was not so great. Blue Skies is character-driven in the sense that the reader understands and cares about the protagonists. In Extrapolations, the people are less interesting than the world changed by climate, resulting in the show being less memorable and emotionally resonant than it might have been.  The women and men who populate Blue Skies, which takes place in the near future and is set in Florida and California, respond to climate catastrophes (sea-level rise, unbearable heat, extreme weather, water shortages, wildfires) in ways that are internally consistent to their biographies, personalities and idiosyncrasies. People who move to Florida always seem to make bad decisions, but Blue Skies makes a convincing case that those choices will lead to nasty outcomes in our unfolding climate emergency.  Bringing Blue Skies and Universities on Fire into conversation with one another, one is left with the idea that the true impacts of climate change on higher education will be to cause many things in academia to be incrementally worse. Water shortages, high temperatures, floods, extreme storms, wildfires and a rising sea level will not kill universities overnight. Taken together and cumulatively over time, the effects of a warming planet will result in less resilient and more expensive universities.  Reading Blue Skies while thinking about Universities on Fire, it is easy to imagine a time when the residential college will become a luxury good. How will cash-strapped public universities in climate-vulnerable areas afford to protect their campuses from never-ending heat waves, water shortages, fires and flooding?  One theme of Blue Skies is that even the smartest and best intentioned among us are not ready for the problems that climate change will create. And a theme of Universities on Fire is that even smart and well-intentioned leaders in higher education are doing too little to prepare their institutions.

Before long, the Sierra Nevada foothills became difficult to see. The Sutter Buttes, some 20 miles to the southwest, were only visible by way of their ghostly outlines.  Is wildfire season here already, so soon after an extraordinarily wet winter?

(Ed Booth/Enterprise-Record)  No. Temperatures are definitely rising and vegetation is drying out, as it does every late spring in the Sacramento Valley, but fire officials are working to get ahead of the types of fires that foul the air and can threaten homes and businesses.  This was the game plan for Cal Fire/Butte County firefighters as they used drip torches to ignite a prescribed burn near the Thermalito Forebay off Grand Avenue a few miles from Oroville. The event sent some unpleasant smoke into the sky, but the results on the charred landscape were a thing of beauty — the blackened elimination of invasive, non-native vegetation such as star thistle.  It was the third consecutive year of burning this area, said Cal Fire/Butte County public information officer Rick Carhart. He explained the remarkable growth, in a single year, of the weeds, which were approximately knee-high on the firefighters moving through them.  This effort — which state officials call the Forebay Vegetation Management Project — will apply controlled burns to four zones in all, finishing by June 17. Carhart said Saturday’s kickoff took advantage of light south winds to send the resulting smoke north, away from residences as much as possible.  Benefits  Cal Fire/Butte County is conducting the burns in conjunction with California State Parks and the state Department of Water Resources. DWR observers “are monitoring what we’re doing,” Carhart said, adding the area has vernal pools dotting the landscape.  “They’ll study the pools and habitat after we’re done,” he said.  To combat invasive species like yellow star thistle, Carhart explained that it’s important to burn the same area multiple years in a row. When completed during the right stage in the star thistle’s growth cycle, the control burns eradicate the current crop and reduce the spread of seeds. The area has seen a significant decline in the volume of star thistle since the project began, Carhart said.  Another solid benefit is the training opportunities for firefighters, most of whom work seasonally. Veteran firefighters were on hand Saturday, and will continue to be, so they can prepare seasonal personnel for the fire season.

"fire","2023-07-10","15:00:00","{""Loganton"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-02T06:33:24","LOGANTON — The Sugar Valley Greenhouse — a staple for house plants, flowers and vegetable plants for decades — already is rebuilding following a Tuesday fire.  The shop is owned by Sarah Stoltzfus and managed by her daughter Feenie Esh.  “The Sugar Valley Fire Company really did a good job and they got here really quick,” Esh said. “For a while, we thought the barn was going to go. There were some sparks from the shed that landed in there, and the straw and the hay caught on fire inside, but the fire company saw what was going on, and they stopped it right away. Because of them, the damage really isn’t that bad, not like it might have been. They really are something.”  “The main thing we lost was our work area and our tobacco shed, and some equipment. It wasn’t much. And we didn’t lose any flowers from inside the greenhouse at all,” she continued.  According to Feenie, the blaze started in an area attached to the main greenhouse.  “There was a small red shed back there where we kept the tank filler in, and my brother was filling the forklift with propane. He was outside the shed, and he said that all of the sudden the fire was just shooting out of the propane tank and out of the shed,” she said. “He tried to stop it, but then ran to the phone to call for help, and the fire company got here so fast.”  “In the beginning, we had gone into the office to start moving things out and the fire company came in and told us that we couldn’t be in there and to get out — that the propane tanks could explode, so we listened and stood over by the garden. And one of them did explode. That’s when the flames were higher than the silo. We could feel the heat from that far away,” Esh said.  Feenie and her family are thankful for everyone who played a part in saving not only the greenhouse, but potentially their farm too, as well as the homes of her parents and grandparents, had the fire spread.  “So many people came to help — even from the auction next door — they ran up and helped clear out the lower greenhouse when the first of the smoke was in the air, and we really want to thank all of the fire companies. We are very grateful,” she said. “They are so good at their job that we have people coming in here this morning saying they heard we had a fire and couldn’t believe it, because when you walk in the shop, you can’t tell until you look out back.”  Tuesday’s smoke and firefighters were replaced Wednesday by the sound of pounding hammers and men putting up the frame of a new building where blackened beams stood shortly before.  “They are already building a new shed,” Esh said. “It will be up by tonight, I’m sure.”  Feenie, Sarah and the rest of the Stoltzfus and Esh families are counting their blessings.  “It could’ve been way worse. Yesterday, we couldn’t believe anything was going to be standing, the way flames looked, but today it feels so good to walk in here and see all the flowers,” she said.  An official cause of Tuesday’s fire has yet to be released. The following fire companies responded to the blaze: Sugar Valley, Lamar Township, Nittany Valley, Mill Hall, Beech Creek/Blanchard, Flemington Goodwill Hose fire and EMS, Lock Haven Citizens Hose, Lock Haven Hope Hose, Lock Haven Hand in Hand, Dunnstown, Woolrich, Avis, Nippenose Valley, Citizens Hose of Jersey Shore, Miles Township and Millheim.

Sherill’s life was cut short at just 30 years old, but during that time he influenced many.  During the fire, Sherill filmed a frantic Facebook Live, begging for any kind of help. Channel 9′s Glenn Counts spoke with Sherill’s uncle, Pastor William Eddleman, who believes his nephew didn’t die alone.  ”I can’t let you go through this stuff that you are facing right now; come on, that earthly part of you may deal with it, but that part of you that is eternal and going to be with me forever has got to get out of here,” Eddleman said.  Sherill was married, but his family says his wife passed away from COVID-19 about two years ago. He then began raising his four children as a single father with help from his kids’ grandmother. Harriett Davis, Sherill’s aunt, remembered her nephew’s care for others.  ”We knew this was a kid who was always respectful, even when he was wrong,” Davis said.  Sherill had two daughters and two sons between the ages of 5 and 13; his hope was to put all four through college.  Pastor Eddleman decided to look at the situation in a more positive light. He hopes that the loss and destruction that happened during the SouthPark fire will inspire change within the construction industry to stop another family from going through the same pain  .Just over two weeks after they lost Sherill, his family is facing a new challenge. They believe some people are trying to raise money in Sherill’s name without the family’s blessing.  ”The mother wanted me to say that we don’t want people taking advantage of the situation,” Eddleman told Counts.

Ready, has been fired as Baltimore’s Fire Marshal and Deputy Chief, the latest example of high-level volatility in the Brandon Scott administration.  A terse general order – “Dismissed from Service, Effective 2400 hours on May 31” – was issued Wednesday afternoon to agency personnel by Acting Fire Chief Dante Stewart, disclosing a termination that, executed four weeks earlier, had been kept secret from the City Council, other Cabinet members and the media, multiple sources tell The Brew.  Ready now joins his former boss, Fire Chief Niles R. Ford, and a growing number of deputy mayors, senior officers, city and deputy city administrators, department heads and chiefs of staff who have left city government in the last 18 months.  But unlike those departures, Ready wants the public to know the circumstances of his termination.  “It caught me by surprise. It came totally out of the blue,” he said in an exclusive interview with The Brew, saying he was free to speak now that the department announced his dismissal.  “I can only speculate that just before I was fired, I had applied for the chief’s job. That is supposed to be confidential, but somebody up high maybe doesn’t want me to be the chief.”  “The funny thing is,” he continued, “I was happy as fire marshal. I am most proud of the fact that since I became marshal, we have achieved the lowest civilian fire deaths in BCFD history in 2020, 2021 and 2022.  “I am the first and only fire marshal to get civilian fire deaths down to the single digits,” he added.  Ready has won numerous awards, including “Fire Fighter of the Year” and the American Red Cross “Hometown Hero” award.  “I am the first and only fire marshal to get civilian fire deaths down to the single digits” in 2020, 2021 and 2022 – Derrick Ready.  The 60-year-old said he decided to apply for the top fire job because “I have all of the professional qualifications to be chief, and other members of senior staff do not.”  Ready said he believes Mayor Scott was not aware of his dismissal until this week, but that senior members of his staff, including one who had worked in the fire department, were.  Pre-signed Letter  “They gave me no reasons for the termination. They just kept saying I was an ‘at will’ employee and they don’t have to explain anything.”  Scott’s office and the fire department have not yet responded to a request for comment. Typically, the city does not respond to what it terms confidential personnel matters.  On May 4, Ready said he was called into a meeting with Deputy Chiefs Charles Svehla and Chris Caisse and Human Resources Director Jamarr Rayne and was handed a resignation letter.  “Chief Svehla said, ‘Just sign the letter,’ and I said, ‘I didn’t write that letter. I’m not ready to leave yet.’ And he said, ‘If you don’t sign it, we’re going to have to fire you.”  Immediately, Ready said, he was handed a termination letter, already signed by Acting Fire Chief Stewart.  He said he was taken to the fire marshal’s office, where he was asked to surrender his keys, city-issued computer, cellphone and badge, then was driven home because he had come to work in a city-issued car.  “He no longer works here”  While waiting for clarification from the fire department about his health care benefits, accrued vacation time and other matters, Ready said he was hearing that he had retired.  “Nobody knew what was really going on until Wednesday when they dropped the order that I had been dismissed. I go to all the big fires, all fatals and, when I’m working, to all second alarms. Individuals would be asking where I was, and they were either told nothing or ‘he no longer works here.’”  Ready also religiously attends the fire department’s annual budget hearings before the City Council.  But he was not present this Tuesday when Stewart was grilled about vacancies and high overtime costs at the department.  “A councilman asked where I was, and nobody would tell him. The whole idea was to cover up my dismissal from the Council and from the public,” Ready told The Brew.  Earlier this week, Ready said he requested through human resources that his termination date be extended from May 31 to June 1 to cover the gap in health care benefits before his COBRA coverage would kick in in July.  “The HR director explained to Chief Stewart that if you just grant Chief Ready one day, terminate him on June the 1st, he will still have his health insurance for the whole month.  “He has plenty of vacation time on the books. Let him use 7.2 hours of vacation, so he won’t lose his health insurance. And Chief Stewart said no.”  Ready said he turned in his dress uniforms two days ago.  “When you are terminated, they tell you you can’t be on fire property, and you are not allowed to wear anything that indicates you were ever a member of BCFD. And that’s the way they treated a dedicated employee after more than 32 years of service.”  • To confidentially reach a reporter: reuttermark@yahoo.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZWJyZXcuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvMDIvaXQtY2FtZS1vdXQtb2YtdGhlLWJsdWUtYmFsdGltb3Jlcy13ZWxsLXJlc3BlY3RlZC1maXJlLW1hcnNoYWwtaXMtZGlzbWlzc2VkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2022-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-06-01T17:15:51","As we so tragically learned in 1991, the threat of catastrophic wildfire is nothing new in Oakland and the impact of such an event would be felt in all corners of the city.  Last week, Oakland Fire Chief Dr. Reginald Freeman announced the official launch of a pilot agreement between the Oakland Fire Department, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), and technology company N5 Sensors that will allow the City to utilize technology that may detect signs of wildfires.  “Understanding the year-round threat, the Oakland Fire Department is committed to seeking out any and all strategies to prevent wildfires within our jurisdiction,” said Chief Freeman. “Whether it’s by ensuring we have adequate staffing, developing new regional partnerships, acquiring new equipment and apparatus, or through new piloting of new technology that may prevent the loss of properties and save lives. Early detection and suppression of fire is critical in the prevention of catastrophic wildfire.”  In 2022, Chief Freeman began conversations with the representatives from the Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate about having Oakland participate in a pilot program to test the use of real time fire-detection sensors, like those currently being placed across Oregon in partnership with the Oregon Hazards Lab, and in parts of eastern Canada. In early, 2023, the Oakland City Council approved a resolution authorizing the City to move forward with the planning and implementation pilot program, known as N5SHIELD, in partnership with technology company N5 Sensors. Today the pilot program in Oakland is a reality.  “Climate change and extreme weather are lengthening wildfire seasons – and putting more communities and properties at risk. In a world with these rapidly changing environmental threats, we work every day so that everyone can access the right information at the right time to stay safe,” said Abhishek Motayed, CEO of N5 Sensors.  Over the last several weeks, in coordination with the Oakland Fire Department, staff from the City of Oakland’s Department of Transportation Electrical Services Division installed 10 wildfire sensors in strategic locations across Oakland’s wildfire urban interface.  The anticipated duration of the pilot is twenty-four (24) months. The pilot project will monitor air quality changes only, there is no audio, visual, or other surveillance capability with the technology being deployed. There is no cost to the city associated with the acquisition of the equipment, maintenance, or use of the technology during the pilot phase.  HOW IT WILL WORK:  • Ten (10) air quality sensors will be installed throughout the wildland urban interface area of Oakland. The sensors will continuously sample air quality (no audio or visual sensors) and transmit back to the vendor.  • There will be a web-based dashboard showing the status of all the sensors in real time. The vendor will email and/or text OFD dispatch whenever the sensors are alerting for a fire. This project is testing whether these sensors and associated alert algorithm work and whether this technology can be used in an urban interface setting.  • When their system is alerting for a fire, OFD will receive a notification through text/email and on the dashboard projected on a wall monitor in fire dispatch.  In 2020 alone, fires burned over 4 million acres, claiming thousands of homes, and taking over 30 human lives. In terms of acreage burned from wildfires, the last several years in California have been some of the worst in history. Climate change and extreme weather are lengthening wildfire seasons – and putting more communities and properties at risk.  However, due to the Oakland Fire Department’s pre-planning, comprehensive vegetation management and annual inspection program, pre-positioning of wildland apparatus, and the commitment of tens of thousands of Oaklanders to create and maintain defensible space, the city has been spared from these types of catastrophic events since 1991. The Oakland Fire Department has one of the most comprehensive wildfire prevention programs in California. Annually it directly inspects 25,000+ private and city-owned parcels, conducts year round fuel mitigation on thousands of acres in the hills, executes many miles of roadside clearing projects, and deploys one of the largest herd of goats in the state to mitigate and remove hard to reach, hazardous combustible fuels.  Thankfully, Entities like N5 are starting to implement technological solutions to reduce wildfire spread using sensors that can detect and warn fire departments and communities of deadly blazes in the incipient phase. The goal of this partnership is to identify where technology solutions can be brought in line with other commercially available products to advance Oakland’s citywide efforts to prevent wildfires.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ha2xhbmRjYS5nb3YvbmV3cy8yMDIzL29ha2xhbmQtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXRvLWxhdW5jaC13aWxkZmlyZS1kZXRlY3Rpb24tcGlsb3QtcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Liberty Township Trustee Bryan Newell told The Gazette it’s important for residents to understand the levy is a renewal and everyone’s portions paid to the levy will be reduced with the renewal as a result of more residents now paying into the pool.  “We will also maintain the portion of the levy that the state contributes because we have run the same levy for so long we are grandfathered into receiving that money even though the state no longer provides that subsidy for new levies,” Newell added. “This is all possible because of our fiscally responsible management of levy dollars and the other funding we bring in through soft billing, grants, and our EMS partnership with the county.”  Reach Dillon Davis at 740-413-0904.

Firefighters arrived on scene within minutes and discovered an unoccupied building with smoke and fire coming from the roof. The entire first floor to this two-story building was boarded, so they forced open the boarded areas and initiated an aggressive fire attack.  Because the growth and development of the fire intensified with the potential of an imminent collapse of the structure, all fire personnel were removed from the interior and a defensive attack began with the goal of saving the surrounding buildings, including a nearby senior living facility. In total, this 3rd alarm fire included 5 chief officers, 5 engine companies, 3 ladder trucks, 1 rescue squad, 33 firefighters, 1 safety officer, 2 arson investigators, along with breathing support and mutual aid from Riverside County Fire, American Medical Response, City of Riverside Public Works and Public Utilities, and the Riverside Police Department.  Once the visible fire was extinguished, it still took several days before a complete search inside the building for potential victims could begin due to the unstableness of the structure and smoldering areas within. Riverside Police maintained a security presence around fire scene overnight during this time.  As part of the collaborative investigation, the Police Department’s Problem Oriented Policing Team and Fire Department’s Arson Investigators were able to develop information into the identities of two local transients who were believed to have been involved in setting this fire. On Wednesday, May 31st, both suspects were located and arrested in the 2900 block of Iowa Avenue.  41-year-old Isaac Gutierrez Avila of Riverside was later booked into the Robert Presley Detention Center for arson and various misdemeanor warrants. He is still in custody held on $50,000 bail. 40-year-old Pasha Sadavandi of Riverside was also booked into the Robert Presley Detention Center as an accessory to arson, and still in custody held on $25,000 bail.  Almost 6 million gallons of water were used to mitigate this fire utilizing rotating engine crews for 16 hours straight. The building is owned by the City of Riverside and its estimated monetary loss is in the millions of dollars. The building has since been completely torn down.  This investigation is still ongoing and there are no further details to release at this time. Anyone with additional information regarding this building fire and arrests should contact Fire Captain Ray Mendoza at (951) 826-5640 or [email protected], or POP Officer Mike Smith at (951) 826-8715 or [email protected].

(KGTV) – All that remains at Linda Churchill’s home in Jacumba is singed sections of pages, torched pieces of timber, and plenty of ash. It’s the heartbreaking loss of losing your home.  “It was an awful thing. You know, I mean, everything I owned was toast within such a short period of time,” Churchill, whose home was destroyed by a fire, said.  Churchill - a painter and muralist – told ABC10News she was painting in her living room, which is also her studio, nearly two weeks ago on May 21. She said she heard a strange noise and went to her front door.  “The smoke was coming from that direction, and I ran to the front yard, and it was already going up into the trees,” Churchill said.  Churchill didn’t have cell phone service. So, she grabbed her phone and laptop, drove to her neighbor up the hill, got a signal and called 911.  “Within an hour and 15 minutes, it was like bomb. It was completely flattened,” Churchill said.  The fire took dozens of her paintings, a collection of her friends’ artwork and decades’ worth of sketchbooks.  Adding fiery insult to injury, Churchill lost some four-legged friends in the fire.  “You know, and I regret I didn’t go upstairs and save my dog. My dog is my companion. I have to live with that,” Churchilll said. “I had three kitties. Two of them have been discovered, and the third I don’t know yet.”  As Linda works to get her ID, passport and much more back, her close friend Doreen Cruz is putting the call out to the community to help her friend who’s lost everything.  “People want to help. And one way to do that was to set up the Fire On The Mountain Linda Churchill GoFundMe,” Cruz said.  Cruz said the outpour of support for her long-time friend has been extremely generous.  “For a woman who is an independent artist, has worked all her life doing that,” Cruz said. “Every time they might walk by one of her murals, they’re getting a smile or a piece of joy and this is the woman who did that work.”  A woman grateful for all of the support she's getting and looking to rise from the ashes.  “The thing recently is everybody that I see, ‘Linda, we love you.

Photo: Go Nakamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images  A California judge on Wednesday dismissed all criminal charges against Pacific Gas & Electric in the deadly Zogg Fire and PG&E agreed to a $50 million civil settlement with Shasta County officials over the matter.  The big picture: The utility was charged with manslaughter and other crimes in connection with the Northern California wildfire that killed four people, including an 8-year-old girl, and burned hundreds of homes in 2020 after investigators found the blaze was sparked by a tree that fell onto a PG&E transmission line.  However, a Shasta Superior Court judge in a tentative ruling found there wasn't enough evidence to show that PG&E had committed criminal conduct or that the tree was a known risk before the Zogg Fire ignited and dismissed the charges, per the Sacramento Bee, which obtained a copy of the ruling.  Shasta County District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said in a statement Wednesday that due to the ruling, she moved to secure an agreement with PG&E that protects the community.  Details: As part of the resolution, PG&E has agreed to pay $45 million to support organizations dedicated to rebuilding and assisting communities affected by the fire, according to statements from the Shasta County D.A. and PG&E.  It has also agreed to a $5 million penalty to Shasta County.  And the utility committed to projects to reduce wildfire risks, including installing new weather monitoring stations and removing abandoned power lines.  What they're saying: Bridgett said at a news conference Wednesday that the agreement doesn't make her happy as her goal was ""taking PG&E to trial and holding them criminally responsible.""  The resolution ""doesn't bring back the people who lost their lives"" nor the homes lost to the fire, she said.  But Bridgett added that she and her office wanted to do all they could to ""keep our community safe and to prevent any future fire and get the needed services into our community to do just that, and that is exactly what this resolution does.""  Meanwhile, PG&E CEO Patti Poppe said in a statement the agreement ""reflects our continuing commitment"" to making the situation right and safe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzAxL3BnZS16b2dnLWZpcmUtc2V0dGxlbWVudC1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWNoYXJnZXMtZHJvcHBlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Four people perished last month, when a May 7 blaze tore through an Upper Manhattan apartment building.  In April, a 7-year-old and a teenager died in a Queens house fire sparked by the battery on an e-bike, officials said.  In that instance, people were forced to leap out of their windows to escape the inferno, which broke out inside the vestibule of the two-story building at 25-71 46th St. in Astoria and quickly spread up the stairs, fire officials said.  On Jan. 20, Modesto Collado, 63, was killed and 10 others hurt after a charging e-bike battery fueled a fast-moving fire that tore through a home in East Elmhurst, Queens.  Lithium-ion battery blazes also claimed one person in the Bronx and another in Brooklyn.  Lithium-ion batteries from e-bikes and similar devices have fueled 92 fires, injured 64 people, and caused nine deaths so far this year.  E-bikes should not be charged overnight or when residents are out, nor should they be stored near windows or exits, the FDNY has warned. Peter Gerber  In 2021, four persons died and 79 were injured in 104 lithium-ion battery-fueled blazes in homes, fire officials said.  Last year, those numbers took a concerning climb: six people were killed and 142 hurt in 220 battery-related fires.  Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens) has introduced legislation to ban electric scooters and bikes until safeguards are in place.  City landlords were required to post an FDNY safety guide by April 30 warning apartment dwellers about fires caused by e-bike batteries. Peter Gerber  “The reckless rush to legalize e-mobility devices without regulation has unleashed a terrifying wave of fires, injuries, and tragic deaths,” Holden told The Post. “It’s heartbreaking to witness the consequences of the previous City Council’s ill-advised actions as these incidents become more and more common.”  Holden wants electric scooters and e-bikes to be “registered, licensed, inspected, and insured like any other motor vehicle. If we fail to take action, we’ll continue to witness the loss of precious lives.”  City landlords were required to post an FDNY safety guide by April 30 warning apartment dwellers about fires caused by e-bike batteries.  “The reckless rush to legalize e-mobility devices without regulation has unleashed a terrifying wave of fires, injuries, and tragic deaths,” said Councilman Robert Holden.

They should also have approved certification markings.  The owners of one luxe 44-story building on West 57th Street last week informed its tenants that “Effective immediately, electric micro-mobility devices, including but not limited to electric scooters, electric bicycles, personal e-mobility devices, light electrical vehicle applications, and any other devices with a lithium-ion battery, can no longer be stored in bike rooms.”  “It’s a smart move because these lithium-ion batteries are scary,” a building tenant told The Post. “If one explodes they can all go up in flames.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzAzL2UtYmlrZS1iYXR0ZXJ5LWZpcmVzLXRoaXMteWVhci1oYXZlLWtpbGxlZC1tb3JlLWluLW55Yy10aGFuLWluLTIwMjItZmRueS_SAWtodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wMy9lLWJpa2UtYmF0dGVyeS1maXJlcy10aGlzLXllYXItaGF2ZS1raWxsZWQtbW9yZS1pbi1ueWMtdGhhbi1pbi0yMDIyLWZkbnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WTOC) - Multiple fire crews responded to a trash fire at the Republic Services Landfill off Augusta Road.  Port Wentworth Fire Chief Lance Moore says it wasn’t the scale of the fire itself that made things so difficult- it was the amount of trash involved and the availability of water.  Crews from Port Wentworth fire were called to the landfill around 10 p.m. on Friday night and when they showed up, they found tons of trash and the building that was housing it, on fire.  Multiple fire departments were called in to help, including from Effingham County, Pooler, and Garden City.  Even with all the help it wasn’t until 2 p.m. on Saturday that the flames were under control.  ”It took a while to get water supply established- it’s tanker shuttles,’ Port Wentworth Chief Lance Moore said.  Meaning that tankers were forced to leave the landfill, fill up with water at a fire hydrant, then drive back to the landfill to use the water- all because there was no water source on site.  When the fire was finally out- crews continued leaving to get water, moving instead to snuff out hotspots in the tons of burned trash.  “It’s just a tedious process. Most of the garbage, is what it is, there was a fire throughout the building, and really the only way to deal with it is to get machinery, take it out one bucket at a time, put water on it one bucket at a time, and keep going from there,” Moore said.  The process took hours but was familiar to the crews doing it.  Moore says that just last month, they were called out to fight a fire in the exact same spot.  ”That was a little smaller scale because there was less product in the building, but it was the same situation, same scenario, and we did the same exact operations to get it under control.  ”The cause of the fire is under investigation.

GEORGE — Personnel from multiple fire fighting agencies conducted simulations and tested new vehicles Saturday morning in Dammeron Valley.  Exercises were simulated in the field, focusing on quickly attacking wildland fires that interface with an urban environment.  In other words, they practiced fighting wildfires that threaten to burn homes and structures.  The training comes right as the wildfire season is expected to flare up.  Washington County Fire Warden Heber Heyder was one of several Utah fire wardens leading their crews in Saturday’s simulations, dubbed the Utah Wildland Engine Training.  “We train year round, especially in the summertime, getting ready for the wildland (fire) season, which is shaping up to be fairly busy for us down here in the low country,” Heyder told St. George News. “I think we will see activity — whether that’s more than usual remains to be seen.”  About 30 or 40 firefighters gathered in the staging area at Dammeron Valley Fire Department to get briefed before the simulations started.  Fire fighting agencies from the city, county and state level all gathered together for the simulations, preparing for large-scale operations that might have to be utilized in the future.  “Wildland-urban interface is what we’re training on today,” Heyder stated. “So structure triage, structure protection. Also to get our cooperators working together and familiar with each other and with tactics that we use in Southwest Utah.”  Another focus at the event was to educate and familiarize fire fighters with new equipment.  “Absolutely, become familiar with new equipment they need to use, break it in, get to that point where they don’t have to think about it, just get in and use it efficiently and effectively,” Heyder noted.  After simulated emergency calls came through dispatch, engines from multiple districts rolled out from the Dammeron Valley Fire Department and dispersed to seven different sites featuring 15 different homes around the valley.  Engine teams at each site learned to evaluate the simulated threat to the structures present and determine an attack plan.  Also important was to determine the hose lays, which is the pattern of laying fire hoses around structures to facilitate maximum water flow.  Each engine crew worked the site and then had their assessments and attack plans discussed by mentors and instructors, going over what they did or didn’t do in their simulations and what might have worked better.  Personnel were told at the briefing that there was no right or wrong way to do things, rather, the purpose of the simulation was to become everyone familiar with what will be needed in the event of an incident in the area.

Tips to stay fire safe, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources:  Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.    Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.  It’s illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  You can use a burn barrel with a screen on top to burn paper, leaves and natural materials.

Hosted in partnership with Marshall Together and the Community Foundation, the groundbreaking celebration marks the beginning of the “tangible progress” made by the condominium’s homeowners association, the city of Louisville and various community partners.  “It’s been a long, long road to get to this point since that fateful day when not just us, but nearly 1,100 persons and families and homes got displaced,” said Mark Appelfeller, the HOA board president and a Wildflower resident who lost his home in the Dec. 30, 2021 blaze.  After facing unique challenges in rebuilding, the complex received the permits required to build two weeks ago, according to Appelfeller.  “About last weekend, I felt like a kid out of school on the last day of school — it felt so good to finally get to that point,” he said.  One challenge the community faced in rebuilding was the initial debris removal process, according to Billy O’Donnell, a former engineer and Wildflower resident who lost his home in the fire.  “You couldn’t take soil samples, and you need to take soil samples because the debris was here,” O’Donnell said. “So everything had to go in sequence.”  O’Donnell volunteered to be on the HOA board after the fire, lending his experience in engineering and construction. He and the board worked alongside many organizations, engineers and experts.  “With the help of an awful lot of people … we’ve gotten to this point,” Appelfeller said.  Although the groundbreaking ceremony marks an important milestone, there is still much to be done.  Construction is expected to take between 12 and 15 months, after most homeowners’ insurance coverage for alternative living expenses has expired.  Appelfeller compared the process to training for and running a race.  “We have gotten something done, but we spent a year and a half in training — we’re just now at the starting line,” he said. “It’s not a 10K; it’s a marathon. We’re going to be involved in this for quite a few more months.”  Despite much lying ahead, community members in attendance expressed gratitude toward the community, various people who have helped with the project and the firefighters who responded the day of the fire and were also at the groundbreaking.  “It means a lot to see all of the support and help that the whole community has given,” said Deborah Fahey, a member of the Louisville City Council who also lost her home in the fire. “Now it’s up to us to build our houses, and congratulations on getting this done.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWNhbWVyYS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wMy9tYXJzaGFsbC1maXJlLWxvdWlzdmlsbGUtcmVzaWRlbnRzLWJyZWFrLWdyb3VuZC1vbi1yZWJ1aWxkaW5nLW9mLXdpbGRmbG93ZXItY29uZG9taW5pdW1zLWNvbXBsZXgv0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5Y2FtZXJhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2LzAzL21hcnNoYWxsLWZpcmUtbG91aXN2aWxsZS1yZXNpZGVudHMtYnJlYWstZ3JvdW5kLW9uLXJlYnVpbGRpbmctb2Ytd2lsZGZsb3dlci1jb25kb21pbml1bXMtY29tcGxleC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An air quality alert was issued for nearby residents that advised them to remain inside to avoid breathing in potentially hazardous material, but tests later revealed no signs of toxins.

A review of Licensing and Inspections records shows several fire-safety related violations levied against Philly Auto Salvage and parts, including failure to mount fire extinguishers withing 75 ft of each other throughout the yard.

(WDAM) - What started as a small fire turned into an acre-wide brush fire in Jones County Saturday.  Volunteer Fire Department units from Johnson, Glade, Ovett and Moselle responded to a brush fire at 664 Ira G. Odom Road about 3:45 p.m. Saturday  Upon arrival, firefighters found a brush fire spread across about 3/4 acre to 1 acre with a power pole and a 15-foot-by-10 shop in flames as well.  Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze and stop the spread of the fire, protecting the nearby home.  Resident Zane Stewart said he had a small fire burning and it got out of control and spread across the yard.  The driveway was about 1/5 of a mile long and in poor condition.  Firefighters were only able to access this residence with small brush trucks. Tankers also responded, but had to remain on Ira G. Odom Road due to being unable to travel the long driveway.  Safety tip  Larger fire apparatus weigh between 38,000 pounds to 60,000 pounds, so access to certain areas can be challenging.  Narrow driveways and driveways and roads in poor condition mean that fire apparatus cannot access the areas those roads lead to, which could mean a building is inaccessible to fire equipment.  Poor driveway conditions could mean loss of life or valuable property if the condition is so poor that fire equipment cannot access the scene.  Regular maintenance to keep your driveway in good condition could make a significant difference in protecting lives and minimizing property damage in the event of a fire or other emergency.

The Butter Fire was reported today around 4 p.m. The fire is approximately two-thirds of an acre and is lined. Firefighters are continuing to secure the fireline and working on mop-up.  Resources on the fire this evening are Plumas National Forest Engines 324 and 320, Greenville Rancheria Engine 2 and the Trinity Hotshots.  Butterfly Valley received heavy lightning last Monday and this fire is a holdover from that storm. The strike tree was a large diameter, multi-top white fir. There was still heat in the top of the tree, requiring firefighters to cut it.  Advertisement  The fire was also in an older fuel reduction treatment area which helped reduce fire intensity and growth, helping firefighters.  Even though thunderstorms over the past few weeks have had wetting rains, lightning fires can holdover for several weeks. They remain undetectable until dryer conditions, increased winds and other factors cause them to spread and become more visible.  On the Butter Fire, dryer conditions today led to embers falling from the strike tree and igniting surrounding vegetation, spreading the fire and producing visible smoke.  The weather forecast through next week includes a continued chance of thunderstorms.

Friday was another typical day for Michael at J and J Farms in Amherst when the weather took a drastic turn.  “We were in the barn, in the milking facility, just finishing up milking our cows when this big, huge black cloud and bolts of lightning began,” Waskiewicz said.  Lightning hit the over 100-year-old farm and destroyed barns and damaged a house on the property. Amherst fire officials said it took hours to battle the flames. Thankfully, there were no injuries and the animals are safe.  “Not in my wildest dreams that this would happen. Hundreds of acres surrounding me and lightning had to hit our barn...As you can see, it takes everything,” Waskiewicz explained.  Crews from several local towns are working to put out a fire on Meadow Street in Amherst.  Waskiewicz told Western Mass News that while his family is in shock, they’re ready to get back to work and gear up for the next harvest.  “As soon as we get this debris cleaned up and removed from the site, we’re gonna try to put a structure up, maybe of some sort, maybe a butler building because...we have all these crops in the field out here. Come September time, we need a facility by then. We need to harvest,” Waskiewicz noted.  They’re grateful for the community’s support as a GoFundMe has been set up to help pay for the damages caused. Farms have have also helped by taking in their cows.  “Lts of thanks to all the people who have shown so much concern for the dairy farm, for us as individuals, thank you very much.

The Calcasieu Refining Company is located on the Calcasieu Ship Channel roughly five miles southwest of Lake Charles, Louisiana. The plant refined products include liquid propane gas, naphtha, kerosene, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heavy vacuum gas oil.  The Lake Charles Police Department said that initially an evacuation order was issued for people within 1.5 mile radius of the plant, including Graywood, with a shelter-in-place order issued for a 5 mile radius of Tank Farm Road. Authorities have since reduced the shelter-in-place order down to 3 miles.  Authorities say a large tank is on fire; the Lake Charles Fire Department described it as a “crude oil tank fire” but the specific contents that are burning have yet to be confirmed by multiple sources. While the refinery said lightning was to blame, there are also contradicting stories with how the blaze started. Weather RADAR does show numerous thunderstorms moving through Louisiana this evening.  The Port Director for the harbor, Ricky Self, told an NBC affiliate in the area that the plant was home to another fire on Thursday that may have started in an area where motor oil was stored for company vehicles. It isn’t clear if that fire is at all related to today’s.  Video from the region shows a a very large thick column of black smoke rising from the refining plant.

"fire","2023-05-31","21:30:00","Not Discerned","2023-06-02T15:47:54","DELMAR – What fire officials are categorizing as one of the largest fires in Bethlehem in 30 years has led Bethlehem police to arrest a 35-year-old Delmar man on Friday, June 2, for lying to the police about sparking the fire.  Juan W. Miranda, who lived in one of the burned buildings, allegedly was smoking a marijuana cigarette in the courtyard between 9 and 11 Equinox Court shortly before the fire started and discarded the end into the yard. The spark triggered a fast-moving fire from what witnesses say was a buildup of highly flammable and fuzzy poplar seeds and brush near the house.  Miranda allegedly tried to extinguish the fire with 5-gallon buckets of water, which delayed calling 911.  Later, in interviews with fire investigators, Miranda allegedly told a different story that led to the charge.  On Tuesday, May 30, at approximately 7:30 p.m. Slingerlands, Elsmere, Selkirk, North Bethlehem, McKownville, Westmere and Delmar Volunteer fire departments responded to a fire at the Deer Run Apartment complex just off Kenwood Avenue for the report of a structure fire.  What they found was an inferno.  “Never in my 30 years of experience that I have been involved or in command where we arrived at a scene with two, four-unit apartment buildings fully involved with fire coming through the roof,” Slingerlands Chief Craig Sleurs said.  The fire started at the four-unit apartment building at 9 Equinox Court and quickly spread to the building next door and the woods behind the buildings. By the time firefighters arrived, the fire moved through the ravine in the rear of the two buildings and advanced back up the slope towards Kenwood Avenue.  “The fire burned down in the ravine and then came up towards Kenwood,” Sleurs said. “It was really roaring there.”  Fire fighters now had three distinct fires, and water to feed the various high-pressure hoses quickly became a problem at the scene.  “It wasn’t that the town wasn’t giving us water (through the hydrants), it just wasn’t enough,” Sleurs said. “With three separate fires at once and three tower trucks, three pumper trucks, three two and one half inch Blitz fire lines and four additional hand lines, it was never going to be enough water through hydrants alone in this situation.”  There is a fire hydrant 25 feet from the first building, but it is fed with one 8-inch diameter pipe connected to a main on Kenwood Avenue between two other hydrants, according to Bethlehem DPW Superintendent George Kansas. It was functioning, but drawing water from all three hydrants at the same time limited water inflow to the middle connection. He estimated that the departments could draw between 1.500-3,000 gallons of water a minute from the line depending on the equipment pulling.  The bottom line is that they needed more water.  “We quickly realized we needed to set up an additional water supply with our tankers,” Sleurs said.  Fire departments set up a 3,000 gallon temporary water pond fed by additional tanker fire trucks from Onesquethaw and New Salem to help supply the three fire attacks.  It took two hours to bring the fires under control. Departments had to return the next morning to extinguish the rubble again after it reignited.  What was left was devastating to the eight families that lived in the two buildings. The Red Cross responded to the scene just after 9:30 p.m. to assist them. Slingerlands Volunteer Fire Department will be holding a fundraiser breakfast to benefit the families 8-12 noon on Sunday, June 18, at the firehouse on New Scotland Road, and the Albany County Burn Fund is providing assistance as well. Further information will be posted on the department’s website and facebook page.  The start of the fire was under investigation within an hour, but the speed with which it spread was evident immediately.  The property has an abundance of poplar trees that shed a fluffy-white fuzz that is actually made up of seeds shed from female trees this time of year. The seeds are rich in oil, which makes them burn faster.  According to one resident, piles of the substance were a foot deep in some spots where the wind pushed it.  “Last week there were piles of the stuff up to your knees,” Randy Nemeckay, a resident of 11 Equinox Court, said. “I wish the owners cleaned up the property better.”  The fire was able to spread on the ground and also through the trees, setting the second building and woods a blaze. Multiple residents also said that dry brush was not cleared from around the area after earlier storms and that added additional problems.  On Wednesday, the trees between and behind the buildings had gobs of white fuzz with burnt points hanging from between the leaves and the ground was again covered with seed fuzz in areas.  One thing the residents said clearly was how first responders handled the situation.  “I just don’t have enough kudos for the police and fire people who came,” said one woman who did not want to use her name. “They were amazing, and without them, this could have spread and we all could have been out.”  The Red Cross provided assistance to the eight families that were displaced the night of the fire.  “The Red Cross handed us cards for immediate needs. They were really good to us,” Nemeckay said. “You just never expect this to happen to you, until it does.”  He said that he lost everything in the fire as was evident by looking at the structures. The second floors on both buildings were completely gone and the contents of the interior strewn about the yard.  Other residents were looking for what was left.  “I did find a few things, but I am not sure I will ever get the smell out of them,” one person said while holding some shoes and pictures. “It is just hard right now to think.”  While no residents were injured at the blaze, several pets died in the fire, and one firefighter had to be treated for heat exhaustion. He had recovered the next day.  Miranda was charged with Making a False Written Statement, a misdemeanor and was given an appearance ticket for Bethlehem Town Court on Tuesday, June 20.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvdGxpZ2h0bmV3cy5jb20vdG93bnMvYmV0aGxlaGVtLzIwMjMvMDYvMDIvYXJyZXN0LW1hZGUtaW4tZGVsbWFyLWRlZXItcnVuLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eden Prairie fire officials say three of the four people who were injured during an overnight fire involving two homes have been released from the hospital.  Out of the four people who had non-life-threatening injuries, two of them were children. Officials say both of the kids have been released, as well as one adult. The other adult is still being treated for burns.  According to fire officials, there are five pets still unaccounted for – two dogs and three cats.  Firefighters say flames broke out around 12:30 a.m. Friday along the 10000 block of Lee Drive. Multiple agencies were called in to help put out the fire, which was a big job, especially due to the heat.  “Our crews did an outstanding job,” said Eden Prairie Fire Chief Scott Gerber.  Gerber says the victims who were injured made it out of the two burning homes, but they had mild or moderate injuries.  Neighbors say they heard loud booms just before seeing the flames, and that it was a scary site to see. In addition, the surrounding neighborhood was evacuated as a precaution for a brief period of time.  “A huge bang, like a firecracker or dynamite, and then went outside and then another bang,” said neighbor Steve Hunt. “Looks like they got the fire out quickly – I bet 10-15 minutes – it’s extinguished though, so those flames were shooting up 30 yards I bet.”  Hunt added a glass was knocked off a table inside his home.  Now, cleanup work begins as investigators work to figure out what caused the two homes to burn.  “I can’t tell you 100%, but likely, one of the structures ignited from the first structure that was started as well,” said Gerber.  Both of the homes had significant damage due to the fire, which also affected other buildings in the vicinity.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL3RvcC1uZXdzLzItY2hpbGRyZW4tYW1vbmctNC1ob3NwaXRhbGl6ZWQtZm9sbG93aW5nLW92ZXJuaWdodC1lZGVuLXByYWlyaWUtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-06-03T02:50:12","FLAGSTAFF — The firefighters made their way through the dense Coconino National Forest, their drip torches leaving behind a clear trail of new fire.  As the pine needles on the ground quickly burned, the crews were left with a distinct black line of ash signifying the fire's containment line alongside a dirt road.  Their effort Friday is the latest in the U.S. Forest Service's response to the lightning-caused Volunteer Fire burning about 20 miles southeast of Flagstaff.  While the nearly 100-person crew is trying to fully suppress this fire, they are doing so using an indirect strategy that uses the landscape to their advantage.  ""We're using some modified, indirect tactics to make sure that the fire, one, stays where we want it to stay, and two, protect the values that are at risk surrounding this,"" said Aaron Graeser, operations section chief for the Volunteer Fire.  Crews are burning untreated areas along the fire perimeter and using existing roadways as containment lines, eliminating the majority of the remaining fuel on the ground should the fire start moving.  A priority has been placed on protecting areas adjacent to the fire perimeter, including the Navajo Army Depot to the north, a Mexican spotted owl habitat along the eastern edge of the fire on Mooney Mountain and acres of private land with ranches and homes scattered throughout.  Burning ground fuels and limiting a fire's ability to spread have been essential in the effectiveness of these fire suppression strategies. Past fires that have altered the landscape have assisted in suppressing the new fire as well.  When the Volunteer Fire started May 23, much of it was contained to the burn scar left after the 2020 Rafael Fire, which significantly limited the potential fuels for the fire and allowed fire officials to better manage its movement.  Friday's prescribed burns were essentially designed to do the same thing.  ""Having those areas of landscape that have recently burned allows us to, on the worst days, be able to control where a fire occurs,"" said Nick Mustoe, deputy district ranger with the Flagstaff Ranger District.  Prescribed burns are possible only because of a perfect cocktail of conditions. In this case, a wet winter and spring followed by a cooler-than-average start to summer have allowed officials to start and maintain prescribed burns with minimal risk of them growing out of control.  ""This is the window,"" Mustoe said.  It's been such a unique year in terms of weather, he said, that fire officials are balancing wildfire response and potential prescribed fires.  This has required balancing resources to ensure all of the planned work gets done while they are still able to respond to wildfires when they occur.  ""We're trying to the extent that we can to not overcommit to any one area,"" Mustoe said. ""We want to be able to do as much as we can do in a year that has given us plenty of opportunity to put fire on the ground.""  In an area with so much land that has already burned, the current risk of a runaway wildfire is considerably lower than it was a decade ago.  ""Fire risk for this area for the next, maybe five to 10 years, isn't that high, and it's because of the work that we're doing today,"" Mustoe said.

The fire happened in the area of 220 S. 200 East, where crews were battling a fire at an abandoned building late Friday night.  “Crews were met with what we experienced and believed to be a smoke explosion,” explained Salt Lake City Fire Capt. Shaun Mumedy, whose crews arrived around 11:20 p.m. “That whole street level, the first-floor windows blew out right as we were arriving. Glass and smoke going approximately 50 feet clear out into the street area here behind us.”  Neither fire crews nor bystanders were injured.  Crews are planning an immediate demolition of the vacant structure so that people who live nearby can go home safely.  About 55 units at the Randi apartments right next to the structure were evacuated. Those homes were filled with smoke and the proximity to the flames was unsafe for people to live in until it was put out completely. The American Red Cross was on scene to help those who were displaced, providing food, water and shelter. Others in the area were impacted because they couldn’t get into their homes until the fire department said it was safe to do so.  Andrew Simmons lives in the apartments across the street and saw what happened.  “About to go to sleep and then just started hearing a bunch of sirens, ambulances, fire trucks,"" he said.  He was not evacuated, but was not allowed to go back inside the perimeter in the morning while crews were working to battle the blaze.  “Hopefully by the time we get back tonight, we can go back in. Not ideal circumstances,"" Simmons said.  With 200 East closed between 200 and 300 South, businesses on that block were closed and could not open for the day — including Ken Sanders Rare Books.  “It’s definitely a bummer. We were excited about the foot traffic with the Pride Festival, and Saturday is usually our best day,” said Madeline Clement, an employee at the bookstore.  Kathie Chadbourne owns From the Ground Up, a nearby cafe, and she said she met people who had been evacuated.  “People started screaming and running around and leaving the apartments and grabbing animals, and so that’s what the stories were this morning. There have been a few people that have come in, just coming in for coffee and tea, just gathering,"" she said.  Ultimately, she was just glad that no one was hurt.  “I’m so grateful everyone is OK. Everybody got out, and they’re being watched over beautifully.

The risk of fire exists even when the vehicle is parked and turned off. This month, the company will notify affected owners of the fire risk, advising them to park outside until they can have their vehicles fixed. Owners will be instructed to take their vehicle to a Lincoln dealer to have an in-line fuse added to the battery monitor sensor power circuit.

(KTVZ) – Residents escaped a fire late Friday night that heavily damaged a home northeast of Redmond – caused by the heat of a butane lighter on a bed – but two dogs were taken from the home by firefighters and given oxygen to recover.  Redmond Fire & Rescue was alerted around 11:45 p.m. to the possible structure fire in the 3400 block of Northeast 33rd Street, Fire Marshal Tom Mooney said.  Deschutes County sheriff’s deputies were first on scene and confirmed all residents had safely evacuated the home, where flames were coming from a bedroom window.  ""Fire crews quickly deployed handlines and made an aggressive interior fire attack and were able to get the fire under control within a few minutes of arriving on scene,"" Mooney said in a news release early Saturday.  Firefighters located two dogs during their search of the home and removed them.  ""Fire crews quickly deployed the pet oxygen masks carried on all Redmond Fire & Rescue engines and life-saving measures were taken,"" Mooney wrote, ""Both dogs responded well to the treatment and are doing well.""  Fire investigators conducted interviews and analyzed the fire debris and patterns to determine the fire’s cause. Mooney said they determined “a small handheld butane lighter that was used to light a cigarette was placed on a nearby bed, and the hot metal on the lighter quickly ignited the bedding and mattress,” Mooney said.  The investigators also found that the home did not have working smoke alarms. “This is a good reminder to install working smoke alarms within your home and to test them on a regular basis,” the fire marshal said.  The residents were displaced by the fire, which caused significant damage, and the Red Cross was called in to provide assistance.

As crews worked to put out the blaze, smoke, and flames from this fire could be seen and smelled from miles away.  UPDATE- Aliquippa Chief Dave Foringer told us the fire call came in at 4 AM as a brushfire, but upon arrival, they saw one building was fully engulfed and the fire was spreading. This quickly became a 3 alarm fire. As of 6 AM, crew still working, but fire is out. @KDKA pic.twitter.com/CxWUHO1Z0h — Christopher DeRose (@ChrisDeRoseTV) June 3, 2023  A massive fire broke out early this morning in West Aliquippa, resulting in multiple units responding, and luckily, no one was hurt.  Around 4 a.m., firefighters rushed to Erie Avenue for a report of a brush fire, which turned into multiple buildings fully engulfed.  The call went out to fire units from nearby Rochester, Monaca, Ambridge, Baden, and Bever Falls, and soon, this neighborhood was filled with men and women working to put out the blaze.  Aliquippa Fire Chief Dave Foringer said he is grateful for the units that responded and that everyone, including the firefighters, got out safely.  ""We had a pretty good turnout. It ended up being a three-alarm fire, so we had units from Bever and Allegheny County. Fortunately, only one of the buildings was occupied and was residential; we had a small business in the other one, but nobody was injured, and no firefighters were injured fighting the fire.""  The business that burned in this blaze that the chief spoke of had been closed for some time. And while no one was in the building when the fire started, owner Frank Wilczynski said everything he had been storing inside the space, including two classic cars, was destroyed.  [I am feeling] very sick. Very sick. I've been up for an hour and a half, and they called me. It took this time for me to muster up and get here. No insurance. It's all a total loss.""

KNOX TWP. − A fire early Saturday about four miles east of Alliance burned down a building housing a used car business in northwestern Columbiana County, a fire official said.  There were no injuries.  North Georgetown Volunteer Fire Department Chief Ed Reichenbach said a neighbor reported a fire at Western Reserve Auto Sales on U.S. Route 62 about 2:30 a.m. No one was on the property at 25933 U.S. Route 62 at the time. The business, which sells used cars, is just south of the stretch of U.S. Route 62 that's the boundary between Columbiana and Mahoning counties.  Related:North Georgetown, Sebring fire departments to upgrade radio system  Related:Fire destroys 197-year-old Stagecoach Inn  About 35 firefighters from several nearby fire departments responded, along with a water tanker truck. The flames destroyed the large building, which had a car shop, offices and two or three vehicles inside. It took the firefighters about three hours to put out the fire. By 7:30 a.m., the firefighters had cleared the scene. Reichenbach said the building also had living quarters, but no one was living in them.  In addition to the vehicles inside the building, three or four other cars and a couple of motorcycles outside were destroyed. The business' owner, whom Reichenbach said appeared at the scene, had insurance.  Reichenbach said he had no estimate yet as to a damage total. He said the Ohio State Fire Marshal's office is investigating to determine what caused the blaze.  North Georgetown and Homeworth Fire in Columbiana County have an agreement to jointly provide fire protection in Knox Township, which is Columbiana County's northwest corner.  The other departments responding were Sebring Fire and EMS, Beloit Fire EMS, Damascus Fire Department and Green Township Fire in Mahoning County, along with Washington Township and Lexington Township fire departments in Stark County.  Winona Fire Department in Columbiana County sent firefighters and trucks to North Georgetown's fire station in case other calls came in during the auto dealership blaze.  North Georgetown fire in a Facebook post also thanked many others who assisted.  Stark Fire Department Rehab Unit responded to the scene and provided drinks to firefighters and a place for them to recover from battling the flames. The Ohio State Highway Patrol along with Sebring Police and Smith Township Police, based in Mahoning County, closed U.S. Route 62 to traffic and detoured vehicles around the scene. Johnny's Excavating, based in North Georgetown, provided equipment to help the firefighters handle hotspots. And a McDonald's in Alliance donated food to the firefighters, according to a comment on the Homeworth Fire Department's Facebook account.

The blaze, centered in Grayling Township about 50 miles from Traverse City, is spreading west and southwest and threatening multiple buildings, the state's Department of Natural Resources said in a statement, CNN reported.  ""Evacuations are being conducted by emergency personnel,"" the department said.  A five-mile stretch of Interstate 75 was shut down in both directions as crews battle the fire, and a temporary flight restriction was issued for a five-mile perimeter around the fire below 5,000 feet.  Firefighters are attacking the flames from the ground and the air, with aircraft scooping water from Neff Lake, Shellenbarger Lake and Lake Margrethe, according the statement.  Crawford County Sheriff Ryan Swope said in a statement that power in the area has been shut off for the safety of firefighters working under power lines.  It's still unknown what sparked the fire, the Department of Natural Resources said in its statement earlier.  The fire is burning as Michigan sees ""unprecedented"" hot and dry conditions for this time of year, setting the stage extreme fire danger, the statement added.  The wildfire produced thick smoke in the area Saturday, and the department warned nearby residents to limit exposure to wildfire smoke by staying indoors with windows shut.  The Department of Natural Resources also said visibility may be reduced on roadways.  Warm temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry fuels will all combine fuel the risk of fires in the days ahead, the National Weather Service in Grand Rapids said in a tweet.

Elizabeth Goyette is the administrative assistant at the First Congregational Church of Spencer and was called to the church to check out the fire alarm that had gone off.

Cloud cover helped crews on the ground by cooling the fire area, reducing fire behavior, and making fuels more receptive to suppression tactics. Crews continue to patrol the fire perimeter, locating and extinguishing hot spots and documenting fire effects.  Today’s focus is to begin cleanup and preparation, on Road 21, in the event of fire movement to the west. In the Gila Wilderness fire is moving south towards Indian Creek. Rock and sparse fuels are creating a natural barrier to fire spread. Lookouts on Yellow Mountain are monitoring fire movement in the area, ready to respond if necessary. The plan is to keep the fire on the east side of Indian Creek. Beaver Creek is in monitor status and the fire is tied into the bluff above the creek. A module of firefighters trained to observe and document the effects of the fire on the landscape has been deployed into the area.  Weather: The next few days will begin sunny with clouds building towards the afternoon. A chance of thunderstorms is in the forecast over the fire area through Tuesday. A shift to northerly winds, yesterday, caused smoke to move into the Silver City area. This is expected to clear today as winds shift back to the west.  Aviation Restrictions: ATemporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is still in place over the Pass Fire. All non-fire aircraft are restricted. This includes civilian drones. Unauthorized aircraft in the area will ground firefighting aircraft, hindering firefighting efforts.  Closures: The Gila National Forest remains open. Visitors are encouraged to use extreme caution when driving near the fire area due to the presence of firefighters and equipment and the potential for decreased visibility due to the high volume of smoke.

(supplied photo) The scene of the fire on Pine Street. (supplied photo)  By Sydney Leyerle  Special to the Sentinel-Tribune  PERRYSBURG — A Perrysburg family is asking the community for help after losing everything in a house fire.  On May 25, Jessica Colo and her family lost their rental home at 946 Pine St. after it caught fire that evening. The fire took emergency personnel almost four hours to put out. The family was not home at the time, but everything inside the house was destroyed or damaged.  Through a GoFundMe started by a friend, Colo said she is hoping to raise enough money to help her family purchase the necessities.  The family of four, which includes Colo, her husband, and their two young children, need everything from clothes to cribs and strollers. Also lost in the fire was a brace worn by Colo’s son. Due to being born with a clubfoot, Colo said her son must wear a brace every night, but they lost the brace in the fire and haven’t been able to purchase a new one yet.  Some items in the garage and outside the house were destroyed or damaged. Colo said they had two cars that were damaged, both of which are new, one with the temporary tags still on it. Her husband’s motorcycles were also destroyed in the fire.  “We’re not by any means trying to buy new motorcycles or anything like that, it (donations) would be for like diapers, clothes, new beds for my kids,” Colo said.  The family is living with Colo’s mother as they search for a new rental home.  In December, the family moved to Perrysburg from Indiana to be closer to family. Colo said they were living in the rental home until they could find a house of their own. Now they will stop their search for a house until they find a new rental home and have their lives back to normal.  Due to their recent move, Colo said most everything in the house had been purchased brand new. However, she said they likely won’t get much from insurance for the damages.  The family’s GoFundMe page can be found at https://gofund.me/c5b50dc7. Donations can also be taken to Hazelton and Company at 131 W. Indiana Ave. in Perrysburg. As of Thursday night, $7,360 has been raised, with a $35,000 goal.  Some have already donated clothes and toys for the kids, which Colo said she is incredibly thankful for.  “I do appreciate everybody’s support and kindness, because a lot of people have been very kind to me and us and my kids and everything,” she said. “So I really appreciate it, brought them (the kids) toys and things like that.”  The cause of the fire is still unknown but is under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8wMS9maXJlLWRlc3Ryb3lzLWFsbC1iZWxvbmdpbmdzLW9mLXBlcnJ5c2J1cmctZmFtaWx5LWluY2x1ZGluZy1zb25zLXNwZWNpYWwtYnJhY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(AP) - A Florida woman faces charges of aggravated child neglect and arson after her car became engulfed in flames while she was allegedly shoplifting at a mall, according to an arrest report.  Alicia Moore, 24, parked her car in a parking lot outside a Dillard’s department store at Oviedo Mall on May 26, according to an arrest report filed by the Oviedo Police Department. The report indicated Moore left children inside the vehicle. Their names and ages were redacted.  Security saw Moore and an unknown man shoplifting in Dillard’s, according to the report. After about an hour, Moore began leaving Dillard’s to see her car engulfed in flames and dropped the merchandise before she left the store.  Bystanders at the mall saw the car and rescued the children inside trying to escape the flames. The children were taken to Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children. One child suffered first degree burns “to her face and ears,” the arrest report said.  Moore has been charged with aggravated child neglect for allegedly allowing children who could not care for themselves alone inside the vehicle, according to the report.  Police said they don’t know what caused the fire but said it’s unlikely the children would have been injured if Moore “was not being neglectful.” Moore was charged with arson because the fire occurred while she was allegedly committing a felony, the arrest report said.  The public defender’s office was representing Moore, according to court records. An email seeking comment sent to the office late Saturday was not immediately returned.

Police arrested Alicia Moore, 24, of Orlando on charges of aggravated child neglect and arson after flames engulfed her car, trapping her children inside, while she was allegedly shoplifting inside the Oviedo Mall on May 26, according to the arrest report obtained by NBC News.  Moore allegedly left her kids inside the 2016 Lincoln around noon that day, while she and an ""unknown male"" allegedly headed inside Dillard's department store and spent about an hour shoplifting, according to the arrest report. When she was leaving the store, she saw her car ""engulfed in flames"" and ""dropped the stolen merchandise"" and fled the store, the report states.  The car was ""completely totaled"" by the flames, the report states. One child tried to escape the car, and bystanders ultimately helped rescue them before they were rushed to Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital. One child suffered ""several first degree burns,"" including on her face and ears, according to the arrest report. The children's ages are unknown.  When interviewed by police, Moore ""stated only her biographical information"" and requested an attorney, the report says.  The Oviedo Mall in Oviedo, Fla. Google Maps  The Seminole County Sheriff's office arrested Moore on an unrelated outstanding warrant, and charged her with aggravated child neglect and arson related to the May 26 incident while she was in custody that same day. (She also faces charges of petty theft and assault and battery on a person over 65 years old in Sumter County, about 55 miles west of Orlando, according to the jail record.)  The arrest report states while the cause of the fire is unknown, Moore's neglect contributed to the children's injuries and ""the fire occurred during the commission of a felony by Moore,"" hence the charges she is facing.  Moore's bond is set at $20,000 and her arraignment is set for June 27, court records show.  She entered a not guilty plea on Friday. Her court-appointed attorney could not immediately be reached.  It was not immediately clear how much prison time she could face if convicted. Representatives for the Seminole County Sheriff's Office and the Oviedo Police Department could not immediately be reached Saturday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUtY291cnRzL2Zsb3JpZGEtbW9tLWFjY3VzZWQtbGVhdmluZy1raWRzLWNhci1jYXVnaHQtZmlyZS13YXMtYWxsZWdlZGx5LXNob3BsaWYtcmNuYTg3NTcy0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvcmNuYTg3NTcy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Firefighters say clutter inside the apartment made the firefighting effort that much more difficult.  ""It's just very hard,"" Elizabeth Marino said.  Marino started crying when she realized she knew the father killed in the apartment, and the son, who is still fighting for his life. She used to live in the building and was back to help her nephew move from his smoke-damaged floor.  ""They were a nice family. They were an Italian family, and we were very close growing up, and I'm still friendly with the daughter,"" Marino said.  Firefighters flew a drone above the 6-story building trying to determine why flames erupted from the 4th floor unit where the 71-year-old man and his 95-year-old father were living. Both victims were found unresponsive.  ""I wasn't here when they were pulled out. By the time I got here, he was just on the ground and they were doing CPR, and then they wheeled him past in the gurney,"" neighbor Andrea Roble said.  ""Very, very tight hallways. The apartment was full of clutter, which kind of delayed our accessing the apartment,"" Deputy Fire Chief Michael Barvels said. ""Once we did get into the apartment, we put water on the fire.""  The fire broke out just after 9 p.m. on the fourth floor of a six story apartment building on Sullivan Street.  ""I grabbed a couple things, and I opened my door, and the hallway was filled with smoke. The firefighters were rushing in,"" neighbor Shelby Halas said.  ""It's horrifying,"" Halas added. ""There [were] people who didn't know and they had to get carried out.""  Neighbors said the unit had a history of problems, and they contacted Adult Protective Services multiple times over odor complaints.  ""Cleanliness of the apartment, clutter, maybe stuff that was emanating from the apartment. But since I lived below, I never experienced it firsthand, but a lot of the people that lived on the upper floors had issues,"" neighbor Cary Williams said.  Firefighters say the clutter made the apartment difficult to access and delayed their firefighting efforts.  Families say despite the heavy smoke – no alarms went off.  ""I just knock on every door.

"fire","2017-11-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-30T14:06:47","Smashing rocks and rubbing sticks are the two most basic techniques to make fire, yet it is unclear which human species first mastered these incendiary procedures. To try and solve the riddle, researchers have analyzed the cognitive processes required for each method, determining that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens probably invented different modes of ignition.  Exactly when we first mastered the art of arson is something that is up for debate, with some evidence suggesting that ancient humans were using fire up to 2 million years ago, while other scholars believe the first controlled flames burned as recently as 200,000 years ago. And while the authors of the new study can’t pinpoint the first ever deliberate fire, they do propose some interesting hypotheses regarding the origins of the two main pyro-techniques.  Advertisement Advertisement  The strike-a-light method, for instance, involves smashing a nodule of flint against a suitable rock such as iron pyrite to create a spark. Interestingly, while there is no archaeological or ethnographical evidence for the use of this method in Africa, early firemaking tools of this kind are found in Upper Palaeolithic sites across Europe.  Given that Neanderthals occupied Eurasia at this time, the study authors speculate that this extinct human species may have been the users of these ancient strike-a-light kits. Analyzing the intelligence required to master the technique, they explain that “the most complex phase of strike-a-light firemaking is understanding how to turn the spark into a flame by first nurturing it into an ember.”  Noting that our ancient cousins were probably bright enough to get their heads around this concept, the researchers conclude that “based on cognition, there is no reason to argue against Neanderthals being the inventors of the strike-a-light technology.”  Friction fires, on the other hand, are a little more tricky to master, and involve the use of two different types of wood to create a fire drill. To produce an ember using such a drill, a hardwood spindle must be tapered in order to fit into a notch cut into a flat softwood fireboard.  Advertisement Advertisement  Thus, rather than simply using materials that are naturally present in the environment, this method requires the use of a manufactured toolkit with multiple interlocking parts. Given that most hunter-gatherer groups still use the fire-drill method today, the study authors propose that the technique is likely unique to Homo sapiens.  Unfortunately, ancient fire drill kits are absent from the archaeological record because wood doesn’t tend to survive over long periods. However, the fact that strike-a-light kits are not found in Africa, combined with the presence of other highly complex ancient tools, suggests that the first modern humans to emerge on the continent probably used fire drills to generate fires.  “This firemaking technology may have been invented by different Homo sapiens groups roaming the African savanna before populating the rest of the globe, where fire-drills remain the most-used hunter-gatherer firemaking technique,” they write.  Overall, then, it seems likely that Eurasian Neanderthals created fire by smashing rocks together, while modern humans in Africa invented the more sophisticated fire drill.

The fire quickly engulfed the home destroying the family’s belongings and most of their home.  “My husband was doing yard work and I was just in the house, he ran in and said call the fire department, the house is on fire,” homeowner Naomi Guidry said. “He was very frantic, I didn’t know it was that serious.”  Guidry was inside the home with her two children who were sleeping.  “You know, you don’t think it’s going to be as bad as it is, and then when you run out into your backyard and you see flames; I had a panic attack,” Guidry said.  The fire started in their laundry room.  “And it just went up from there; most of this carport is received all the damage and all of the things in the home received heavy smoke and water damage and so there’s nothing that we can salvage,” Guidry said.  Guidry said her children’s memory boxes were kept just above where the fire started.  “Baby clothes and just stuff from the hospital, and this is all my memories of them from babies was in there, it’s gone,” Guidry said.  Because of the fire, smoke, and water damage, none of their belongings are salvageable.  “You say it’s just property, that’s all you have and all of it, none of it can be salvaged,” Guidry said. “I don’t even know what to do, I don’t know where to go.”  A GoFundMe has been started to help the family.

Carpenters building a new timber frame for the fire-ravaged roof of Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral are using the same tools and techniques as their medieval predecessors. For them, working with hand-axes to fashion oak beams has been like stepping back in time. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Schaeffer) Time machine: Rebuilding Notre Dame’s fire-ravaged roof transports workers back to Middle Ages Time machine: Rebuilding Notre Dame’s fire-ravaged roof transports workers back to Middle Ages  SAINT-LAURENT-DE-LA-PLAINE, France (AP) — If time travel was possible, medieval carpenters would surely be amazed to see how woodworking techniques they pioneered in building Notre Dame Cathedral more than 800 years ago are being used again today to rebuild the world-famous monument’s fire-ravaged roof.  Certainly the reverse is true for the modern-day carpenters using medieval-era skills. Working with hand axes to fashion hundreds of tons of oak beams for the framework of Notre Dame’s new roof has, for them, been like rewinding time. It’s given them a new appreciation of their predecessors’ handiwork that pushed the architectural envelope back in the 13th century.  “It’s a little mind-bending sometimes,” says Peter Henrikson, one of the carpenters. He says there are times when he’s whacking mallet on chisel that he finds himself thinking about medieval counterparts who were cutting “basically the same joint 900 years ago.”  “It’s fascinating,” he says. “We probably are in some ways thinking the same things.”  The use of hand tools to rebuild the roof that flames turned into ashes in 2019 is a deliberate, considered choice, especially since power tools would undoubtedly have done the work more quickly. The aim is to pay tribute to the astounding craftsmanship of the cathedral’s original builders and to ensure that the centuries-old art of hand-fashioning wood lives on.  “We want to restore this cathedral as it was built in the Middle Ages,” says Jean-Louis Georgelin, the retired French Army general who is overseeing the reconstruction.  “It is a way to be faithful to the (handiwork) of all the people who built all the extraordinary monuments in France.”  Facing a tight deadline to reopen the cathedral by December 2024, carpenters and architects are also using computer design and other modern technologies to speed the reconstruction. Computers were used in the drawing of detailed plans for carpenters, to help ensure that their hand-chiseled beams fit together perfectly.  “Traditional carpenters had a lot of that in their head,” Henrikson notes. It’s “pretty amazing to think about how they did this with what they had, the tools and technology that they had at the time.”  The 61-year-old American is from Grand Marais, Minnesota. The bulk of the other artisans working on the timber frame are French.  The roof reconstruction hit an important milestone in May, when large parts of the new timber frame were assembled and erected at a workshop in the Loire Valley, in western France.  The dry run assured architects that the frame is fit for purpose. The next time it is put together will be atop the cathedral. Unlike in medieval times, it will be trucked into Paris and lifted by mechanical crane into position. Some 1,200 trees have been felled for the work.  “The objective we had was to restore to its original condition the wooden frame structure that disappeared during the fire of April 15, 2019,” says architect Remi Fromont, who did detailed drawings of the original frame in 2012.  The rebuilt frame “is the same wooden frame structure of the 13th century,” he says. “We have exactly the same material: oak. We have the same tools, with the same axes that were used, exactly the same tools. We have the same know-how. And soon, it will return to its same place.”  “It is,” he adds, “a real resurrection.”  ___  AP correspondent John Leicester in Paris contributed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZW50LXRyaWIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvdGltZS1tYWNoaW5lLXJlYnVpbGRpbmctbm90cmUtZGFtZXMtZmlyZS1yYXZhZ2VkLXJvb2YtdHJhbnNwb3J0cy13b3JrZXJzLWJhY2stdG8tbWlkZGxlLWFnZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dozens of community members gathered Tuesday night in hopes of saving the Franklin Center in the Argentine neighborhood. They believe it can be saved, but with driving rain before and after that meeting and no roof over much of the building, they’ll need to act quickly.  “I think there were many of us who feared that this would almost potentially be a funeral,” Franklin Center Board President Kurt Rietema said to open the meeting in the Franklin parking lot.  As the community gathered to hear the latest from the first walk-through Tuesday, they shared stories of the how a school built in the 1800s transformed into a community center and co-op with a coffee shop with a café.  “I helped run this place for many years. It means a lot to me. Twenty years of my life was here,” Diane Stohlmann told a small group.  “It was always here to meet the needs of the community,” Kathy Hodges said to another small group elsewhere in the parking lot.  After the Franklin Center closed in 2009, a new board worked to get it on the National Register of Historic Places. But sitting vacant, it was a target for vandals.  “Our work of taking off all the graffiti off it wasn’t easy,” said Xochitl Galves, a volunteer with monthly food distributions in the parking lot.  In the case of last week’s arson, without any electricity they couldn’t get insurance.  “This is has been my greatest fear, and it was realized last week,” Rietema said.  Plans for $5.5 million in funding to restore the building into the community center it once was, plus a health clinic, fell through right before the COVID-19 pandemic.  After the fire, the board president said realistically that plan may no longer be viable. But they still hope their prayers will be answered.  “That even though we can’t see it right now that there can be a new story that’s written for this neighborhood and this building,” Rietema prayed.  The building that withstood the 1951 Argentine flood has just mainly roof damage from the fire.  “I would call it a survivor because it is still here,” Galves said.

People who live in the Starlight Ranch community near Pershing Avenue and South Semoran Boulevard say what started as hurricane damage has turned into a possible public safety hazard.  Shortly after you enter the main entrance to the Starlight Ranch community, the bridge that connects the front of the neighborhood to the back is closed to pedestrian and vehicle traffic and has been since Hurricane Ian.  Residents say Ian caused the damage, but the ongoing repair work is restricting access to the community.  [TRENDING: Become a News 6 Insider]  Neighbors said they feel trapped in their community and the lack of communication has been frustrating.  Mary Stivale-Rivera has lived in the neighborhood for 15 years.  “This has been absolutely ridiculous,” Stivale-Rivera said. “Why is this taking so long? This is going on eight, nine months.”  During Hurricane Ian, the culvert below Wildhorse Road was washed out, causing a portion of the bridge to collapse.  Since then, Equity Lifestyle Properties, the owner of the property, has said it has been in permitting with Orange County Utilities and the St. Johns River Water Management District.  “It’s definitely an inconvenience to the entire community,” said Luis Melendez, another resident.  About three quarters of the homes cannot access the front entrance. There is a back emergency entrance that is now open, but it takes 10 to 15 minutes to drive to the front of the community to access their mailboxes, according to neighbors.  Dawn Hughes is frustrated, too.  “We do have a lot of elderly people who don’t drive anymore,” Hughes said. “We have a lot of elderly people who get medications delivered or other things delivered and if it’s a small delivery, GPS would route them around the front and they weren’t getting their deliveries.”  Residents say it’s not only an inconvenience, it’s a possible hazard.  Last November, one of the homes in the back of the community caught fire and some of the fire trucks were delayed because they went to the front entrance, according to residents.  They believe the house may have been saved if there was no delay.  “Absolutely. No doubt in my mind,” Hughes said. “Because there’s an extra 10 or 15 minutes just to get back down and around.”  They also took their concern to Orange County Commissioner Mayra Uribe.  “This is why we decided to get the fire marshal involved and have them review it,” Uribe told News 6.  Residents also say they have been given limited information about the project.  “If they would communicate and give us something, people wouldn’t be so frustrated,” Stivale-Rivera said.  Johnson Laux is doing the construction and laid out the plans for News 6.  In addition to the bridge, metal pipes underground that breached during the storm are being replaced, upgraded to reinforced concrete pipes that can handle more water.  But it will take time.  “That’s what we’re also checking on, when was this permit issued, how long is the permit good for, what’s their progress?” Uribe said.  Jennifer Ludovice, a spokesperson for Equity Lifestyle Properties, sent News 6 the following statement:  “We have been working in cooperation with the Fire Marshal’s office throughout the construction process. Representatives of the Fire Marshal’s office have been to the property since construction began on the bridge repair project, including a property inspection. The demolition phase of the project is currently underway. During the demolition process, our contractors discovered communication cables and conduit in the culvert which were not marked in any documents provided by the authorities. We are working with AT&T and Spectrum to relocate the cables and conduit now. In the meantime, we have begun working on the storm pipe down the road from the culvert while we wait for the communication cables to be relocated. While the area is under construction, the bridge must be closed to pedestrian and vehicle traffic for safety reasons - a closure which was communicated in advance to residents of the community. There are access points at the front and back of the community, so all areas of the property remain accessible by vehicle. We look forward to the completion of the culvert repair project over the next few months.” Jennifer Ludovice, spokesperson for Equity Lifestyle Properties  Laux said crews hope to have the project done by October, but they warn we are entering the rainy and hurricane seasons, which can cause delays.

Escambia County Public Information Officer for Public Safety Davis Wood told the News Journal that the fire began as a small campsite fire and began spreading to other campsites. He said nine units responded and they put the fire out by 10:08 a.m. No one was hurt.  According to witnesses, the fire grew out of control as a result of a domestic dispute between a couple living at the campsite, and the fire quickly spread to the trees and other areas.  People who live in the encampment say issues with camp fires are a continual concern because those who start them don't always monitor them or they weaponize the fires during disputes.  Nearby residents and business owners have also complained to city and county leaders about problems stemming from so many homeless living nearby, including fires, and say the smoke often has a noxious smell, such as when people cook drugs or burn trash.  Hundreds of people are camping in the area on Beggs Lane, off North Palafox Street. Despite the growing number of homeless at the location, Escambia County has not forced them to move.

It happened around 4:45 p.m. at a farm on Franklin Road in Coolspring Township near Route 62.  According to East End Fire Chief Bill Finley, a fire from a burn barrel caught the nearby barn on fire. The structure was destroyed before the first fire trucks arrived.  Firefighters worked their way around the burn barrel that caused the fire, standing idly between a storage building and the now-destroyed barn. It was the grandmother of the barn’s owner — 23-year-old Leah Hensley — who decided to burn some old wood on the property since Hensley had just bought it in November.  “I just heard Grammy yelling and I came out and the barn was on fire… I was inside and I heard her yelling and I came out and the barn was completely smoking and in flames,” Hensley said.  It didn’t take long before the entire barn was gone.  “Most of it had already caught when I got there and within 3 minutes, it was swallowed in flames,” Hensley said.  The fire started around 4:45 p.m. By the time First News arrived around 5:30 p.m., all the volunteer fire departments had it out — an aerial truck left to hose down the hot spots. Water was continuously trucked in and a plastic reservoir was erected to hold it.  “About two hours, three hours ago we had another two-alarm fire. It was in town where we had hydrants and literally night and day difference in fighting these two fires based on the availability of water,” Finley said.  Finley says there wasn’t anything of value in the barn.  “It appears as though it was pretty empty, so I don’t think we have much damage to contents, maybe some hay and stuff like that. Didn’t see any farm equipment or agricultural equipment in there,” Finley said.  “It was old, a very old barn. We think the half of it was from about the 1800s. So it was a really dry, old barn,” Hensley said.  One last piece of advice from the fire chief…  “This time of year, especially with as dry as it is this week, please try and refrain from burning until we get some rain,” Finley said.  No one was hurt.  The building next to the barn had some damage, but most of it and everything inside was saved. There’s also a house on the property and it’s fine.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9idXJuLWJhcnJlbC1maXJlLWRlc3Ryb3lzLWJhcm4taW4tY29vbHNwcmluZy10b3duc2hpcC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy53a2JuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYnVybi1iYXJyZWwtZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95cy1iYXJuLWluLWNvb2xzcHJpbmctdG93bnNoaXAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So we're always trying to go refill that well of new people, get people trained up.""  A type of training that's been made possible because of this donated house, something members of the community often provide to them every year.

"fire","2023-07-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-30T20:10:00","State and federal land managers are warning of extreme fire danger across northeastern Minnesota, as a lack of precipitation, low humidity, warm temperatures and strong winds combine to create ideal conditions for wildfires.  The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources reported 50 wildfires over the long Memorial Day weekend, stretching from central Minnesota northward to the Canadian border.  The two largest burned south of Ely, reaching about 10 and 20 acres in size. Their causes are still under investigation. The larger of the two, dubbed the Ely Fire, closed a stretch of the Taconite State Trail over the weekend.  Aircraft stationed nearby by the DNR and U.S. Forest Service helped douse the blazes from above, said Tim Engrav, a public information officer with the Superior National Forest.  Grow the Future of Public Media MPR News is Member supported public media. Show your support today, donate, and ensure access to local news and in-depth conversations for everyone.  Those wildfires “are a good indicator of the fuel conditions in the forest, how dry things are,” Engrav said. “And with some lower humidity the fires can start to go, especially with some wind behind them.”  A helicopter drops water on the Delta Lake fire east of Ely, Minn., in July 2021. Courtesy Superior National Forest  ‘Extreme’ fire risk around BWCAW  The Minnesota DNR’s most recent fire danger map shows high fire danger across the entire Arrowhead region, with extreme fire risk in a wide area in northeastern Minnesota around the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  The conditions couldn’t be more different than just a few weeks ago, when a record snowpack blanketed much of northeastern Minnesota.  But there’s been little precipitation since the snow melted, said Leanne Langeberg, a public information officer with the Interagency Fire Center, who said conditions on the ground “are prime for wildfire activity.”  The forests in Minnesota are also going through what DNR officials refer to as the “spring dip,” Langeberg said. That’s a period during the spring green-up when needles in the crowns of pine trees dry out, making them more susceptible to fire.  “So the trees are a little bit more stressed during that time. And when you combine that with the drier conditions, that's when we start to see wildfire activity pick up,” explained Langeberg.  Areas burned by the Greenwood Fire — which was first spotted near Greenwood Lake north of Two Harbors, Minn. on Aug. 15, 2021 — are seen one month after the fire passed through. Photo by Michael Furtman  Burning restrictions  Rain is in the forecast this week but it’s expected to be spotty, Langeberg said — not the kind of wetting event that could help lower fire danger. “That dryness that is sitting upon us is is expected to hang in there throughout the month of June,” she said.  No open burning is allowed in northeastern Minnesota. Campfires are allowed, but officials urge campers not to leave fires unattended and to make sure embers are cold to the touch before they leave.  There’s also a chance for thunderstorms in the forecast this week, raising the possibility of wildfires caused by lightning strikes, Engrav said — because of dry soils at the top of the forest floor, and dry twigs and branches that can easily ignite.  “Right now we've been concerned about campfires and people being safe and prudent with their campfires.

The film, called “Southern Range: Salmon in the Santa Cruz Mountains,” came about through a collaboration with the director, Kyle Baker, who earned an MFA in social documentation in 2020, UCSC professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Eric Palkovacs, and Jonathan Hicken, executive director of the Seymour Center Marine Discovery Center.  “This was a collaborative project from Day 1,” said Hicken. “Eric brought his expertise in fisheries science, I brought community connections, and Kyle brought the creativity to tell the story of our local salmon and the community-based efforts to help them.”  The documentary will air on KQED at 8:30 p.m. Friday and at 8 p.m. June 21. The film will also air at 5 p.m. on June 9 on the KQED Plus channel.  Palkovacs, who contributed his expert knowledge to the film, also serves as the director of the Fisheries Collaborative Program, which gives UCSC researchers the opportunity to team up with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center on projects focusing on marine life and conservation along the coast.  “I work on lots of different things but one of my main interests is anadromous fishes like salmon,” said Palkovacs. “Their life cycles, their adaptations to environmental conditions, to changing environmental conditions and their conservation.”  Baker had first reached out to Palkovacs for a previous documentary project called “Salmon Nation,” which was a collection of short interviews with individuals who are involved with salmon species in various ways.  “That’s how we started talking and at that point, we thought it would be fun to think about doing a longer form documentary,” said Palkovacs. “We let the idea marinate and then the CZU Lightning Complex fires happened and that became a really compelling story because a lot of the watersheds that we work in and have the last endangered coho salmon were severely burned in that wildfire.”  The wildfire and its effects on coho salmon, most notably in the Scott Creek watershed, then became a central theme of the documentary. Palkovacs pointed out that the fire not only affected local wildlife but all residents of Santa Cruz County.  “Everybody in the community has some point of reference with respect to those fires,” said Palkovacs. “And we wanted to tell the story of how the fish, and the people invested in these fish from the scientific perspective and from the conservation and restoration perspective, and from the community perspective, had experienced these fires and were trying to save the fish through this really rough period.”  Scott Creek is home to the southernmost spawning population of coho salmon in North America. Palkovacs said the population has been depleted over the years and there are very few fish left, which was only exacerbated by the CZU Lightning Complex fire.  “That’s why a lot of the conservation and research is going into restoring not just Scott Creek, but restoring the neighboring watersheds,” said Palkovacs. “So that we have fish in a variety of watersheds in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, and not just this one. If we continue to support one watershed by itself, it’s a really risky strategy.”  Although Palkovacs’ research is centered around salmon, contributing his expertise to the documentary allowed him to meet others he may not have who also share his passion for the upstream swimming salmonids. The human communities that strive to conserve and restore the species is a core theme of the film, and Palkovacs hopes that the documentary will inspire others to get involved.  “It gave me a wider perspective on the human dimensions of salmon restoration,” said Palkovacs. “I mostly think about the fish and less frequently about all the people involved. I think what the film emphasizes is how many people care and what they are doing to save salmon, which I found to be inspiring.”  If you watch  What: “Southern Range: Salmon in the Santa Cruz Mountains”  Where: KQED  When: 8:30 p.m. Friday, 8 p.m. June 21","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbnRhY3J1enNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzMwL2ZpbG0tYWJvdXQtY3p1LWxpZ2h0bmluZy1jb21wbGV4LWZpcmUtc2FsbW9uLWFpcnMtZnJpZGF50gFqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2FudGFjcnV6c2VudGluZWwuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvZmlsbS1hYm91dC1jenUtbGlnaHRuaW5nLWNvbXBsZXgtZmlyZS1zYWxtb24tYWlycy1mcmlkYXkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-30T23:29:24","For the third time in six days, the massive pile of shredded tires sitting beside an old grain elevator on the Willamette River reignited this morning, sending flames and smoke into the spring air.  Crews from Portland Fire & Rescue have visited the site at least three times in the past week, dousing flames with thousands of gallons of water, fire spokesman Rick Graves said.  The pile is out of compliance with regulations, Graves said. “The size of the pile is greater than what we would permit,” he said. “The permit is under review.”  It’s the size that makes the heap ripe for burning and difficult to extinguish. The owners of the grain elevator use the site to ship shredded tires to Asia, where they are burned to generate electricity. In a huge pile, the shreds—and the air pockets between them—make a near-perfect setup for conflagration, Graves said.  Dousing the fire quells the flames for a short time, but if the center is hot enough, the fire can reignite soon after fire hoses are rolled up, as happened this week.  “It’s a matrix,” Graves said. “It’s a pile of little pebbles. If you drop water in the top, it will get the hot spots for the time being. But because there are no sidewalls, you can’t keep the water in it.”  The tire pile is owned by Beau Blixseth and Chandos Mahon. Blixseth is the son of Tim Blixseth, a Roseburg timber baron who used his millions to start the Yellowstone Club, the private ski resort in Montana.  Mahon, a Columbia Business School graduate, runs Castle Tire Recycling, a North Portland company that collects and shreds tires. Before joining an affiliate called Castle Capital in 2015, Mahon was vice president at a company called Integrated Media Technologies, according to his LinkedIn profile. From 1998 to 2003, he was a professional motocross racer, the profile says.  In an interview with WW last year, Blixseth described the grain elevator as a screaming deal. It has a mysterious history. Starting around 2013, global grain merchant Louis Dreyfus Co. spent $21.5 million to renovate the facility. Then, in June 2019, it turned around and sold it for just $164,000 to a company called Rabin Worldwide that specializes in auctioning off industrial properties and equipment.  Seeing a diamond in the rough, Blixseth and Mahon bought the complex for $2.9 million through an entity called Castle Arden 1 LLC. Blixseth told WW that he wanted to ship grain from the site, as Louis Dreyfus had, but Union Pacific stopped running rail service to the elevator because a turn in the tracks there was dangerous. Blixseth said he didn’t learn about Union Pacific’s move until after he bought the property.  Soon after, the tire piles started forming. They build up until a ship docks and loaders fill the hold.  Blixseth hasn’t returned messages seeking comment. In an email Monday, Mahon said the fire was started by an arsonist. Pressed for proof on Tuesday, he didn’t reply. The fire bureau says the cause is under investigation.  The terminal appears to have been operating within the law. After coverage by WW, inspectors from the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality showed up unannounced Aug. 4, but found no violations.  “They observed two piles of tire-shred product,” DEQ spokeswoman Lauren Wirtis wrote in an email to WW at the time. “No tire shreds were visible outside of the two piles. DEQ inspectors did not observe any visible dust or odor during their visit.”  The DEQ inspection came after a Portland resident told WW he went on a run past the terminal in July and encountered dust and the stench of rubber (“Rubber Room,” WW, July 27). One thing had changed in the interim: A ship taking on tire shreds had left two weeks earlier.  DEQ regulates the location in North Portland where Castle Tire shreds the tires, DEQ spokesman Harry Esteve said today. But the site on the river doesn’t need a DEQ permit to store waste tires because the shredded tires are considered a product, not waste, Esteve said in an email.  “DEQ is going to inspect the site when it is safe to do so and determine if there are environmental violations,” Esteve wrote.  A spokesman for City Commissioner Rene Gonzalez, who heads the fire bureau, didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.  In addition to the size-of-pile violation, the fire bureau had cited Blixseth and Mahon for not providing sufficient access to the site in the event of a fire, Graves, the fire spokesman said.  “They were very responsive,” Graves said. “Whatever needed to be done was done.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53d2Vlay5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXR5LzIwMjMvMDUvMzAvcGlsZS1vZi10aXJlLXNoYXJkcy1jYXRjaGVzLWZpcmUtZm9yLXRoaXJkLWRheS1hcy1pbnRlcm5hbC1oZWF0LXN0YXlzLWhpZ2gtZW5vdWdoLXRvLXJlaWduaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Putnam Vocational Technical Academy in Springfield recently spent a day learning about careers in the fire service at the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy (MFA).  The 10 juniors, who are studying in various vocational fields, visited the Department of Fire Services’ (DFS) Springfield campus on April 26. Dr. Sara Pragluski Walsh, who serves as the MFA’s instructional design and curriculum development specialist, met students with Assistant Coordinator Peter Jerusik of the Career Recruit Firefighter Program. They led a discussion and presentation on the fire service mission followed by an engaging tour of the campus that demonstrated the myriad types of training that the MFA offers to firefighters at every level of experience.  Academy instructors Zachary Gates and Christopher Hernandez – who are both experienced firefighters – assisted students in learning how to don and doff their turnout gear while emphasizing the importance of safety within the fire service. Students were assigned to instructors to learn and then apply practical skills in search and rescue, forcible entry, and hose deployment. The students were extremely hands on with their learned skills, properly leveraging the “irons” as well as additional tools when carrying out forcible entry skills and interior search tactics. All the while, they supported each other in a teamwork approach that instructors emphasized as a core fire service value.  A class of recruit firefighters was conducting a live fire practical day during the visit, which allowed students to observe active firefighter training and discuss it with their assigned instructors. Throughout the day, MFA staff and municipal firefighters joined in to support the learning – many of them sharing that they, too, were graduates of Putnam or other Springfield public schools.  Later in the day, State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey, Deputy State Fire Marshal Maribel Fournier, and Springfield Fire Commissioner Bernard Calvi joined the students for a detailed question and answer session on the fire service and its opportunities, challenges, and rewards.  The Putnam Vocational visit followed similar events for students at Shrewsbury High School, Northampton’s Smith Vocational and Agricultural High School, and South Shore Technical High School’s first Fire Cadet Training Program, which was offered in partnership with several local fire departments. DFS officials hope to continue offering the experiential opportunity to young people from across the Commonwealth at all three campuses.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3MuZ292L25ld3MvcHV0bmFtLXZvY2F0aW9uYWwtc3R1ZGVudHMtdmlzaXQtZmlyZS1hY2FkZW150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Flames ignited and ripped through the buildings sometime before 7:30 p.m. at the apartment complex on Equinox Court, located in a cul-de-sac off Kenwood Avenue. By 9 p.m., the worst of the blaze appeared to be under control.  No one was injured, but eight families were displaced and 17 people were being assisted by the local American Red Cross chapter, according to the Red Cross, Slingerlands Fire Chief Craig Sleurs and Bethlehem Deputy Police Chief James Rexford.  Deer Run resident Carlos Matias said he had just finished walking his dog at about 7 p.m. Tuesday and was looking forward to going out to dinner later that evening with his wife when he noticed a small ground fire near the building at 11 Equinox, next door to his apartment of 10 years.  He said he and his neighbor tried to stamp out the fire, but it was feeding on piles of fluffy, fallen seed from the nearby cottonwood trees and was moving too quickly for the two to keep up. He said he watched it spread under his neighbor’s porch, where the seed had accumulated, and it ignited a propane tank attached to a gas grill.  He brought the dog upstairs and went back down to try to keep the flames from his home, about 40 feet away from his neighbor’s, but the same scenario transpired, with the flames eventually igniting a pile of seed under his porch.  “I have never experienced anything like that before,” he said Wednesday while rummaging through the burnt wreckage of his home, looking for a mesh bag that contains the couple’s passports, birth certificates and other paperwork. “It was moving across the ground, like there was gasoline or something, and it was spreading and spreading and spreading and before you know it, everything is engulfed. There was nothing we could do.”  Rexford said Wednesday he would not comment on the witness linking the fire’s spread to what is called poplar fluff — the white, snow-like seeds that are currently blanketing the Capital Region from poplar-type trees. But there were questions about why two buildings so far apart had caught on fire. Rexford said the fire is still under active investigation.  Sleurs, the Slingerlands fire chief, said Wednesday a cause for the fire hadn't been determined, and referred other comment to Rexford. But he said fighting the fire when cottonwood seed is everywhere ""didn't help."" ""It’s been so dry and that stuff is falling all over the place,"" he said about the yearly shedding of seeds.  Earlier on Tuesday, Albany fire officials warned residents that there has been an increase in outdoor fires associated with the igniting of the fluff — fueled by videos online of people lighting the seeds on fire.  As firefighters battled the Deer Run blaze Tuesday night, water had to be brought in to extinguish the flames after the first crews to arrive experienced a drop in pressure — not unusual when water sources on cul-de-sacs are tapped in such a fashion, Sleurs said.  The town warned residents Wednesday that water in the Slingerlands area might be discolored because of the large amount used to fight the blaze. They recommended waiting, and then running cold water until it’s clear before using; however, the town said the sediment in the water does not pose any threat.  The fire brought a large presence of departments Tuesday night including those from Delmar, Bethlehem, Slingerlands, Selkirk, New Salem, Westmere and McKownville.  The surrounding scene, close to the Albany County rail trail, is heavily wooded, which appeared to be of some concern to those fighting the fire. A bucket loader was called in to work the scene.

Interested in how black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) respond to fire, researchers sought to develop fire management tools to aid planning after burns in California.  “Fire patterns continue to change, so we need to create pathways to adapt our toolbox for biodiversity conservation in the face of large forest fires,” said Andrew Stillman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.  Stillman led a study published in Ecological Applications outlining a model that uses over 10 years of black-backed woodpecker surveys conducted by The Institute for Bird Populations, as well as satellite-derived fire information, to predict potential woodpecker densities across a burned area. The model has also been made into an online app that can provide this information to managers in just a few minutes.  Although the model is built for woodpeckers, it can highlight valuable habitats for other species that depend on different fire mosaics as well.  A black-backed woodpecker visits its nest site in a burned forest. Credit: Jeremy Roberts/www.ConsevationMedia.com  Black-backed woodpeckers are a “flagship” species for post-fire recovery, Stillman said. Adults use areas recently burned at high severity because they provide nesting trees and beetles to eat. Young woodpeckers use low-severity areas to hide in trees from predators.  Stillman and his colleagues originally created three different models to predict black-backed woodpecker occupancy based on 11 years of surveys in over 130 different fires. “It was a competition between three separate models describing habitat associations for black-backed woodpeckers, and we wanted to see which one gave us the best predictions,” Stillman said. “The winning model incorporated variation in fire characteristics and temporal habitat dynamics after fire.”  Stillman and his colleagues made the model accessible through an app for managers. Users input burn severity and area boundaries. The app can then predict black-backed woodpecker potential abundance and densities at high resolution within minutes. “You can grab a cup of coffee, and it’s done,” he said.  The app cuts the time it would otherwise take for managers to survey burned areas – some of which can cover hundreds of square miles, he said. Because wildlife surveys are time-consuming and expensive, managers sometimes have to make decisions without baseline information on woodpecker populations.  The Sierra Nevada in Northern California comes back to life after a wildlife. Credit: Jean Hall  In California, he said, pyrodiversity—patchworks of different burn severity—is on the decline. “There’s less of these mosaic patches that are good for biodiversity. Having a tool like this makes it easier to engage in adaptive management and respond to the changing reality of fire.”  While Stillman hopes the new tool can fill information gaps for forest managers in California, he also hopes this work will pave the way for additional tools that aid targeted, adaptive management in other systems.  The tool can also easily be updated as climate and mega-fires change. “Adaptive management in the face of climate change is an intentional piece of this tool, and there’s still work to be done.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd2lsZGxpZmUub3JnL2JsYWNrLWJhY2tlZC13b29kcGVja2VyLW1vZGVsLWluZm9ybXMtZmlyZS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWRlY2lzaW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But now, they’re working on moving toward the future.  ”It still feels like a bad dream,” said Shay Dunnigan, director of Pulaski County Parks & Rec.  Dunnigan left the pool house Friday less than an hour before the fire started.  When he came back, very little was left standing.  ”The outpour of love and messages and encouraging words we’ve received in the last 72 hours have been very heartfelt and much needed,” Dunnigan said.  The fire is still under investigation, and they are waiting on insurance claims, but Dunnigan says they want to move forward.  Parks & Rec summer camps start in the coming weeks, and Dunnigan wants people to know they are still happening, regardless of the fire.  ”We’re being creative with what we can do with our summer camps in terms of swimming, partnering with people around the New River Valley to make that a positive experience for them in the summer,” he said.  The pool provided summer employment for many people in the area, like lifeguard Alan Fernandez.  ”I was supposed to start Monday which is crazy to me. I just looked down at my phone at my girlfriend’s graduation and I just see, oh it’s on fire,” Fernandez said.  The Parks & Rec Department plans to keep pool employees on staff in other areas of the department.  Dunnigan says he knows what a loss this is to the community.  “This place is home to a lot of people,” he said.  But he says one day they will be back and better than ever.  ”We’re going to do everything in our power to make this standing behind us bigger, better and stronger as we move forward,” he said.  Parks and Recreation tells 10 News they’re meeting soon to discuss more specific solutions and will know more in the coming days.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndzbHMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8zMC9wdWxhc2tpLWNvbW11bml0eS1sb29rcy10by1yZWJ1aWxkLWFmdGVyLXBvb2xob3VzZS1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2019-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-30T16:10:00","A new report shows that the number of days out of the year with weather conditions that promote the spread of wildfires has jumped considerably over the last 50 years, a trend that’s most pronounced in the West.  The Climate Central report was based on data from nearly 500 weather stations from 1973 through 2022. The group was looking for trends in so-called ""fire weather days,"" when temperatures and winds are high and humidity is low.  “While (in) most places it might be a couple of weeks more, maybe a month more, we're seeing some places that have two more months of fire weather days on average each year,” said Kaitlyn Trudeau, who conducted the report’s data analysis.  A map featured in the report shows especially dramatic rises in fire weather across the Southwest. A broad swath of New Mexico has seen an increase of 59 days over the last 50 years.  You can see the change in fire weather days where you live here .  The report largely attributes the shift to human-caused climate change, and recommends a rapid move away from fossil fuels, as well as adaptation to the troubling new reality.  Beyond increasing the risk of severe wildfires, the report notes that more hot, dry and windy weather can lead to utility companies shutting off power to avoid igniting blazes. It can also make it much more difficult to carry out prescribed burns, an important ecological and wildfire mitigation tool.  “As the climate continues to warm, we're not going to have safe enough conditions to…actually do things like prescribed burns as often as we need to, which is definitely alarming,” Trudeau said.  Alongside the trend in fire weather, the number of homes in the so-called wildland urban interface – where the built environment comes into close proximity to undeveloped landscapes susceptible to fire – has grown steadily. Several Western states – Nevada, Arizona and Utah – saw the sharpest percentage increase in such homes between 1990 and 2020, according to data included in the report.  That and other data, as well as the full report, can be downloaded here .

""That was definitely scary,"" said parent Morgan Smith. ""We did our best to make sure all the kids were safe. The school called an announcement to get all kids inside so that they were not dealing with the smoke out here.""  The fire station has been abandoned for roughly 10 years after the new fire station 83 opened across the street.  L.A.'s homeless population is known for frequenting the vacant building, located on Balboa Boulevard and Addison Street.  In the last month, parents told Eyewitness News a man has been seen jumping the school's fence to access the property and he's made many in the community, uncomfortable.  ""We absolutely do not want someone like this hanging out near our school,"" said Smith. ""We have requested increased LAPD patrols of the area. I know our school police has been on campus a lot more so we're hoping they catch him.""  Parents fear something dangerous could happen next.  ""The unknown of who this person is and what is he capable of, does he have weapons? Does he not? It's really the concern of the parents,"" said parent Sanaz Jadian. ""Who is he? Get him away from our school.""  Parents think the transient man is responsible for the fire.  In fact, Councilwoman Nithya Raman's office told Eyewitness News they were alerted of what the vacant building was being used for and sent their homeless team for outreach last Friday morning.  Shortly after their visit, the fire started.  ""Difficult conversation to have with our kids that, he's homeless. He could be on the drugs. If you see it, you need run get an adult. Let's call 911,"" said Jadian.  ABC7 has learned the Armenian Cultural Foundation has leased the abandoned fire station for 30 years. It pays the city of Los Angeles $1 per year.  They're finalizing plans to renovate the building so it can be used for elderly services in the morning and arts and dance programs in the afternoon.  However, the process is slow, which has made it a target for the unhoused.  In a statement, the Los Angeles Unified School District said, ""In response to recent safety incidents, we have fortified our school perimeter with the help of our facilities team. In addition, we recently added a buzzer at the school entrance to ensure all visitors are screened before they enter our campus.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjNy5jb20vZW5jaW5vLWNoYXJ0ZXItZWxlbWVudGFyeS1zY2hvb2wtYWJhbmRvbmVkLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1jb3VudHktaG9tZWxlc3MvMTMzMjE1NTcv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3LmNvbS9hbXAvZW5jaW5vLWNoYXJ0ZXItZWxlbWVudGFyeS1zY2hvb2wtYWJhbmRvbmVkLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1sb3MtYW5nZWxlcy1jb3VudHktaG9tZWxlc3MvMTMzMjE1NTcv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At that April meeting, while informing county commissioners of “no-show” calls in which the predominately volunteer department were dispatched to calls but failed to have anyone respond by the department over the previous year, Cabe did offer hope by introducing the department’s new Chief, Tony Randall, who was committed to reforming the department. In April, Cabe recommended the county continue to monitor West Macon pending their upcoming state inspection in May.  “On April 11 Emergency Management was asked to come out and check our roster due to new members joining,” Randall said. “We were found to have the 19 required members with adequate training and Warren reported that night to the county commissioners that he was happy with the progress made and recommended no further action pending the scheduled ISO rating inspection by NC OSFM on May 22.”  While the county found no issues leading up to the state inspection, the North Carolina State Office of the Fire Marshall once again found the volunteer department to have staffing issues and issued a notice of non-compliance.  “OSFM appreciates the cooperation and assistance given by members of your staff during the recent inspection of your department. The purpose of the inspection was to verify that your department meets the State’s minimum requirements for a certified department,” reads the letter issued to Macon County on May 23 from the North Carolina Department of Insurance.  According to the notice from the state, West Macon did not meet the minimum standards or requirements for a certified department due to being low on personnel and for failing to meet minimum response requirements, meaning the department failed to respond to a call when dispatched or failed to have the required number of firefighters respond to a call when dispatched.  Randall noted that the department is already well on its way to addressing the issues presented by the state.  “The ISO inspection is a very thorough process but, on the training, and membership part of that inspection they look at a snapshot of time January 27 2022 through January 27 2023 which includes the probation time mentioned above,” explained Randall. “New members added after January were not included. As a result, West Macon received a Notice of Non-Compliance from the Office of State Fire Marshal.”  The letter explained that “Failure to meet the minimum requirements for a certified department will lead to a change in the rating classification of your department and the fire district(s) it serves to a Class 10 rating.”  West Macon Fire and Rescue currently holds a Class 4/9E rating. If their rating classification were implemented, the change to a Class 10 would affect all property insurance premium calculations for residential occupancy insured under Homeowner policies and other special schedule surveyed property.  According to Cabe, at this time, no changes are being made to the class rating for property within West Macon’s Fire District and the department is diligently working to rectify the issues. The department has 30 days from inspection to submit a detailed written corrective plan and then will be allowed six months to implement the plan. If after the six months, the department still does not meet all the minimum requirements, the Office of the State Fire Marshall will take action o change the status of the department from non-compliant to probation.  “No actions have been taken by OSFM against West Macon Fire and Rescue beyond the Notice of Non-compliance at this point,” said Randall. “We have been notified that they will return in six months to give us time to correct the deficiencies. We currently hold a Class 4/9s rating and that will not change until a full ISO rating inspection is completed in six months. This new snapshot of time will allow the hard work of our new members who joined since January to be recognized. I want to thank OSFM and Macon County Emergency Management for their impartiality, guidance and insight throughout this process. My officers and members have been working very hard to ensure WMFR continues to provide quality fire, rescue, and medical response well into the future.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc291dGhlcm5zY29vcG5ld3MuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL3dlc3QtbWFjb24tZmlyZS1mYWlscy1zdGF0ZS1pbnNwZWN0aW9uLW5ldy1jaGllZi1vZmZlcnMtcHJvbWlzZS10by1jb21tdW5pdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-28","Not Discerned","{""Gilroy"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-30T18:04:08","Sign up for our email newsletter for the latest science news  Unless you’re Peter Pan, you can’t lose your shadow. At least, not permanently.  Shadows crop up wherever light is obstructed by an object, and they come in a range of shapes and sizes. In 2012, for example, physicists captured the first-ever view of an atomic shadow by shining a laser at a single ytterbium atom in a vacuum chamber.  And on a much larger scale, our moon blocks the light of the Sun from reaching Earth during solar eclipses. Millions of people will witness this firsthand in 2024, when a much-anticipated totality is projected to sweep across North America.  But what happens if the obstruction itself is a light source, too — like a candle’s flame or a roaring campfire?  What Is Fire Made Of?  (Credit: Shutterstock/nasti23033)  First of all, most fires are more than just a light source. A typical flame contains multitudes: hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules actively being burned, the carbon dioxide and water vapor produced as a result, and impurities like soot, smoke and half-burnt fuel.  The yellow light that we typically associate with fire, in fact, is created when little bits of soot are heated up so much that they glow. These yellow flames are called luminous ones, and all that extra soot ultimately means they aren’t being fed enough oxygen to turn fuel into carbon dioxide.  Non-luminous flames, however, are a different story. Because these have access to plenty of oxygen, they burn cleaner (read: no soot) and hotter. They also tend to burn blue, rather than the traditional yellow.  Does Fire Have a Shadow?  What does all this have to do with shadows? Well, the more visible impurities that a fire contains — soot, but also perhaps aerosolized candle wax — the greater the chance that you’ll be able to see its shadow.  Of course, even a fire that is burning cleanly has a shadow of sorts. This typically looks like faint, dancing ripples, and it’s a visual representation of the super-hot gas molecules dancing around inside the flame; because the molecules are much hotter than the surrounding air, they bend or diffract light.  Photographers may recognize it as the same science that allows a camera lens to focus light.  Read More: Do Atoms Ever Touch?  What Is Light, Anyway?  (Credit: Shutterstock/Erkki Makkonen)  Try pointing a weak flashlight at a blazing campfire, however, and you’re unlikely to see much of a silhouette. For a flame (or any light source) to generate a shadow visible to the human eye, it must be obstructing an even brighter lighter source — like sunlight.  Take note that any shadow is not the result of incoming light being scattered by the light produced by the fire. Physics tells us that light beams never directly interact with each other, whether that means bouncing off or absorbing each other.  Why? Photons, the tiny particles that comprise light waves, by nature can overlap, pass through one another and even inhabit the exact same positions. They’re the very definition of “mind your own business.”  Photons also lack electric charge and a magnetic moment, things that electromagnetic fields take advantage of to interact with objects. But without these, one light beam can never interact with any other light beam.  In short, fire doesn’t produce a shadow like you or I might, by blocking all light from passing through it. But it does partially block light — and thanks to a bunch of ultra-hot gas molecules, a fraction of the light will likely be deflected back or diffracted.  To avoid the Peter Pan effect at home, make sure you’re pointing a bright light beam or direct sunlight at a luminous flame that has lots of soot or smoke.

Assistant Chief Jeff Stabley was the first on the scene and immediately ordered a second alarm, bringing multiple additional tankers from Lycoming, Clinton and Northumberland counties.  The fire, which has been ruled accidental, broke out about 12:15 p.m. Stabley, who directed operations, ordered a third alarm at 12:45 p.m. before the blaze, which destroyed the store and four greenhouses, was brought under control shortly after 1 p.m.  Radiant heat melted the siding of King’s home, about 30 feet from the store. However, firefighters were successful in stopping the flames from reaching the house. Even though the temperature was only in the low 80s with little humidity at the time of the fire, the heat was brutal for firefighters.  With all the turnout gear that they have to wear, “It feels like you’re standing inside an oven. Your body temperature starts to boil,” Miller said.  At least two firefighters reportedly needed medical attention — one for smoke inhalation and another for heat exhaustion. Miller said it was believed the fire started around a 20-pound propane tank inside the store.  “The tank vented under pressure, and the escaping gas found an ignition source, probably the pilot light in the freezer, and it (the fire) just took off from there,” Miller said in explaining what was believed to have sparked the blaze.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvdGhyZWUtYWxhcm0tZmlyZS13aXBlcy1vdXQtYnVzaW5lc3MtaW4tbmlwcGVub3NlLXZhbGxleS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fire officials said windy weather made battling the blaze difficult, and an investigation is now underway to figure out the cause of the quick-moving fire in Easton's West Ward.  Tuesday was an emotional morning for many people who came back to assess the damage now that the smoke and flames have cleared. A block of rowhomes went up in flames on Ferry Street.  The blaze left all 15 homes uninhabitable, and about 60 people are displaced, the Red Cross said.  One resident, Tina Queen, said she was sitting on her patio enjoying the weather and a day off for Memorial Day. That all changed around 3 p.m.  ""I said, that's not barbecue, that's smoke...and I've seen that house from ground up, go whoosh, just like a ball of flames,"" Queen said.  Queen says she, her son, his girlfriend and her grandkids immediately ran out of the house and started knocking on neighbors' doors.  She says it appears the fire started in one of the homes closer to South Ninth Street, then quickly made its way down the 900 block of Ferry Street at what she felt was lightning speed, destroying and damaging homes along the way.  Firefighters escorted Queen into her home, telling her to be careful because they don't know what kind of structural damage there is to the property.  She retrieved her medication, her dogs' crate and ""that was it.""  ""It's a nightmare. You know, everything you work hard for is possibly gone,"" she said.  Another family says they've lived in one of the homes for 60 years. It was one of the six that's a total loss. Firefighters allowed them inside and amidst the rubble, they walked out with photos and drawers of memories, untouched by the fire.  Fire officials say of the 15 homes damaged, at least six are a total loss.  The fire department says the fire spread so quickly because of the wind and because the buildings did not have what are called fire stops in the walls. Fire stops prevent the fire from spreading to home to home, but without them, it spread as quickly as nature would allow it to.  ""When they showed up, within probably two minutes they had fire showing out of three dwellings here, and it ran the block,"" said Chief Henry Hennings, of the Easton Fire Department.  Fire companies worked through the night to get the fire under control, coming from as far away as Allentown to provide support.  ""It was advancing faster than we could get water on the fire,"" Hennings said.  Thankfully everyone made it out safely, but several firefighters suffered injuries in the process.  ""We did have five firefighter injuries, all minor. Three were transported to Anderson for evaluation, but I think they're going to be okay,"" Hennings said.  The Red Cross has stepped in to help families displaced by the fire. They have a shelter set up at Paxinosa Elementary School. According to their spokesperson, only one person and their dog stayed the night.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Zm16LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FyZWEvbGVoaWdodmFsbGV5LzYwLWRpc3BsYWNlZC1ieS1xdWljay1zcHJlYWRpbmctZWFzdG9uLXJvd2hvbWUtZmlyZS9hcnRpY2xlXzE2ZGYzOWNlLWZmMDQtMTFlZC05ZjNlLWFmMDEwODIzMGFlNy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A few neighbors said it's unreal that this happened, but find a small blessing that it happened on Memorial Day when many families were away celebrating.  But it's little comfort for some families.  In utter disbelief, Tamaya Smith tried to see what, if anything is left of her burned-out house where she and her two children once called home.  ""When my friends were calling me, saying the houses by your house are on fire I was like I literally just left 10 minutes ago,"" Smith said.  Monday afternoon Smith was heading to a family barbecue for Memorial Day when officials say a fire started in one of the homes on 9th and Ferry Street in Easton.  The flames quickly jumped from one house to the next.  ""When It got up, it ran the block,"" Chief Henry Hennings, of the Eason Fire Department, said. ""All of these buildings were built in the 1900s, there are no firewalls and it's all blue frame construction.""  ""They were running up and down the street knocking on doors when I came out the flame was already up on there,"" Kevin Maxwell, whose home burned in the fire, said.  Maxwell and his neighbors returned to sift through the damage searching for sentimental belongings.  ""Some of my coats, my suits, my tux,"" Maxwell said. ""It's depressing to know that you lose your stuff but I got my health.""  ""My grandmother just passed away not even a year ago, so I just want this jacket that she used to wear. I keep it in my room and my room is right there the first window,"" Smith said. ""I'm just hoping that it's OK.""

They estimate 60 people are displaced and will need financial assistance and resources for interim housing and clothing donations.

""We received actually $1,500 worth of gift cards that will go directly to the victims."" Easton City Councilwoman Taiba Sultana  “We have Family Connection [of Easton], who are providing all the resources,"" Sultana said. ""We have Third Street Alliance providing emergency housing. West Ward WISE, I've been working with them since morning, we provided food, clothing, shoes — we have a lot of donations.  ""We received actually $1,500 worth of gift cards that will go directly to the victims.""  She also noted the Salvation Army, FEMA, Project Paw — a group that helps those with pets — and local church groups have pitched in.  St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church Pastor Susan Ruggles and Vicar Vanessa Storlie also attended the meeting, noting the fire occurred just a few blocks away from their church at 330 Ferry St.  Ruggles said the church is putting out “feelers for any kind of clothing and household goods,” but also is collecting cash donations that will go to a church fund and distributed to the victims.  The pastor also advised the public to be careful about donations, and to only donate only to recognizable organizations to ensure the money goes to the right people.    'Need to continue to feel supported'  Beyond that, Ruggles encouraged any victims to seek out someone to speak to in such trying times, noting the church is always available to help.  “They're going to need to continue to feel supported by not just by the community, but by their friends and their neighbors,"" Ruggles said.  ""Of course, all of us are offering. If you need to talk, we can talk, but go and talk to someone. That would be my advice, go and talk to someone you know.""  “Cash would be better, because these people are going to need money. I mean, they lost everything. But we also have people who are willing to collect items that people may need, from toys to clothing to toiletries to towels and bedding."" Easton Mayor Sal Panto, in regard to donations for fire victims  While any assistance is appreciated, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. also encouraged the community to consider donating money, if possible.  Panto said he would have preferred one centralized agency to take donations.  “Cash would be better, because these people are going to need money,” Panto said. “I mean, they lost everything. But we also have people who are willing to collect items that people may need, from toys to clothing to toiletries to towels and bedding.  ""The problem is, we've got to make sure that it's in good shape.

His daughter Angela Sanchez, who sometimes works in the store said, ""We do have a witness that says that they seen him running as soon as the fire started. So he took off and he left all his stuff behind.""  Over 40 firefighters were called to the store at the corner of New Hampshire and Melrose avenues at 1:25 a.m. Monday morning.

Crews responded to the The Pointe at Midtown Apartments on Navaho Drive just before 1 a.m. on Monday.  Two cars were badly burnt in the parking lot of the apartment complex.  A similar pattern has already happened before in May – where two cars have burned overnight under mysterious circumstances, all within 5 to 15 minutes of one another.  On May 4, WRAL reported two cars caught fire overnight in Raleigh around 2 a.m. on the 4400 block of Craftsman Drive, which is only around 5 minutes away from where last night's cars were burned.  Then again on May 20, WRAL reported on two cars that caught fire overnight in Raleigh, also around 2 a.m. One of the burning vehicles was on Dixon Drive in Raleigh; the other was 10 minutes away on Grand Manor Court.  Tony Yamamoto said he got a call from police last week after his white Hyundai sedan went up in flames on Pleasant Valley Road.  ""It’s an unfortunate thing to happen, and I don’t want it to happen to other people,"" said Yamamoto. ""This is all for awareness. If someone knows there’s somebody out there, other people can be on the lookout for it and hopefully get to the bottom of the situation.""  The location of the fires burned overnight were roughly 10 minutes away from each of these other fires. Police have not answered questions as to whether or not the fires are connected.  Police believe the fires from May 4 were set on purpose; however, they have not given any word yet on what may have started Monday morning's fires.  The Raleigh Fire Department Investigation Team told WRAL News they're working with Raleigh police to attempt to determine any link, leads or further investigative information regarding the fires.

The home, which was the filming location for the 1959 movie ""A Summer Place,"" suffered extensive damage from the fire.  The fire department responded just before 10 a.m. to La Porte Mansion, located at 1030 Lighthouse Avenue in Pacific Grove, Monterey Fire Chief Gaudenz Panholzer told SFGATE.  Panholzer said the sole resident of the Victorian mansion tried to extinguish the fire through a window but was unsuccessful as the fire burned on the second and third floors. He said the resident made it out of the house and was not injured.  Panholzer said there were about 35 firefighters on the scene from various regions including the Monterey Fire Department, which provides services for the city of Pacific Grove and Carmel, CalFire's pebble beach district, Monterey County Regional Fire and the Presidio of Monterey Fire Department.  During the incident, officials closed Lighthouse Avenue and 17-Mile Drive, Panholzer said.  According to Panzoler, it can be difficult to extinguish fires in Victorian buildings because of their old construction techniques. He said these homes have studs on the exterior walls that run the entire height of the building.  In this case, the fire got into the walls and ran all the way up to the third floor attic, which slowed crews down extinguishing the fire.

"fire","2023-04-18","19:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-29T19:53:00","Share Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Pinterest  By Leisa Boley Hellwarth  On Monday, April 10, 2023, at around 7 p.m., South Fork Dairy suffered an explosion and fire that seriously injured one female worker and killed around 18,000 dairy cows. It was likely the deadliest dairy fire in our nation’s history, according to several news reports. South Fork Dairy had only been operating at this elevated level for about three years. It is located just southeast of Dimmitt, in Castro County, in the Texas Panhandle. I cannot imagine the shock and pain the owners and employees are experiencing.  I’ve been to Dimmitt, Texas, more than once. This was years ago when I worked for the Texas Department of Agriculture. I will never forget driving towards Dimmitt. The land is flat, open prairie. Population is sparse. You could see the lights of Dimmitt 40 miles away. And Dimmitt is not a big town, population of approximately 4,300.  At that time, Dimmitt and all of Castro County were known for fertile soil and lush, irrigated crops. These days, the aquifers are running low and the cost to irrigate is too high to be feasible. The area is now home for many big dairies.  In fact, Texas ranks fourth nationally in milk production. And Castro County ranked second statewide in milk production. Fifteen dairies produce 148 million pounds of milk a month, according to USDA.  A Dimmitt accountant tells the story of a California dairyman who moved his large herd to Texas. He literally milked his cows in California in the morning, and then milked his cows in Texas that evening. The cows were relocated by plane.  Dairy sales people love to relay the following adage. What is the difference between a California dairyman and a New York dairyman? The New York dairyman says I never missed a milking. The California dairyman says I never missed a cow.  It appears that the automation that made super-sized dairies possible is the likely cause of the fire. Sal Rivera, Sheriff of Castro County, reported that a honey vac truck that sucks water and manure out of the barns probably overheated. This led to a fire and an explosion of methane gas. There are also reports that the insulation in the 40-acre barn was not fire retardant. The Texas Fire Marshall is still investigating. The fire appears to have been an accident.  Since we cannot turn back time and stop the fire that claimed 26 football fields of cows, we need to examine what can be done to prevent another catastrophe. History need not repeat itself.  Industries that use cattle define what constitutes humane husbandry. State legislatures usually exempt cattle from animal cruelty laws or codify the industry standards into law.  In Ohio, we have Ohio Livestock Care Standards and Regulations that are rules for the care of livestock in the state. The Ohio Livestock Care Standards Board consists of farmers, food safety experts, farm organizations, veterinarians, ag college dean, consumers and county humane society representatives.  On April 18, 2023, The Dairy Reporter published an article that asked if dairy is doing enough to prevent barn fires. There are no federal laws that specifically protect farm animals from barn fires. Some states adopt the National Fire Protection Association’s Fire and Life Safety in Animal Housing Facilities Code, known as NFPA 150. The standard details fire protection and fire safety mitigation measures which can be used in a variety of settings and environments, including barns, stables, animal shelters, veterinary facilities, etc. Texas was not one of the states that embraced NFPA 150.  The legal status of a dairy cow is that of property. The legal definition of property is anything that can be owned by a person or entity. Property is the most complete right to something the owner can possess, use, transfer or dispose of.  A cow, however, is cow is not a widget. Nor is a pig or a goat or a sheep or a chicken. They are living creatures that feel and see and live and should be treated accordingly. It seems fitting to conclude with an observation of Mahatma Gandhi. The greatness of a nation and the moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vb2NqLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2EtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtZGFpcnktYmFybi1maXJlLWluLXRleGFzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2019-07-06","Not Discerned","{""WestYellowstone"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-30T00:07:06","The U.S. government can keep using chemical retardant dropped from aircraft to fight wildfires, despite finding that the practice pollutes streams in western states in violation of federal law, a judge ruled Friday.  The judge agreed with Forest Service officials who said dropping retardant into areas with waterways was sometimes necessary.  BILLINGS, Mont. -- The U.S. government can keep using chemical retardant dropped from aircraft to fight wildfires, despite finding that the practice pollutes streams in western states in violation of federal law, a judge ruled Friday.  Halting the use of the red slurry material could have resulted in greater environmental damage from wildfires, said U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen in Missoula, Montana.  The judge agreed with U.S. Forest Service officials who said dropping retardant into areas with waterways was sometimes necessary to protect lives and property.  The ruling came after came after environmentalists sued following revelations that the Forest Service dropped retardant into waterways hundreds of times over the past decade.  Government officials say chemical fire retardant can be crucial to slowing the advance of dangerous blazes. Wildfires across North America have grown bigger and more destructive over the past two decades as climate change warms the planet.  More than 200 loads of retardant got into waterways over the past decade. Federal officials say those situations usually occurred by mistake and in less than 1% of the thousands of loads annually.  A coalition that includes Paradise, California - where a 2018 blaze killed 85 people and destroyed the town - had said a court ruling that stopped the use of retardant would have put lives, homes and forests at risk.  ""This case was very personal for us,"" Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin said. ""Our brave firefighters need every tool in the toolbox to protect human lives and property against wildfires, and today's ruling ensures we have a fighting chance this fire season.""  State and local agencies lean heavily on the U.S. Forest Service to help fight fires, many of which originate or include federal land.  Fire retardant is a specialized mixture of water and chemicals including inorganic fertilizers or salts. It's designed to alter the way fire burns, making blazes less intense and slowing their advance.  That can give firefighters time to steer flames away from inhabited areas and in extreme situations to evacuate people from danger.  ""Retardant lasts and even works if it's dry,"" said Scott Upton, a former region chief and air attack group supervisor for California's state fire agency. ""Water is only so good because it dries out. It does very well to suppress fires, but it won't last.""  The Oregon-based group Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics argued in its lawsuit filed last year that the Forest Service was disregarding the Act by continuing to use retardant without taking adequate precautions to protect streams and rivers.  Christensen said stopping the use of fire retardant would ""conceivably result in greater harm from wildfires - including to human life and property and to the environment."" The judge said his ruling was limited to 10 western states where members of the plaintiff's group alleged harm from pollution into waterways that they use.  After the lawsuit was filed the Forest Service applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for a permit that would allow it to continue using retardant without breaking the law. The process could take several years.  Such a permit could require tighter restrictions on when retardant could be used or for officials to use less-toxic chemicals, said Andy Stahl with Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics.  ""It's certainly a good first step,"" Stahl said.  Christensen ordered federal officials to report every six months on their progress.  Forest Service spokesperson Wade Muehlhof said the agency believes retardant can be used ""without compromising public health and the environment.""  ""The Forest Service is working diligently with the Environmental Protection Agency on a general permit for aerially delivered retardant that will allow us to continue using wildfire retardant to protect homes and communities,"" Muehlhof said.  Climate change, people moving into fire-prone areas, and overgrown forests are creating more catastrophic megafires that are harder to fight.  Almost 150 million gallons (567 million liters) of fire retardant were dropped on National Forest lands between 2013 and 2022, according to the Department of Agriculture. Retardant drops onto forests in California accounted for 49% of the total volume.  Health risks to firefighters or other people who come into contact with fire retardant are considered low, according to a 2021 risk assessment.  But the chemicals can be harmful to some fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic species. A government study found misapplied retardant could adversely affect dozens of imperiled species, including crawfish, spotted owls and fish such as shiners and suckers.  Forest Service officials said they are trying to come into compliance with the law by getting a pollution permit but that could take years.  To keep streams from getting polluted, officials in recent years have avoided drops inside buffer zones within 300 feet (92 meters) of waterways. Retardant may only be applied inside those zones when human life or public safety is threatened. Of 213 instances of fire retardant landing in water between 2012 and 2019, 190 were accidents and the remainder were necessary to save lives or property, officials said.

Miller said both La Pine fire crews were in the process of transporting patients to St. Charles Medical Center in Bend when the fire started. This required the Sunriver Fire Department and the Bend Fire Department to assist until the La Pine crews could get back from Bend.  “Upon arrival, large flames were reported to be coming from the roof and the fire was beginning to run the length of the attic,” Miller said.  Response times were impacted by fire crews traveling to La Pine, allowing the fire to grow into a full-scale attic fire along the entirety of the roof, according to the La Pine Fire District.  The La Pine Incident Command deemed the house fire too dangerous to fight from the inside due to potential roof collapse, so crews stayed outside of the structure for the entirety of the operation.  “The efforts of firefighters and neighbors having plenty of defensible space on their properties prevented the fire from extending into trees and nearby brush,” Miller said.

These updates also include many counties in the Lakeland viewing area.  Almost all of northwest Minnesota is considered to be at an extreme risk for fire. This means the fire situation is explosive and can cause property damage. Other areas of the Lakeland viewing area are at a very high risk, which means fires can start easily and spread at a very fast rate.  Most of the Lakeland viewing area is also under a no-open-burning restriction, with the exception of campfires. This restriction means people cannot burn debris, such as small amounts of leaves and brush, within these counties. In Todd County, open burning is allowed but requires an agency approved permit.  As of May 15th, the DNR reported 207 wildfires. To report any suspected unauthorized fires, you can call 911.

Residents released several Mylar balloons that connected with high-tension power lines, resulting in sparks that ignited a brush fire. The balloons, which have a metallic coating, can conduct electricity, meaning they can cause fires and power outages in the area.  Crews were dispatched at 11:28 a.m. to 23 Harold St., and the fire was under control at 2:20, Fire Chief Gary Ryan said.  Because of the incident, Ryan advises residents “to understand the potential hazards” that come with letting balloons float away near such power lines instead of properly disposing of them.  Ryan wrote in an email that the incident left several residents without power, but National Grid responded “quickly” to restore it.  “The Chelmsford Fire Department and Forestry members from the Department of Conservation and Recreation promptly responded to the incident, mobilizing resources to extinguish the flames and prevent further damage,” Ryan wrote.  Such balloon-related situations, though new to Chelmsford, signal a recent trend in other communities, Ryan added.  “Although this is my first encounter with the balloon matter, in my safety follow up discussion with National Grid, it was noted that the number of balloon-related power outages has been on the rise in recent years due to the increasing popularity of Mylar balloons,” Ryan said. “Their metallic coating makes them conductive, increasing the likelihood of contact with power lines which will create a short circuit and potential damage to the electrical infrastructure.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvd2VsbHN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9jaGVsbXNmb3JkLWJydXNoLWZpcmUtc3BhcmtlZC1hZnRlci1iYWxsb29ucy1oaXQtcG93ZXItbGluZXPSAWZodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb3dlbGxzdW4uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjkvY2hlbG1zZm9yZC1icnVzaC1maXJlLXNwYXJrZWQtYWZ0ZXItYmFsbG9vbnMtaGl0LXBvd2VyLWxpbmVzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""ModocCounty"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T15:59:22","An online tool maps and predicts the presence of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in newly burned forests in California.  The tool aims to aid fire managers in incorporating the protection of these birds into their efforts to revive burned forests.  Black-backed woodpeckers thrive in the diverse ecosystem left behind by wildfires, but fire suppression efforts and salvage logging often disturb their habitats.  Through the case study of black-backed woodpeckers, the tool aims to illustrate how wildlife conservation and pyrodiversity (the variation in which fires burn landscapes) should be incorporated into fire management efforts around the world.  Imagine a burned forest in California. The charred remains of trees, the soot on the forest floor and the smoke in the air might make it seem like all is lost.  Far from it.  While fires negatively affect many species of animals, they also spawn new and complicated ecosystems with rich biodiversity.  In California, the black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a ubiquitous presence in burned-over forests. The birds, in fact, capitalize on the diverse landscape left behind by the fires; they feed on beetles that infest burnt trees and make nests by drilling holes in dead ones. Their contributions are also significant. Once they are finished, these woodpeckers make way for other species — birds as well as small mammals — that use their nesting sites. Research has shown that these animals then go on to serve important functions such as repopulating the forests, dispersing seeds and keeping a check on insect populations.  Despite black-backed woodpeckers playing a pivotal role in post-fire regeneration of forests in California, their protection doesn’t often take precedence during fire recovery operations. In a scramble to make rapid decisions on how to better protect and revive burned forests, fire managers and authorities find it difficult to get data on where the birds are. Oftentimes, fire suppression efforts, cutting off of snags and salvage logging (the practice of logging trees in burned forests to minimize economic loss) impact these birds and disturb their habitats.  “In many ecosystems, animals have evolved alongside fire and actually benefit from it,” Andrew Stillman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, told Mongabay in a video interview.  A new online tool, developed by Stillman and his team, aims to help these birds and aid authorities in incorporating wildlife conservation into post-fire management.  The tool maps and predicts the presence of black-backed woodpeckers in forests after fires. Through this data, the tool enables land managers and authorities to identify and estimate areas with a higher abundance of woodpeckers and subsequently avoid those areas for post-fire management efforts. For example, if an area is estimated to have a larger population of birds, authorities can choose to leave that area out for salvage logging in order to save the birds and their habitats.  Stillman worked in partnership with the Joint Fire Science Program of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, the Institute for Bird Populations and the University of California, Los Angeles, to collect the data and develop the tool.  The tool hinges on the concept of pyrodiversity, which is the variation in the way fires burn landscapes, and the relationship that wildlife has with fires. While the tool monitors only black-backed woodpeckers in California, the scientists behind its development say they want it to serve as a case study to illustrate the importance of incorporating pyrodiversity into fire management efforts.  “Pyrodiversity is very important for wildlife and we need a pathway to adapt our toolbox for biodiversity conservation in the face of forest fire,” Stillman said. “The goal of this tool is to give us the ability to make more informed decisions about wildlife management immediately after fires burn.”  Different animals and birds react differently to fires. A study, co-authored by Stillman and published in the journal Ecological Applications in March 2023, found, for example, that black-backed woodpeckers not only like burned forests, but also need a good mix of different degrees of burn. The study found that the birds were more likely to occupy areas “with greater diversity in burn severity.”  “Adult woodpeckers were placing their nests near the edges of high-severity patches where there’s low-severity and high severity close together,” Stillman said. “We learned that adult woodpeckers forage in areas that burned at high-severity with lots of dead trees, but the juveniles forage and spend time in areas that are low-severity.”  The study also found that the survival of juveniles was much lower if they spend all their time in areas with high-severity burns.  “What we have is a species that requires both high-severity burns with snags and low-severity burns with live trees,” he said. From their findings, Stillman said, they concluded that authorities can manage burned forests to benefit black-backed woodpeckers by prioritizing the retention of areas with a high density of dead trees that are located right next to areas burned at low-severity.  The tool incorporates these findings to make estimations about where the birds might be.  The platform uses data derived from satellite imagery along with information from field surveys to make the predictions. Over 11 years, the Institute for Bird Populations and the USDA Forest Service collected data that gave them a sense of how the woodpeckers are using fires to form their habitats. They also collected data from radio transmitters attached to the birds to track their movements around the burned forests.  “That gave us a view of home range size, and we found that the density of dead trees is a really important factor that determines the size of the home range. This means that we can use snag density to actually estimate the density of home ranges on the landscape,” Stillman said.  In the tool, users are required to input some information based on their needs, such as year of the fire and the location they want to focus on. The tool then runs mathematical models to come up with three maps: one showing woodpecker density in the area, a second map that displays the estimated number of woodpecker pairs living in the area and another one that quantifies the uncertainties in those estimates. “It’s really important for managers to incorporate uncertainty into their decisions,” Stillman said.  While it is built specifically for black-backed woodpeckers in California, Stillman says the model could be adapted for other species in other places.  “The methods that we use, the model we use and the general framework that we are using to engage in adaptive management can be applied to any system anywhere,” he said.  What’s important, he said, is to learn how to start incorporating pyrodiversity to better manage and protect wildlife after fires, especially in the face of increasing temperatures and frequent droughts around the world.  “Fire is a natural part of California’s ecology, and it’s ingrained in the history of that landscape,” Stillman said. “This tool is about ways that we can live with the fire and manage fire in smarter ways.”  Banner image: A black-backed woodpecker in a Parker 2 Fire area in Modoc County, California.

Ten Lehi teens, ages 17 and 18, who have asked to remain anonymous, started a bonfire in American Fork Canyon. They used gasoline to start the fire, which started small but proliferated. Most of the teens got away before the heat became extreme, but three were trapped against a cliff wall.  All the teens were burned on their hands and face due to the extreme heat, and one received burns on the back of one of his legs.  The quick thinking of the teens was vital in keeping the three most badly burned victims alive. One of the trapped teens used his jacket to cover the other two, protecting most of their bodies from burns. Those who escaped threw snow and water on the fire while they rescued their badly burned friends. They stripped off the victims’ coats and hoodies, dipped them in water, and used them to cool off the burns. Some less severely burned teens ran to their vehicles and drove the badly burned victims to the nearest hospital.  Sgt. Spencer Cannon with the Utah County Sheriff’s Office said the three who sustained the worst injuries were on top of the spillway at Silver Lake Flat Reservoir when the incident occurred. Cannon said the teens are “lucky to be alive.” If it weren’t for the quick actions of some of the teens, a worse tragedy would have occurred.  All three badly injured teen boys were transported to the burn unit at the University of Utah Medical Burn Center. Two will require skin graft surgery, but all three are expected to recover fully. One was released in time to attend his high school graduation last Thursday. An Alpine School District spokesperson said, “Our thoughts are with these students and their families as they recover.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbGVoaWZyZWVwcmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9sZWhpLXRlZW5zLWx1Y2t5LXRvLWJlLWFsaXZlLWFmdGVyLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-12-01","Not Discerned","{""Denton"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T09:09:00","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:  Climate change is increasing the fire risk on the mostly treeless Great Plains. Montana Public Radio's Aaron Bolton reports on efforts to get prairie dwellers to adapt to the new reality.  AARON BOLTON, BYLINE: Homebuilder Josh Poser lives in the small town of Denton, surrounded by the grasslands of eastern Montana. The last thing he thought he'd be doing is fighting a wildfire in December, but that's exactly what happened a couple of years ago as 70-mile-an-hour winds pushed flames across 10,000 acres.  JOSH POSER: Late that night, you know, we're putting some embers out in the yard and sprinkler on the roof, and they had patrols going all over the place.  BOLTON: Overnight, flames consumed Poser's house and 24 others. Don Pyrah is with Montana's state fire agency. He says firefighters were quickly overwhelmed because, unusually, there was no snow on the ground in December, and it was way too warm.  DON PYRAH: And it was 56 degrees in the middle of the night. That's not normal.  BOLTON: Researchers say the warming climate means more dry Decembers and a lot less snow cover across the Great Plains, meaning a lot more fire risk during a typically windier time of the year. University of Florida researcher Victoria Donovan led a 2017 study that found fire activity on the Great Plains has increased by 3 1/2 times in recent decades. She says that a century of fire suppression has also allowed more trees and woody vegetation to grow, making fires more intense.  VICTORIA DONOVAN: There's a lot more opportunities for these wildfires to occur and also for them to be a lot more destructive.  BOLTON: That kind of research isn't really embraced in conservative eastern Montana. Official growth policy in the county that had the big fire explicitly opposes President Biden's 2021 executive order on climate change. Mike DeVries is chief of the volunteer fire department in Denton, the town of 200 that was burned over a couple of Decembers ago.  MIKE DEVRIES: I mean, I grew up in Montana, and I know we've been through droughts. I don't know that people just attribute it to one thing.  BOLTON: But DeVries acknowledges that fire was well outside the norm.  DEVRIES: That was by far the most active and unbelievable year that we'd ever had.  BOLTON: Anika Peila with Montana's state fire agency is trying to help people better prepare their homes for fires. She says it's a tougher sell out here than in more forested parts of the state.  ANIKA PEILA: You can blame climate change, the drought, whatever you want to blame, but it ultimately starts with people's homes.  BOLTON: Peila will make suggestions for property owners, like shifting to metal roofs and less flammable building materials or cutting back trees and shrubs near their home. But there's been little interest so far.  PEILA: I feel like that's people's beauty. That's people's paradise.  BOLTON: But Josh Poser, who lost his house in the December fire, is still living with his family in a camper. He takes the threat of another wildfire more seriously now. Standing inside the unfinished walls of the new home he hopes to finish this fall, he says they are building in a more fire-resilient way to avoid losing their home again.  POSER: There will be concrete siding, metal roof. Before, we had - everything was wood - wood windows, wood siding, wood everything. So it was a recipe for disaster.  BOLTON: Those are exactly the kind of changes state fire managers would like to see more people in the Great Plains make. They're hoping others will be more likely to do the same if they see their neighbor do it first.  For NPR News, I'm Aaron Bolton in Denton, Mont.

Fuels, terrain and weather dictate the fire’s spread. Crews are keeping pace with the fire and ensuring that pre-determined objectives are met. Features like roads and trails can act as barriers to fire spread. “The fire effects are being constantly monitored and the Pass Fire is burning naturally in this fire-dependent ecosystem. We appreciate the support of the local communities who are closely monitoring the Pass Fire, as well,” said Pete Valenzuela, Incident Commander.  Weather: High temperatures will be near normal, 80’s to 90’s; winds are expected to increase ahead of a low front which could result in critical fire weather on Wednesday afternoon. Winds are expected to taper off on Thursday. Potential chance for rainshowers arriving this weekend.  Closures: There are no road closures at this time, however firing operations will be intermittently occurring over the next few days along Highway 59 as the fire continues to spread under current fuel and weather conditions.

Officials say flames broke out on the fourth floor of the building on Sullivan Street just before 9 p.m.  Neighbors say the fire smelled electrical and that they didn't her a smoke detector go off. Video from inside the building shows water damage to some neighboring apartments.  ""I heard a knocking on my door, a loud bang, then I hear someone yelling in the hallway,"" resident Korey Benesh recalled.  Both men have been there for decades as longtime residents.  Authorities say one other resident and three firefighters were treated for minor injuries.  FDNY Deputy Chief Michael Barvels says there was clutter in the apartment and the narrow hallways made the operation difficult.  ""You could only fit one person down the hallway at a time. On top of that, trying to move within that apartment is difficult because of all that clutter,"" Barvels said.  The fire was placed under control, but the apartment is badly burned.

"fire","2020-09-07","21:30:00","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T13:04:33","In the darkness of Labor Day night 2020, Mill City fire chief Leland Ohrt looked into the sky and saw fire balls spreading overhead and igniting grass and brush fires in the Santiam Canyon.  The fireballs, he told a jury in Portland last week, came from a wildfire that started 12 miles away in the Opal Creek Wilderness — the Beachie Creek Fire — that had exploded and spread rapidly on historic winds, raining embers into the canyon.  The fires did not, he emphasized, come from downed power lines.  “Every fire that we had in the Mill City area, we came to the conclusion it all came from the Beachie Creek Fire,” said Ohrt, a witness for PacifiCorp during the ongoing trial for the class action lawsuit between victims of the 2020 Labor Day fires and the utility.  Now set to enter its sixth week at Multnomah County Courthouse, the historic trial has entered the phase where PacifiCorp is calling witnesses and experts to defend itself after lawyers for plaintiffs rested their case. The utility is trying to avoid paying millions or maybe billions in damages after its power lines were blamed for igniting wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes in the Santiam Canyon, Lincoln City area and southern Oregon.  Ohrt is a key witness for PacifiCorp. The now retired fire chief was one of the few people who stayed all night in the Santiam Canyon on Labor Day, as he led a group of volunteer firefighters widely credited with saving large parts of Mill City.  And Ohrt has maintained, in stories reported in the Statesman Journal and his testimony, that it was the original Beachie Creek Fire, rather than power lines, that did the lion’s share of damage.  Other witnesses and 911 calls played during the trial have detailed fires sparked by power lines, both in the Santiam Canyon and elsewhere.  By emphasizing the Beachie Creek Fire, PacifiCorp appears to be hoping it can limit some liability. As many as half of the 2,500 members of the class action lawsuit are from the Santiam Canyon.  PacifiCorp asks judge to rule for defense in Santiam Canyon  PacifiCorp lawyers last week made a motion for a “directed verdict” that would essentially allow the judge to rule in favor of the defense in the Santiam Canyon portion of the case.  It would separate a Santiam Canyon decision from the other wildfires being considered, which include the Echo Mountain, 242 and South Obenchain Fire.  “Put simply, plaintiffs’ counsel drew an arbitrary boundary purporting to define the Santiam Canyon class members and to separate them from the owners of properties affected solely by the Beachie Creek Fire,” defense lawyers for PacifiCorp wrote. “But not a single witness, and not a shred of evidence, has been introduced to justify the location of that boundary. In order for plaintiffs to prevail on their class claims, they must provide evidence showing that PacifiCorp is liable to the entire class — which means that plaintiffs must have evidence that PacifiCorp caused property damage to everyone in the class area.”  The judge will likely rule on whether to issue a direct verdict toward the end of the trial in early June. Plaintiffs' lawyers haven’t yet responded to the motion.  Dueling experts on Beachie Creek versus power line fires  Much of the trial has centered on a question residents of the Santiam Canyon have been asking since the day after Labor Day 2020: Where did the original Beachie Creek Fire end and the power line fires begin? And which is more to blame for the destruction?  Beachie Creek ignited in mid-August in a remote part of the Opal Creek Wilderness and was monitored by U.S. Forest Service fire crews for weeks before growing to 500 acres and exploding Labor Day night.  Power lines have been implicated for sparking fires in the canyon that night and were seen by numerous eyewitnesses who called 911.  In the absence of a final investigative report on the cause from state and federal officials — which is officially still incomplete — it has been left to dueling experts for plaintiffs and PacifiCorp.  For the plaintiffs, Oregon State University professor John Bailey testified that, based on his fire modeling, there was no way the Beachie Creek Fire could have reached Gates and the Mill City area before midnight on Labor Day, although he couldn’t make the same claim for Lyons.  Bailey’s mapping showed Beachie Creek staying well north of the canyon as eyewitnesses reported fires breaking out.  For PacifiCorp, atmospheric sciences professor Neil Lareau of the University of Nevada used satellite imagery to make the case the Beachie Creek Fire did send long-range embers that caused the ignition at Potato Hill and several spot fires in the Santiam Canyon by about 9:30 p.m. Labor Day evening.  Both sides also presented testimony from other technical experts on the disputed ignitions from power lines.  Testimony speaks to power lines versus original fire debate  Much of the case could be summed up in Ohrt’s testimony. The fire chief, who led volunteer firefighters credited with saving much of Mill City, testified about having to put out fires sparked by power lines.  In cross-examination, he also said he asked PacifiCorp to shut down power because he thought it might be dangerous. They didn’t, he said.  Even so, Ohrt put a lion’s share of the blame on the original Beachie Creek Fire, even though, as a resident of Gates, he is a member of the class of people who could benefit from PacifiCorp having to pay out a judgement.  “You could tell right off the bat that they were going to go after Pacific Power for this,” he said.  The trial is expected to last until closing arguments in early June, followed by jury deliberation.

"fire","2021-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Canyonville"", ""Oregon"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-29T13:00:13","State researchers predict Oregon could experience a much warmer summer than previous years as the climate shifts to a warmer pattern later this year. But a cooler and wet spring could lead fire season to run longer throughout the year.  Oregon State University researchers recently predicted the state could see a much hotter July and August as the shift from La Niña to El Niño weather patterns begin this year. The shift from La Niña, a naturally occurring cooler weather pattern associated with ocean temperatures an the equator, to El Niño, its warmer counterpart, already has shown signs of its emergence.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  FILE: Children play in the fountain at the Portland waterfront as the temperature rises to more than 100 degrees in June of 2021. Hanin Najjar  Oregon’s state climatologist, Larry O’Neill, said the transition from one phase to another normally doesn’t impact the Pacific Northwest until late summer or fall. Usually, the region feels the effects in winter, he said.  “While we don’t expect an immediate change in Pacific Northwest weather earlier this summer, we could see abnormally warm and dry weather develop later in the summer attributable to El Niño, depending on how quickly El Niño develops,” he said.  Over the past decade, Oregon summers have already been warmer and drier due to climate change, according to O’Neill, and those trends are expected to continue. He said if the weather pattern develops, it could be the warmest El Niño that Earth has experienced because of rising temperatures from climate change.  Over the past decade, Oregonians all around the state have begun to feel the effects of climate change, including more intense wildfires, extreme heat and drought. The rise in temperatures and the prediction of a warmer summer have some already concerned about the fire season.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  That fire season may start later than is typical. Researchers said because of a wet spring and lots of snowpack, the wildfire season could be delayed a few weeks at higher elevations. That isn’t completely good news.  John Bailey, a professor at OSU’s College of Forestry, said he’s concerned a delay in the fire season’s start could be offset by hotter, drier weather stretching into October or even November.  Bailey said when there is a cooler, wetter spring, it makes fuel for wildfires — usually dried out or dead vegetation — more abundant during the warmest months and prone to catching fire.  When heat waves like the one in early May hit the Northwest, it dries up vegetation that has abundantly grown during the wetter months.  “July, August are forecasted to be a little warmer than normal and so that fuel and warmth toward the end of the fire season, I think that’s what has most foresters worried at this point,” Bailey said.  Director of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and professor at OSU Erica Fleishman said these predictions should serve as a warning for the state to be better prepared for extreme heat as well.  Some solutions are already in the works, she said, like regulations for protecting workers laboring in high temperatures. She said other resources like cooling centers and offering heat pumps to households in need should continue. But, she said, the state needs to do more in terms of revising building codes and planting more trees.  “Thinking about the communities that are disproportionately affected by high heat and being able to do some advanced planning, we have that chance now before it really heats up,” she said.  There are several bills in this legislative session that are aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions as well as helping Oregonians adapt to climate change. But an ongoing walkout by state Senate Republicans could sink the dozens of bills aimed at climate action.  According to Senate Minority Leader Tim Knopp, R-Bend, his members may continue their walkout until the last day of the legislative session — June 25 — when they would return to pass “lawful, substantially bipartisan budgets and bills.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzI5L2ZvcmVjYXN0ZXJzLXdvcnJpZWQtYWJvdXQtZXh0ZW5kZWQtb3JlZ29uLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uL9IBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzI5L2ZvcmVjYXN0ZXJzLXdvcnJpZWQtYWJvdXQtZXh0ZW5kZWQtb3JlZ29uLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire at Simmons Village started with a cigarette discarded in mulch beneath a bench, engulfed the bench and quickly climbed the side of the three-story apartment building around 3 p.m. Sunday, Johnston Fire Marshal Thomas Marcello said.  Three people were sent to an area hospital for smoke inhalation, and one firefighter was treated at the scene for heat exhaustion.  The building, with a charred façade, looked a little worse than it actually was because the fire started on the outside of the building. Firefighters knocked down the fire in 20 to 25 minutes, Marcello said. Six housing units were heavily damaged, he said.  Most of the 52 displaced residents are staying with family members or friends while the management company for Simmons Village, Picerne Real Estate Group, is finding places to put the remaining nine to 10 people, Red Cross Senior Director of Disaster Cycle Services Jamie Lynch said.  Simmons Village on its website is described as ""federally subsidized housing for elderly/disabled households.""  Donna Jolly, who lives in the building across the street, said she and many other residents called 911, and the dispatcher thought it was a brush fire.  ""I said, 'no, it's a whole building,'"" she said.  Jolly said she saw the fire start consuming the bench, then climb the side of the building.  ""It went up fast,"" she said. ""So very fast.""  52 people, and lots of pets, are displaced  Half of the units in the building on the side opposite the fire will probably be habitable within one to two weeks while crews try to restore power to the half of the building that was lightly damaged, Marcello said.  On Monday, maintenance crews cleared the hallways and firefighters were able to escort residents into most of the units to get their personal belongings.  One cat, identified as ""Creamsicle,"" appears to still be missing following the fire. At least two other cats were found safe following the fire.  ""A lot of animals were walking around here yesterday,"" Marcello said.  When firefighters arrived, residents were already streaming out of the building while some of those on the third floor called 911 because they were stranded. Firefighters escorted, or carried, those people out of the building, Marcello said.  Residents were either not home or were generally awake when the fire started. If it had been in the middle of the night, the outcome could have been drastically worse, Marcelo said.  Low humidity, high temperatures a recipe for fire  The fire at Simmons Village comes after multiple large fires already this year in Rhode Island.  An April 14 fire in Exeter burned 350 acres of woodland, the largest since a 1942 fire burned 24,500 acres. Another blaze, on April 13, burned 200 acres in the Big River Management Area in West Greenwich.  April 14, 2023 fire:Fueled by dead trees, Exeter wildfire in Queen's River Preserve was largest in RI since 1942  The original 911 call about Simmons Village came in as a brush fire, but as crews drove toward the scene, they saw heavy black smoke and knew it was something more.  Video taken by bystanders shows the fire engulfing the bench and the side of the building.  ""This should have never happened,"" Marcello said.

Before firefighters arrived, the flames had engulfed the second floor, extended into the attic, and had started to descend into the first floor.

A teenage girl has been charged with 19 counts of murder for allegedly starting a deadly fire in a school dormitory in the South American nation of Guyana.  The 15-year-old student was charged as an adult on Monday for the deaths of 18 mostly Indigenous girls and one five-year-old boy at a school in the city of Mahdia.  The Guyana Chronicle, a daily newspaper in the country, reported that the teen appeared by video before the Diamond Magistrate’s Court in the capital Georgetown on Monday.  She was not required to enter a plea to the charges at the hearing, but the court did affirm the teen would be held in custody at a juvenile holding centre until further proceedings could take place.  The Associated Press reported her second court appearance is scheduled for July 5.  In a statement last week, police said that investigations reveal the student “is suspected of having set the devastating fire because her [mobile] phone was taken away by the dorm’s mother and a teacher”.  The charges come as the country continues to grieve the tragic incident, which took place late at night on May 21 at a boarding school that largely serves students from remote Indigenous communities.      The blaze injured more than two dozen students, one of whom was flown to a New York hospital for special treatment in the United States over the weekend. The suspect was also injured during the fire.  Of the 19 dead, 13 could not be “visually identified” after the fire, according to a government statement. On Friday, the government announced that DNA testing had been used to confirm their identities and that authorities would allow the remains to be returned to the victims’ families.  Questions around conditions in the school have become a topic of contention, and ​​Guyana’s Education Minister Priya Manickchand has said that the school’s alarm system and fire preparedness efforts are being investigated.  All five doors in the facility were locked with keys from the inside, which National Security Advisor Gerry Gouveia said the dorm administrator did to prevent students from sneaking out at night.  The dorm administrator’s five-year-old son was among those who died in the fire.  In a Facebook post on Monday, Manickchand said that family members of the victims had been harmed by speculation about the incident circulating on social media. She urged people to refrain from sharing claims without having all of the facts.  “Hold off on mouthing off on your opinions,” Manickchand said. “You do not know better than these parents what is good for their children and families.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjkvdGVlbmFnZWQtc3R1ZGVudC1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtbXVyZGVyLWluLWRlYWRseS1ndXlhbmEtc2Nob29sLWZpcmXSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8yOS90ZWVuYWdlZC1zdHVkZW50LWNoYXJnZWQtd2l0aC1tdXJkZXItaW4tZGVhZGx5LWd1eWFuYS1zY2hvb2wtZmlyZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The application is from MyLS (My Local Safety), a nationwide program available to local police and fire departments.  According to fire district Chief David “Chip” Comstock, the app allows residents to list information about their residence and family. That information is instantly available to first responders, who will have the information before they arrive to a scene.  “You can put as much or as little information as you want,” Comstock said.  The app is first loaded onto a phone, then the resident can go down a list and put in information. They can list family members as well as pets and where they are kept in the house.  Any important medical situations with a family member can be added. An example would be a deaf person. In an example of a fire, responders would know there is a person in the house who cannot hear.  Dangers in the home also can be included, such as storage of gas cans or bottled gas, even ammunition. That information could be an important factor during a response.  Other information could include who has keys and garage door codes, where the nearest hydrant is, number of floors, type of roof material, gas shutoffs and any alarms in the structure.  According to the MyLS web page, the app is a companion to the IamResponding.com system that fire and police departments can choose to use.  Under that system, when a call goes out for service, the first responders will use an iPad map while en route. That map would highlight residences that have the MyLS app. Those homes would come up with a small blue square to let the first responders know there is MyLS information available. While en route, the first responders can scan through the information, which could dictate how the service rendered would take place and could save a life.  Comstock said the information also would be available to any neighboring fire departments that subscribe to the service. He said that would come in handy should all the Poland trucks be at one fire, and a neighboring department is covering other calls in the WRJFD area.  The MyLS app costs the WRJFD $300 per year, according to Comstock. The app is free for residents by going to MyLS.  One other feature available in the Poland area, through the app, is notification. Those with the app can get notices when roads are closed, about power outages and other community data.  “Anyone who wants to use the app and needs help setting it up can come to one of our open houses,” Comstock said.

Sunday evening, a fire damaged two homes and a church in Howard Lake.  While the fire department continues to investigate the cause of the fire, officials say burning embers from the fire landed on the steeple of St. James Lutheran Church and caught fire.  “To see the steeple on fire, for a moment my heart sunk — I thought to myself we’ve seen churches burn down — here goes one,” pastor Mark Loder said.  Loder watched as firefighters stopped the flames from spreading beyond the steeple. Then, he noticed two homes down the block from the church were burning.  “You don’t know what you’ll do in a situation like that; your brain starts to take over, you just do what you need to do,” Richard Block, one of the victims of the fire, said.  Block believes the fire may have started somewhere near his garage before spreading to his home and his neighbor’s house.  “I did hear her chihuahua barking … then it kicked in; she’s not even home,” Block said.  With Block’s neighbor gone, he jumped into action and, with help from a police officer, freed the neighbor’s dogs from their kennels as the fire spread.  While his home was gutted in the fire, Block said he’s thankful his family of eight, their pets, and the neighbor’s animals were all saved.  “There’s nothing left, nothing we can salvage,” Block said.  Even the shoes he’s now wearing were given by someone who stopped to help. But thanks to the St. James congregation, there’s more help coming.  “Even in the midst of this chaos, I thought let’s do a prayer of service and thanksgiving, give prayer and praise no loss of life, and the many blessings that God will put out,” Loder said.  Loder said his congregation is leading a clothing and toy drive for the families who lost their homes. The church plans to collect some items at a Monday night service, but Loder added that anyone interested in helping can send him a message on Facebook.  In the aftermath of such a difficult situation, news of that effort is bringing comfort to Block and his family.  “It’s amazing; it’s nice to see the community come together when you really need it,” Block said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL3RvcC1uZXdzL2NodXJjaC1jb25ncmVnYXRpb24tcmFsbHlpbmctdG8taGVscC12aWN0aW1zLW9mLWhvd2FyZC1sYWtlLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Boatyard Manager Micaela Emory-Wilson said the fire started around 12:30 p.m. She was at home when she got a call from someone at the office.  “By the time I showed up the whole cab was, like, engulfed and everyone was scrambling around,” she said.  Emory-Wilson said fishermen on a neighboring boat tried to put the fire out with extinguishers and garden hoses while others tried to contact the fire department. But she said GCI customers in Naknek have had trouble calling landlines from their cell phones.  “So no one could get through to 911. The call kept dropping,” she said.  One bystander was eventually able to call 911 from a landline, and the Bristol Bay Borough Fire Dept. arrived shortly after.  GCI spokesperson Heather Handyside said in an email that the company has had three ""mobile-to-landline"" outages in Naknek this month due to an issue with equipment — on May 3 - 4, May 13 - 15, and May 21 - 23.  ""We believe we have resolved this issue and don’t expect future interruptions for mobile-to-landline service,"" Handyside said.  Micaela Emory-Wilson / People work to extinguish the fire on the F/V Midnight hour. May 21, 2023.  Emory-Wilson said a neighboring boat downwind of the fire was damaged. Its windows cracked from the heat, and some bumpers and hydraulic lines melted, though the boat’s structure remained intact. A crew member who was on that boat was able to get away uninjured.  “Once the flames got big, the wind was blowing towards his boat. So the flames were next to where his ladder was,"" she said. ""But luckily, he was able to find the ladder on like another neighboring boat’s connex, and he was able to get down.”  Emory-Wilson has worked at the boatyard for six years, and this is the biggest fire she’s seen yet. She said she wants to refine their protocols for fire response and address some safety issues. For instance, the boatyard’s water line doesn’t connect to the fire trucks.  “That wasn't really an issue because the fire department did so good,"" she said. ""There was already a truck behind the one that was filling the main truck. There was already one on standby when that one was empty.”  While that wasn’t a problem this time, Emory-Wilson said, she wants to set up a system to get uninterrupted water in emergencies.  Emory-Wilson didn't know exactly what had caused the fire. The fire department didn't immediately respond to calls requesting an interview.  The fishermen of the F/V Midnight Hour are staying in crew housing for the time being. They still hope to fish on another boat this summer.

CLAIRSVILLE — Flames destroyed a barn outside St. Clairsville on Monday, but no people or animals were hurt by the blaze.  Barton Fire Chief Kirk Smolenak said the blaze, which broke out around noon, was reported by a neighbor who noticed smoke coming from the structure shortly after the property owner had left and came to the site to investigate. Smolenak added that the fire started in the front of the barn, which was constructed mainly of metal — a factor that he said helped to retain the heat of the fire.  “It’s obviously a total loss,” the chief noted. “I don’t know a cause. I don’t know if there’s electricity in there. … But when we were trying to combat the fire, there was some arcing and stuff.”  The fire occurred on Crescent Road, prompting the activation of the Belmont County Tanker Task Force due the relatively remote setting and a lack of nearby hydrants.  Among the departments that responded, according to Belmont County’s 911 Center, were Cumberland Trail, Bethesda, Bellaire, Brookside, Sunset Heights, Morristown, Belmont, Dillonvale, Adena, Wolfhurst and Colerain. The Salvation Army canteen truck was also at the scene to provide drinks, snacks and support for the firefighters.  “We appreciate the help,” Smolenak said. “And it did kind of hit us on a holiday, so we did have some extra guys around who would be at work, so we did get out of the building pretty quick and got here pretty quick, but the end result isn’t the best.

(Nikos Frazier/Quad City Times via AP) Fire chief: 1 person rescued overnight from Iowa building collapse; No deaths reported Fire chief: 1 person rescued overnight from Iowa building collapse; No deaths reported  DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) — One person was found overnight at the site of a collapsed apartment building in Iowa, bringing the total number of people rescued from the crumbling structure to eight, authorities said Monday.  Davenport Fire Chief Michael Carlsten said at a news conference Monday that it was unclear if anyone was still missing after part of the six-story complex crashed to the ground in the eastern Iowa city. No deaths have been reported.  “No known individuals are trapped in that facility,” Carlsten said. Authorities have not released how many people were injured or provided details on the nature of their injuries. Carlsten did say that the person who was rescued overnight was in the hospital.  Rescue teams, including K-9 units, were inside the building all night.  “When something like this happens here, and tragedy strikes, our responders immediately do their work and their job and I can’t thank them enough,” Davenport Mayor Mike Matson said.  Rescuers were called to the scene shortly before 5 p.m. Sunday. Fire crews rescued seven people and escorted more than a dozen others from the building in their initial response.  Earlier, Carlsten said the back of the apartment complex collapsed and had separated from the building, which houses apartments on the upper floors and businesses on the ground level.  Authorities found a gas leak after the collapse, Carlsten said, while water also had leaked throughout the floors of the structure.  The stability of the building was still a concern.  Carlsten said officials were “currently finishing the rescue phase of our operation and soon it will become a recovery operations.”  The cause of the collapse was not immediately known.  Rich Oswald, City of Davenport director of development and neighborhood services, said at a news conference Sunday that work was being done on the building’s exterior at the time of the collapse.  Reports of bricks falling from the building earlier this week were part of that work and the building’s owner had a permit for the project, Oswald said.  The Quad-City Times reported Robert Robinson, a second-floor resident, had gone outside and returned as alarms went off in the building.  “When we started to go back in the lights went out,” he told the newspaper. “All of a sudden everybody started running out saying the building collapsed. I’m glad we came down when we did.”  Robinson and his girlfriend were able to take the elevator down just in time, he said.  “This is horrible,” he said. “We don’t have anywhere to go. Nothing to eat.”  Tadd Machovec, a Davenport contractor, told the newspaper he was inside putting up a support beam when the building came down.  Some people in the area said the building has had problems. City officials said Sunday that they had several complaints from residents about needed repairs.  “The tenants told us the building was going to collapse,” said Jennifer Smith, co-owner of Fourth Street Nutrition, which moved into the building this winter.  “It sounds bad, but we have been calling the city and giving complaints since December. Our bathroom caved in December,” she said.  Smith said water damage has been apparent since they moved into their space. Her fellow co-owner, Deonte Mack, said fire crews were in the building as recently as Thursday for an inspection.  The Quad-City Times reported the building is owned by Andrew Wold. A working phone number for Wold was not immediately available Sunday night and attempts to reach him for comment were unsuccessful.  The newspaper reported nearly 20 permits were filed in 2022 for building repairs, mainly for plumbing or electrical issues, according to the county assessor’s office.  Authorities were still trying to determine if there were any missing people associated with the building. The mayor said some residents didn’t have cellphones or a second way of reaching them.  There were 84 units in the building, a mixture of residential and commercial spaces, the mayor said.  In June 2021, 98 people died when a high-rise condominium near Miami Beach collapsed in the middle of the night.  The Champlain Towers South had a long history of maintenance problems, and shoddy construction techniques were used in the early 1980s. Other possible factors for the collapse include sea level rise caused by climate change and damage caused by saltwater intrusion.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9maXJlLWNoaWVmLTEtcGVyc29uLXJlc2N1ZWQtb3Zlcm5pZ2h0LWZyb20taW93YS1idWlsZGluZy1jb2xsYXBzZS1uby1kZWF0aHMtcmVwb3J0ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Helena"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-28T13:00:00","Gift this article Share this article paywall-free.  For many of our central Montana communities, the unseasonably early wildfire smoke from Canada brings heightened anticipation of the fire year to come.  As the forest supervisor of the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest, I have the honor to oversee the management of nearly 2.9 million acres of public lands from the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex through Lincoln and Helena and east to the Snowy Mountains. Having spent over a decade studying and working on fire and landscape resilience issues within similar forests and communities, I understand the benefits that fire can bring, and the concerns people may have.  Over the last few decades, our understanding of wildfire in the West has made it clear that we need to get fire back on the land under the right weather conditions to reduce expensive and severe wildfires. By reducing fuels and introducing more prescribed fire, we invest in protecting forests, our homes and communities, drinking water, and our favorite places to recreate. If we don’t expand the amount of fire we introduce under the right weather conditions, a heavier burden is passed down to taxpayers and communities in terms of continued wildfire impacts.  Managing fuels — or the things a wildfire would burn — is our best chance to change how a wildfire impacts the land.  Prescribed fire is the most effective way to reduce fuels, both surface fuels (e.g. grasses and pine needles) and ladder fuels (e.g. small trees or branches on trees near the ground) that carry fire across the landscape. Historically, frequent wildfires would have removed many thousands of small trees, but the impressive effectiveness of our suppression work has led to dense forested areas where it is neither safe nor effective to use prescribed fire. In these situations, we can thin forests before we reintroduce fire. A combination of thinning or mechanical fuels reduction along with prescribed fire is our best bet to reduce the size and severity of wildfire while protecting our forests and communities.  We’re fortunate to have exceptional partners with whom we plan and implement projects that make a real difference on the ground.  For many years now we have worked closely with partners on the Capital 360 Project to accomplish fuels reduction work around Helena. This work is a great investment for taxpayers as it not only protects the city of Helena and homes but also helps protect the Ten Mile Creek Watershed, Helena’s primary drinking water source. Additional partners in this work include the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation; Tri-County FireSafe Working Group; Natural Resource Conservation Service; Bureau of Land Management; Lewis and Clark, Broadwater, and Jefferson counties; the city of Helena; and local fire districts and residents.  We are also working with partners and have collectively obtained over $7 million in funding for the Elkhorn Range to carry out work that will foster more resilient forests and landscapes. Starting this summer, meadow and shrubland restoration, the reintroduction of fire, and weed mitigation efforts will improve wildlife habitat and restore grasslands to more historical conditions leading to more resilient landscapes and enhanced recreational opportunities, such as hunting and hiking.  We are combining these focused projects with innovative, landscape-scale work.  One project we’re particularly excited about is our forestwide prescribed fire project. The idea is to analyze the introduction of prescribed fire across the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest so that when narrow windows of opportunity arise, we can take advantage of just the right weather and forest conditions to reduce the risk of catastrophic outcomes when wildfires hit under untenable weather conditions. You can visit: tinyurl.com/ymd4mnzs to learn more about this project. We anticipate a comment period on the environmental assessment sometime this fall.  Fuels reduction and prescribed fire mean safer communities, and a safer, more effective response for fire personnel. This work would not be possible without our industry, government, NGO and community partners — thank you. And we are always open to hearing from you about what you value about our national forestlands and how we can better serve the community.  Feel free to reach out anytime to let us know what you think.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL210c3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1uaXN0cy9lbWlseS1wbGF0dC1mdWVscy1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tYW5kLXByZXNjcmliZWQtZmlyZS1tZWFuLXNhZmVyLWNvbW11bml0aWVzL2FydGljbGVfYjdhNzIxMjAtZmJmNi0xMWVkLTg1YTMtMWJhYTcxMDQxZjQ3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

More than a dozen low-cost devices, several with substandard, unfused plugs, were on offer on all three websites, a Guardian investigation with the charity Electrical Safety First (ESF) found.  Fire brigades have warned incompatible chargers paired with the wrong lithium ion batteries are a key source of e-bike and e-scooter fires that can quickly become catastrophic. Since 2020, eight people have been killed and at least 190 injured by e-bike and e-scooter fires in the UK.  A snapshot investigation this month revealed 15 different chargers being offered on Amazon, eBay and Wish.com by British and Chinese sellers that were likely to breach UK safety regulations. Several have clover-shaped plugs that increase the risk of an electric shock. Technicians opened the plugs bought on Amazon and eBay and found they had no fuse.  An e-bike battery charger bought from Amazon, which was unfused. Photograph: Supplied  Responding to the investigation, London fire brigade’s deputy commissioner Dom Ellis said the risk of significant fires was increasing as sales of e-bikes and scooters grew. He urged the public to “always use the correct charger and buy an official one from a reputable seller”.  On Monday, 25 firefighters were called out to a house fire in Newham, east London, caused by an e-bike that had been left on to charge. In March, a man died and 17 were left homeless when a food courier’s charging e-bike battery combusted in an overcrowded flat in Tower Hamlets, east London.  The National Fire Chiefs Council said: “When these batteries and chargers fail, they do so with ferocity and because the fires develop so rapidly, the situation can quickly become incredibly serious.”  Lesley Rudd, the chief executive of ESF, said: “Online marketplaces are failing to get to grips with substandard and dangerous products on their platforms. None of the charging devices we found should have been on sale to the public.”  The online retailers were warned last September by ESF to remove sellers who offered the devices and did so at the time. After being approached by the Guardian this week, all three websites withdrew the latest chargers identified.  Devices removed from Wish.com included a scooter charger from China that was on sale for just £5.36. The website launched “an extensive sweep for any similar and identical listings” and said it had informed affected customers.  Amazon removed five chargers, all imported from China with clover-shaped plugs, most of which originated from Guangdong province, a big electronics manufacturing hub. It said safety was “a top priority” and that it required all products to “comply with applicable laws and regulations”.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What makes the veteran trout fishermen sit up and take notice is the expert manner in which young Judy fly casts — she uses a special 3 ounce rod that has been cut down to a 7 foot length to be adaptable to her. Her father, who taught her the science of correct fly casting, admits that she is better than he is — and that’s saying a lot coming from a man who was born and raised near a trout stream in Pennsylvania.  Judy has been trout fishing since she was 3 years old, and has achieved her prowess through experience. Her skill has paid off in good dividends, her father will testify, as she has gotten some excellent catches.  A typical scene at Central high school is this one with J.G.

The building which burned Friday night was built 12 years ago at a cost of $15,000 to replace the previous building, which was also burned. Insurance covers the loss up to $10,000.  ADVERTISEMENT  The fire was discovered at 11 p.m. and it is believed that it started a full hour before it was noticed. Villagers were helpless to combat the flames when discovered because the fire had too much of a start.  The cause of the fire is unknown. Some residents of Wentworth think, however, that it may have been caused by electric wiring. The school was wired for electric lights last fall. The fire which destroyed the schoolhouse 12 years ago started from a defective furnace.  But one more day of school remained for the 87 pupils enrolled in the Wentworth school. The students were scheduled to attend school Monday to make up a day lost during the regular school year, which ended Friday.

"fire","2023-05-29","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-29T05:07:07","Memorial Day marks the start of summer, and the National Fire Protection Agency has a few tips for keeping safe outdoors.  Barbecue is a summer staple, and according to the NFPA, causes more than 10,000 fires annually, resulting in approximately 10 deaths and nearly 20,000 hospital visits each year.  The primary causes of grill fires are failure to clean the grill, putting combustible materials too close to the grill's heat source, leaving the grill or equipment unattended or leaks in the grill or fuel source.  In 2021, El Dorado Fire Captain Norman Langley said it's important to keep an eye on one's surroundings while grilling.  ""You want to account for smaller kids and keep the area clear and safe with no tripping hazards. As with fireworks, you want to have a hose or bucket nearby in case things get out of hand. And if anything comes up, don't hesitate to call us. We can always turn around and go back if it's under control by the time we get there,"" Langley said.  The NFPA recommends checking the gas tank for leaks before use for those who use propane grills. The grill lid should be open before it's lit, as well.  Those using charcoal grills should be careful to use only charcoal starter fluid, and it should only be added before a fire has started. Once one is done grilling, they should let the charcoal cool completely before disposing of it.  Grills should be placed well away from one's home or any other structures, the NFPA says. One should also remove grease and fat buildup from below and in between the grills.

The two prescribed fire units are the 1,931-acre Cold Springs unit, located along Forest Road 94 southeast of Apache Creek, and the 1,592-acre Sheep Basin unit, located south of the Village of Reserve (acres corrected for both units).  Live fuels are holding high moisture content, making them resistant to burning, while dead and down logs and other surface fuels are dry enough to be consumed. These conditions are ideal for achieving fuels reduction for community protection and forest restoration objectives identified in the Cold Springs and Sheep Basin project areas. Thirty miles to the southeast, other fire crews are using a confine and contain strategy in response to the lightning-caused Pass wildfire, allowing fire to play its natural role in fire-dependent forest. Though prescribed fire and wildfire are distinctly different, both can be tools for achieving similar resource objectives.  “There is a critical need to increase the pace and scale of treating forests that have been impacted by the loss of frequent fire, in order to change the trajectory of increasingly destructive wildfires,” said Reserve District Ranger Amanda Gehrt. “Fire is the most effective and efficient tool for removing hazardous fuels and restoring a more natural forest structure to these fire-dependent Southwestern Forest ecosystems.”  Low-lying smoke and heavy presence of firefighters on forest roads may periodically impact the public’s access to areas adjacent to the prescribed fire. If this occurs, road guards and/or signs will be in place to warn of hazards. Smoke may linger at night and early morning and will be visible from Reserve, Aragon, Apache Creek, and Cruzville. The Forest Service is coordinating with New Mexico Environment Department and will follow smoke management guidelines. Air quality information and health protection measures are posted online at NM Fire Info | Smoke Management.

The mom I met with this morning was in good spirits, a little overwhelmed and I think still in shock as any parent would be,” Dr. Eric Cioe-Peña, vice president of Center for Global Health, said.  Cioe-Peña says the Guyanese government suggested that she should go to New York to get a higher level of care. Northwell Health has relationships with Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation in Guyana.  “We’re really a phonecall away and we have always said if you need us give us a call we are happy to help and they took us up on our offer. I think this was the patient that was the most injured,” Cioe-Peña said.  A vigil was held at Faith Assembly Church on Friday, which was also Guyana’s Independence Day.  Richard David is first-generation Guyanese and was at the vigil.  “It was hugely traumatic, heartbreaking, and we are having vigils after vigils because it was one way for our community to gather to deal with this huge sense of loss,” David, board member of The Indo-Caribbean Alliance, said.  David said he spoke to people at the vigil with a connection to the victims.  “They shared stories of growing up there, going to that same dormitory and being friends with the victims that passed away,” David said.  New York state Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar held a vigil Sunday.  She represents an area in Queens referred to as Little Guyana.  “We have 140,000 Guyanese Americans here in New York City, so we support one another and there is a direct line from Guyana to Little Guyana and that is why we are coming together,” Rajkumar said.  While the Guyanese community mourns, Northwell Health is providing resources to help people during this difficult time on the ground in Guyana and a call in line for people in the city.  “This is a line set up specifically with grief counselors they are aware of the Mahdia fire they don’t need to be reeducated on what happened or why they are sad and what is going on and we hope it is a resource for the community,” Cioe-Peña said.  The free line for mental health support is 1-833-327-1001.  The line is operating Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The line is not open on Memorial Day.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55MS5jb20vbnljL2FsbC1ib3JvdWdocy9wdWJsaWMtc2FmZXR5LzIwMjMvMDUvMjgvZ3V5YW5hLWRvcm1pdG9yeS1maXJlLXZpY3RpbS1pcy1iZWluZy10cmVhdGVkLWluLW5ldy15b3JrLWNpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

RELATED |  The fire happened at the Columbia Island Marina after midnight Sunday morning. Investigators have not released a cause, but nobody was hurt.  D.C. Fire and EMS Public Information Officer Vito Maggiolo said these fires can be destructive for a number of reasons.  ""Once they catch fire, they can burn very quickly. They're plastic, they're wood, and also they have fuel. They're a vessel and carry fuel. That combination will cause a fire to quickly envelop the boat,"" Maggiolo said. ""Because the boats are very close to each other in the marina, fire will quickly spread, as it did last night. A combination of attacking the fire from both the land and the water, we were able to cut the fire off before it can spread even beyond that. Marina fires can be very bad and very dangerous.""    Hours after crews extinguished the fire, onlookers could not believe what they were seeing: the charred boats still floating on the water.  ""We saw pictures of it, and we were going to check on our boat anyways and thought, 'Let's go check this out,'"" said Christine Dolan, a boater.    Fires are not the only safety hazard first responders want boaters to be aware of.  With many people expected to be on the water Monday, Maggiolo said he wants to remind people to be responsible.  ""People do like to drink. They like the recreational component of the water, but just like we tell people don't drink and drive when you're on a boat, you're driving,"" Maggiolo said.    Boaters are well aware of how dangerous it can get when drinking and boating.  ""The drinking, everybody loves it. You want to be in the water. I would recommend to be careful because you're in the water, anybody can fall, nobody knows the person is there, the Potomac has currents. You have to be very very careful,"" said Orlando Karpf, a boater.    While out on the water, boaters told 7News it's easy to spot recklessness.  ""I'm ex-Coast Guard reserve and I did search-and-rescue for law enforcement in Florida. I find that overall the D.C. boating community does a good job with boater safety,"" said Tom Dolan, a boater.  His wife Christine added: ""It's pretty easy to spot the knuckleheads that are out there. When they come out, there are certain tell-tale signs. You see them, kind of like out in the road if you're an alert driver, get out of their way.""  Maggiolo said there are other precautions to take.  ""We have full staffing on at least two fire boats. We up staff when there's extra boating activity. Our responsibilities are primarily rescue, fire operations, rescue operations,"" Maggiolo said. ""The most critical is everybody on the vessel should have a personal flotation device: children, adults. You need to have those devices. It's preferred you have them on, but at least have them at the ready so in an emergency, God forbid, you have to leave the vessel, you're prepared for that. When you take your vessel out, make sure it's functioning properly. Check it out beforehand. Know the rules of the road so you don't get yourself in an emergency situation where we need to come and assist you. Every vessel should have a carbon monoxide detector and smoke alarm. You should have a working fire extinguisher on the boat.""  Maggiolo also recommends having a cell phone or a two-way radio. On that two-way radio, you can access the emergency channel, channel 16.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3dqbGEuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWVtb3JpYWwtZGF5LWJvYXRpbmctc2FmZXR5LW1lYXN1cmVzLWNvbHVtYmlhLWlzbGFuZC1tYXJpbmEtZmlyZS13YXNoaW5ndG9uLWRjLXZpdG8tbWFnZ2lvbG8tZHJpbmtpbmctYWxjb2hvbC1ib2F0aW5nLWNhcmVmdWwtY3VycmVudHMtY29hc3QtZ3VhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There is no other word for it and the cycle that comes after that as for the 40 firefighters here and you know what’s coming in the family and how are you going to deal with that and how are you going to tell them. It was just an explosive amount of emotion to deal with.”  His family, those who love him, and his fellow firefighters are left with a huge hole in their hearts.  “It’s an emotional roller coaster. You see it in waves hour after hour, sometimes we are crying, sometimes we’re laughing. The hole is already being filled because of who he was. You say the name, James Michael Mueller and you have to smile. If you’re not smiling it’s because you didn’t know him. So that is how we are going to heal. You already got me smiling because you bring up his name and it just brings a smile. Awesome memories,” said Chief Sonefeld.  Notice a spelling or grammar error in this article?

It’s the day he woke up and saw his business, Cuzzo’s Cuisine, in flames.  What You Need To Know A fire ripped through Cuzzo’s Cuisine in West Charlotte on May 17, 2023 causing an estimated $125,000 in damage    Co-owner and head chef Andarrio Johnson is working to raise funds to pay his employees, because he says unemployment is not enough to survive    Programs like Culinary Connections, which feeds children for free at Cuzco’s, are on hold  The Charlotte Fire Department says someone driving by the restaurant early that morning saw the flames and called 911. Investigators ruled the fire accidental due to an electrical problem, causing at least $125,000 in damage.  Cheffing it up since he was 14, Johnson joined forces with his cousin — thus the name “Cuzzo’s” — and poured his heart, soul and South Carolina roots into a food truck in 2014. And in 2016 they opened their first brick and mortar on Tuckaseegee Road.  “You come in this door, we want you to feel the love,” he said. “Feel like you’re at home. We treat you like family.”  They fed kids who walked through their doors for free Tuesday-Friday like they were his own children with the help of donations. But now that’s at a standstill since this was the only location that offered the service.  In the meantime, he wants to continue to help his employees.  “They’re family, and I want to make sure they’re taken care of, because unemployment is not enough to — nowadays — not enough to live off of,” he said.  He says he started a gofundme page to pay his employees. Considering the circumstances, they will qualify for unemployment, but he says the $350 a week maximum that North Carolina offers will still leave his team with unpaid bills.

(Courtesy Mascoma Valley Preservation) Courtesy Mascoma Valley Preservation  CANAAN VILLAGE — On the evening of June 2, 1923, after a fire had taken out most of their town center, Canaan residents gathered at the one church still standing downtown to pray.  One hundred years later, on Friday morning at 10:30 a.m., residents will once again gather at the Methodist Church to pay tribute to the two lives and the 48 buildings lost to the fire. The service — which will conclude with the bells ringing 50 times — is part of two days of events planned by Friends of Canaan Village and Canaan Historical Society to commemorate the 1923 fire.  “It’s something we’ve talked about, but digging in deep it really comes alive, how much this hurt the town and how much suffering there was,” Robin Parker, a co-organizer of the commemoration who runs Canaan Hardware, which her family has owned for 100 years. “Yet they mention in (historic documents) is that that first thing members of the town did was go to the only church that was still standing and prayed.”  Other events planned for the two-day celebration include an exhibit at the Canaan Town Library that features art Gary Hamel created from remnants of the fire titled “Putting The Pieces Back Together,” a performance by The Firehouse Dixieland Jazz Band and talks about the fire.  Visit Facebook: “Commemoration of the 1923 Canaan Fire” for a complete schedule of events.  Like other Canaan residents, Parker grew up hearing about the fire, but not necessarily the details of what took place. Dale Barney, a lifelong Canaan resident and businessman, who is one of the co-organizers of the event, heard stories about what the town looked like before and it how it was rebuilt after.  “In the Barney family we had a lot of loss on that day,” Barney said. “Nobody was injured, but they lost a lot of property and businesses.”  As he and Parker helped plan the activities, they delved deeper into that history.  “What I had kind of heard was that Canaan was a thriving town and growing fast with the depot coming through and was really kind of the city in the area,” said Parker, whose great-great grandfather started the hardware store after the fire. “After the fire it just took so much rebuilding that Lebanon had taken over that role in the Upper Valley from them.”  The fire started in a hay bale on School Street on the morning of June 2. The dry conditions and high winds caused the flames to quickly spread. Many buildings had wood-shingled roofs and the wind blew flaming shingles throughout downtown. Horatio Gilman and his son, Sydney, died trying to save the family shop.  “Within 20 minutes after the fire started, the Baptist Church was gone and there were several other buildings that were on fire,” town historian Donna Zani-Dunkerton said. “The whole downtown business district was gone within two hours.”  At the time, Canaan Village was known as East Village and was the town’s center of commerce, Zani-Dunkerton said.  But Canaan residents did not let the fire overwhelm them: They dipped quilts and brooms in water to beat out the flames to help the town’s fire department save buildings. That work continued even after fire departments from neighboring towns arrived.  “People got up on the roofs of these houses, they had a water brigade, they passed buckets of water and got them up to the roofs of the houses,” Zani-Dunkerton said. “A lot of these buildings were on fire several times.”  After the fire was put out, residents gathered to decide what to do next. Businesses and homes were wiped out, including railroad buildings that had been central to the town’s economy.  “They didn’t linger,” Zani-Dunkerton said. “They announced the next day that they were going to rebuild.”  Among the buildings that burned were the town’s train station and freight house. Two miles of train track had been warped by the flames, and crews replaced them the day of the fire. Telegraph lines quickly went up and rail cars were set up to be a post office, train station and freight office.  “The first year after the Canaan fire, half of the buildings had been rebuilt and several other ones were under construction,” Zani-Dunkerton said.  A group of town businessmen and residents formed a corporation called the Canaan Rehabilitation Corporation to take on the rebuild, said Andrew Cushing, president of the nonprofit organization Mascoma Valley Preservation. The group set guidelines for construction — no wood shingle roofs, for one — and decided that new structures should be built in the “colonial style.”  The train station and the freight shed, located at the end of Depot Street, were among the first to be rebuilt.  “I think it was a sign of optimism that Canaan Village would still be the economic hub of the town,” Cushing said.  The train station now is a private residence and the nonprofit organization Mascoma Valley Preservation is beginning to restore the freight shed, which is owned by the town of Canaan.  The building was used by the railroads until around the 1960s and in the decades since had been used as a storage facility. In 2017 it was put on the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance’s Seven to Save list.  “The fire was awful, but it was remarkable that the town was built back,” Judith Kushner, vice president of Mascoma Valley Preservation, who has been a leader in the effort to restore the shed, said during a tour of the freight shed.  So far, the slate roof has been repaired and sill work has been done on the exterior of the building.  Volunteers have hacked away brush and worked to clear the interior of junk. “It’s a neat structure,” Kushner said as she pointed to remnants left behind by the railroad, including signs.  Grants and private donations have funded the work so far. While the building has been stabilized, there is still a long way to go before the building can be put to use.  “Once all the work is done, we’d love to use it to incubate business,” Cushman said. “Whether that is a bike shop or whether that’s a restaurant or a bar, we want to use it in a way that keeps the momentum of downtown Canaan’s revitalization up.”  Preserving the building can also help honor the town’s history and recovery, which will be on display in full force when the 1923 fire commemoration takes place June 2 and 3.  “It just grew up of the ashes so fast,” Parker said. “I just think we need to honor how hard everybody worked to rebuild the town and how quickly they came together to be united and that is not easy when you’re suffering and hurting and broke.”  Liz Sauchelli can be reached at esauchelli@vnews.com or 603-727-3221.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZuZXdzLmNvbS9PdXQtLS1BYm91dC1DYW5hYW4tY29tbWVtb3JhdGVzLTE5MjMtZmlyZS01MTA2MDI4OdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

LOUIS – Residents in a north St. Louis neighborhood are voicing concerns about the empty warehouse that caught fire Saturday evening. Many say the building has been a hub for seemingly criminal activity for years and hope it will now be demolished.  More than 12 hours after the fire initially started, firefighters remained on-site Sunday morning. Although the fire was put out around 10 p.m. Saturday, firefighters stayed overnight and into the morning to hose down a few hotspots left over from the massive fire.  “We heard some crackling, then when we looked up, we saw black smoke,” Darnell Gordon said.  Cell phone video shows the warehouse engulfed, with fire shooting out of the vacant building, and a huge cloud of smoke that could be seen for miles around the region.  Roughly 85 firefighters responded to the scene. Although the cause of the fire is unknown, St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson believes it looks suspicious.  “It just took off too fast. The first company was on the scene, and they were preparing to take an inch and ¾ in to make an interior attack, and then the second floor just entirely lit up, and that’s a big building for it to lit up like that,” he said.  Thankfully, the fire was put out and no one was hurt, but some in the community say the eyesore, which is adjacent to multiple apartment complexes, has been a problem and has long-concerned residents.  “I’m glad they got it out, because now the building will be gone, because nobody uses it for nothing, nobody but homeless people going in there or people doing drugs,” Gordon said. “That don’t look good, it makes the neighborhood look bad,”  The former timber construction warehouse near North 7th and O’Fallon streets has been vacant for years. Now that the building is gutted and filled with charred debris, it’s unclear whether it’ll be torn down; but it’s currently unsafe.  “It should have been torn down years ago, because it’s been like that for a long time,” said a nearby churchgoer, “it just makes the neighborhood look real bad.”  An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9taXNzb3VyaS9yZXNpZGVudHMtY2FsbC1mb3ItcHJvYmxlbS13YXJlaG91c2UtdG8tYmUtdG9ybi1kb3duLWFmdGVyLW1hc3NpdmUtZmlyZS_SAW5odHRwczovL2ZveDJub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbWlzc291cmkvcmVzaWRlbnRzLWNhbGwtZm9yLXByb2JsZW0td2FyZWhvdXNlLXRvLWJlLXRvcm4tZG93bi1hZnRlci1tYXNzaXZlLWZpcmUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2019-07-06","Not Discerned","{""Missoula"", ""Montana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-28T21:22:30","×  More than 200 loads of retardant got into waterways over the past decade  BILLINGS, Mont. – The U.S. government can keep using chemical retardant dropped from aircraft to fight wildfires, despite finding that the practice pollutes streams in western states in violation of federal law, a judge ruled Friday.  Halting the use of the red slurry material could have resulted in greater environmental damage from wildfires, said U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen in Missoula, Montana.  The judge agreed with U.S. Forest Service officials who said dropping retardant into areas with waterways was sometimes necessary to protect lives and property.  The ruling came after came after environmentalists sued following revelations that the Forest Service dropped retardant into waterways hundreds of times over the past decade.  Government officials say chemical fire retardant can be crucial to slowing the advance of dangerous blazes. Wildfires across North America have grown bigger and more destructive over the past two decades as climate change warms the planet.  More than 200 loads of retardant got into waterways over the past decade. Federal officials say those situations usually occurred by mistake and in less than 1% of the thousands of loads annually.  A coalition that includes Paradise, California – where a 2018 blaze killed 85 people and destroyed the town – had said a court ruling that stopped the use of retardant would have put lives, homes and forests at risk.  “This case was very personal for us,” Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin said. “Our brave firefighters need every tool in the toolbox to protect human lives and property against wildfires, and today’s ruling ensures we have a fighting chance this fire season.”  State and local agencies lean heavily on the U.S. Forest Service to help fight fires, many of which originate or include federal land.  Fire retardant is a specialized mixture of water and chemicals including inorganic fertilizers or salts. It’s designed to alter the way fire burns, making blazes less intense and slowing their advance.  That can give firefighters time to steer flames away from inhabited areas and in extreme situations to evacuate people from danger.  “Retardant lasts and even works if it’s dry,” said Scott Upton, a former region chief and air attack group supervisor for California’s state fire agency. “Water is only so good because it dries out. It does very well to suppress fires, but it won’t last.”  The Oregon-based group Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics argued in its lawsuit filed last year that the Forest Service was disregarding the Act by continuing to use retardant without taking adequate precautions to protect streams and rivers.  Christensen said stopping the use of fire retardant would “conceivably result in greater harm from wildfires – including to human life and property and to the environment.” The judge said his ruling was limited to 10 western states where members of the plaintiff's group alleged harm from pollution into waterways that they use.  After the lawsuit was filed the Forest Service applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for a permit that would allow it to continue using retardant without breaking the law. The process could take several years.  Such a permit could require tighter restrictions on when retardant could be used or for officials to use less-toxic chemicals, said Andy Stahl with Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics.  “It's certainly a good first step,” Stahl said.  Christensen ordered federal officials to report every six months on their progress.  Forest Service spokesperson Wade Muehlhof said the agency believes retardant can be used “without compromising public health and the environment.”  “The Forest Service is working diligently with the Environmental Protection Agency on a general permit for aerially delivered retardant that will allow us to continue using wildfire retardant to protect homes and communities,” Muehlhof said.  Climate change, people moving into fire-prone areas, and overgrown forests are creating more catastrophic megafires that are harder to fight.  Almost 150 million gallons (567 million liters) of fire retardant were dropped on National Forest lands between 2013 and 2022, according to the Department of Agriculture. Retardant drops onto forests in California accounted for 49% of the total volume.  Health risks to firefighters or other people who come into contact with fire retardant are considered low, according to a 2021 risk assessment.  But the chemicals can be harmful to some fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic species. A government study found misapplied retardant could adversely affect dozens of imperiled species, including crawfish, spotted owls and fish such as shiners and suckers.  Forest Service officials said they are trying to come into compliance with the law by getting a pollution permit but that could take years.  To keep streams from getting polluted, officials in recent years have avoided drops inside buffer zones within 300 feet (92 meters) of waterways. Retardant may only be applied inside those zones when human life or public safety is threatened. Of 213 instances of fire retardant landing in water between 2012 and 2019, 190 were accidents and the remainder were necessary to save lives or property, officials said.  Many areas of the Western U.S. experienced heavy snowfalls this past winter, and as a result fire dangers are lower than in recent years across much of the region.  ×","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1qb3VybmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9qdWRnZS1zYXlzLWZpcmUtcmV0YXJkYW50LWRyb3BzLWFyZS1wb2xsdXRpbmctc3RyZWFtcy1idXQtYWxsb3dzLXVzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But not only is it important to have your own plan, knowing the neighbors’ plans — particularly if they are elderly or disabled — can help save lives.  Evacuations are most effective when everyone, not just firefighters, is prepared, authorities say.  “Know your neighborhood, know who lives next door, know who lives across the street from you,” said San Diego Fire-Rescue Department Capt. Alma Lowry, at a recent town hall meeting in Tierrasanta. “You can actually help them and assist them in evacuating.”  Advertisement  Lowry and others spoke at the hour-long event last week, hosted by San Diego City Councilmember Raul Campillo and the Fire-Rescue Department. It was held at the Tierrasanta Recreation Center.  About 30 residents attended.  Major rain in recent months has caused vegetation growth throughout the region — fuel for wildfires, firefighters said.  Many people who attended the town hall talked about the Cedar Fire, which ignited east of Ramona in October 2003, and quickly burned west — eventually burning more than 273,200 acres, destroying 2,820 buildings and killing 15 people, including one firefighter.  Some attendees said they were given only a few minutes notice that their neighborhoods were being evacuated, and they were stuck in traffic for hours as they tried to drive to safer areas.  “People were very impatient,” said Kenneth Phillips, whose Tierrasanta home backs up against the Mission Trails Regional Park. “They were driving over people’s yards to get out.”  Fire authorities have said for years that they have made significant improvements in how they respond to fire emergencies. Many of those improvements are in the areas of fire equipment, fire organization and communication with residents as well as among different agencies and governments.  Lowry said the Fire-Rescue Department holds community-specific drills with other emergency agencies to practice how to make evacuations run more smoothly.  She added that computer software from San Diego Gas & Electric provides firefighters with information to predict how wildland fires will spread. Based on that system, text alerts and evacuation notices can be sent out to homes, giving hours of advanced warning for residents to leave.  Campillo said it is important for residents to know their responsibility to maintain 100-feet of defensible space around their homes by trimming trees, clearing brush and bagging up dead leaves. He said the Fire-Rescue Department’s code inspectors and the Park and Recreation Department’s weed management program can help residents meet the requirements.  “It’s not all on you. It’s a collective responsibility,” he said at the meeting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYW5kaWVnb3VuaW9udHJpYnVuZS5jb20vbmV3cy9wdWJsaWMtc2FmZXR5L3N0b3J5LzIwMjMtMDUtMjgvYS1jb2xsZWN0aXZlLXJlc3BvbnNpYmlsaXR5LXRpZXJyYXNhbnRhLXJlc2lkZW50cy1wYXJ0aWNpcGF0ZS1pbi1maXJlLXNhZmV0eS10b3duLWhhbGzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire, which started around 8 a.m. inside the Musgrave Market in the parish capital, Port Antonio, quickly spread throughout the market space, along West Street- destroying in its path dozens of stalls containing ground provision, craft items, items of clothing, footwear, electrical appliances, and a variety of meats.  Firefighters, who arrived on the scene in quick time, struggled to contain the raging inferno, which started to spread rapidly as wooden stalls, clothes, plastic containers, and footwear were quickly consumed, further fuelling the blaze.  Despite the efforts of two fire units from the Port Antonio fire station, an additional unit from Buff Bay, some 18 miles away, had to be called in to assist with fighting the fire as it threatened two nearby buildings – Kamals Supermarket and Cambio – and Portland Jewelers furniture and appliance store.

The Musgrave Market suffered more than 75 per cent in total, which is a massive loss.  “We now have to make a quick assessment on Monday to determine the extent of the damage caused by the fire, which, from all indication, is significant. In total, more than 100 people from the supermarket and the appliance store are now out of a job, and this will have serious implications as it relates to their employment. We have not yet recovered from COVID-19, and this disaster has, basically, crippled the livelihood of many who might not be able to provide for their family,” Thompson added.  The firefighting effort was hampered by a shortage of water due to a scheduled water lock-off by the National Water Commission as a result of drought conditions. Water was later restored to the Port Antonio area as the fire continued to rage.  The entirety of Kamals supermarket and its stock was reduced to ashes while hundreds of Portlanders stood by, watching in shock as one of their favourite shopping facilities was engulfed by flames despite the efforts from firefighters and other volunteers to contain the blaze.  Tremendous loss  It was the nearby Portland Jewelers furniture and appliance store that caught fire next as a result of the blaze from the nearby Musgrave Market, resulting in its part board and concrete structure becoming engulfed. That fire would spread quickly to Kamals, which is almost adjoining, with its part board and concrete structure burning like paper.  Although the operators of Portland Jewelers managed to salvage a few items, including stoves, sound-system boxes, fans, television sets, radios, and wooden furniture, the loss was tremendous as there are reports that a substantial amount of money had been left inside the store vault overnight by its owners.  More than 150 persons, comprising craft vendors, butchers, clothes and footwear higglers, book sellers, fruit vendors, ground provision higglers, food stall operators, fish vendors, and herbal stall operators have been affected directly or indirectly by the massive fire.  The day was not without incident as the police were forced to arrest at least four individuals for attempting to loot some of the salvaged items even though others managed to grab goods and flee, eluding the lawmen.  Among the looters was a man seen by The Gleaner making a hasty retreat along William Street, carrying a smart television set.  The origin of the fire is not yet known, but up to 4:30 p.m. yesterday, firefighter were still trying to contain the blaze in a massive storeroom area at Kamals, which is located to the back of that building. They were also sifting through the rubble inside the supermarket and on the inside of the Portland Jewelers furniture and appliance store.  In the meantime, firefighters have hinted that damage caused by the fire to the three properties – Kamals, the Musgrave Market, and Portland Jewelers - could run into billions of dollars.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xlYWQtc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzMDUyOS9tYXNzaXZlLXBvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtbGVhdmVzLWh1bmRyZWRzLWpvYmxlc3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The twin-engine Gates Learjet 36A plunged into the Pacific Ocean near San Clemente Island on May 10 while trying to make an emergency landing at a Navy airfield there, according to a preliminary investigative report from the National Transportation Safety Board.  RELATED  The wreckage of the plane was found underwater but the two pilots and additional crew member — all civilians — haven’t been found and are presumed dead, the report said.  The jet was one of two that took off from Point Mugu Naval Air Station in Oxnard and headed south towards San Clemente Island, which is owned by the Navy and is west of San Diego. They were going to take part in training exercises with the Navy.  Shortly after arriving at the exercise site, the crew in the first plane, which was leading, radioed that they smelled an odor in the cabin and the crew of the plane behind radioed that they saw white or gray smoke or gas coming from the left side of the cabin, along with some kind of liquid trailing the jet, according to the NTSB report.  “At this point the lead airplane was not maintaining heading or altitude,” the report said.  The crew of the second plane then saw flames coming from around the rear equipment door of the first aircraft and told the crew to declare an emergency.  The troubled plane planned to land at an auxiliary Navy airfield on San Clemente Island and the other jet maneuvered in front to lead it to the field, the report said.  However, contact was lost as the jets descended.  Broadcast data from the first airplane showed that it made a series of descending turns and was at an altitude of 1,338 feet (408 meters) and about a half-mile (less than a kilometer) from the island when the information stopped, according to the report.  The Learjet’s wreckage was located a mile (1.6 kilometers) offshore in about 300 feet (91 meters) of water, and some of the debris showed evidence of a fire before the crash, the report said.  The report didn’t mention a possible cause for the fire or the crash.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdnl0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzI4L25hdnktY29udHJhY3Rvci1qZXQtd2FzLW9uLWZpcmUtYmVmb3JlLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtY3Jhc2gtcmVwb3J0LXNheXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The first half was a back-and-forth affair, with the teams finishing almost even in shots and shots on goal. It looked as though Chicago would break the tie but it was Crown Legacy who scored first, when David Poreba found himself one-on-won with Gal and capitalized on the opportunity in the 40th minute.  Chicago found a way behind the Charlotte defense on several occasions, but the most dangerous came in the 26th and 38th minutes. First midfielder Harold Osorio sent a pass across the box for Luka Prpa, whose shot was saved and parried to the right. Omari Glasgow kept it in play, but his ball back across the goal ended up going out for a throw-in. Eight minutes later, Glasgow controlled a long ball that was sent up the left side and he carried it inside. Glasgow slipped a pass for Osorio, who passed it with one touch to the middle of the box but Michael Nesci’s shot was saved by Charlotte goalkeeper Isaac Walker.  It was Chicago goalkeeper Jeff Gall who was called to action early in the second half, making a point-blank save from one yard out in the 46th minute to keep the score the same.  Defender Andreas Ueland started his first match for Chicago Fire II but was shown a second yellow card in the 74th minute that left Chicago with one player less for the remaining 16 minutes of play. With the result, Chicago Fire II remains in 11th place in the Eastern Conference and returns to action with back-to-back road games.

Waterloo Fire Rescue responded at 4:30 p.m. to a fire at a single family home at 516 Rhey St. that left it uninhabitable, according to Battalion Chief Ben Petersen. His crew then reacted to another call at 5 p.m. for a garage fire at 215 French St.  Firefighters responded to the Rhey Street blaze fearing as many as three children were inside the house. The children were soon determined to be safe and away from the property before firefighters extinguished what turned out to be a kitchen fire in the back of the home, one that threatened the front side of the structure.  Petersen said the cause was determined to be ""unattended cooking.""  A woman, the sole occupant and owner, had been home when “serious” flames broke out, according to Petersen. She escaped through a window after neighbors got her attention upon seeing evidence of the fire.  The Red Cross was contacted to assist her. The home suffered significant damage, with smoke damage throughout, but it is not deemed a total loss.  A few blocks away on French Street, also in the eastern part of town, a detached garage was on fire with no people or vehicles inside it. The structure was 25 feet behind a home on the property, Petersen estimated, but the fire was put out before it had a chance to spread.

On the night of the fire, 50 fire departments and more than 550 firefighters were called to the scene.  “I think I can speak for the firefighters who were there when I say that May 28, 1977, was the worst day of our firefighting career but I believe it was our finest hour,” said Southgate Fire Department Chief John Beatsch.  David Brock and Wayne Dammert were two young employees at the supper club that night.  ”There’s smoke coming out around the corner. Ok, there is a fire. Get out of here. Everybody get out. Get out the back,” Dammert recalled.  The man credited with sounding the initial alarm of fire was Walter Bailey, a 17-year-old busboy at the time.  Restaurateur Jeff Ruby was also in Cabaret Room that night.  ”At least 500 people more would have died if Walter Bailey didn’t get up there and take the stage and make that announcement,” Ruby said.  There were 2300 customers and staff at the supper club and hundreds were injured.  The Fort Thomas Armory had to be utilized as a makeshift morgue for the 165 who died.  Doug Louderback lost four of his family members in the fire.  “The four here...Fredricka Hehr Fryman...Marty Scott Fryman...he was the youngest one killed that night,” Louderback remembers.  ”We’re still talking about that night, how bad it was, but it’s been a long fight and this is awesome,” he said.  The fight for a permanent memorial began nearly 20 years ago.  ”I knew it would happen eventually,” said Brock. “It just had to be the right people. It had to be the right people.”  Dana Stallings lost eight family members in the fire.  ”It’s beautiful,” she said. “From here on out, it’s going to be wonderful. Sweet. It’s going to be wonderful every time I come back here.”  The City of Southgate will maintain the memorial site as part of its parks division.  “I pray that this memorial with give the family, friends and co-workers peace and a place to come and remember those who we lost 46 years ago today,” said Southgate Mayor Jim Hamberg.

The Gila Las Cruces Zone Type 3 Team, led by Incident Commander Pete Valenzuela assumed command yesterday.  The low to moderate intensity of the Pass Fire allows firefighters time to get out ahead to assess values at risk and prepare holding features and protection before the fire’s arrival. Yesterday, a helispot at Black Mountain was cleared of encroaching vegetation and the Black Mountain Lookout’s cabin was wrapped.  “We’re seeing some really good fire effects, consuming dead grass and pine litter, with heavy dead and down fuels burning down to ash,” said Valenzuela. “Crews are doing a great job of keeping pace with the interior advance of the fire, burning out small pockets of vegetation between the fire and prepared containment features. A variety of tactics will be used to confine and contain the Pass Fire commensurate with firefighter safety, probability of success, and values at risk.”  Weather over the fire area will be mostly sunny today, with highs from 69 to 84, depending on elevation. Relative humidity will drop to 8 – 11%. The fire currently has 115 people responding, including one Bureau of Land Management and two Gila National Forest fire engines, the Gila Regulars and Rio Puerco BLM hand crews, and one Type 3 helicopter in addition to incident command staff. Additional resources have been ordered and the size of the organization is expected to increase in the coming days.  Values at risk include small private land parcels, range fences, water pipelines and stock tanks, powerlines, recreation sites, roads, a research site, historic features, sensitive wildlife habitats, wetlands, and watershed resources. They will be protected as appropriate if fire reaches pre-identified management action points.  The Pass Fire is located south of New Mexico Highway 59, about 1 mile west of Wolf Hollow Campground, and along the northern Gila Wilderness boundary. Camping is not recommended at Wolf Hollow due to the likelihood of fire reaching the area and heavy localized firefighter activity. Please use caution when entering or passing through the area, as heavy firefighter traffic and activity may exist along area roads. Air inversions are likely to cause low-lying smoke to settle into valleys overnight that may obscure visibility for travel. Smoke-sensitive individuals should follow recommendations at NM Fire Info | Smoke Management.

"fire","2023-04-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-29T03:37:37","The Minnesota fire weather season is currently in full swing, with over four hundred fires so far this year.  “We had so much snow over the winter, we had a pretty late start to our fire season. But then with a couple of really warm days, that snow disappeared in about a three day stretch. So it was a later start than usual, but it was fast and furious when it did start,” said Minnesota DNR Division of Forestry Fire Prevention Supervisor Allissa Reynolds. “We typically see anywhere from 1000 to 2000 fires in Minnesota each spring. It’s more than a lot of people recognize. It is kind of a busy season for us.”  Red flag warnings were issued this weekend as a dry weather pattern, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds increased risk.  Both the Minnesota DNR and the Wisconsin DNR websites update statewide fire danger daily, with ratings based on how easily a fire could start and how quickly it could spread.  “It’s just an indication of the fire weather, which is a combination of relative humidity, temperature and wind speed typically are the three driving factors and then the condition of the fuels,” explained Reynolds. “So how green they are, if it’s fully progressed into the growing season or if it’s still earlier in the spring or even late in the fall, some of those drier fuels really come into play with those that fire danger rating that we’re seeing. And then the burning restrictions is kind of a translation to our burning permit system and whether or not we allow public folks to conduct burning on their property, whether that’s a pile of yard waste or farmers burning their field or even prescribed fire, contractors conducting burns in the grasslands or forest lands across the state.”  Although much of Minnesota has a restriction on open burning, campfires are still allowed.  “Campfires should be small, less than three feet by three feet, and if you do have one of those, make sure it’s absolutely out cold,” said Reynolds. “A lot of times, those campfires or larger fires especially hold heat for a number of days. And so if you go to bed one night thinking it’s all out and then the winds pick up or it dries out the next day, that’s when that fire can kick back up and get out of control. That’s what we see year after year as the number one cause of wildfires.”  Although weather and soil conditions make fires start and spread more easily, most are preventable.  “Over 90% of fires in Minnesota are from humans. We have very few lightning starts. So of those 90, 90 plus percent, it’s campfires, what we call debris or yard waste fires, people burning logs, sticks, leaves, things like that. That’s what gets away and that’s what causes most of our wildfires,” said Reynolds. “The biggest thing is to be cautious around fire. If you have any kind of fire, absolutely. Make sure it’s out cold before you leave, and if you do see any kind of spread or wildfire occurring, make sure you call 911 right away. Get to a safe place. Don’t try and suppress it yourself. We have trained professionals with the right equipment.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkaW8uY29tL3dlYXRoZXItbmV3cy9maXJlLXdlYXRoZXItY29uZGl0aW9ucy1leHBlY3RlZC10by1jb250aW51ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. — An outdoor storage area at Ward's Nursery caught fire on Friday and damaged the exterior of an apartment house less than a dozen feet away on Silver Street.  The cause of the fire is unknown and the State Fire Marshal's office is working the investigation with local police and fire. There were no injuries.  The fire was reported at about 12:52 p.m. and firefighters on Engine 2 could see heavy black smoke while en route to the Main Street business and found a large outdoor fire in the rear of the nursery complex that was extending to an adjacent wood staircase to a second-floor apartment of a stucco multifamily building off Silver Street. The apartment wasn't occupied at the time.  A second alarm was called and Engine 2 quickly stretched a hose line rapidly knocking down the fire on the building and then worked to control the outdoor fire. Engine 5's crew deployed a second line and immediately went to check for extension and verify the apartments were empty. The fire was completely under control in approximately 15 minutes.  A ladder truck also responded and firefighters were assisted at the by scene police and the Fire District, the Fire Department Support Group and the Egremont and Monterey Fire Departments.

ARLINGTON — An early morning fire caused “extensive damage” Sunday at an Arlington restaurant that’s received death threats amid controversies over the city’s Pride event, according to police.  Around 6 a.m., North County Regional Fire Authority firefighters responded to the fire at ReMyx’d, located at 17216 Smokey Point Drive, according to authorities.  “Please avoid the area and allow crews room to operate,” the firefighters union wrote on social media.  There were no injuries, Arlington police Lt. Peter Barrett said.  Arlington police assisted firefighters. Detectives remained on scene to help fire marshals determine the cause of the fire, according to police.  Early reports indicated the fire started inside the fully-secured restaurant, Barrett said. He added it likely started in the back of the restaurant, near the electrical boxes. There was no sign of forced entry.  There was no estimate Sunday for damages to the building.  Fire officials could not be reached for further information Sunday morning.  Photos shared to social media showed plumes of smoke and heavy damage to the roof of the restaurant and bar.  ReMyx’d has been ensnared in hatred after an all-ages Mother’s Day drag event made its way into alt-right media across the country.  Reached by phone Sunday, owner Brenton Holland said he’d “never had so many death threats in my life.”  “It’s not a good time to be gay,” he said.  Police encouraged anyone with information on the fire to call 360-403-3400.  “As a police department, we’ll look into all possible leads,” Barrett said. “But right now, there’s no indication, at this point, that would lead to believe there’s a correlation” between the fire and the death threats.

Although the winds were light that July day, the temperature was in the low 90s and it hadn’t rained in weeks. Balls of flame were crowning in the treetops, jumping from tree to tree driven by winds the fire was creating on its own. Firefighters estimate the temperature on the forest floor was close to 2,000 degrees.  It wasn’t the worst Montana wildfire during the summer of 2021, but for those who lived through it the Harris Mountain Fire was devastating. In the two weeks it took to bring it under control the Harris Mountain Fire burned close to 32,000 acres of private, state and federal timberland, much of it prime wildlife habitat, home to herds of Rocky Mountain elk, Mule deer, black bear and mountain lion.  One of the private property owners most deeply impacted by the Harris Mountain Fire is Don Harland. Within two days after the fire started on July 23, Harland and his family lost 12 structures on their Sheep Creek Ranch, including the family lodge and hunting camp. In addition, most of the nearly 4,600 acres of timberland Harland owns was critically damaged.  “This area we’re looking at right now was just black,” Harland said taking in the view from a promontory overlooking the Sheep Creek drainage basin. Everything was washing down into the creeks. It was a disaster.”  “I guess when you own land like this you find that you’re in love with it,” Harland said of his grief at the loss of his forest. “You’re the steward of this land. You want to take care of it just like you would your children or your family, and you want to leave it better than when you found it or at least as good.”  The landscape Harland was referring to looked verdant in new spring growth. Its valleys and hillsides are covered in a lush carpet of green grass, with eye-popping displays of wildflowers seemingly around ever corner. Mother Nature had already replaced much of the ground cover on the mountain slopes; yet the landscape was haunted by an expanse of blackened trees stretching as far as the eye can see.  A hotter, drier world  Wildfire is, of course, a natural part of the life of a forest. Low intensity fires are actually beneficial to a forest, clearing away dead and congested undergrowth, releasing nitrogen into the soil, and opening up areas to new growth and regeneration. However, when a fire burns at too great an intensity it damages the soil, destroying seed stocks, micro-organisms and nutrients needed by trees to begin the natural reforestation process. This is what happened on the Sheep Creek Ranch.  “When you take a step back in time and you look at the role fire played historically … we’re looking at an 80-year regrowth cycle,"" said Zach Bashoor, a forest resource manager and founder of Montana Forest Consultants Inc. “That’s in a perfect world. Now we are seeing hotter and drier summer seasons with fires that burn at a much higher intensity. there’s no guarantee that the forests will return at all. We’re watching forests burn and become grassland and brushland, with no reforestation happening at all.""  Bashoor was one of the first people Harland contacted as he set about seeing what he could do to restore his land. Harland and Bashoor had collaborated in the past developing a plan for the sustainable harvest of timber from the Sheep Creek Ranch.  He represents a new generation of foresters taking a more intensive approach to forest management that includes developing new techniques in response to the increased frequency of devastating forest fires. Those techniques include a deep analysis of terrain, soil, vegetation, climate, and wildlife down to individual sections of land.  “We’ve got a very deep and intimate connection with Montana ecosystems,” he explained of his consulting services. “We can provide input on what trees are supposed to be and where, taking the landowners objectives into account with our prescriptions. That way we know what’s going out here is going to stand the best chance of surviving.”  The general concept is that as the forests of the western United States are exposed hotter, longer, and more destructive wildland fire seasons they need to be managed more intensely. The goal is to use every tool available through the ever-expanding understanding of biological processes to develop forests that regenerate faster and are less susceptible to catastrophic fire.  New innovations in forestry  Bashoor referred Harland to MAST Reforestation, a company Bashoor had not worked with before but was developing a reputation for using drones, nurseries, and carbon offsets to revitalize land after wildfires, often at minimal cost to the property owner.  Up until that time MAST Reforestation was primarily dedicated to reforestation projects in California and Washington state, but was eager to expand its operations into Montana. After developing a working relationship with Bashoor and Harland, MAST, which draws its name from the botanical term for the fruits of forest trees and shrubs, accepted Sheep Creek Ranch reforestation project as its pilot project in the state.  ""We’re a technology forward company managed by foresters, which is unique … all in support in helping landowners recover as quickly as possible,"" Arnoud de Villegas, Vice-president of Development for MAST Reforestation, said. ""The innovation we bring is in seed sourcing and processing, and then in developing new stock types and growing shorter rotation seedlings much faster to get that reforestation back in the ground as quickly as possible.”  “There really wasn’t anything for us until we met with MAST,” Harland said of his reforestation prospects immediately following the Harris Mountain Fire. “We’re the pilot project for them and it’s scary as hell. There’s a lot at risk for us and MAST, but it’s coming together. My dream burnt up, but we just keep moving forward and doing the best that we can.”  “The process began with an extensive mapping project,” explained de Villegas. “With that we were able to develop a sophisticated reforestation plan that took into consideration slope, aspect, soils, the availability of native seeded.”  No seeds, no trees  The collection, use and development of native seedstock is a critical component of MAST Reforestation projects. The company works to use seed genetically adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the forest they’re working on, preferably collected within no more than a few thousand feet of where the project is to take place.  However, when MAST foresters looked for suitable seedstock for the Sheep Creek Ranch project they found that there wasn’t any. It’s a growing problem across the western United States, where native forest seedstocks are at their lowest levels in decades. Much of that is attributable the sheer scale of wildland fire in the U.S. in recent years, and to a forest seed collection process that has seen little investment over that same period.  “In the last decade alone, we’ve lost 17.1 million acres to catastrophic wildfire in the western United States,” de Villegas noted. “Montana is the third most impacted state behind California and Oregon. A million-and-a-half acres in Montana has been lost to catastrophic fire. We presently as an industry; including states, the fed and private companies across the western United States only have the capability to replant perhaps half of that reforestation debt.”  “Before you get to seedlings though, you need seed,” he added. “Investments into seed collection, which historically have had a very low return on capital, have been woefully inadequate, and really the only insurance against catastrophic fire is seed. Without seed that is adapted for these landscapes we can’t reforest.”  The solution was for MAST to launch a historic cone collection program in the Big Belt Mountains in 2022, organized in partnership with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and the Bureau of Land Management.  “It was really the first of its kind in the western United States,” de Villegas said. “We collected Douglas fir cones not too far to the west from here with seed that’s adapted to this site, giving us the ability to plant seedlings from seed sources that are within 1,000 feet of the original source. The seedlings that we put back in the ground are sourced from seed that are climate adapted to the site. We were also able to increase seed supply quite substantially for the State of Montana, which we are very proud of.”  “We collected cones, extracted the seed at our factory which is the largest of its kind in the United States at Silvaseed in Washington,"" he continued. ""We tested that seed for germination, we sowed that seed at our nursery last summer and are planting it inside of a year of that seed collected and sown at the nursery.""  No escaping hard labor  The hard physical labor of replanting Don Harland’s forest began several weeks ago. High up on the ridge lines that slip down toward Sheep Creek substantial acreages of burned trees have been fallen, and now lie in a purposeful, organized pattern perpendicular to the slope of the hillsides, providing improved erosion control and preventing sediment from washing down the steep slopes that feed Sheep Creek.  “We had a couple timber crews come out and methodically fall many of these burned trees in certain patterns,” Bashoor explained. “As these trees decompose it allows nutrient recycling, putting more organic matter into these hillsides that right now is lacking. It also discourages elk and deer from coming through and browsing on the newly planted trees. We also methodically left ridge lines and draws with standing timber to allow travel corridors for elk and deer.”  When site prep is done successfully and with quality reforestation stock the forest regeneration cycle can be shortened by as much as 60 years compared with the natural forest regeneration process.  Planting across the project site began a week ago and is already completed an application of roughly 70,000 Lodgepole pine seedlings. While MAST has developed a capacity to use drones to broadcast evergreen seed across wide areas as soon as five days after a fire has been extinguished, the work on the steep slopes overlooking Sheep Creek comes down to methods developed by foresters more than 80 years ago.  The seedlings are delivered to staging areas along old logging roads where hand crews fill canvas hip-bags with 300 seedlings at a time. Carrying a large pick-like tool called a ""hoedown,"" the planters work their way up and down the steep slopes, returning to the staging area to collect another 300 seedlings whenever their hip-bag runs empty.  The slopes they climb planting trees frequently include elevation gains of over 1,000 feet and require the planters to climb around and over fallen logs. They can make as many as six trips up and down the slopes in a single shift. During a shortened shift last Thursday, the planting crew of roughly 20 men planted approximately 18,000 seedlings.  “It is very arduous work,” de Villegas said of the tree planting process. “I’ve been told that the caloric output the planters expend is roughly equivalent to running two marathons. It’s amazing.”  Looking toward the future  The tree planting taking place this week at the Sheep Creek Ranch is the second phase of the three-year project MAST launched in 2022. The MAST team expects to complete the current planting of 200,000 Lodgepole pine seedlings over the next few weeks, then return next year for the second phase of planting, which will then exceed one million plantings of Lodgepole pine with Douglas fir and Ponderosa pine added to the mix.  MAST Reforestation’s and Montana Consultant’s commitment to the property will; however, extend many years into the future. Representatives of both firms spoke of periodically returning to the forest in the coming decades to ensure its management objectives are being met.  “We were able to secure work in us being able to do this, but its much bigger than that,” Bashoor said of his firm’s commitment to the project. “The payoff for us is getting to see this place reforested and hopefully being able to bring my grandkids our here on day and seeing a forest that we played an integral part in restoring.”  The life of the forest extends far beyond the years counted in a human lifetime. Don Harland will never see his forest return entirely to what it was before the Harris Mountain Fire, but he takes great pride in fact that future generations will reap the benefits of what’s being done today.  “We are a main natural corridor between Yellowstone, the Beartooth Mountains and Glacier National Park,” he noted of his forest place within the larger ecosystem. “Everything off to the sides of us has been developed with little ranchettes and stuff like that, but we’ve got a clear corridor going through here. You have elk, deer, bear, moose going through here.”  “When we’re done here, the property will go into a conservation easement that will keep that corridor in perpetuity,” he announced. “It will never get subdivided. It will stay there not just for our kids, but for the public and all the wildlife.”  “I’m almost 70,” he admitted. “I’m not going to see the trees get much more than probably 10-feet tall in my lifetime, but my kids are going to end up with it, and hopefully my grandkids and great grandkids. I hope we’re building something here for them that will bring it back to its glory.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVhdGZhbGxzdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIzLzA1LzI4L21vbnRhbmEtZm9yZXN0LWRldmFzdGF0ZWQtYnktZmlyZS1icm91Z2h0LWJhY2stdG8tbGlmZS83MDI2MjAxODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Jeff Olinger said.  No one was home at the time, with no injuries reported, but he did say two cats and a rabbit were missing and it was believed they may have gotten out or were hiding. Firefighters found a large cage in the living room with four dogs inside and took the cage and dogs outside. A cat was also found and rescued from the basement.  Firefighters were called at 12:11 p.m. to the two-story structure at 1095 E. Third St., finding the front and back doors both open upon arrival and heavy black smoke in the kitchen. The fire was knocked down and the upstairs was checked to see if there was any extension of fire, with thick smoke throughout.  According to the fire department report, firefighters had to open up the ceiling in the kitchen and living room to find hidden hot spots because there were a few void areas in the kitchen. Areas were foamed and checked with the thermal imaging camera.  Green Township and Damascus fire departments had been called for mutual aid, but were canceled. Perry Township Fire Department also responded and remained on the scene to help with overhaul. Ohio Edison and Columbia Gas were notified.  When checking to make sure everything was out, firefighters noted finding a perfect “V” pattern in the kitchen and it appeared two stove top knobs were in the on position and the oven appeared to be on also. The tenant advised he wasn’t cooking at all and he questioned if his cat was playing with the knobs to the stove. Firefighters also noted finding what appeared to be smoke detectors hanging open with their batteries removed.  Damages were estimated at $15,000 for the residence and $15,000 for the contents. The home was insured. Olinger identified the tenants as Amy Tingle and Jeff Seidner, with Melissa Stell as the listed owner.

The entire state is under high to extreme fire danger due to dry and warm conditions, and a red flag warning was in effect all day Sunday for dozens of counties.  ""If an ember gets lofted into dry grass, what's the probability that ember will start a fire? Right now today it's 100%. That will happen and it will spread quickly,"" said Allissa Reynolds, the DNR's wildfire prevention supervisor.  Reynolds says things like dragging trailer chains, grills, fireworks and campfires are particularly risky this weekend.

So if you can avoid it at all, please do. It's just a bad idea,"" she said.  Each year, more than 50 wildfires are started in Minnesota from campfires that are not completely extinguished, too large, or unattended.  ""Once you leave, make sure you actually douse the fire with water, stir it around with a shovel and then get down and actually feel it with the back of your hand to make sure there's no heat remaining in those coals,"" she said.  People cause 90% of Minnesota fires. So this summer, make sure you're not one of them.

The blaze broke out late Thursday afternoon at the Monastère du Bon-Pasteur, a 19th century former monastery, and quickly became a five-alarm fire requiring the intervention of 150 firefighters.  It proved difficult to tame because of the construction and materials used in the building. Authorities believe the fire began in the attic but had difficulty reaching the source.  Émilie Barbeau-Charlebois, section chief at the Montreal fire department, said Saturday both the cause of the fire and an estimate of damages remained unknown.  ""It was about 42 hours total of intervention by firefighters who worked non-stop,"" Barbeau-Charlebois said.  An investigation into the cause of the fire is set to begin on Monday.  As of Saturday, 59 people were being taken care of by the Red Cross, Barbeau-Charlebois said. No one was injured in the blaze.  About 20 firefighters were still on site Saturday to ensure a new fire doesn't start in the debris, and authorities inspected the building before allowing residents to enter.  Accompanied by police or firefighters, they were led inside in small groups to briefly collect their personal belongings like medication or important documents.  Wearing the same clothes on his back since the fire broke out, Patrice Masse was one of the people who came to gather his belongings.  Now staying with his sister, he lived in the building for the past two years. When he was evacuated Thursday afternoon, he didn't get the chance to take his cat, whom he was reunited with the following day.  ""It was very pleasant to live there because there's a lot of mutual support,"" he said of the housing co-operative he called home.  Masse said what concerns him most is finding a new place to live.

Bilodeau said the housing co-op is working with its provincial co-op federation to find new apartments for those displaced.

Free Fire is often considered to be one of the ‘Founding Fathers’ of the battle royale genre. It launched not too long after PUBG was released in 2017, and it went on to set and smash records in the years that followed. By contrast, Call of Duty’s battle royale platform – Warzone – was released in 2020, and while it enjoyed a strong start, it started to die out relatively fast. In this article, we’re breaking down the comparison of Call of Duty vs Free Fire, figuring out which game is ultimately the better one.  It’s a difficult discussion to have, though. For instance, Free Fire is a mobile-only game, but Warzone doesn’t yet (at the time of publishing) have a mobile variant. Furthermore, Free Fire – despite being a global game – is massively popular in Asia and South-East Asia, while Warzone is much more popular in the Western areas of the world.  But with those facts aside, we’re still going to eagerly debate the Call of Duty vs Free Fire discussion, to see which game is best.  Free Fire Breaks Records  By 2023, ‘Garena’ Free Fire had held the record for the most popular esports tournament in history for more than two years. In May 2021, the Free Fire World Series, which was held in Singapore, pulled in a peak concurrent viewer count of 5,415,990. It was a staggering figure and since then, only League of Legends has come close to topping it, at one time pulling in a peak count of 5,147,701, according to escharts.com.  Since then, Free Fire’s figures have dropped considerably, with the 2022 World Series pulling in a peak of 1,477,000 viewers.  By comparison, the most popular Call of Duty Warzone tournament – a 2021 Twitch Rivals event – topped out at 441,145 viewers. Since then, there has been a decline in viewership as the Warzone esports scene has failed to maintain itself too effectively.  Once upon a time, Warzone almost died, and since then, it has mostly failed to get back on track.  Read More: Best Call of Duty Tournaments in 2023  Warzone Breaks Players  It’s not fair to bring the multiplayer platforms for Call of Duty into this debate of Call of Duty vs Free Fire. That’s why we’re focusing on the battle royale offering – as that’s all Free Fire really has to offer. In 2020, Warzone debuted to an overwhelmingly popular reception, but within two years, all that success had been undone by too many issues in the game. From stability problems to cheaters and from controversial decisions from Activision to content creators leaving the game, there was plenty of bad press to deal with.  In November 2022, Warzone 2.0 was released, introducing an all-new map, experience, and platform to players around the world. By comparison, Free Fire has always remained the same, and it hasn’t really changed at all in the last six years.  It’s tough to figure out how many people are playing Free Fire, unfortunately.  As of July 2021, Free Fire had seen more than 1 billion downloads in the Google Play Store alone. It was claimed in 2019 that the game boasted more than 50 million active daily players. It’s tough to get a solid figure on that, but it’s widely expected that the number hasn’t changed too much by today.  At the time of writing, and using Steam as a representative example, Call of Duty Warzone boasts a 24-hour peak player count of just 90,000 users. Of course, Free Fire is mobile-exclusive, and Warzone is more popular on console platforms, so it’s really tough to lock down exact figures.  And The Experience  So, it’s subjective, but where does it all land in the age-old debate of Call of Duty vs Free Fire?  If we look at the esports figures, we can see that Free Fire is much more valuable. If we take a look at the player numbers, then again, we can see that Free Fire is more popular. It can be argued that Warzone offers a better experience overall, as it’s not being played out on a mobile device, but that again is a subjective claim. There are plenty of people that love playing games on their mobile devices, and it’s why Call of Duty Mobile has racked up hundreds of millions of downloads.  Soon, Call of Duty Warzone Mobile will be released, and then we’ll be able to make a much more interesting comparison between Call of Duty and Free Fire. It’s always difficult comparing two games when they’re so different, and that’s the case here. For instance, Warzone is a 100% first-person shooter game, while Free Fire is almost entirely played from a third-person perspective. It’s things like this that make all the difference when it comes to comparison.  What do you think? Is Free Fire better than Call of Duty, or is Warzone still loaded with potential and may one day become king of all battle royale games?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG9ydHMubmV0L25ld3MvY29kL2NhbGwtb2YtZHV0eS12cy1mcmVlLWZpcmUv0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwb3J0cy5uZXQvbmV3cy9jb2QvY2FsbC1vZi1kdXR5LXZzLWZyZWUtZmlyZS8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The group approved moving forward with a consultant to determine the feasibility of a merger of the town's fire and emergency services divisions. Photo by Leslee Bassman.  On May 18, Lee and Stockbridge working group members unanimously voted to hire JB Consulting Group to assemble a preliminary plan that would kickstart a possible merger of their fire and emergency services divisions.  Lee and Stockbridge — Following the joint meeting of their towns’ Select Boards in early March, Lee and Stockbridge working group members unanimously voted on May 18 to hire JB Consulting Group to assemble a preliminary plan that would kickstart a possible merger of their fire and emergency services divisions.  The consulting group is led by retired Hanover Fire Chief JB Blanchard, and the plan would include three phases of data collection for a total cost of around $30,000.  The first step in the process is estimated to cost $3,000 and would map the existing emergency response routes for individual departments, including those miles covered by current stations and staffing. The remaining phases would focus on predictive modeling, including analyzing response time and data should a station be eliminated or added in a certain location.  The working group is represented by individuals from both towns, including fire chiefs, town administrators, fire department volunteers, residents, and a member of the state’s Emergency Management Agency. It was formed to determine if a merger of departments is feasible.  Lee is creating a concept for a public safety administration building that would house its fire and police departments. The fire station in Lee was built in 1911—a sound building but not suitable for today’s larger fire trucks, Town Administrator Christopher Brittain said. The building next to the station is in disrepair and the police department is currently located in a cramped town hall, he said.  The proposal includes Stockbridge contributing to the cost of the new building and the two towns sharing fire and emergency management services in a regional agreement, a measure that would avoid duplicating those services. “Putting our resources together, we’ve got to decide if it’s better for each party and good for all,” Lee Fire Chief Ryan Brown said.  Brittain said that, originally, a downtown central fire station was contemplated. After considering response times, the space needed for the facility, and floodplain issues, however, the focus shifted to the Route 102 corridor, he said.  Brittain said he subsequently discussed the matter with Stockbridge Administrator Michael Canales at a town manager’s meeting, and the idea of a joint fire and emergency services system came up. Officials from both towns voiced concern over an aging population that may deplete the volunteer component of their divisions, and the alternative of a fully paid, professional staff would be an expensive crew. The group discussed the area’s lack of affordable housing as well as firefighter training as issues that may serve as deterrents to attracting new department members. Also, by combining forces, additional state funding may be available as a resource.  “I think one of the things we’ve concluded on is we need some professional help here to give us the data, to make us all understand what our options are, and then see if this is best,” Canales said. “And then, how do we approach it? Is it a phased-in approach over time?”  Blanchard will be asked to attend the next meeting, with that meeting date set on his availability. “If we commit to this, we need to take our time and do it right because there are a lot of people watching, not county-wide, statewide,” Brown said. “People have heard about this [merger], and they’re watching for a potential model that can help them out.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmVya3NoaXJlZWRnZS5jb20vam9pbnQtbGVlLWFuZC1zdG9ja2JyaWRnZS1maXJlLWFuZC1lbXMtd29ya2luZy1ncm91cC11bmRlcndheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WGGB/WSHM) - Fire crews responded to a large fire on Exposition Avenue in West Springfield Saturday morning.  Western Mass News spoke with neighbors who said the scene was surreal. But the nine people displaced were offered support from the American Red Cross to get back on their feet.  Dan Williams was woken up early Saturday morning by what he described as a soft explosion.  “So, I got up and I opened my shades and the place was ablaze,” said Williams.  The apartments right across the street from him on Exposition Avenue in West Springfield were engulfed in flames.  “The flames were leaping about 30ft. above the building, it was spreading extremely fast, I mean it started at one end and within 15 minutes it engulfed the whole roof, and you can see it going down into the apartments,” explained Williams.  According to Lt. Tony Spear of the West Springfield Fire Department, they received the first call around 3:20 a.m. where nine people were displaced. Thankfully, no injuries were reported.  Now, eight units were impacted by the blaze and the building is uninhabitable.  “I feel so sorry for the people in those apartments I don’t know what they’re going to do,” said Williams.  This is where the American Red Cross steps in, fire response supervisor Dorothy Cichonski told Western Mass News they found hotel rooms for those needing them, and finances to help replace items lost in the fire.  “These folks obviously had a really bad morning everything is pretty much destroyed,” said Cichonski. “Our recovery team will be following them going forward for the next several months if they need to have help with replacing items and doing things like that.”  The cause of the fire is under investigation.

In the north of the country alone, 53 fires had to be put out on Saturday. The coastal area saw 32 fires, the greater Jerusalem area 28, the south 24, the central region 22, while the West Bank suffered 14 blazes throughout the day.  Near Acre, traffic was diverted from the Acre East intersection due to thick smoke from a nearby bushfire, according to an Israel Police spokesperson. The fire was later brought under control.  The Fire and Rescue Services listed five major outbreaks of fires around the country throughout the morning.  In the north, a grass fire spread toward Mount Turan and a nearby kibbutz. Eight planes from the Elad firefighting squadron arrived on the scene to contain the fire alongside four ground teams that protected the line of houses.  Firefighters said the fire was under control, some four and half hours after initial reports of its spread.

Four teams from the Nof HaGalil fire station worked to contain the fire.  A large fire threatened Kibbutz Karmiya  In the South, in Kibbutz Karmiya near the Gaza Strip, six teams accompanied by four planes worked to put out a large grass fire that spread towards the Kibbutz's greenhouses. Citizens and hikers who were in the Karmiya grove were evacuated from the scene with the help of the Israel Police. The forces worked in cooperation with KKL firefighting teams and with the help of heavy engineering by the army. In the evening, the fire was brought under control.  ""This is a very large fire in which we operate with a large force and with the help of other forces,"" the Fire and Rescue Service's team chief at the scene described the situation. ""There is also a spotting helicopter of the Israel Police at the scene and at this point, I am doing a situational assessment from the air to get a clearer picture of the situation. Happily, up to this stage, there have been no casualties and we were able to evacuate all the citizens from the area with the assistance of the Israel Police.""  Towards evening, Fire and Rescue Services announced the preliminary results of an investigation into the causes of the fire. According to the statement, a group of about 100 people had gathered in a field for a game of airsoft and then lit two fires in an open and grassy area in order to barbecue. These fires then got out of control and caused the larger fire.  Three of the group were detained for questioning under suspicion of arson and violating an order not to light a fire in the area. Two cars belonging to members of the group were burned completely.  A fire rages near Kibbutz Kfar Etzion, May 27, 2023 (Israel Fire and Rescue Service).

""Firefighters from the Yehuda regional station a while ago worked on a fire in the grove of the ""Mukhtar's saddle"" near Kibbutz Kfar Etzion,"" Tamir Erez, commander of the Israel Fire and Rescue service's Yehuda Regional Station said.  ""The Yehuda regional station was reinforced today with additional teams following the decision of the Israel Fire and Rescue Commissioner to raise the alert level and reinforce the stations. Upon receiving the message, many teams went to the scene and from afar noticed heavy smoke, and the fact that the fire was in an inaccessible area. Due to the terrain conditions, and the spread of the fire with the help of the strong winds, a pair of firefighting planes from the 'Elad' squadron were launched which assisted in the efforts to extinguish the fire.""  In the country's center, in the village of Tzur Moshe near Netanya, a grass fire spread towards the first row of houses in the village, the residents were evacuated from their homes as a result. Four planes were launched to the scene and helped stop the spread of the fire in coordination with the ground crews. The Fire and Rescue department reported that as of 1 p.m., there was no perceived danger to the nearby homes.  By the beach, a grass fire spread in the village of Mazraa.

Grilling  1) The grill should be placed well away from the home, deck, railings and out from under the eaves and overhanging branches.  2) Keep children and pets at least 3 feet from the grilling area.  3) Keep your grill clean by removing grease or fat buildup from the grill and in trays.  Never leave your grill unattended.  Camping  1) Use designated fire rings in National Forests and state properties. If no fire ring is available, scrape the ground down to mineral soil or build fire in an area with no grass or brush.  2) Always have a bucket and shovel available to assist in fire extinguishment.  3) Extinguish fire before leaving it unattended or going to sleep. Be sure the fire is out and cold to the touch.  Boating  1) Ensure that each person on the vessel has a properly fitting personal floatation device.  2) Bring a friend. Paddling in groups is safer than paddling alone. Plus it’s more fun to enjoy your time on the water with friends.  3) If you do head out alone, make sure someone knows where you are going and when you are expected to return.  4) Dress appropriately. It may be warm outside, but our lakes and rivers are still cold and many are running higher and faster than normal. The current water temperature of Lake Coeur d'Alene is 59 degrees.  Don’t drink and drive  Memorial Day begins summer's 100 Deadliest Days, when motor vehicle collisions increase dramatically. If you drink alcohol, do it responsibly and ensure that you have a designated driver to get you home safely.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2RhcHJlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjcvY2RhLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1iZS1zYWZlLXdlZWtlbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But an early Friday morning fire halted all of that — at least temporarily.  “It’s a sad day because we have been getting community support,” Acob said Friday morning as he surveyed the fire at his business, 70 Lono Avenue Takeout and Catering.  The site was previously the home of Dairy Queen, with its red roof and white walls, before it became Treats and Sweets and later Plantation Grindz.  Acob’s business, which he said people started to call “Rey’s Place,” primarily served a blend of Filipino and Mexican cuisines and was gaining a following.  But around 1:15 a.m. Friday, a fire broke out.  Crews arrived on the scene to find the structure more than 70 percent involved and worked to knock down and control the fire, fire officials said Friday afternoon.  The cause of the fire is under investigation. Estimated damages are $232,000 to the structure and $175,000 to the contents. There was also $33,000 in damages to a vehicle.  The fire was brought under control at 2:32 a.m. and extinguished at 4:06 a.m.  Engine, rescue and hazmat crews from Kahului responded to the blaze along with an engine from Wailuku.  On Friday morning, nearby roadways were still filled with water from crews who fought the blaze, and a smoky smell still lingered in the air. A white pickup truck near the building was also charred.  Acob said he was asleep when he got the call about the fire.  “Just shock at first, but I know things happen beyond our control,” Acob said. “We thank God nobody was hurt. Material things can be replaced.”  Nearby residents described hearing what they though were firecrackers and some gathered outside the Waterfront Apartments at Kahului across the street to see the blaze in the early morning hours.  Acob said due to the longtime outreach he has done with the area’s homeless community, he did not believe the fire was caused by one of the people living on the streets.  “It’s unfortunate people have been saying the homeless. I don’t think so. I tried to help everyone. I’ve been trying to pump up the community,” he said.  Acob said he spread the word among homeless people that he would give them food and has been doing so since he opened.  Acob added that a condition of acquiring the lease for the property was cleaning it up. He said he and his family had worked on the building and property for eight months.  At his restaurant, one of his favorite offerings was “smash tacos,” which he developed. They also served local-style breakfasts and lau lau.  On Facebook at the beginning of May, he posted photos of “Mama Nells Signature” halo halo and also shared photos of lumpia at his restaurant.  Hours after the fire, Acob had a positive outlook and already had some future plans in mind.  “We’ll bounce back,” he said. “I already have some ideas.”  He said those ideas include clearing the gutted building and reopening soon with food trucks.  Cashier Pauline Piso was scheduled to work Friday morning. Instead, she stood across the street and watched Fire Department investigators inspect the ruined building and burned-out car where the blaze likely started.  “We’ll get back,” Piso said. “We’ll get back on our feet.”  * Matthew Thayer can be reached at thayer@maui.net.

(WIFR) - A vacant Church School building in Rockford catches fire in a classroom, but first responders are calling it arson.  The Rockford Fire Department got a call around 5:30 p.m. Saturday about smoke coming from a second floor window at the abandoned Church School building located at 1419 Blaisdell Street.  First responders discovered a small fire in a classroom on the second floor and put it out quickly. Nobody was inside of the building at the time and the building itself is reported to have minimal damage.  Rockford Fire says this is the second small fire to have been reported in this building in the last three days. Rockford Fire Chief Kyle Hill says they suspect these fires are intentional. The building has been vacant for many years with only a chain link fence surrounding its perimeter. Hill says the fencing has fallen into disrepair which makes it easy for vandals to enter the building illegally.  Hill says the building has structural damage and poses a risk t the public and first responders, and a demolition will be scheduled for the near future.  “It’s a drain on our resources that we have that our protecting the rest of the city for abandoned buildings.

The Rio Bravo Volunteer Fire Department responded quickly to the call and helped extinguish the flames which occurred in the early morning hours of Saturday at the 500 block of Rosales -- the first street at the entrance into the southern Webb County municipality.  Juan C. Gonzalez, the fire chief, said they received the call at 12:15 a.m. and responded immediately. He said they were notified by National Guard troops that were passing through the area.  “The fire resulted in the burning of one RV, one small mobile home and one van,” Gonzalez said. “An elderly man (was) taken to the hospital for unknown injuries related to the fire.”  According to preliminary investigations, Gonzalez said the cause of the fire was an electrical issue within the mobile home.  El Cenizo Mayor Carina Hernandez was quickly alerted about the fire and even helped with what she could with the corresponding authorities during the blaze.  “Last night's fire incident was very unfortunate, and as a city, we are very fortunate that no one was injured during the incident,” Hernandez said. “As a city leader, this is something that I pray never occurs in our community due to the limited resources we have to be able to suppress fire incidents. I’ve made it a top priority of my administration to reorganize our local volunteer fire department and provide full support in terms of training and equipment.”  The mayor says she wants to assure the community that her administration is doing everything they can to utilize the resources they have available. They hope to maintain properties by working with property owners to try and prevent incidents like Saturday's fire from occurring.  Several bystanders looking at the flames said they were appreciative of the help of the Rio Bravo Volunteer Fire Department and hope that soon the El Cenizo Volunteer Fire Department can also increase its ranks in efforts to be more proactive in the community and respond faster to any emergency.  ""We were in bed early and received the news after midnight that there was a fire growing rapidly. My brother -- Raul Mata, an El Cenizo volunteer firefighter -- rushed to the fire station by himself and took the fire truck to the scene, but thankfully the Rio Bravo Volunteer Fire Department had arrived momentarily,"" Jerry Mata said. ""Together, they fought the fire within our community and prevented the loss of further property and most importantly, life. We have other volunteers but we’re not able to assist since we are a handful, and some we’re out of town or working. We hope to reach energetic individuals within our community with a passion to help others to come and become part of our volunteer firefighter team.""  The mayor thanked the Rio Bravo Volunteer Fire Department for their prompt actions to prevent the fire from spreading.  “We’re thankful to the Rio Bravo Volunteer Fire Department for their prompt response and for their continued support in rendering fire suppression mutual aid,” Hernandez said. “Local volunteers like Mr. Raul Mata, who selfishly assisted with fire suppression aid, are what will make our local volunteer fire department successful and provide our community with the safety and reassurance that in an event of an emergency, someone will answer the call and promptly respond.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxtdG9ubGluZS5jb20vbG9jYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9maXJlLXN0cmlrZXMtZWwtY2VuaXpvLXJlc2lkZW5jZS1yaW8tYnJhdm8tMTgxMjI2NzgucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""We're seeing the incremental rebound from the Chinese consumer,"" the firm's chief investment officer told "" ETF Edge "" this week. ""[But] it's not like turning on a light switch.""  China's pandemic-battered economy is starting to see consumers open their wallets wider, according to KraneShares' Brendan Ahern.  Ahern, who's involved with the firm's China-focused ETFs, expects quarterly earnings for Chinese companies to improve with each consecutive quarter — a forecast that may already be unfolding.  Tech giants Baidu and Tencent beat revenue expectations for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. Alibaba , on the other hand, missed revenue estimates.  ""We're actually hearing that for many of the companies … in the management calls, they're speaking to how Q2 already is outpacing Q1, which outpaced Q4 of last year,"" Ahern said.  China's reopening is also anticipated to have a positive impact on the airline industry.  Singapore Airlines , Japan's All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines all noted demand from China as a factor in future earnings while reporting net profits earlier this month for the financial year ended March 2023.

His forecast comes as a government-backed epidemiologist said the country's new Covid wave could infect 65 million a week by the end of next month.  Rhind believes the recent Covid surge won't affect the reopening's trajectory, adding past lockdowns seen across China are ""very, very much unlikely to be repeated.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjcvY29uc3VtZXJzLWFyZS1zdGFydGluZy10by1maXJlLXVwLWNoaW5hcy1lY29ub215LWV0Zi1leHBlcnRzLWZpbmQuaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzA1LzI3L2NvbnN1bWVycy1hcmUtc3RhcnRpbmctdG8tZmlyZS11cC1jaGluYXMtZWNvbm9teS1ldGYtZXhwZXJ0cy1maW5kLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As more wildfire evacuees are being allowed to return home in Alberta, provincial officials warn that warm, dry conditions are returning this weekend in some areas.  Melissa Story with Alberta Wildfire says the elevated fire conditions were anticipated and that crews on the ground are seeing more intense fire activity on the perimeters of wildfires.  But she says most fires haven't grown substantially and she doesn't believe any have jumped their containment lines.  The number of evacuees as of Saturday afternoon stood at 5,257, down from over 7,200 on Wednesday, following cooler and wetter conditions in the last week.  Nearly 50 wildfires in Alberta's forest protection area are burning, with 14 of those listed as out-of-control.  Cyndee Evans, executive director of the Alberta Emergency Management Agency, says the situation remains serious despite recent positive news.  ""While we can take heart that more Albertans are starting to return home, we cannot afford to drop our guard. Now is not the time for complacency. Please continue to do your part and help prevent the spread of wildfires and further damage from occurring,"" Evans told a news conference Saturday.  Story noted that showers were forecast for some parts of Alberta later Saturday, reducing fire danger, but also cautioned they bring the risk of lightning.  Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said in a tweet Saturday that an extension for the deployment of Canadian Armed Forces personnel to assist in firefighting efforts has been approved.  Story said firefighters from New Zealand were welcomed to the province Friday and that nearly 200 firefighters and support staff from Australia would be arriving this weekend.  Alberta remains under a provincewide state of emergency, although some bans on fires, ATVs and off-highway vehicles have been relaxed in recent days.  Parkland County west of Edmonton lifted a state of local emergency on Friday that had been in place since April 29, and downgraded a fire ban to a fire restriction. It said that meant ""safe fires in approved fire pits with a screen are allowed and do not require a permit.""  Fires without screens still required permits, however, and open fires in the county are still banned.  The High Level Forest Area wildfire update noted the Pasqua fire located in the community of Fox Lake saw an increase in fire activity after warm and dry weather on Friday, and that temperatures and fire behaviour was expected to pick up on Saturday.  Fox Lake remains evacuated, but residents are being permitted to sign up for tours of the community on Monday to view damage. A statement from the Little Red River Cree Nation said priority will be given to people who have lost their homes.  ""Tours will be visual only, as it is still not safe for members to walk around the community or house sites due to hot spots as well as possible toxins and hazards in the areas that have been burned,"" said a statement posted online by the First Nation on Friday.

The incident happened Tuesday morning after the couple argued over an unknown subject.  Residents say they were told the male was so upset, he took several of the woman’s clothes from her bedroom closet, set them on the floor, lit the attire on fire, and left the complex. The woman was able to self evacuate.

Pat Stiles hopes home, barber shop can be restored.  $8,000 raised to help recover from fire.  Pat Stiles considers herself lucky to be alive.  On May 17, a fire swept through parts of her home in Green where the family barbershop had operated since 1967.  More:'Thankful for this day': Historic Green schoolhouse reopens after arson left it in ruins  The retired teacher, who remains active in Green Good Neighbors and the city’s restored Lichtenwalter Schoolhouse, said Wednesday she almost didn’t make it.  She was upstairs getting ready for bed when the smoke alarm went off. Another 10 or 15 minutes and she would have been asleep and never heard the alarm.  She's not a light sleeper, she said.  “If I had gotten to sleep, you wouldn’t be talking to me now,” she said.  Startled by the alarm, Stiles walked down the stairs to the kitchen and saw flames.  “They were down, close to the floor,” she said.  'I've got to get out of here'  Smoke crept up the stairs, and Stiles was overwhelmed as she processed what was happening. At one point, she froze, knowing she needed to call 911.  “How did the fire get here?” she said. “All at once, I thought, ‘I’ve got to get out of here.’”  Stiles exited through the barbershop, safe from the fire but forced out of her home of more than 50 years.  It wasn’t the first time a fire caused her grief, she said. In 2016, the Lichtenwalter Schoolhouse was set ablaze by arsonists. Stiles taught classes there, showing elementary school students what school was like long before the era of computers and cellphones or even automobiles.  “I just sat down and cried when the schoolhouse went down,” Stiles said. “But this is much more traumatic.”  Help from a stranger  Outside her home, Stiles was helped by a man who pulled up and offered assistance.  “(He) asked me: ‘Do you have any relatives here in Green?’ ” she said.  He offered to take her to her youngest son’s home, but still in shock, Stiles couldn’t remember his address.  “I could not think of the street,” she said.  She waited with the man, still in her pajamas, as firefighters and her family arrived on scene.  Nancy Hall, one of Stiles’ four children, found out about the fire when a brother called.  “Mom’s house is on fire,” her brother told Hall. “Get down there.”  He’d seen a posting about the fire on the 330ToGo social media page, she said.  More than 50 years of memories  As of Wednesday, Stiles was waiting for an estimate on repairs — or even if the house was considered repairable. She wants to reopen the barbershop for two barbers employed there.  “We would rather restore than replace,” Hall said.  Stiles and Hall said some items that can’t be replaced were destroyed in the fire — the keys to Stiles' car and camper, for one. The upstairs bathroom that had recently been renovated, for another.  But the memories remain intact.  Stiles said she and her husband returned to Ohio in 1967 after eight years in Florida, looking for a home that could serve as his barbershop.  Having difficulty, they considered a return to Okeechobee before finding the house at the corner of Greensburg and Massillon roads to raise their four young children. Stiles Barber Shop — started as Ray’s — was run by her husband, who had a heart transplant in the early 1990s.  “We always had to be quiet in the house because they could hear us in the shop,” Hall said.  Stiles remembers a 1917 newspaper she found stuffed in a windowsill to block a draft. Her father’s 100th birthday celebration. Her grandparents’ antique tea cup set, feared lost in the fire but found on Wednesday. The camper stored in the large garage — “Stiles Pavilion” — that hauled extended family to every state in the U.S. except Hawaii.  Help from the Green community  Since the fire, the community Stiles has spent her years helping is helping back. A GoFundMe page — www.gofundme.com/f/fire-restoration-for-pat-stiles — had raised more than $8,000 by Friday morning to help restore the home and barbershop.  Numerous people have offered assistance. She said she reached into the pockets of a donated jacket and found two $50 bills left there to help out. The person who donated the item said nothing about the cash.  “They have been so wonderful,” she said.  Despite the disruption the fire has caused, Stiles remains concerned about the barbers — Tom and T.C. — who worked at Stiles Barber Shop.  “I want to help the boys,” she said.  They’ve taken positions at Portage Lakes Barber & Styling, and Stiles hopes they will return if the business can be restored.  For now, Stiles is staying with Hall while the fate of the family home is determined.  But there’s a time limit, Hall said, although it’s a generous one.  “I’m giving her 21 years,” Hall said. “After that, she’s on her own.”  Leave a message for Alan Ashworth at 330-996-3859 or email him ataashworth@gannett.com.

Personnel from Scalp Level-Paint, Hooversville, Conemaugh Township, Central City, Windber and Jerome fire departments were dispatched at 1:47 a.m. for a structure fire with possible entrapment, Scalp Level-Paint Fire Chief Mike Horvath said.  Memorial Day events:Here's where to see parades and other Memorial Day ceremonies  When the first crews arrived on scene, they were able to determine that there was no entrapment, as the homeowner was able to get herself and a dog out of the house, Horvath said. However, the homeowner told Horvath that some other animals in the home were unaccounted for.  As crews arrived, there was heavy smoke and flames visible at the front of the home, which faces River Street, Horvath said. The firemen initially went inside the home to put out the fire, but then they switched to an exterior attack because the structure became unsafe, Horvath said.  ""The roof had started to come in and (so) I pulled everybody out,"" he said.  More local events:Looking for something to do around Somerset County?

Crews made an aggressive interior attack with multiple hand lines until conditions forced the evacuation of the structure.  Firefighters remained on the scene performing extensive overhaul and the scene was cleared just prior to 8 p.m.  Four Swansea engines, Ladder 1 and Rescue 1 responded to the scene. An additional engine from the Somerset Fire Department was brought to the scene and Swansea Ambulance Corps responded to standby. The Rehoboth Fire Department and Warren Fire Department provided station coverage during the incident.  The home is uninhabitable as a result of the fire, and the damage is estimated to be approximately $250,000. Seven residents and several pets were displaced. There were no injuries reported.

No one was inside as massive flames broke out in the top floor.  “It was a little concerning as quickly as this building took off,” said Jenkerson. “It was more concerning because our firefighters could’ve been inside this building.

The fire is considered under control as of 10 p.m. Saturday.  Jenkerson says around 85 firefighters responded to the scene, using four aerial devices and three ground monitors in efforts to put out the fire. With swift response, crews prevented the fire from spreading to other vacant buildings around the area.  “Firefighters did a great job,” said Jenkerson. “It’s been a busy day for the St. Louis Fire Department.”  There are on injuries or inhalation concerns, but the fire has led to some scattered debris around the ground.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZm94Mm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9taXNzb3VyaS9sYXJnZS13YXJlaG91c2Utb24tZmlyZS1pbi1zdC1sb3Vpcy_SAUpodHRwczovL2ZveDJub3cuY29tL25ld3MvbWlzc291cmkvbGFyZ2Utd2FyZWhvdXNlLW9uLWZpcmUtaW4tc3QtbG91aXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Victoria"", ""BritishColumbia"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-27T11:02:19","Campaign for fire tax increase sees no opposition ahead of July vote  Voters in Murrells Inlet will go to the polls July 25 to decide whether to raise property taxes for fire and rescue services. The referendum comes four years after voters rejected a similar measure.  “I haven’t detected anyone who is opposed. Hopefully, it will stay that way,” said Tom Swatzel, a political consultant and former Georgetown County Council member. He formed Friends of the Murrells Inlet-Garden City Fire District to support a referendum that passed in 2015. He opposed one that failed in 2019.  The six-member board of the special-purpose district voted last month to raise the tax rate from 14 to 28 mills over the next five years. The rate will increase by 7 mills the first year to fund pay raises to help attract and retain firefighters and emergency medical workers. That will also allow the district to add a fourth ambulance.  A study commissioned by the district board last year found that it had to rely on mutual aid from neighboring departments over 200 times because of overlapping calls for medical services, a condition known as Level Zero.  That and the needs of a growing population in a service area that covers portions of Georgetown and Horry counties resonates with voters, Swatzel said.  The Friends had to give back donations in 2019 because it didn’t support the referendum. Starting from scratch this year, the group has raised close to $10,000, Swatzel said.  “A lot of businesses and individuals are enthusiastic about supporting the district and a ‘yes’ vote,” he said.  The district board moved cautiously through the winter and spring before voting to hold the referendum. Members worried voters would not support a measure that doubles their taxes.  But the board was also concerned that turnover was high and employees were becoming burned out by working overtime to maintain service even though the minimum staffing levels dropped. Over one weekend this winter, only two of the three ambulances were staffed.  The district is on track to have its ambulances fully staffed by next month with paramedic specialists. They will work 24-hour shifts and have three days off. That change from a 24/48 schedule – and from filling the role of paramedic and firefighter – has proven to be a draw, Fire Chief J.R. Haney said.  “It costs more, but we’re able to get personnel that are looking for that better schedule,” he said.  It requires eight people to staff an ambulance around the clock on a 24/72 schedule rather than the six required by a conventional schedule.  Before creating the paramedic specialist position, the district had one applicant for a paramedic-firefighter position in eight months, Haney said. He has filled 12 paramedic specialist slots in three months.  “This is the direction the system is going,” Haney said. “I’m only hiring paramedics, which are the hardest ones to get.”  The tax increase will also allow the district to add the 50 staff that will allow the district to meet the national standard for dealing with structure fires.  The district staff can’t campaign for the referendum while on duty, but it can inform voters about its plan to used the additional revenue. The response so far has been “wholly supportive,” Haney said.  A successful campaign extends beyond building support to making sure that supporters turn out to vote, Swatzel said.  “It’s difficult, in general, with these off-cycle referendums, particularly in the middle of the summer,” he said.”It’s about turning out a vote that supports a ‘yes’ vote.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY29hc3RhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9jYW1wYWlnbi1mb3ItZmlyZS10YXgtaW5jcmVhc2Utc2Vlcy1uby1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWFoZWFkLW9mLWp1bHktdm90ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Playing their seventh match in the last three weeks, the Fire raced ahead to an early two-goal lead in the first half, but conceded a pair of goals to enter the halftime break level, 2-2. The two sides would exchange goals late in the second half to earn a point each.  Ten minutes into the match, Chicago won a ball in their half and midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri scanned the field for a target. Shaqiri sent a perfectly-weighted ball behind the Revolution defense for forward Georgios Koutsias. The young forward ran onto the pass, taking a couple of controlling passes toward the goal before placing his shot past the goalkeeper and into the lower left corner. With his goal, Koutsias became the third player under the age of 20 to score in back-to-back matches for the Fire, along with Jhon Durán and Justin Mapp.  Koutsias was a key part of the second goal in the 22nd minute, when he played a pass up the left flank for Miguel Navarro. The quick Venezuelan cut a pass across the goalmouth that bounced off Andrew Farrell and redirected into the net.  New England pulled even just before halftime with goals in the 38th and 40th minutes. Revolution midfielder Noel Buck put one past Homegrown goalkeeper Chris Brady with a big shot from outside the box in the 38th minute. Two minutes later, Bobby Wood, who assisted on Buck’s goal, sent the ball sailing to the back of the net off a header from the center of the box.  Brady kept the score level in the 55th minute when Giacomo Vrioni found himself one-on-one with the young ’keeper. Vrioni squared up and Brady made himself big, saving the shot with his foot.  In the 79th minute, second-half substitute Brian Gutiérrez controlled the ball on the left side, sending a pass across the box for Kei Kamara. The forward kept it going right, sending a low pass to Haile-Selassie making a run on the right. The midfielder placed it low for his third goal of the season.  New England also scored a third via Jozy Altidore in the 83rd minute. The result marks the Fire’s second consecutive 3-3 draw in League play, as the team extended its unbeaten run to three matches across all competitions.  NEXT MATCH: Chicago heads up North to face Toronto FC at 6:30 p.m. CT on Wednesday, May 31 at BMO Field. The match will be broadcast on Apple TV+, streamed in English on wlsam.com, and transmitted locally in Spanish on TUDN 1200 AM.  Notes:  Greek forward Georgios Koutsas scored his second goal in a Fire shirt in his first-ever MLS start. Koutsias, who scored his first MLS and Chicago Fire goal in the 89th minute of the 3-3 tie with Atlanta United, scored in consecutive MLS matches for the first time in his career.

And has slapped frozen grins on children as it transported Santa down through their neighborhood.  So that wistful expression on Lower Milford Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 veteran firefighter Scott Moser’s face was completely understandable as he waved the old girl goodbye.    Lower Milford Volunteer Fire Company No. 1 is auctioning off its 1983 Chevrolet fire truck  The four-wheel-drive vehicle has fewer than 28,000 miles  Bids are being taken at municibid.com  “It’s time,” Moser said at the fire company Friday. “We’re getting a new truck about the same size to replace it. The old truck is aging and difficult to get parts for. But it has never let us down.  “It’s time. But still, it’s hard to let it go.”  After 39 years serving the community, the 1983 Chevrolet fire truck — an old but reliable friend in red — has been placed up for auction at municibid.com.  1 of 3 — Pierce1.jpeg Dean Bruch (l) and Henry Iobst enjoy a champagne toast to celebrate the arrival of the new Pierce attack/mini-pumper in the engine room at the Lower Milford Fire Company in Limeport on May 11, 1984.

Contributed  The truck’s specs are there for review: a four-wheel-drive, four-speed manual V8, 454-cubic-inch gas engine, with a 250-gallon water tank, and electric hose reel.  With fewer than 28,000 miles.  But what’s most significant about the 40-year-old fire truck can't be found in the owner’s manual.  “To some people, it’s just a truck. But to many of us, it’s much more than a truck.” Scott Moser, Lower Milford Township Fire Company firefighter  “That little truck has been a part of this community forever,” Moser said. “Halloween parades, firemen’s parades, and kids holding their dogs sitting in it getting their picture taken.  “To some people, it’s just a truck. But to many of us, it’s much more than a truck.”    'It's a special truck'  The little fire engine that could predates Moser, 67. The Bethlehem native began his Lower Milford Fire Company career on that very truck 35 years ago.  “We got it new in 1984,” Moser said. “It’s a smaller truck — we call it either a brush or attack truck — that can get to places where the bigger trucks can’t. We use it for field fires where sometimes the bigger trucks can’t get up the narrow roads.  “It was always able to do its job. It’s a special truck.”  With the new $350,000 replacement truck expected to be delivered within a week, the time had come to say goodbye to the old girl. The fire company contacted municibid early this month to put it up for auction.  “I’d like to see some small fire company buy it and keep it working for the community. That’s what it's good at."" Scott Moser, veteran firefighter at Lower Milford Fire Company  “I have no idea who will buy it,” Moser said. “Maybe a farmer will use it to water their crops. The truck has two sprinkler nozzles under the bumper, and someone could stand on the back and use the hose.  “I’d like to see some small fire company buy it and keep it working for the community. That’s what it's good at.""  Bidding on the truck ends Tuesday. As of Friday evening, the high bid stood at $5,300 after 49 bids.

"fire","2019-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-27T17:07:15","The U.S. government can keep using chemical retardant dropped from aircraft to fight wildfires, despite finding that the practice pollutes streams in western states in violation of federal law, a judge ruled Friday.  Halting the use of the red slurry material could have resulted in greater environmental damage from wildfires, said U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen in Missoula, Montana.  The judge agreed with U.S. Forest Service officials who said dropping retardant into areas with waterways was sometimes necessary to protect lives and property.  The ruling came after environmentalists sued following revelations that the Forest Service dropped retardant into waterways hundreds of times over the past decade.  Government officials say chemical fire retardant can be crucial to slowing the advance of dangerous blazes. Wildfires across North America have grown bigger and more destructive over the past two decades as climate change warms the planet.  More than 200 loads of retardant got into waterways over the past decade. Federal officials say those situations usually occurred by mistake and in less than 1% of the thousands of loads annually.  A coalition that includes Paradise, California — where a 2018 blaze killed 85 people and destroyed the town — had said a court ruling that stopped the use of retardant would have put lives, homes and forests at risk.  “This case was very personal for us,” Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin said. “Our brave firefighters need every tool in the toolbox to protect human lives and property against wildfires, and today’s ruling ensures we have a fighting chance this fire season.”  State and local agencies lean heavily on the U.S. Forest Service to help fight fires, many of which originate or include federal land.  Fire retardant is a specialized mixture of water and chemicals including inorganic fertilizers or salts. It’s designed to alter the way fire burns, making blazes less intense and slowing their advance.  That can give firefighters time to steer flames away from inhabited areas and in extreme situations to evacuate people from danger.  “Retardant lasts and even works if it’s dry,” said Scott Upton, a former region chief and air attack group supervisor for California’s state fire agency. “Water is only so good because it dries out. It does very well to suppress fires, but it won’t last.”  The Oregon-based group Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics argued in its lawsuit filed last year that the Forest Service was disregarding the Act by continuing to use retardant without taking adequate precautions to protect streams and rivers.  Christensen said stopping the use of fire retardant would “conceivably result in greater harm from wildfires — including to human life and property and to the environment.” The judge said his ruling was limited to 10 western states where members of the plaintiff's group alleged harm from pollution into waterways that they use.  After the lawsuit was filed the Forest Service applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for a permit that would allow it to continue using retardant without breaking the law. The process could take several years.  Such a permit could require tighter restrictions on when retardant could be used or for officials to use less-toxic chemicals, said Andy Stahl with Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics.  “It's certainly a good first step,” Stahl said.  Christensen ordered federal officials to report every six months on their progress.  Forest Service spokesperson Wade Muehlhof said the agency believes retardant can be used “without compromising public health and the environment.”  “The Forest Service is working diligently with the Environmental Protection Agency on a general permit for aerially delivered retardant that will allow us to continue using wildfire retardant to protect homes and communities,” Muehlhof said.  Climate change, people moving into fire-prone areas, and overgrown forests are creating more catastrophic megafires that are harder to fight.  Almost 150 million gallons (567 million liters) of fire retardant were dropped on National Forest lands between 2013 and 2022, according to the Department of Agriculture. Retardant drops onto forests in California accounted for 49% of the total volume.  Health risks to firefighters or other people who come into contact with fire retardant are considered low, according to a 2021 risk assessment.  But the chemicals can be harmful to some fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic species. A government study found misapplied retardant could adversely affect dozens of imperiled species, including crawfish, spotted owls and fish such as shiners and suckers.  Forest Service officials said they are trying to come into compliance with the law by getting a pollution permit but that could take years.  To keep streams from getting polluted, officials in recent years have avoided drops inside buffer zones within 300 feet (92 meters) of waterways. Retardant may only be applied inside those zones when human life or public safety is threatened. Of 213 instances of fire retardant landing in water between 2012 and 2019, 190 were accidents and the remainder were necessary to save lives or property, officials said.  Many areas of the Western U.S. experienced heavy snowfalls this past winter, and as a result fire dangers are lower than in recent years across much of the region.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwci5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yNy9qdWRnZS1hbGxvd3MtZmlyZS1yZXRhcmRhbnQtdXNlLWRlc3BpdGUtcG9sbHV0ZWQtc3RyZWFtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(0:57)  Bayern Munich's Bundesliga title celebrations were quickly overshadowed by the fallout from the club's decision to fire former goalkeeper Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidžić from their positions as top executives.  Bayern secured the German championship in the final minutes of the season on Saturday with Jamal Musiala securing a 2-1 win over Cologne with a late goal for the team to finish ahead of Borussia Dortmund on goal difference.  - Hamilton: Dejection in Dortmund as Bundesliga title dream collapses  - Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)  Shortly afterward, the club announced its supervisory board had decided to fire Kahn as chief executive and Salihamidžić as sporting director with immediate effect.  ""Instead of celebrating, now we have the next issue,"" Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said.  Both Kahn and Salihamidžić had been under pressure following Bayern's dip in form this season. The Bundesliga title race was the closest in years after Bayern had comfortably won the previous 10, while there were quarterfinal exits in both the Champions League and German Cup.  Club president Herbert Hainer later said the decision to fire the two men was made Friday --- before the team's unexpected Bundesliga success.  Dortmund were leading by two points going into the final round and just needed to beat Mainz at home Saturday to be sure of becoming German champions. Instead, they only drew 2-2.  Salihamidžić was in Cologne for Bayern's final game, but Kahn didn't travel.  ""I wasn't allowed by the club,"" Kahn wrote on Twitter, contradicting the club's claim that he missed the game on doctor's orders.  Tuchel seemed shocked by the club's decision to fire the men who had brought him to the club as Julian Nagelsmann's replacement in March.  ""I knew about it since yesterday. The two were largely responsible for the fact we went on this journey together. That's why I have to process it now,"" Tuchel said after his team's win. ""But I'm assuming that I'll continue on my path at Bayern.""  Bayern said supervisory board vice-chairman Jan-Christian Dreesen will take over as CEO from Kahn, while a successor for Salihamidžić still needs to be found.  ""The club had the feeling that they had to do something,"" Bayern veteran Thomas Müller said, ""That's what we were told and that's what they've now decided.""  Kahn, a former Germany goalkeeper and Bayern captain, returned to the club in 2020 on a 5-year contract, initially as a member of the supervisory board before taking over in 2022 from Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as chairman and CEO.  Kahn joined Bayern from Karlsruher SC in 1994 and went on to win eight Bundesliga titles, six German Cups, and the Champions League in 2001. Salihamidžić was his teammate for six of those league titles and four in the cup.  Kahn made 86 appearances for Germany, winning the European Championship in 1996 and finishing World Cup runner-up in 2002. He was named the world's best goalkeeper three times, European goalkeeper of the year four times and German footballer of the year twice.  Salihamidžić became Bayern's sporting director in 2017.  ""I would have liked to keep going because I really want to win the Champions League again with this team,"" Salihamidžić said.  Bayern have called a press conference for Sunday to explain the decision to fire the two men.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL3NvY2Nlci9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzQxNjQ3L2JheWVybi1tdW5pY2gtZmlyZS1jZW8tb2xpdmVyLWthaG4taGFzYW4tc2FsaWhhbWlkemljLWJ1bmRlc2xpZ2EtdGl0bGUtd2lu0gGHAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL3NvY2Nlci9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzQxNjQ3L2JheWVybi1tdW5pY2gtZmlyZS1jZW8tb2xpdmVyLWthaG4taGFzYW4tc2FsaWhhbWlkemljLWJ1bmRlc2xpZ2EtdGl0bGUtd2luP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Gila Las Cruces Zone Type 3 Team, led by Incident Commander Pete Valenzuela assumed command this morning.  The fire is located south of New Mexico Highway 59, about 1 mile west of Wolf Hollow Campground, and along the northern Gila Wilderness boundary. Camping is not recommended at Wolf Hollow due to the likelihood of fire reaching the area and heavy localized firefighter activity. Fire is progressing to the south, east, and west, consuming mostly down logs, dead grass, and pine needles beneath a ponderosa pine-dominated forest canopy.  One hundred people are currently working the Pass Fire, including a large number of youths who are supporting the fire at the Incident Command Post, gaining work experience and exposure to public land management. A Job Corps kitchen crew began serving meals this morning and camp yurts are being maintained by a contracted youth crew out of California. Fire crews are cutting back grass and removing surface fuels to protect range and other infrastructure. A Helitack crew will begin cleaning up a helispot on Black Mountain in preparation for structure protection of Black Mountain Lookout.  “Responders have done some great work up to now, protecting values at risk and keeping the fire south of Highway 59, while allowing fire to play its natural role in the forest,” said Valenzuela. “The work we’re doing is helping to restore resiliency to these lands and watersheds.”  A variety of tactics will be used commensurate with public and firefighter safety, values at risk, and likelihood of success. Values at risk include small private land parcels, range fences, water pipelines and stock tanks, powerlines, recreation sites, roads, a research site, historic features, sensitive wildlife habitats, wetlands, and watershed resources. They will be protected as appropriate if fire reaches pre-identified management action points.  Firefighters are using control elements, such as roads, trails and landscape features to safely confine and contain the fire within the desired area identified by resource specialists. A large planning area allows for the Pass Fire to ultimately encompass about 75,000 acres south of Highway 59, including much of the northern Gila Wilderness east of Indian Creek, north of the Middle Fork Gila River and the Adobe Springs and White Rocks trails, and west of the East Fork Gila River and Beaver Creek.  Decisions about whether to fully suppress a naturally ignited wildfire or to manage for natural resource objectives depend on a number of factors including the ignition source, location, fuels, suppression resource availability, expected fire weather conditions, and seasonal outlook.  Weather over the fire area will be partly cloudy this morning, turning mostly sunny this afternoon, with highs from 68 to 83, depending on elevation. Relative humidity will drop to 10 to 15% this afternoon, and there’s a 10% chance of precipitation today.  Several fire scars exist around the area of the Pass Fire, which will help serve as containment features, should the fire reach them. Pass Fire ignited within the 2005 Bull Fire perimeter, which removed a large amount of ladder fuels from much of the area. The 2012 Whitewater Baldy fire scar is a few miles west of the western edge of the Pass Fire, and the more distant 2021 Johnson Fire and 2022 Black Fire scars lie to the south and east.  Please use caution when entering or passing through the area, as heavy firefighter traffic and activity may exist along area roads. Air inversions are likely to cause low-lying smoke to settle into valleys overnight that may obscure visibility for travel. Smoke-sensitive individuals should follow recommendations at NM Fire Info | Smoke Management.

(WDBJ) - The Pulaski community is reeling from the loss of the Evelyn Alexander Water Park, also known as the Randolph Park Pool. The building caught fire Friday night and was destroyed.  Just three days before opening Monday for the summer, the Randolph Park pool house burned down - leaving an entire community devastated and heartbroken.  “Seeing it gone, it’s just like my entire life is, like, here,” said Emileigh Sheppard.  Like many people in Pulaski County, Sheppard and her family drove to the pool to see what was left.  “You see this and you’re like, woah,” added Sheppard. “My entire childhood, or so far of it, has been here every summer.”  Only memories and rubble remain of the building opened in 2000 to serve the community. Officials say it is a complete loss.  “Personally, there is a lot of emotion but thankfully no one was hurt,” said Assistant County Administrator Anthony Akers.  Akers says the call was made just before 4:30 Friday Afternoon. He explained some staff members were inside but made it out safely after calling 911. Fire officials say 6 of the 8 fire departments in the county were on scene.  “And they were all here ‘cause a lot of them had memories here as well,” added Akers. “You could feel those emotions going on while they were fighting the fire.”  Akers was the first park manager and remembers the growth. He says that on average, more than 500 people visited the pool every day.  “I’ve seen the amount of people who’ve spent their lives – young lives – through here, and adults,” explained Akers. “So, it’s very meaningful and it’s a vastly important facility to Pulaski County.”  County officials met for a debrief meeting Saturday morning to discuss how they will pick up the pieces.  “We will do all we can to fix it,” said Board of Supervisors Chair Laura Walters. “We’ll build back better and it’s because the community will all pull together to make this happen.”  The cause of the fire has not been determined.  Randolph Park remains open and available to the public.  Copyright 2023 WDBJ.

Low humidity and gusty winds caused the Morse-Fall Lake Fire Department to have to pull back from battling the blaze and an air attack was launched.  By Saturday night the fire was 50 percent contained with a dozer line being cut around the fire.  ""The fire started by the Lucky Boy ponds and burned to the northeast,"" said Morse-Fall Lake fire chief Ted Krueger. ""It entered a clear cut and then into an area with a lot of dead balsam.""  Following the initial attack by Morse-Fall Lake, a Chinook helicopter and four Fire Boss planes were diverted from another fire to drop water on the Ely fire.  ""The Chinook was able to dump a lot of water on the fire and he had a quick turnaround time from Lucky Boy to the fire,"" said Krueger.  The Chinook CH-47 can drop 3,000 gallons of water at a time and reload in under two minutes.  The Fire Boss can carry 800 gallons of water and fly 170 miles per hour. They were picking up water on Shagawa Lake.  People gathered at vantage points to take photos of the fire and the air show that went with it, including along Hwy. 169 and at the Morse Town Hall.  Krueger said the plan is to get a dozer line around the entire fire and attack the spot fires that were popping up Saturday. A smaller helicopter will be on the scene in addition to ground crews from Morse-Fall Lake, the U.S. Forest Service and the Minnesota DNR.  The Taconite Trail will be closed until further notice between Ely and Raven Lane.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVseWVjaG8uY29tL2x1Y2t5LWJveS1maXJlLWJ1cm5zLTIwLWFjcmVzLW5lYXItZWx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A Scio man helped pull two neighbors from a burning home before fire leveled the house Saturday afternoon, May 27.  Neighbors said Jacob Klindtworth smashed the windows out of a house at 36591 Crackerneck Drive, near Scio, as the structure filled with flame and smoke.  Sheryl Kundert said her daughter, Michelle Lee, was in the house babysitting a child when she received a phone call.  “Michelle called, frantic, and I couldn’t understand her. House was on fire,” Kundert said.  Klindtworth said he went to the back of the house after he saw fire had likely cut off the structure’s front door from rooms on the opposite side of the home.  He said he saw cars parked out front and no one standing outside the house and ran around the side of the structure with only one thought on his mind.  “I assumed there was people in the house,” Kindtworth said.  Someone called 911 around 1:45 p.m. to report that the home was on fire in an area of mostly farm fields and houses between Albany and Scio, hemmed in to the south and north by Crabtree and Thomas creeks.  Several neighbors heard concussions they described as explosions as car tires and unknown containers detonated in the heat of the fire.  “We were outside and didn’t hear anything,” Klindtworth said. “We smelled it.""  Jefferson, Lyons and Scio Rural fire districts sent more than a dozen firefighters, and numerous firetrucks and water tenders were staged around the house as it burned.  Thick black smoke filled the road where responders deployed a collapsible pool-like reservoir of water and pumped hoses onto the house. The home appeared completely razed by 2:20 p.m. as firefighters sprayed flames still burning on the back side of the house.  Kundert said hers was one of several cars destroyed in the driveway in front of the home. She said a family dog had been with her daughter while visiting the house and was unsure if the animal survived.  Lee and the child she was watching both had been placed in ambulances, according to neighbors who said they saw the fire.  “Michelle survived and that’s the important thing,” Kundert said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL2dhemV0dGV0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hY2NpZGVudC1hbmQtaW5jaWRlbnQvc2Npby1uZWlnaGJvci1zYXZlcy0yLWZyb20taG91c2UtZmlyZS9hcnRpY2xlXzRhYjIwZDM3LThhM2EtNTI3OS1hYmU2LWEyZTE5YWYwNGZhNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fire damage to an outdoor shower at a Cape Cod home was believed to have been caused by a mirror reflecting sunlight. Harwich Fire Department  A mirror in an outdoor shower sparked a fire at a Cape Cod home by reflecting and magnifying sunlight into the shower’s frame. And now, firefighters are reminding residents that placing a mirror in an outdoor shower can be a fire hazard.

(KYMA, KECY) - With an increase in wildfire activity, which is anticipated to peak as the weather continues to get hotter and drier, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is doing its part to keep western Arizona safe.  Starting Friday, May 26, BLM has seasonal fire restrictions in place in Yuma, Mohave and La Paz Counties.  Maintaining a campfire, using charcoal, coal, or wood stove fire, smoking, and discharging a firearm or gas gun are all prohibited.  Dolores Garcia, BLM Spokesperson adds, ""That's restricted as well as in many places, the use of grinding a welding torch so working outdoors with metal that could cause a spark and again that's on BLM lands.""  So before building a campfire, make sure you're not on BLM land or there could be serious consequences.  ""In addition to having to pay for, we have fines but you might have to be responsible for paying for the suppression costs depending on how large that fire gets. We have many fires that are a million dollars a day for the resources we bring in,"" stated Garcia.  Tribal, federal, state, and local mandates are different, they may have some differences in their restriction notices. Variations are possible, and visitors should check with the most local office for area-specific restrictions and regulations.  Henry Arnold, visitor from San Diego says he has been coming to Yuma for years to fish and fires have really changed the environment.  ""Smoking, trash. I mean it's never good so when you put restrictions in, it makes it a lot better,"" Arnold says.  According to the Southwest Coordination Center, there have been over 350 wildfires in Arizona already this year and in 2022, there were over 1,200 fires that burned more than 145,000 acres.  Garcia shares how driving your car onto grass can even start a fire and can be prevented.  ""The bottom part of your car from its exhaust system and that catalytic converter underneath your car gets hot enough to start a fire,"" mentions Garcia.  If you do happen to start a fire, call 911 immediately.  BLM said the restrictions will be released once the risk of wildfires goes down.

(WIBW) - Fire crews at the Mission Township Fire Department say they’ll be able to serve the community much better now that they’ve got some new equipment.  One of the vehicles is a $700,000 Pumper Engine Tanker 40 truck picked up from South Dakota.  “This truck has a lot of water on it and it’s gonna be used in place of what we called our rescue truck. Before we were taking a rescue truck out on fire calls which its main purpose, it had supplies for a fire but it’s mainly for rescues and car wrecks, and crash fires and things like that,” says Mission Township Fire Department, Fire Chief, Forrest Walter.  “One OF the things a lot of times that we have to take with us is our water, so this tank has 3,000 gallons which our other pumper which we could take on fires only had 1,800 gallons, so this is bigger, better, faster truck,” says Chief Walter.  The other a $200,000 brush truck from Salina.  “And then we were fortunate enough to get approval over the last year to get a brush truck to replace one of our 18 brush trucks that was over 20 years old. So it gives us really good arsenal to work with on response for everything from grass fires, medical, to having a better engine out for second out on our structure fires,” says Chief Walter.  Crews say it takes about 500 days to get a new fire truck, so they consider themselves very lucky.  “We are excited to get a new fire truck actually to get two in a week is astonishing,” says Chief Walter.  Crews say the new trucks will help them better serve the community.  “That’s a problem a lot of rural fire departments have is that they got to be prepared for anything so you got to find that finetune to be able to meet the demand of what the public needs in emergencies from a fall, to a structure fire to a full hazmat situation. So we’re able to utilize our assets more effectively and efficiently and have a better response with the equipment that’s necessary for the different types of calls,” says Chief Walter.

Representatives from the Chicago Fire participated in a Play Proud 10-day intensive residency training program, joining teams from Major League Soccer (MLS), National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL), United Soccer League (USL), United Soccer League Championship (USL Championship), Liga MX and the Canadian Premier League (CPL) in completing 100+ hours of training with the goal of tackling inclusion at all levels of soccer, dismantling systematic barriers, and providing anti-bias education.

The fire station received 12 new twin mattresses from BEDGEAR, and NFM donated six recliners, three cooling fans, and an entertainment set to make the most of their rest and recovery time.  Fire Station No.1 also received a custom Dallas Mavs jersey to hang.  Dallas Mavs swingman Theo Pinson represented the franchise on Thursday and spent time unboxing the beds, visiting with emergency personnel, and he got a tour of the firetrucks and station.  “Oh man, our first responders deserve great things to work with and getting rest and recovery is a big part of that,” Pinson said. “To give them a better experience when they are resting (is important) so they can give us a better performance out there. They do great already. But they deserve all this stuff.”  May is when the world’s community comes together to recognize and honor firefighters’ sacrifices to ensure communities and environments are as safe as possible.  Each season the Mavs come together to donate to a local station. Fire Station No. 1 is significant to the franchise because it’s responsible for the American Airlines Center and Mavericks HQ. These are the same men and women caring for fans on game nights.  The Mavs ManiAACs, D-Town Crew and Mascot Champ also attended the event.  Assistant Fire Chief Frank McKinley spoke on behalf of the department and said the items are greatly appreciated and will be put to use.  “I’m responsible for Dallas Fire Rescue’s facilities, so it’s an extreme honor to receive these wonderful pieces of furniture. It’s very needed,” he said. “It’s a testament to how DFR likes to extend our partnerships with outside agencies and companies. So we really want to say thank you to Nebraska Furniture, BEDGEAR and the Dallas Mavericks. We really do appreciate it.”  Pinson, who wears No. 1 on the court, admitted that he has a particular affinity towards the fire station with the same number.  After shaking hands with all the first responders, he tried out their new beds and learned about the ins and outs of the station. He said these men and women are the true heroes in our communities.  “Sleep is very important; you want to get as much sleep as possible and the best sleep during the time you do get,” Pinson said. “I understand lack of sleep now that I have a little girl. But the time you do get is very important. So I think it’s a big-time thing we did today for them and everyone else. We really appreciate everything they do.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hdnMuY29tL3RoZW9maXJlc3RhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The twin-engine Gates Learjet 36A plunged into the Pacific Ocean near San Clemente Island on May 10 while trying to make an emergency landing at a Navy airfield there, according to a preliminary investigative report from the National Transportation Safety Board.  The wreckage of the plane was found underwater but the two pilots and additional crew member — all civilians — haven’t been found and are presumed dead, the report said.  The jet was one of two that took off from Point Mugu Naval Air Station in Oxnard and headed south towards San Clemente Island, which is owned by the Navy and is west of San Diego. They were going to take part in training exercises with the Navy.  Shortly after arriving at the exercise site, the crew in the first plane, which was leading, radioed that they smelled an odor in the cabin and the crew of the plane behind radioed that they saw white or gray smoke or gas coming from the left side of the cabin, along with some kind of liquid trailing the jet, according to the NTSB report.  “At this point the lead airplane was not maintaining heading or altitude,” the report said.  The crew of the second plane then saw flames coming from around the rear equipment door of the first aircraft and told the crew to declare an emergency.  The troubled plane planned to land at an auxiliary Navy airfield on San Clemente Island and the other jet maneuvered in front to lead it to the field, the report said.  However, contact was lost as the jets descended.  Broadcast data from the first airplane showed that it made a series of descending turns and was at an altitude of 1,338 feet (408 meters) and about a half-mile (less than a kilometer) from the island when the information stopped, according to the report.  The Learjet’s wreckage was located a mile (1.6 kilometers) offshore in about 300 feet (91 meters) of water, and some of the debris showed evidence of a fire before the crash, the report said.  The report didn’t mention a possible cause for the fire or the crash.

Public Safety Commissioner James Montagnino declined to provide the firefighters’ name Wednesday. However, he said the firefighter provided time records to his office that the firefighter received via a Freedom of Information Law request from the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  “The bulk of the investigation was ours but it was triggered by the provision of that initial set of papers,” Montagnino said.  That complaint was received by the Public Safety Commissioner on Jan. 27 and Dolan was placed on paid leave Feb. 1. On May 19 the Public Safety Department filed 16 misconduct charges against Dolan.  The alleged misconduct charges include:  Dolan did not take leave time for the various days in 2022 he attended training at the State Academy of Fire Science in Montour Falls.  Dolan did not take leave days in 2021 for the times he provided training at the Saratoga County Fire Training Center or in 2022 when he provided training at Troy Fire Department in his capacity as a trainer for the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  Dolan defrauded the city and offered a false instrument for filing by falsely entering time worked into the employee time reporting system.  Dolan asked the Montagnino to secure an over $62,000 Chevy Tahoe and was eventually given one to be used by fire captains to respond to scenes but was used by the chief instead, including for personal reasons.  The various charges constitute both misdemeanors and felonies under criminal law statutes, including instances of grand larceny. However, no criminal charges have been filed against Dolan. Montagnino said he was not ready to comment on whether criminal charges would be filed.  Dolan’s attorney Brian Culnan, of Albany-based law firm O’Connell & Aronowitz, has denied the claims.  “I am confident that Chief Dolan has done nothing that should result in the termination of his employment,” Culnan said.  “Every time that Chief Dolan was paid for performing services for the city of Saratoga Springs, he was actually performing services for the city of Saratoga Springs.”  Culnan said the city doesn’t cite a city policy that Dolan has violated.  “The collective bargaining agreement between the chiefs union and the city states that it is expected that the chief will work a 40-hour week, Monday through Friday,” Culnan said. “And yet they have proposed to discipline him for providing training on nights and weekends. This despite the fact that his bio on the city’s website trumpets that he is a state fire inspector.”  Culnan also claims that the firefighter who ignited the investigation has just been disciplined by Dolan.  “Ordinarily, that fact would taint and/or delegitimize the complaint, but it was apparently ignored by Mr. Montagnino because it did not fit the political objectives of him and his minions.”  The union representing the city’s firefighters declined to provide any comment.  On May 1 the union announced that it had voted no confidence in the fire chief and made a request to Montagnino that he be removed.  Montagnino said he was unaware of whether the firefighter had been disciplined by Dolan.  Dolan, through his attorney, has filed a grievance to the state Public Employment Relations Board alleging improper labor practices by the city.  Assistant Chief Aaron Dyer has been overseeing operations of the department while Dolan has been on leave.  Reporter Shenandoah Briere can be reached at [email protected].

The Moose Fire, alone, burned 130 acres and cost over $98 million to fight.

No human fatalities or injuries were reported; however, there were two dogs, four cats and six chickens that perished in the fire. The home's human occupants were not home at the time.  LFR did confirm that Lubbock Fire Marshal ruled the incident was caused by nature — a lightning strike to the structure. The fire happened as a line of thunderstorms moved across the city.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWJib2Nrb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2ZpcmUvMjAyMy8wNS8yNi9zb3V0aC1sdWJib2NrLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUtY2F1c2VkLWJ5LWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2UtMTItYW5pbWFscy1kaWVkLzcwMjYxMzM0MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is expected to reach the Orange or Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups category. * WHERE...Portions of central and southern Minnesota. * WHEN...From 12 PM CDT Sunday through 8 PM CDT Monday. * IMPACTS...Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who are active outdoors, may experience health effects. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Ground-level ozone is expected to be high during the afternoon hours on Sunday and Monday, and air quality is expected to reach the Orange (unhealthy for sensitive groups) AQI category across central Minnesota. Sunny skies, warm temperatures, and low humidity will create an environment favorable for two types of pollutants (Volatile Organic Compounds and Nitrogen Oxides) to react in the air to produce ground-level ozone. Ozone will be highest during the afternoon and early evening hours when sunshine is most abundant, and temperatures are highest. Air quality is expected to reach the Orange AQI category. This is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups. Ozone levels will be low during the overnight and morning. Air quality will improve on Tuesday, when a weather system will move across the state and bring increased moisture, clouds, and scattered thunderstorms to eastern Minnesota. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Sensitive groups, such as people with lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, children and older adults, and people who are active outdoors, should limit prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution, such as outdoor burning, and use of residential wood burning devices.

Lisa Pierson, 53, says she and her fiance were sleeping when their cabin on North County Line Road in Sunman went up in flames around 4 a.m.  Barnes says he parked in the driveway and ran up to the home as he shouted, banging all the cabin’s doors to alert everyone inside of the fire.  Barns says he parked in the driveway and ran up to the home as he shouted, banging all the cabin’s doors to alert everyone inside of the fire.  “One of [the doors] happened to be unlocked, so I opened up the door and ran into the house, and started screaming, ‘there’s a fire, we’ve got to get everyone out,’” explained Barnes.  Adrenaline took over, as Barnes says he helped get everyone out of the burning home and to safety.  Within 15 minutes, Barnes says the home was gone.  “I just did what I thought was right,” Barnes said. “We were fortunate to get there at the right time. God was looking out for them, and I was really appreciative of that.”  Pierson says she bought the cabin 10 years ago and was in the middle of remodeling it.  Friday’s early morning fire did more than destroy the cabin, as Pierson explains.  “I can’t replace my father’s things, and that’s what gets me,” Pierson says. “That’s what upsets me. I don’t have the original pictures. His coin collection is all gone, those are things I can’t replace.”  As Pierson’s family grieves the loss of the more than 170-year-old cabin, they’re focused on the journey ahead.  She says they are blessed by Barnes’ kindness and that of others in their tight-knit community to get them through.  “Within five minutes of Caleb waking us, the top story of the house had collapsed,” Pierson explains. “Had it not been for Caleb, I wouldn’t be here today. We’re very grateful we’re alive, very grateful.”  The cause of the fire has not been determined.  See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

Moscow’s forces, meanwhile, struck a building containing psychology and veterinary clinics in the city of Dnipro, in central Ukraine, killing two people and wounding 30, including two children, Ukrainian officials said.  Video released by regional Gov. Serhiy Lysak showed fire engulfing the three-story building that appeared almost destroyed, with only parts of a wall standing, as firefighters battled the flames.  A Russian S-300 missile hit a dam in the Karlivka district of Donetsk province in eastern Ukraine, threatening nearby settlements with flooding.  The town of Graivoron in Russia’s Belgorod region, about 7 kilometers (more than 4 miles) from the Ukrainian border, came under fire for several hours, damaging four houses, a store, a car, a gas pipeline and a power line, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported.  Closer to the frontier, a recreation center, a shop and an empty house were damaged in the village of Glotovo. One woman was wounded when nearby Novaya Tavolzhanka was shelled, Gladkov said.  AP-NORC POLL: Half of U.S. public approves of military aid to Ukraine in 2nd year of war  Earlier this week, the Belgorod region was the target of one of the most serious cross-border attacks from Ukraine since the war began 15 months ago. Details of the raid were murky. Russia blamed the Ukrainian armed forces, but two Russian groups said they were involved, with the aim of bringing down Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Officials in Russia’s southern city of Krasnodar, in the region of the same name bordering Crimea, said two drones struck there. Witnesses told local media they heard something like the sound of a moped and then two explosions.  The blasts smashed a hole in the roof of one building and blew out windows in an apartment building.  “We just went to bed and then there was such a strong, terrible boom,” said resident Tatiana Safonova. “We ran outside. There were people running, but nothing else was going on.”  She said described the sound beforehand “like a growling, noisy moped driving by.”  Krasnodar regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev wrote on Telegram that there were no casualties and that some buildings were damaged but essential infrastructure was unharmed.  Krasnodar Mayor Yevgeny Naumov said a residential building and an office building were damaged.  Drone attacks against Russian border regions have been a regular occurrence since the start of the invasion in February 2022, with attacks increasing last month. Earlier this month, an oil refinery in Krasnodar was attacked by drones on two straight days.  At a meeting in Estonia, German and Baltic leaders played down concerns about fighting spilling over into Russia.  WATCH: The human toll of the battle for Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine  “Russia attacked Ukraine, and so Ukraine can defend itself,” said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “It is clear that the weapons we have delivered will only be used on Ukrainian territory.”  Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas noted that “Ukraine does not have any wish to invade Russia,” and Lithuanian Prime Minster Ingrida Simonyte added: “I’m somewhat puzzled by the worry of Russia, because Russia is at war -– so it’s quite strange to think that the war can only be in that other territory that you invaded.”  Ukraine’s Defense Ministry on Thursday published video that appeared to show a marine drone heading for Russia’s Ivan Khurs reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea. The video didn’t show the drone hitting the ship.  The video followed reports by Russia’s Defense Ministry on Wednesday that Ukraine had launched an unsuccessful attack on the Ivan Khurs using three unmanned speedboats, with all three destroyed prior to reaching the ship. Moscow released video allegedly showing the destruction of one of the marine drones.  At least two civilians were killed and three others wounded in Russian attacks on Ukraine in the previous 24 hours, the Ukrainian president’s office reported Friday.  In Moscow, China’s special envoy Li Hui met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and they exchanged “opinions on the situation around Ukraine and prospects for resolving the conflict,” according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.  Lavrov cited “serious obstacles to the resumption of peace talks created by the Ukrainian side and its Western handlers,” the statement said, but it did not disclose what Li said or proposed.  Li visited Kyiv earlier this month. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government says it’s neutral and wants to serve as mediator in the conflict, but has supported Moscow politically. Beijing released a proposed peace plan in February, but Ukraine’s allies largely dismissed it, insisting that Russian President Vladimir Putin first must withdraw his forces.

Members of the Firefighters Association of the State of New York want to remind everyone of some rules and tips to avoid accidents and injuries.  Experts say before you start cooking, be sure to check the grill for leaks or cracking. Check the tubes along with the propane tank and ensure that your grill is at least 10 feet from your house, garage, or any trees.  According to the U.S. Fire Administration, some 5,700 grill fires take place on residential properties every year, most caused by malfunctioning gas grills. These fires cause an average of $37 million in damage annually to properties, structures and possessions.  Keep the kids away from the grill and never pour or squirt starter fluid onto an open flame.  Use long-handed cooking tools and never leave the grill unattended.  Once you're done cooking, keep your grill clean and free of grease build up that can cause a fire.  “Grilling season is a great time to enjoy friends, family, food and the outdoors, but accidents can happen,” said Michael Treantis, director of Insurance with AAA Western and Central New York. “Before you barbecue, take a few minutes to review grilling safety tips and to ensure your equipment is working properly.”  According to FASNY, there has been an 18 percent rise in ER visits nationwide for grilling related injuries over the past 10 years.

According to Monterey Fire Police Chief Gaudenz Panholzer, crews responded to calls of a structure fire at 1030 Lighthouse Avenue at around 9:48 a.m. Friday. Panholzer said that when crews got there, “they found a fire on the second floor” of the home, which was visible from Lighthouse Avenue.  A man was reportedly inside the home when the fire broke out. Panholzer said the man noticed the fire and tried to put it out using a fire extinguisher. Ultimately unsuccessful, he exited the house uninjured.  Responding crews then “tried to get in and extinguish the fire,” Panholzer said, but also faced difficulty due to the house’s Victorian-era construction. The fire quickly spread to the attic of the house, blocking crews from getting inside.  “We couldn’t get access to the attic because it was very complex inside the house…and we couldn’t find the access point,” Panholzer said.

(David Royal -- Herald Correspondent)  The fire was still burning as of early Friday afternoon, as firefighters stood on the outskirts of the property. Panholzer said that because there were concerns that the house would collapse, crews could not go inside or even get too close to the property.  “We don’t want to put any firefighters in harm’s way,” he said.  Panholzer said crews would be stationed at the house “for several more hours” monitoring the incident and trying to put the fire out.  A historic site for Pacific Grove, the home at 1030 Lighthouse Avenue is known as the LaPorte Mansion. According to city documents, the house was built by banker George Brandt in 1895. The mansion, as well as its gazebo, were featured as the “Pine Island Inn” in the 1959 film “A Summer Place,” starring Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee.  Asked about the mansion’s likelihood of collapse after the fire Friday morning, Panholzer said, “It’s always a risk,” noting that a part of the property had already collapsed on the side closest to Bay View Avenue.  John Kuehl, a building official for the cities of Pacific Grove and Sand City, said that he isn’t sure if the house can be considered a total loss yet.  “Defining what loss is, that’s really hard,” he said, watching the mansion from Lighthouse Avenue Friday afternoon. “So I’m not going to say yes, it’s a total loss (and the property owners) have to tear it down right now. There are some steps we’ll go through in order to get some professionals to establish what’s savable and what’s not.”  Through the incident, the Pacific Grove Police Department closed several roads to the public, including: Lighthouse Avenue from Ridge Road to Bentley Street and 17 Mile Drive from Heacock Avenue to Bay View Avenue.  About 35 firefighters responded to the LaPorte fire, including crews from Monterey Fire, Seaside Fire, CalFire and Presidio of Monterey Fire.  On behalf of Pacific Grove, City Manager Ben Harvey said, “We’re grateful and appreciative for the multi-agency response to the incident.”  “Of course, it’s always sad when you lose a historic structure like the LaPorte Mansion … but we’re grateful for the swift and robust response from our first responders and that there were no injuries,” Harvey said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnRlcmV5aGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI2L2ZpcmUtcmFnZXMtdGhyb3VnaC1wYWNpZmljLWdyb3ZlLXZpY3RvcmlhbtIBWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbnRlcmV5aGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI2L2ZpcmUtcmFnZXMtdGhyb3VnaC1wYWNpZmljLWdyb3ZlLXZpY3Rvcmlhbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire broke out just before 2 a.m. Friday at Rey’s Place, the former Plantation Grindz and before that, Dairy Queen located on Lono Avenue.  “They just started knocking the door, and all they said was, ‘The restaurant!’ And I thought I was late. I said, ‘It’s too early.’ And then they said, ‘No, it’s on fire!” And I was like, ‘What?!’ That was just reaction ... I thought I was dreaming actually,” said restaurant owner Renato Acob.  Images of the fire show flames shooting out of the structure and heavy smoke filling the night sky.  Upon arrival, firefighters said the structure was over 70% involved.  MFD said crews worked to knock down and control the fire for about two hours until they were able to extinguished the blaze just after 4 a.m.  “I want to thank all the first responders who were on the scene and whoever called,” Acob said. “And all our family members and customers for their overwhelming support.”  Officials said the fire caused about $440,000 in damages — about $232,000 to the structure, $175,000 to the contents, and $33,000 for a vehicle that was damaged.  “I was sad, frustrated, but yet at the same time, I’m glad that no one got hurt,” said Acob.  Acob said he and his family spent eight months building his dream business.  “I just thought my passion was food and go for it!” he said. “We call us ‘Team Lono.”  He had a soft opening on April 29th and was planning a grand opening for June.  “The surrounding community, businesses, everyone was so excited. I think they were more excited than me.”  Acob said they served a little bit of everything and he was especially proud of his “smash tacos.”  “Everybody is doing smash burgers. So, we decided to go against the grain and do smash tacos.”  An investigation is underway into what caused the blaze.  For now, Acob plans to operate food trucks and hold an open market with vendors outside his restaurant.  He says he’s not giving up on his dream.  “The fighting spirit lives on!” he said. “We’ll be back.”  If you would like to help him rebuild, click here.  Copyright 2023 Hawaii News Now.

When firefighters arrived on the scene, the plastic building was completely burned away and the contents of the building destroyed, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  Firefighters were sent to 3210 Parkview Drive at about 10:30 a.m. Friday. Bartholomew County Emergency Operations Dispatch Center received a report that several explosions were occurring within the storage building.  When firefighters arrived on the scene, the building had burned away and the items within the building were still on fire, Wilson said. Firefighters heard the sound of aerosol cans exploding from within the debris. Firefighters pulled a fire hose to the rear of the residence and extinguished the flames within a short amount of time using a minimal amount of water. The fire was isolated to the storage building and did not cause damage to the home.  Columbus Fire Department Investigators spoke with the property owners and inquired if any items in the building were capable of creating a heat source. According to fire investigators, no persons had been in the building during the last 24 hours and no known heat sources were identified. Investigators combed through the debris to look for any indication of fire cause. No cause was determined due in part to the amount of fire damage and the destruction of the building materials.  Damage to the building and contents is estimated at $4,000.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include the Columbus Police Department and the Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Service. The official cause of fire is listed as undetermined.

(WYMT) - After a fire destroyed a tire shop on Sunday, the owner is left to pick up the pieces.  Owner of Crowe Tire & Battery James Crowe was out of the country when he received calls saying his store was on fire.  “And then seeing all of that, it was pretty rough too. As we sit on where we was at, we had to sit there and look at it on Facebook and people calling, messages,” he said.  Weekday broadcast of WYMT Mountain News First at Four  However, the tire shop is back in its original location on Allais Rd.  Crowe said he originally bought the building in 1999 and stayed for more than a decade until they outgrew it.  “We stayed here until 2011, I bought the property at the other location and then got the garage built, got everything remodeled and built and moved into it April 7, 2012 and we have been there until now,” he explained.  He said that he still owned the building despite leaving 12 years ago.  Crowe said he was surprised that after the fire, the building was still standing.  “As much damage that was done to that building, it is hard to believe that it burnt the trusts off of the building, but the wood floors, the tires were on are still there. You tell me how that happened, I mean that is just the Lord’s will, I guess, I do not know, but the Lord is with us, he has brought us this far and we know that we are going to be okay,” he explained.  Despite the struggles, Crowe said that they are not going anywhere.  “There are rumors going around on Facebook, ‘Well they are gone, they are out.’ We are not out, we are down but we are not out,” he said.  Even though the building is a loss, Crowe said that will not stop him.  “We are going to rebuild, there are not going to be no if’s, and’s or but’s about it... We are coming back,” he explained.  Without all of the love and support, Crowe said that this would not be possible.  “I am thankful for all of the customers that I have gotten, all of the friends and people that reached out to us. By text, message, call, stops, hugs, all of the prayers... It means a lot,” he said.  Crowe said that with help from the community, he will take things one day at a time.  Copyright 2023 WYMT.

Fire officials have asked Hamilton County’s health and building departments to inspect the building.  Beechmont Avenue was shut down in the area for 90 minutes after fire crews responded around 6 a.m. Friday. A passerby reported seeing smoke coming from the building.  A firefighter went to the hospital with a minor ankle injury during the response.  Multiple other fire agencies came to assist, including Cincinnati and Mariemont, according to the Anderson Fire Department.  Firefighters quickly knocked down the bulk of the blaze, which was contained in the kitchen and its exhaust system, Anderson fire officials said.  There is a good amount of smoke damage in the restaurant’s dining room and at the other businesses in the shopping center.  One of the businesses damaged was Gloss Salon, according to the salon’s Human Resource Operator Carol Sutto.  “I got a call at 6:30 a.m. from my daughter, who’s the owner, saying you won’t believe it, the salon is on fire,” said Sutto. “I said, ‘On fire on fire,’ and she said, ‘Yes, the restaurant next door, Pelican Reef, had a fire and it is affecting the salon as well.’”  The team at Gloss found out the smoke damage was so strong they would have to close their doors for the foreseeable future and replace most of their inventory, Sutto added.

The fire covers a couple of acres inside the landfill near Highway 3 in Dundas, near Faribault and Northfield. It was discovered earlier this week.  RELATED: Rice County landfill fire continues smoldering 2 days later, remains closed to the public  “It’s been horrible when the wind was blowing on Wednesday, it was all foggy,” said Jane DeGrott, who lives nearby, describing the smoke that surrounded her home. “The dogs were hacking; my cats were hacking.”  DeGrott began setting up earlier this week for her yard sale, wondering if anyone would come on Friday if the smoke remained.  The wind on Friday blew the smoke from the landfill fire in a different direction, away from DeGroot’s yard sale, which was a welcomed sight.  “Loaded up the car with trash, cleaned out the garage right because it’s spring,” said Judy Jones, who drove to the landfill but didn’t know about it being closed to residents due to the fire.  “When trash burns, I always worry about the burning plastics, the carcinogens and the chemicals and so on,” Jones said.  “We have had somebody go out to all the properties within half a mile of the landfill, just to do some spot checking around,” said Julie Runkel, Rice County Environmental Services director. “He’s not getting much for readings, which is good.”  Runkel stress if someone does have health concerns and they smell smoke, they should take necessary precautions.  Rice County has been working with experts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for advice on battling fires at a landfill, by using soil to smother the hot spots and flames.  “We also wanted to confirm that we are attacking the fire in the correct manner, that was confirmed, that we were doing what we could to put out,” Runkel said.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but Rice County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Josh Malecha initially said it’s likely the combustion source came from materials brought to the landfill, such as hot ash or lithium-ion batteries. He added the smoke carries an unpleasant smell, particularly downwind.  According to the county, it is “difficult to predict” when the fire will be completely out.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]  Channel 2′s Steve Gehlbach went to the home in Chamblee on Friday to speak to witnesses and first responders about what happened.  Chamblee police and DeKalb Fire Rescue responded to the call this morning, heading to fire at the home on Hardee Avenue around 5:15 a.m.  After the fire, it looks like everything inside has collapsed, save the stone walls that are still standing.  The homeowner, Celestino Vasquez, said he woke up to a loud explosion in the middle of the night.  “I didn’t see nothing,” Vasquez told Channel 2 Action News. “After the explosion, it was very dark, no light.”  Around 2 a.m., Vasquez told Gehlbach that he lost power so he went to his vehicle.  After three hours, Vasquez was told by his neighbor the house was on fire. He was sitting in his truck, parked in the driveway.  “I hear somebody call, say hey, and saw the fire,” Vasquez said.  No one else was inside the home and Vasquez wasn’t hurt, but one of the firefighters responding to the home was.  TRENDING STORIES:  While battling the fire from Vasquez’s backyard, one of the firefighters fell down some steps. He was taken to the hospital for treatment of a minor back injury.  “He was working outside the structure and tripped over one of the hose lines and went down two to three steps,” Battalion Chief Patrick Holcomb told Channel 2 Action News.  The firefighter should be fine, he was treated and already released.  A fire investigator stayed at the house, working to find the exact cause of the fire and determine if it was sparked by the initial explosion Vasquez heard, and if so, what that was.

Dramatic video of the fire was captured on video.  There were no injuries, but the home was a total loss, fire officials added.  Early reports, however, had claimed ""multiple people,"" including ""a child"" were trapped inside, however, this proved to be incorrect police and firefighters said.

Much of the home's roof appeared to have been blown or burnt off, with debris littering the yard.  The fire, authorities said, was caused by contractors who ruptured the underground natural gas line with an excavator, setting off the powerful explosion. The contractors escaped without injury and SEMCO Gas Company shut down the gas line which had been fueling a large flame.  Chesterfield firefighters said they eventually were able to safely extinguish the fire with help from other fire departments, including crews from nearby New Baltimore, Macomb, New Haven and Selfridge Air National Guard Base.

Santiago/Getty Images  INSURERS ON DEFENSE — Foreign-based insurers are getting a taste of the anti-ESG medicine that Republican policymakers have been serving to U.S. financial firms, and they’re clearly not enjoying it.  European insurers are pulling out of the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance over concerns that red states’ antitrust allegations could hurt their businesses. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the group was holding a meeting to discuss recent departures, a week after 23 Republican attorneys general sent letters to members of the group raising antitrust concerns.  The UN is pushing back: “Regardless of the situation, UNEP reaffirms its conviction ever since it initiated, convened, and launched the NZIA — that in order to successfully tackle the climate emergency, there is a fundamental and urgent need for collaboration, not just individual action,” the UN Environment Programme said Wednesday.  And regardless of the legal merits of the antitrust argument, it makes sense that insurers would be spooked in the same vein as Vanguard, which pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative last year in the wake of similar threats. They may be worried about jeopardizing their business in the U.S., one lawyer said.  “There’s a new cost to these initiatives that I think people are now starting to factor in and wonder if they are worthwhile,” said Lance Dial, a partner with K&L Gates’ asset management and investment funds practice. “There was a thinking three years ago that this was a great Good Housekeeping seal of approval…. But now there’s a downside that’s become very apparent with the U.S. state actions.”  Meanwhile, the medicine continues being spooned out in Texas, as Jordan reports. The state Legislature sent Gov. Greg Abbott (R) a bill this week that would bar insurers in the state from considering environmental, social and governance factors in setting rates.  It’d be the first anti-ESG bill to go after the insurance industry. Environmentalists aren’t sure how it would actually work, but the intent is clear.  “It’s very difficult to evaluate what this law would actually do because it appears to ban a practice that insurance companies aren’t actually undertaking,” said Jordan Haedtler, a consultant with the Sunrise Project. “That said, I don’t want to suggest that the bill has no impact whatsoever, because I do think it is still sending a clear signal to insurance companies that they should ignore risk factors that are material to their business.”    A message from American Beverage Association: At America’s beverage companies, we are committed to reducing our plastic footprint.

WASHINGTON WATCH  DOE DISCONNECTS — The Energy Department this week pulled out of an electronics industry group that sets sustainability standards for cell phones, Jordan reports .  DOE said the group was dragging its feet on updating its standards, which haven’t changed since 2017. Sandra Cannon, a sustainable procurement staffer at the agency, withdrew in a remarkably plain-spoken email:  “We presently have mobile phones being registered to a standard that is 5 years old,” she wrote to Underwriters Laboratories, the company that owns the standard. “That is not sufficient to keep up with the speed of the mobile phone industry or purchaser needs for products that meet relevant sustainability and climate change mitigation goals.”  A right-to-repair advocate also dropped out on Tuesday. EPA is still in the group and said it doesn’t plan to leave “at this time.”    Sustainable Finance  MANAGING EXPECTATIONS — BlackRock investors are pushing back against the idea that the $9 trillion asset management firm should take an active role in decarbonizing “the real economy,” Ben Lefebvre reports.  At the company’s annual meeting on Wednesday, shareholders owning about 90 percent of its stock voted against a resolution that would have had the world’s largest asset manager compile a report “specifying whether and how BlackRock could improve its pension fund clients’ investment returns, by focusing its climate-related investment stewardship and proxy voting to ‘engineer decarbonization in the real economy.’”  CEO Larry Fink, in explaining management’s opposition to the idea, said it was BlackRock’s job to serve clients and not push for one particular strategy: “Our role is not to engineer real-world decarbonization,” Fink said at the event. “Our job is to help each and every client navigate investment, risks and opportunities associated with a [energy] transition.”    AROUND THE NATION  OIL OFFSETS — Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) signed a bill Tuesday that authorizes state land to be used for carbon offset credits. Dunleavy’s administration previously told us that he was motivated by interest from in-state oil and gas giants looking to offset their emissions.  One interesting thing about this law: A lot of environmental groups didn’t want to talk about it! The Nature Conservancy didn’t respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Sierra Club. Earthjustice, Earthworks and Alaska Wild also didn’t care to weigh in.  But Freya Chay, program manager at CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes different climate solutions, wrote that the program “could produce carbon credits that don’t represent real climate benefits.”  Further south, legislation in California that would compel the nation’s two largest pension funds to divest from fossil fuels by 2031 passed the Senate 22-10 in a floor vote on Thursday.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  The May 16 fire in a Goose Hollow neighborhood apartment building led to several residents needing rescue from the five-story building. Smoke from the fire also blanketed large parts of Portland and shut down I-405 for several hours.  In a statement, the Portland Police Bureau said it had arrested a resident of the May Apartments, 30-year-old Garrett A. Repp, in connection with the blaze. Repp is in custody at the Multnomah County Detention Center on two charges of first degree arson, 18 charges of recklessly endangering another person and 11 charges of first-degree criminal mischief.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Court records show Repp had been evicted from unit 310 of the building in March because he hadn’t paid $3,405 in rent and late fees owed from December through February. Repp continued to live in the apartment after the eviction notice as the property owners amended his move out date, according to the court records, but the court issued an order to the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office on May 10 to forcibly remove him from the building.  Criminal court records also show Repp was cited in April for trespassing into the home of another person at an apartment building a few blocks away from the May Apartments. According to that citation, Portland police officers entered an apartment at the building after being called and “saw a man hiding in crouched position in the corner of the room behind the bed. The man identified himself as Garrett Repp.”  Prosecutors charged Repp with criminal trespass in the case and he was ordered to not have contact with the person who owned the apartment.  Smoke rises from an apartment fire in Southwest Portland, Ore., on May 16, 2023, in this provided photo from Portland Fire & Rescue. Courtesy of Portland Fire & Rescue  The Portland Fire Investigation Unit has been investigating the May Apartments fire’s cause, which severely damaged several floors of the more than 100-year-old building, since it happened. Firefighters previously said the fire had started on the top floors of the apartment, but it was not initially clear if it had begun in Repp’s former unit.  Fire officials said the top floors of the May Apartments were gutted by the fire, and lower floors in the 42-unit building had significant water damage. Firefighters have said the building’s owner will need to have a structural engineer assess the apartments to see if they are safe to stay up.  In the months leading up to the fire, city staff and firefighters had responded to the May Apartments several times for false fire alarms and safety issues. City inspectors had been to the building as recently as the day before the fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzI2L3BvcnRsYW5kLXBvbGljZS1hcnJlc3QtYXJzb24tc3VzcGVjdC1pbi1nb29zZS1ob2xsb3ctbmVpZ2hib3Job29kLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNS8yNi9wb3J0bGFuZC1wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LWFyc29uLXN1c3BlY3QtaW4tZ29vc2UtaG9sbG93LW5laWdoYm9yaG9vZC1hcGFydG1lbnQtZmlyZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-26","14:00:00","{""Paradise"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T19:52:29","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A judge ruled Friday that the U.S. government can keep using chemical retardant to fight wildfires, despite finding that the practice pollutes streams in western states in violation of federal law.  The ruling from U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen in Montana came after environmentalists sued the U.S. Forest Service dropping the red slurry material into waterways hundreds of times over the past decade.  Government officials say chemical fire retardant is sometimes crucial to slowing the advance of dangerous blazes. Wildfires across North America have grown bigger and more destructive over the past two decades as climate change warms the planet.  Christensen said halting the use of fire retardant would “conceivably result in greater harm from wildfires — including to human life and property and to the environment.”  More than 200 loads of retardant got into waterways over the past decade. Federal officials say those situations usually occurred by mistake and in less than 1% of the thousands of loads annually.  A coalition that includes Paradise, California — where a 2018 blaze killed 85 people and destroyed the town — had said a court ruling that stopped the use of retardant would have put lives, homes and forests at risk.  WATCH: What we know about toxic ‘forever chemicals’ and how to reduce our exposure  “This case was very personal for us,” Paradise Mayor Greg Bolin said. “Our brave firefighters need every tool in the toolbox to protect human lives and property against wildfires, and today’s ruling ensures we have a fighting chance this fire season.”  State and local agencies often depend heavily on the U.S. Forest Service to help fight fires, many of which originate or include federal land.  The Oregon-based group Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics argued in its lawsuit filed last year that the Forest Service was disregarding the Clean Water Act by continuing to use retardant without taking adequate precautions to protect streams and rivers.  The judge said the ruling was limited to 10 western states where the members of the group alleged they had suffered harm due to pollution into waterways that they use.  After the lawsuit was filed the Forest Service applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for a permit that would allow it to continue using retardant without breaking the law. That process could take years. Christensen ordered federal officials to report every six months on their progress.  Experts say climate change, people moving into fire-prone areas, and overgrown forests are creating more catastrophic megafires that are harder to fight.  More than 100 million gallons (378 million liters) of fire retardant were used during the past decade, according to the Department of Agriculture. It’s made up of water and other ingredients including fertilizers or salts that can be harmful to fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic animals.  A government study found misapplied retardant could adversely affect dozens of imperiled species, including crawfish, spotted owls and fish such as shiners and suckers.  Health risks to firefighters or other people who come into contact with fire retardant are considered low, according to a 2021 risk assessment.  Forest Service officials said they are trying to come into compliance with the law by getting a pollution permit but that could take years.  As the 2023 fire season gets underway, California Forestry Association President Matt Dias said the prospect of not having fire retardant available to a federal agency that plays a key role on many blazes was “terrifying.”  Many areas of the Western U.S. experienced heavy snowfalls this past winter, and as a result fire dangers are lower than in recent years across much of the region.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBicy5vcmcvbmV3c2hvdXIvbmF0aW9uL2p1ZGdlLXNheXMtZmlyZS1yZXRhcmRhbnQtZHJvcHMtYXJlLXBvbGx1dGluZy1zdHJlYW1zLWJ1dC1hbGxvd3MtdXNlLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVl0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9hbXAvbmF0aW9uL2p1ZGdlLXNheXMtZmlyZS1yZXRhcmRhbnQtZHJvcHMtYXJlLXBvbGx1dGluZy1zdHJlYW1zLWJ1dC1hbGxvd3MtdXNlLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Read more  The Philadelphia Fire Department placed a two-alarm blaze at a junkyard at 61st Street and Passyunk Avenue under control after just over an hour of firefighting Friday.  The fire broke out at the Southwest Philadelphia junkyard late Friday morning. Firefighters were dispatched to the scene about 10:47 a.m., and arrived within three minutes, Fire Commissioner Adam Thiel said.  Several cars appeared to be part of the blaze, and residents nearby reported seeing plumes of black smoke coming from the area. Thiel was not able to definitively quantify the size of the blaze, but said it measured about “20 cars by 20 cars by 10 cars.”  The fire was elevated to a two-alarm incident just after 11 a.m., prompting a response from about 50 vehicles and other firefighting apparatuses, as well as more than 75 firefighters, Thiel said. Before crews arrived, workers at the junkyard used heavy equipment to create firebreaks to help contain the blaze.  “The salvage yard crew really did help us out before we got here,” Thiel said.  Advertisement  Crews placed the fire under control at about 12:15 p.m. The cause of the blaze will remain undetermined until fire marshals are able to process the scene.  The Philadelphia Department of Public Health said it had dispatched inspectors to the area to collect air samples and assess air quality near the blaze. Those samples were sent to the Air Management Services Laboratory late Friday afternoon, and definitive results were expected by Saturday. Mobile monitoring did not identify any airborne toxic compounds “at levels that would harm human health” on Friday, the health department said.  The department advised that area residents who are normally impacted by poor air quality should avoid going outside, close their windows, and consider wearing a mask if they encounter difficulty breathing. Groups that may be affected by poor air quality could include children, elderly individuals, pregnant people, and those with respiratory or heart conditions.  Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who represents the district where the junkyard is located, encouraged residents on Twitter to “keep your windows closed and avoid the area.” Councilmember Kenyatta Johnson, who represents the surrounding 2nd District, advised travelers to “be aware of traffic tie-ups in the area.”  The city’s Department of Licenses and Inspections was slated to reinspect the junkyard on June 2 after having found three violations during an earlier inspection. It will be inspected once the scene is released by the fire department, L&I spokesperson Shemeka Moore said.  In July, there was another junkyard fire in the area that prompted similar warnings. Records did not indicate the junkyard that experienced Friday’s fire was the same one that burned last year, Moore said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9qdW5reWFyZC1maXJlLXNvdXRod2VzdC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtMjAyMzA1MjYuaHRtbNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9qdW5reWFyZC1maXJlLXNvdXRod2VzdC1waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEtMjAyMzA1MjYuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  YORK, Pa. — A York County fire company has added a new piece of technology designed to provide real-time updates of nearby fire emergencies to drivers.  Safety Cloud by HAAS Alert protects first responders and enhances driver compliance with Move Over laws by sending real-time notifications when approaching active responders en-route or on-scene, the West Manchester Township Fire Department said in a press release.  The equipment has been added to all West Manchester Township Fire Department apparatus, Fire Chief Clifton Laughman said in the release.  ""The Safety Cloud service will help to reduce the risk of drivers colliding with first responders and workers in the field by providing advance warning of their presence and adding a digital component to lights and sirens that they’re less likely to miss,"" the fire department said.  Safety Cloud’s digital alerting works by sending real-time notifications to nearby drivers, warning them of the presence of emergency vehicles and road workers. This advanced warning system significantly reduces the chance of collisions by up to 90%, ensuring the safety of both first responders and motorists, according to the department.  While Pennsylvania’s Move Over laws require drivers to slow down and move one lane over when approaching active emergency vehicles, many drivers still react slowly or fail to move over, the fire department said. Safety Cloud alerts give drivers up to 30 seconds of advance warning to help solve this problem.  Drivers can receive the alerts through the Waze navigation app and Apple Maps, available on mobile devices and in the dashboard of many newer-model vehicles.  Safety Cloud alerts are also now delivered to the infotainment screen of millions of vehicles through a partnership with global automaker Stellantis.  Drivers of 2018 and newer models of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Alfa Romeo vehicles will receive Safety Cloud alerts through the new EVAS (Emergency Vehicle Alert System) feature.  Vehicles using FordSync, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto will also have the service, the fire department said.  HAAS Alert is continuing to work on expanding the alerts to other services and vehicles so that all drivers can receive these critical road safety alerts.  “We’re excited to add another level of protection for our firefighters in order to make sure they are able to do their jobs as safely as possible,” said Laughman. ""This service connects and protects our crews in the field and the drivers around them by giving motorists extra time to see us, slow down, and move over safely.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g0My5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3lvcmstY291bnR5L3dlc3QtbWFuY2hlc3Rlci10b3duc2hpcC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtc2FmZXR5LWNsb3VkLWhhYXMvNTIxLTk3YzlhMzc3LTUxYmQtNDM5Mi1hMjI2LWY2ZDNmZjlmMDNjYdIBnAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3g0My5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC95b3JrLWNvdW50eS93ZXN0LW1hbmNoZXN0ZXItdG93bnNoaXAtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXNhZmV0eS1jbG91ZC1oYWFzLzUyMS05N2M5YTM3Ny01MWJkLTQzOTItYTIyNi1mNmQzZmY5ZjAzY2E?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Durango"", ""Durango"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-25T11:00:42","Agencies gathered Wednesday for training on aerial resources  ×  Rotors and propellers sat at ease Wednesday as firefighters from a long list of agencies learned about one another’s aerial firefighting resources at the Durango Air Tanker Base at Durango-La Plata County Airport. The base opened for the season May 15, and will remain open, staffed and prepared to respond to fires through Sept. 29.  Personnel from the San Juan Nation Forest, which operates the base, were joined by firefighters from the Durango, Los Pinos and Upper Pine Fire Protection Districts, as well as the Bureau of Land Management, the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control, Flight For Life, Durango-La Plata County Airport, Bureau of Indian Affairs Ute Mountain Ute fire agency and Mesa Verde Interagency Helitack.  The “show-and-tell” style fly-in allowed firefighters to circulate briefing stations at each agency’s aerial vehicles, which were neatly arranged around the base’s tarmac.  ×  The impressive array of planes, helicopters and drones is unique to such a rural area, said San Juan National Forest spokeswoman Lorena Williams.  On June 5, two single-engine air tankers will arrive at the base in case of fire this season. Each has a capacity of 800 gallons fire retardant or water. The state agency has a large air tanker under contract, which can fly down to the base if needed.  Assistant Air Tanker Base Manager Dave Hautamaki said the base can host five to six large air tankers, each with a capacity of 3,000 to 4,000 gallons.  As stakeholders place an increasing emphasis on interagency collaboration, leaders at those agencies say events such as the fly-in are critical in enabling personnel to work together.  ×  Logan Davis, battalion chief with the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control, said the day is “huge” for coordination and allows firefighters to know “what air attack needs to hear from ground personnel so that when you are the ground personnel on the other side of the radio talking to an airplane that is somewhere in the sky that you can’t see, you can know how to describe to them your location, what you would like to see from them, and vice versa.”  “This area is pretty unusual in the amount of cooperation between agencies,” said DFPD Wildfire Battalion Chief Scott Nielsen, standing in the shade under the wing of the aerial supervision aircraft.  Perhaps the biggest advancement in aerial firefighting resources is the increasing dependence on unmanned aerial systems – or drones.  ×  Dan Paladino and Tyler Hoest, the two drone pilots with the Columbine Wildland Fire Module, said the fly-in gives them the opportunity to discuss the UAS program with firefighters who are not yet used to working with drones.  The drones, which cost less than 10% of what a helicopter with similar capabilities would cost, allow firefighters to map and even set fire remotely. Unlike their piloted counterparts, drones can fly at night and can travel through thick smoke.  But, drones are also new to firefighting – the Columbine Wildland Fire Module was the first Forest Service fire crew in the country to start using drones back in 2019.  “We’re trying to educate people on the capabilities, the limitations and how we operate within the manned aviation airspace and how we do that as safely as possible,” Hoest said. “That’s our main mission, is to deconflict with other manned assets that are in the air so we don’t crash this thing into a helicopter.”  ×  After last year’s fruitful monsoon and the abundant snow that followed, fire officials are not as concerned about this year’s wildfire season as compared with some in recent memory.  Still, Nielsen said, the drought season to come will likely affect the availability of ground fuels, determining the severity of wildfire impacts.  rschafir@durangoherald.com  This article has been updated to accurately reflect the organization for whom Logan Davis works.

The small cottage at 18 West Shore Road in Hancock is owned by Hancock Point LLC, which according to town records shares an address with Eliot Cutler’s brother, Cape Elizabeth resident Joel Cutler.  The fire came two weeks after the former gubernatorial candidate was sentenced May 4 to serve 9 months in jail for possession of child pornography.  The 1,100-square-foot shorefront house, which is listed on weekly vacation rental websites, was being rented when the fire broke out on Friday, Hancock Fire Chief Chris Holmes said. The fire was reported by a passerby at around 2:40 p.m. but the renters had left the property at around 9:30 that morning to go sightseeing.  The house, originally built in 1875 and renovated in 1991, was destroyed, Holmes said. Approximately 40 firefighters from Hancock and seven other nearby towns responded, but much of it already was engulfed in flames by the time the first firefighters arrived.  “It was very windy,” Holmes said. “Half the house was fully involved by the time our first units got there.”  It took firefighters more than three hours to extinguish the flames. No one was hurt, Holmes said, and a garage and nearby homes were spared any damage.  The state fire marshal’s office and the owner’s insurance company still are looking into what may have caused the fire, the chief said. There was no wood stove in the house.  “There’s nothing suspicious at this time,” Holmes said. “They’re still investigating if it was an accident or an act of God.”  Eliot Cutler’s parents, former Bangor residents Lawrence and Kay Cutler, bought the house in 1966, a couple of months before Eliot Cutler turned 20 years old. Lawrence Cutler died in 1984 and Kay Cutler died in 2003.  A few months after Kay Cutler died, their three sons — Eliot and his younger brothers Joel and Josh — transferred ownership of the 0.9-acre property to Hancock Point LLC. Joel Cutler is listed in town records as the point of contact for the legal entity.  When Kay Cutler died 20 years ago, the property had a total assessed value of $378,000. Last year, the combined assessed value of the land and the cottage was $1.35 million.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdvcmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9uZXdzL2hhbmNvY2svZWxpb3QtY3V0bGVycy1mb3JtZXItZmFtaWx5LWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Waupun Fire Department said in a news release that crews responded to the complex at 1106 Rock Ave. at 1:15 p.m. Wednesday for the report of a fire in a second-floor apartment.  When firefighters arrived, they found the fire had spread to a second apartment and into the eaves, which stretched the length of the building. Crews were notified everyone had exited the building safely.  Firefighters removed portions of the ceilings of four units because the fire had spread into the attic. The release said crews had the majority of the fire under control in 45 minutes but firefighters remained on scene for more than three hours checking for hotspots.  The 16-unit, two-story apartment building is owned by Integrity Investments, Inc., based in Brookfield. The building sustained significant damage to two units and to portions of the roof’s structure, the department said, adding four other units were damaged as a result of water and overhaul operations.  A Family Assistance Center was set up at the Waupun Senior Center for the 22 residents while 19 were being assisted by the American Red Cross.

Another individual told police they had seen a teen running away from the building, carrying a white bag. She identified Gray in a lineup, but did not mention she knew Gray.  A third individual reported they had sold Gray gasoline and a red gasoline jug prior to the fire.  In the early hours of March 25, 1993, a fire broke out near the rear steps of an apartment building on Chicago’s South Side, killing McGuinness and Mesa.  Police located Gray after the fire, and interrogated him for seven hours before he confessed. He later recanted that confession, saying he yielded to police pressure, according to prosecutors.  The individual who said that Gray had purchased gasoline and a milk jug prior to the fire also recanted her identification, saying she was pressured by police. She said that police had told her she misidentified an individual in a lineup, and then allowed her identification to stand when she identified Gray.  The witness who told police that Gray had threatened her also recanted, saying she was “coached” by police and prosecutors.  Other chemical evidence cited by prosecutors, including “alligator charring” and “high-boiling petroleum distillate,” was also dismissed after further study cast doubt on the former’s presence when a chemical accelerant is used, and the latter because of its regular presence in household chemicals, as well as the difficulty with which it ignites, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.  Following the new testimony and evidence, prosecutors requested a new trial, but were turned down by a judge. In 2017, prosecutors and attorneys agreed to dismiss the case and vacate the conviction.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWFuLWV4b25lcmF0ZWQtaW4tMTk5My1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmUtbXVyZGVyLWF3YXJkZWQtMjctbWlsbGlvbi1ieS1mZWRlcmFsLWp1cnkvMzE0OTA1OS_SAYIBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjY2hpY2Fnby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tYW4tZXhvbmVyYXRlZC1pbi0xOTkzLWNoaWNhZ28tZmlyZS1tdXJkZXItYXdhcmRlZC0yNy1taWxsaW9uLWJ5LWZlZGVyYWwtanVyeS8zMTQ5MDU5Lz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We all seem to help each other out, we all have times where we’re short people. The group we have in Addison County is top notch.”  — New Haven Fire Chief Alan Mayer  NEW HAVEN — Vermont State Police on Thursday arrested Gary McIntyre, 77, of New Haven on a charge of first degree arson following an investigation of a house fire that occurred off Route 7 near Hunt Road on Wednesday evening.  No one was home at the time of the fire, though state police identified the victim as Diann McIntyre, 76, of New Haven. Route 7 was closed for less than three hours as firefighters contained the blaze, which resulted in the death of one cat but no other injuries.  The Independent could not immediately determine if the man charged with arson is related to the woman identified by state police as the victim.  The New Haven Volunteer Fire Department was called to action around 6:19 p.m. on Wednesday evening. New Haven Fire Chief Mayer was the first on the scene, and said crews from Vergennes, Middlebury, Bristol and Weybridge were also called to help contain the structure fire.  Mayer said once on the scene, firefighters worked efficiently to contain the blaze.  “It actually went very well. We had heavy fire coming out one window on the front of the house, we were able to hit that very quick, knock that down,” he said of the effort. “We had plenty of manpower.”  The fire chief noted damage to the home was substantial.  “The house basically is a total loss. It’s still standing but there is significant damage,” he said.  Mayer credited the support of other local departments in helping to successfully put out the blaze.  “I really can’t say enough about the mutual aid system. We all seem to help each other out, we all have times where we’re short people. The group we have in Addison County is top notch,” he said. “Something we all should be proud of.”  On Wednesday, Mayer contacted the Vermont State Police’s Department of Public Safety Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit to help determine the origin and cause of the fire. State police conducted a scene examination and determined the fire was caused by direct human involvement.  When the Independent spoke with Mayer on Thursday morning, he said state police were wrapping up their investigation of the incident.  “It is a very suspicious fire. They’re pretty sure they know what the cause was,” he said.  State police’s investigation showed that McIntyre had intentionally set the fire. The New Haven resident was arrested in Burlington on Thursday and cited to appear in Addison County Superior Court on Aug. 21 to answer to the charge of first degree arson.  State police ask that anyone with information regarding this incident contact Detective Sgt. James Wright at the New Haven barracks at 802-388-4919. Individuals can also contact the Vermont Arson Tip Award Program at 800-32-ARSON.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkZGlzb25pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9zdXNwaWNpb3VzLWZpcmUtZGFtYWdlcy1uZXctaGF2ZW4taG9tZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Firefighters were dispatched to Cavender’s house in Charleston, W.Va., and arrived five minutes later. Preparing to douse the fire, they tapped the closest hydrant but got no water. They tried another — nothing. Then a third — nothing still.  So Cavender watched as the flames destroyed his home and killed his dog, a four-year-old brindle boxer named Duke, in what his lawyer described as “a devastating personal experience.”  Now, Cavender, 40, is suing West Virginia American Water, the water utility that serves West Virginia’s capital of some 47,000 residents. In a lawsuit filed Monday in Kanawha County Circuit Court, he alleges that American Water was negligent when it did not ensure there was strong enough water pressure to serve the hydrants. His lawyer, Mike Hissam, told The Washington Post that those hydrants still don’t work, endangering an unknown number of residents.  “People are scared to death up there,” Hissam said.  In a statement released four days after the fire, the company said the three hydrants had last passed inspection in July. After the fire, it pulled them out of service, met with city officials to talk about “concerns related to fire hydrants” and agreed to work with the fire department to find any others that might “produce insufficient flow.” American Water declined to comment Wednesday on Cavender’s allegations and did not respond to a question about whether the hydrants had been fixed.  Advertisement  “West Virginia American Water is committed to working alongside the City of Charleston and the Charleston Fire Department to remedy any issues with the three fire hydrants of concern and have them back into service as soon as possible,” the company said in the statement.  On May 5, Cavender was entertaining friends, Hissam said. That night, he turned on his propane-fueled fire pit on his back deck for the first time of the season. After letting it run for about 1½ hours, he called it a night and shut it off. The fire pit made a “weird click” and “wasn’t acting right,” Hissam said.  “Next thing he knew, it was engulfed in flames,” he added.  Cavender, the executive director of a nonprofit who moonlights as a school board member, snatched his fire extinguisher, but it didn’t work, Hissam said. He called 911, and firefighters showed up about five minutes later prepared to save his house, only to scramble around the neighborhood in a futile search for a hydrant that worked, the suit states. Eventually, a nearby volunteer fire department and Air National Guard firefighters helped by supplying their Charleston counterparts with water tankers.  Advertisement  “That relief came too late for Mr. Cavender,” the suit alleges. “By that time, the heavy smoke had turned into an uncontrollable blaze.”  As Cavender and others watched his house turn into an inferno, Duke slipped a friend’s grasp and darted back inside. Cavender and a friend gave chase. Once inside, they repeatedly yelled the dog’s name and searched the house until the smoke and flames forced them to retreat.  “It was chaos,” Hissam said.  Hours later, firefighters tamed the blaze, which has forced Cavender to stay at a hotel while scrambling to find a place to rent.  Several days after the fire, workers with a debris removal company called Cavender to tell him they’d found Duke’s remains, which Cavender later identified. He and his two sons are wrecked by the death of their dog, who was also beloved by neighbors, Hissam said.  Advertisement  “Neighborhood families enjoyed seeing Duke’s wagging tongue as he hopped up and down on his hind legs at the fence as they walked by,” the suit states.  A day after the fire, Charleston Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin commended the Charleston Fire Department for responding with “urgency and purpose” while decrying their hydrant-caused hindrance as unacceptable, WCHS reported.  “Rest assured, the City and our Fire Department will ensure West Virginia American Water takes all steps necessary to make sure hydrants across the city are in good working order. Doing so is paramount to public safety and the safety of our firefighters,” Goodwin said, according to WSAZ.  American Water wrapped the nonfunctional hydrants in plastic garbage bags after the fire and has started digging up city streets to handle a problem “that should have been fixed a long time ago,” Hissam said. The city grants the company a monopoly and will pay $160,000 this year to provide water to residents, the suit states, and in exchange, the company must do so reliably.  “That’s the deal,” Hissam said.

While no people suffered any injuries, three pets — a dog, a turtle and a lizard — died in the fire at the Stoney Brook Village complex, according to Fire Chief Rick Barrett.  ""Initial indications is that it is probably electrical,"" he said of the fire's probable cause. ""It's not suspicious in any way. It's already been deemed accidental.""  Firefighters responded to 30 Stoneybrook Drive at 9:24 a.m. after receiving several 911 calls about smoke coming from the building. When they arrived, there was smoke and fire coming from the third floor.  All residents were out of the building and firefighters began an ""aggressive attack"" on the fire.

Three-pointers threaten to make it go the distance.  The Boston Celtics found their way to the NBA Finals last year with a stingy, opportunistic defense and a steady cascade of three-pointers. It would appear they have captured that combination once again to keep their hopes of a second appearance alive.  Disorganized and distracted four days ago, the Celtics have climbed out of a 3-0 hole with two consecutive wins over the Miami Heat, forcing a Game 6 in South Florida on Saturday.  Final score: 110-97. The Celtics wasted no time building a double-digit lead. They led by 15 at the end of the first quarter and the margin remained 15 or better in the second half until the waning minutes.  The Celtics made 9 of 20 three-pointers in the second half of Game 4 to avoid a sweep and bounce back from a six-point halftime deficit. They also feasted on nine second-half Miami turnovers, committing only two themselves.  Rinse, repeat in Game 5. Starting with Bam Adebayo on the game's first possession, the Heat turned the ball over five times in the first seven minutes, gifting Boston 10 points off of them. The Celtics, meanwhile, maintained their long-range sharp shooting, hitting 8 of their first 13 3s.  It is the first time the Heat have lost two games in a row this postseason and the recipe for their downfall was identical in both losses: copious turnovers and woeful three-point shooting. Taking care of the ball and punishing the Celtics from deep, conversely, is what they rode to that 3-0 best-of-seven series start.  ADVERTISEMENT  With Gabe Vincent unavailable after spraining his ankle late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, coach Erik Spoelstra had to start 37-year-old Kyle Lowry, who looked every one of his 37 years. He contributed five points, four turnovers and one assist in 30 minutes, a long way from the 17 1/2 points on 58 percent shooting that Vincent had been providing in this series.  Stat to Know: As disappointing as Lowry might've been, the ineffectiveness of the Heat's best two players, Jimmy Butler and Adebayo, was the real shocker. Butler had a quiet 14 points and a plus-minus of minus-24. Adebayo scored 16 points but had six turnovers.  Play of the Game: Al Horford rebounded the miss of a corner three-pointer by Marcus Smart, rebounded the miss of his own putback attempt and then kicked the ball back out to the perimeter, where it made the rounds until Jayson Tatum buried a three-pointer from deep, giving the Celtics an 18-5 lead.  Quote of the Game: ""We always have to stay positive knowing that we can, and we will win this series. We just have to close it out at home"" -Jimmy Butler  What's Next for the Heat: Return to the friendly confines of Kaseya Center, where they are 6-1 this postseason and hopefully will have Vincent (sprained ankle) available.  What's Next for the Celtics: They handed the Heat their first home playoff loss four days ago. If they maintain the energy and focus they've displayed in the last 96 minutes, they could become the fourth team in NBA history to force a Game 7 after starting the series 0-3.

Those restrictions went into effect Thursday.  Public lands managed by the BLM in western Kern, eastern Fresno, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties are all subject to these restrictions.  Lake Isabella, Carrizo Plain National Monument, Keysville Special Recreation Management Area and San Joaquin River George are also included.  “We're seeing a lot of dry vegetation, higher temperatures, lower relative humidity, and so we are seeing more and more fire starts over the last couple of weeks here,"" said Gabe Garcia, the field manager for the BLM Bakersfield field office.  He said there have already been a total of five fires that were put out before they grew too big.  Although those fires are still under investigation, he said they were more than likely caused by humans. The BLM reported that 95 percent of the state's wildfires are human-caused.  ""Some of them are caused by campfires that escape on a windy day, or someone doesn't tend that fire properly. And so we've had the number of camp fires that escape and cause wildland fires,"" he said.  “Sparks from vehicles, sparks from trailers have caused fires in the past. Smoking cigarettes have caused fires in some of our camping areas."" he continued.  The new restrictions banned including open campfires, motorized vehicles or tools powered by internal combustion engines on the road unless on a designated trail, smoking, and charcoal barbeques.  However, Garcia said people are still allowed to use camping stoves, or anything with a valve that is able to be turned off to control the flame.  The will also have fire restrictions in place, but not until mid-June.  There will be similar rules, so anything with a shut off valve will be allowed, but not wood and charcoal based fires.  For those who chose to not follow the rules and potentially cause a catastrophic wildfire, both agencies said there will be consequences.  “If someone has a campfire in one of the areas that's not allowed to have a campfire, you face a fine of up to about $400 fine, so it's best to know your area, know the rules,"" said Robert Sollami, the district fire management officer on the Sequoia National Forest Kern River Ranger District.    Although campfires are still currently allowed on land under the Forest Service, you still need to have a , and follow its rules.  He and Garcia said it’s important that everyone knows the rules of the land, so they can keep themselves and the environment safe.  ""We've had several fires within the Lake Isabella area that have destroyed homes over the last several years. So these are all things that we want to try to avoid if we can, and that's the reason why we put the restrictions on each year,"" said Garcia.

Ramon Alvarez, 56, was arraigned May 19 in 35th District Court on charges of first-degree home invasion, second-degree criminal sexual conduct during a felony, and assaulting/resisting/obstructing a police officer. All three counts are felony charges.  Alvarez is due in court for a probable cause conference June 2 and a June 9 preliminary exam.  He remained jailed May 25 in lieu of a $300,000 bond, according to court records.  Alvarez is represented by attorney Michael J. McCarthy, who said he did not wish to comment on the case.  'He forcefully pushed his way into her house'  A Hometown Life FOIA request for the police report made to Canton Police on May 22 has not yet been fulfilled.  According to a heavily redacted May 18 police report obtained by neighbors and shared with Hometown Life, a woman told police she was sitting in her living room in her Willard Drive home when she saw Alvarez, her neighbor, walk by her front window, then heard him in her garage. She said she opened the door and asked him to leave, but “he forcefully pushed his way into her house,” where he attempted to sexually assault her.  The woman told officers she managed to push Alvarez back into the garage as she screamed for help while he continued to assault her. Neighbors heard her screams and pulled Alvarez off the woman just as police arrived, the report said, allowing her to escape into her home.  The report says Alvarez pulled a knife and cut himself in the face or ear when confronted by police, refused police orders to drop the knife, and was “highly agitated and appeared aggressive” with officers. Police deployed stun guns three times to control him, the report says.  Alvarez was hospitalized following the incident. At least one witness told police Alvarez had not been acting like himself lately.  A nearby neighbor told police Alvarez also caused damage to his or her home minutes prior to the incident. The specifics were redacted in the report. The officer noted damage to the neighbor’s doorwall, frame and glass, and broken pieces of a landscape statue on the ground.  The report also indicates Alvarez called for help before the incident. An officer reported receiving a message at 2:30 p.m., saying Alvarez had called 911 and asked for that specific officer to respond to his home. When a dispatcher told him Canton police supervisors do not normally get dispatched to 911 calls, Alvarez hung up.  The officer suspected a problem, the report said, since Alvarez had never made such a request. The officer attempted to call and text Alvarez, then asked dispatchers to create a 911 welfare check and dispatch a second unit when Alvarez did not respond. The report indicates he was arrested about 3 p.m., 30 minutes after his own call to 911.  According to a 2012 press release from the City of Novi, Alvarez joined the Novi Fire Department in April 1987 as a paid on-call firefighter, was hired as a full-time fire protection officer in 1990 and was promoted to captain in 2012.  It's not clear when Alvarez retired from the department. Novi Fire Chief Jeffery Johnson said he was not aware of Alvarez' arrest and could not comment.  Have a story idea?

"fire","2023-12-05","22:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T22:56:49","Cage structures made with nanoparticles could be a route toward making organized nanostructures with mixed materials, and researchers at the University of Michigan have shown how to achieve this through computer simulations.  The finding could open new avenues for photonic materials that manipulate light in ways that natural crystals can't. It also showcased an unusual effect that the team is calling entropy compartmentalization.  ""We are developing new ways to structure matter across scales, discovering the possibilities and what forces we can use,"" said Sharon Glotzer, the Anthony C. Lembke Department Chair of Chemical Engineering, who led the study published today in Nature Chemistry. ""Entropic forces can stabilize even more complex crystals than we thought.""  While entropy is often explained as disorder in a system, it more accurately reflects the system's tendency to maximize its possible states. Often, this ends up as disorder in the colloquial sense. Oxygen molecules don't huddle together in a corner -- they spread out to fill a room. But if you put them in the right size box, they will naturally order themselves into a recognizable structure.  Nanoparticles do the same thing. Previously, Glotzer's team had shown that bipyramid particles -- like two short, three-sided pyramids stuck together at their bases -- will form structures resembling that of fire ice if you put them into a sufficiently small box. Fire ice is made of water molecules that form cages around methane, and it can burn and melt at the same time. This substance is found in abundance under the ocean floor and is an example of a clathrate. Clathrate structures are under investigation for a range of applications, such as trapping and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Unlike water clathrates, earlier nanoparticle clathrate structures had no gaps to fill with other materials that might provide new and interesting possibilities for altering the structure's properties. The team wanted to change that.  ""This time, we investigated what happens if we change the shape of the particle. We reasoned that if we truncate the particle a little, it would create space in the cage made by the bipyramid particles,"" said Sangmin Lee, a recent doctoral graduate in chemical engineering and first author of the paper.  He took the three central corners off each bipyramid and discovered the sweet spot where spaces appeared in the structure but the sides of the pyramids were still intact enough that they didn't start organizing in a different way. The spaces filled in with more truncated bipyramids when they were the only particle in the system. When a second shape was added, that shape became the trapped guest particle.  Glotzer has ideas for how to create selectively sticky sides that would enable different materials to act as cage and guest particles, but in this case, there was no glue holding the bipyramids together. Instead, the structure was completely stabilized by entropy.  ""What's really fascinating, looking at the simulations, is that the host network is almost frozen. The host particles move, but they all move together like a single, rigid object, which is exactly what happens with water clathrates,"" Glotzer said. ""But the guest particles are spinning around like crazy -- like the system dumped all the entropy into the guest particles.""  This was the system with the most degrees of freedom that the truncated bipyramids could build in a limited space, but nearly all the freedom belonged to the guest particles. Methane in water clathrates rotates too, the researchers say. What's more, when they removed the guest particles, the structure threw bipyramids that had been part of the networked cage structure into the cage interiors -- it was more important to have spinning particles available to maximize the entropy than to have complete cages.  ""Entropy compartmentalization. Isn't that cool? I bet that happens in other systems too -- not just clathrates,"" Glotzer said.  Thi Vo, a former postdoctoral researcher in chemical engineering at U-M and now an assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, contributed to the study.  This study was funded by the Department of Energy and Office of Naval Research, with computing resources provided by the National Science Foundation's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment and the University of Michigan.  Glotzer is also the John Werner Cahn Distinguished University Professor of Engineering, the Stuart W. Churchill Collegiate Professor of Chemical Engineering, and a professor of materials science and engineering, macromolecular science and engineering, and physics.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkYWlseS5jb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8yMzA1MjUxNDE0MjkuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rice County officials said the fire began in the landfill portion of the Solid Waste Facility shortly after it closed for the evening on Monday, May 22. The fire is still burning Thursday.  Officials said the cause of the fire is still unknown. The landfill is closed to non-licensed haulers through Monday. On Thursday, Rice County created a new page on its website where members of the public can find the latest updates about the fire. You can find the website here.  Night and day, Cathy Prodoehl is watching over her 46 prized goats—some of them award-winning—as she worries about the air they're breathing.  ""I've been in contact with my vet. I know the signs and everything to watch out for coughing, sneezing, any signs of respiratory distress,"" Prodoehl said.  Step outside her barn in rural Dundas, and you can see haze and dust from Rice County's landfill a few blocks away.  ""Pretty thick again today. Makes it kind of hard to breathe, and with all the animals that we have here, it's a little concerning for them,"" Prodoehl said.  Rice County officials told FOX 9 no one would be available for interviews Thursday. A spokesperson said a Rice County staff member was out Thursday monitoring the air quality at all residential properties within a half-mile radius of the landfill and ""got no readings that exceed health limits.""  But Prodoehl said that does little to assuage her concerns. She and her neighbors still have questions, and so does their state senator, Bill Lieske.  ""What was being thrown up into the air? What kind of chemicals? What kind of toxins might be floating around now? Obviously, a landfill is full of stuff, so we don't know what that is. And maybe it's time for the agency to step in and at least help answer those questions,"" said Lieske, R-Lonsdale.  A Minnesota Pollution Control Agency spokesperson said Rice County has set up an air monitoring system at the landfill. MPCA also said it connected Rice County officials with an EPA landfill fire expert that can help with data analysis.  Northfield Fire Chief Tom Nelson said an EPA consultant recommended covering the fire with dirt, but that was difficult Thursday because of the wind.  Faribault Fire Chief Dustin Dienst told FOX 9 in an email that local officials have been in contact with multiple state agencies since shortly after the fire broke out Monday and they’ve been ""working diligently to remedy the situation.""  Lieske said he has heard from multiple concerned constituents. He called for increased transparency going forward.  ""We need to work on communication out to the people that live nearby a lot quicker,"" he said.  Prodoehl said she's yet to get a knock on her door, and she continues to worry about the 3-week-old baby goats in her care.  ""How toxic is everything that we're breathing in – for us and all the animals around?

Tony Reeves, the new administrative chief for the Lakeville Fire Department, confirmed with 16 News Now that firefighters went back to work Wednesday night.  As you may recall, 16 News Now first reported back in mid-April that the department was not responding to calls and instead had the Southwest Central Fire Territory handling any fire emergencies in the town. That was because the legal entity Lakeville Fire was contracted with never paid taxes, leaving the department without proper insurance.  At the fire territory board meeting last week, Reeves was approved as the new administrative fire chief and volunteers who wanted to return as firefighters were asked to sign employment agreements.  This allows Union Township to contract the firefighters individually instead of going through another entity.  Lakeville is still a volunteer fire department, but firefighters will get paid an allotment for equipment and a small stipend for time they put into calls for service.  Copyright 2023 WNDU.

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Murphy"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T20:22:00","This story appeared first in WFAE reporter David Boraks' weekly newsletter. Subscribe today to get Climate News straight to your email inbox each week.  Climate change doesn't directly cause wildfires, but it does create the conditions that make fires more likely. A new analysis of weather data by Climate Central shows that as the planet warms, the number of fire weather days is growing nationwide, including North Carolina.  Fire danger is highest when temperatures rise, relative humidity falls and the wind picks up. A lack of rainfall and drought conditions also contribute, said Kaitlyn Trudeau, a California-based senior research associate with Climate Central.  The organization analyzes and reports on climate science. Its report ""Wildfire Weather: Analyzing the 50-year shift across America"" was published Wednesday.  ""We took a look at the change in hot, dry, windy days — days that encourage severe fire behavior,"" Trudeau said. ""The change in fire weather days seems to be largely driven by an increase in dry days, so where the relative humidity is hitting its low thresholds.""  Put simply, Trudeau said, ""There are more days where the weather is primed such that if a fire does break out, you're going to see more extreme fire conditions and fire behavior.""  Trudeau analyzed weather data from 476 weather stations in 48 states. The biggest increase is in the West, where some places now have up to two additional months a year of fire weather conditions, compared with 50 years ago.  ""We also see increases in the East,"" Trudeau said. ""They are not as striking. They're definitely more subtle. But in places like North Carolina and part of northern New Jersey, we are seeing increases of up to two weeks.""  Climate Central / Graph illustrates the increase in fire weather days in North Carolina's Northern Piedmont over the past 50 years.  North Carolina's Northern Piedmont is an example. Climate Central found that the area had 19 fire weather days last year and now has an average of 13 more days of fire weather than a half-century ago. The state's Central Coastal Plain now averages 10 more days of fire weather per year, while the Southern Coastal Plain has eight additional days. (A few states, and parts of North Carolina, have seen a decline in the number of fire weather days because of more favorable weather conditions and other influences, including agricultural development.)  More fire weather days in winter and spring are driving the increase, according to Climate Central. And forestry experts say that's contributing to an increase in actual fires.  ""Wildfires used to be pretty cyclic across most of our southern states,"" mainly happening in spring and fall, said Gary Wood of the Southern Group of State Foresters. ""But it just kind of seems that that typical pattern has gotten a little bit out of whack,"" he said.  About 90% of wildfires in recent years nationwide have been caused by humans. Lightning strikes are also a cause.  In 2022, North Carolina had 6,222 fires that burned 28,851 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles data from multiple agencies nationwide. Of those, 99% were human-caused. The number of wildfires in North Carolina has been rising steadily in recent years, with the exception of the COVID-19 pandemic year of 2020.  A confluence of factors  It’s not just one thing that drives fire risk — it’s multiple factors, adding up and compounding one another. Trudeau said climate change is fueling the increase in fire weather days. The 48 contiguous states are an average of 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer now than in 1970.  ""When it gets warmer, it increases the evaporation. So (the) more evaporation of moisture out of our soils, or landscapes, vegetation, that increases the number of dry days,"" she said.  There's no clear connection between climate and wind, she said, but wind plays an important role along with those climate-driven factors.  So does the growing availability of fuel on the forest floor. As climate change brings more intense hurricanes, tornadoes and other storms, fallen or damaged trees increase the risk of fire. They can pile up and dry out, creating perfect conditions for a more intense fire.  ""And now you have so much more kindling that catches fire with these, you know, basically litters the ground,"" Trudeau said.  Meanwhile, another non-climate trend is adding to the risk — more people moving to wooded areas in or near forests. Experts call this the ""wildland-urban interface"" and it's growing, especially in the eastern part of the country.  In 2020, North Carolina had 2.1 million homes in the wildlife-urban interface, up from 1.3 million in 1990. That was the fourth most in the U.S. behind California, Texas and Florida.  ""There's a lot of North Carolinians that really don't realize how great a risk wildfire is, you know, here in the state,"" said Jamie Dunbar, the Fire Environment Staff Forester with North Carolina Forest Service. ""You definitely have that population growth and expansion, and they've got to go somewhere, right? So the expansion is in that wildland-urban interface, areas where homes (and) communities intermingle with the wildland vegetation.""  All that development presents a new challenge for firefighters, Wood said: Instead of focusing on fighting wildfires, they have to worry about houses burning.  ""Now oftentimes you've got to study and put more emphasis on protecting those structures in those communities than you do being able to put your resources right there and get the fire,"" Wood said.  Forestry officials have typically relied on prescribed fire, or prescribed burns, to control the amount of fuel in wood areas. That's when foresters burn an area on purpose to reduce the risk of a bigger, natural fire. Healthy trees typically don't burn in these controlled fires, but as the amount of fuel grows and the number of fire-weather days increases, those preventive actions get harder, Wood said.  ""So you've got less days to be able to … do those burns,"" Wood said. ""But we know we're at a point where we need to be putting more fire upon the landscape to lessen the risk to human life, to communities and to promote resiliency of our forests and maintain the health of them. So, those shorten windows, it creates a hazard. You're trying to do more when you've got less opportunities.""  Meanwhile, as more people move into forested areas, they often oppose prescribed fires nearby, Wood said.  ""Fire is the oldest land management tool known to man. Fire has been here forever. The Indigenous populations utilized fire. We've got to have fire on the landscapes,"" Wood said.  If you do live in or near a wooded area, Trudeau said you should be prepared for more frequent and hotter fires. ""Increase the defensible space around your homes, make sure you have a way to get emergency alerts, make plans within your communities, talk to your neighbors,"" she said.  But to truly address the issue of wildfires, she added, ""There's no substitute for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.""

Fire experts recommend another 65 feet of clearing to 50% to give firefighters room to defend the home safely.  “As I saw those flames coming over the road, I thought to myself — I’ll never see my home again,” said Allyson Brenner, a resident of Tierrasanta who was evacuated from her home during the 2003 fires.

Fire Marshals stressed the importance of cutting back the fresh brush, which has sprouted up in the heavy rains that are responsible for the current super bloom.  “You’re getting that defensible space and it gives you a chance to me more resilient and resistant to fire, and it gives us a chance to get our hoses in there and defend you,” said Anthony Tosca, a deputy chief in the San Diego Fire Department.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS93ZWF0aGVyL2xvY2FsLXJlc2lkZW50cy1maXJlLWV4cGVydHMtZGlzY3Vzcy1wcmVwYXJhdGlvbi1mb3Itd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29uL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS93ZWF0aGVyL2xvY2FsLXJlc2lkZW50cy1maXJlLWV4cGVydHMtZGlzY3Vzcy1wcmVwYXJhdGlvbi1mb3Itd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Just about 40 feet away, three-quarters of a three-story home was engulfed in fire, and flames shot up nearly 30 feet into the air. The heat was so intense the power lines running by the home were on fire.  His chief concern was the information relayed to him that someone might still be in the home. He stopped long enough to tell dispatchers that mutual aid would be needed.  As he ran around to the side of the house, Lebel saw a man already leaning a ladder up against the side of the burning building. The occupants, Peter Schumacher and his daughter, had escaped the fire by climbing out of the second story onto the roof of the porch. Lebel and the man helped them down the ladder and away from the fire.  By that time, people had started gathering around the fire scene, and Lebel was running to the neighboring houses to warn the residents about the fire and the possibility that it could spread. Some neighbors were outside with hoses, wetting down their property as a precaution.  “If you know Hallowell, it’s a pretty close-knit town,” Lebel said Thursday before heading into his shift at the police department. “When I tell you everyone within 4 square miles was watching that fire, I’m not even kidding you.”  Advertisement  Lebel, 23, has been with the Hallowell Police Department for about two years.  When fires are reported in Hallowell, which has a volunteer fire department, he said the police department also responds and relays information about the status of the fire. Then they do what they can.  Sometimes, he said, it turns out to be someone who has burned some toast. But on Tuesday, it was a devastating and intense house fire, and he didn’t hesitate.  “It’s our job, I guess. I didn’t really think about it at the time. There was still someone on there, so you just gotta run toward it,” he said. “I forget not everybody thinks like that.”  Meanwhile, the identity of the man with the ladder remains a mystery. His best recollection is the man, whom police called a “civilian hero,” was in his mid-20s.  “Everything moved so fast, and that wasn’t really on my radar to be honest,” he said. “I don’t know him. If I met him again, that’s not to say I would recognize him again or I would even fully know 100% it was him because everything moved so fast.”  Advertisement  The Hallowell Police Department is still hoping to identify the man to thank him and is asking anyone who might know him or have information about him to contact the department via Facebook Messenger.  “The selflessness is remarkable,” Christopher Giles, interim Hallowell police chief, said of the mystery helper. “The man took a risk and went far above what most people are willing to do for their fellow humans.”  Once the occupants were safe, Lebel said he ran around to the surrounding houses to make sure that those residents were awake and aware of the fire and the potential it could spread. The closest neighbors to the fire were already outside, wetting down their property as a precaution.  Firefighters from Hallowell, Augusta, Gardiner, Manchester, Pittston and Randolph responded and put the fire out in about three hours.  In the meantime, the Gofundme campaign set up on behalf of the Schumachers had raised nearly $17,000 of its $20,000 goal by Thursday afternoon.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Maine Office of State Fire Marshal, which did not have an update on Thursday.

Credit: Courtesy BFD  City firefighters doused what they believe was a construction-related fire at a Southwest Berkeley home in under a half-hour Tuesday.  A 911 caller reported a burning house in the 1300 block of Haskell Street just before 2 p.m., said Berkeley Fire Department spokeswoman Dafina Dailey.  When firefighters arrived they found flames and smoke coming through the house’s roof, Dailey said. They got it under control by 2:25 p.m. with no injuries to anyone.  “The structure was vacant due to construction,” Dailey said. “The possible cause of the fire might be due to construction work on the roof.”  There was no estimate of the property damages.  The precise source of ignition was not known Wednesday but the fire was still under investigation.  The state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) maintains strict regulations for fire safety during construction, since so many of the materials used or generated can be flammable.  For example, CAL FIRE mandates that combustible debris like cardboard, lumber and packing material “shall not be accumulated within buildings” but removed daily, oily rags must be stored in specific containers and there is no smoking allowed “inside or on the roof of new buildings under construction.” With a few exceptions anything that can combust must be kept at least 20 feet from buildings under construction.  Any so-called “hot work” — cutting, welding, soldering, thermal spraying, torch-applied roofing or anything involving fire or explosions — is subject to pre- and post-site inspection and must have “fire watch” personnel on hand, according to CAL FIRE’s regulations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlcmtlbGV5c2lkZS5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9oYXNrZWxsLXN0cmVldC1ob3VzZS1maXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

During an interview with law enforcement, Hufford described his actions in the video as “excessive.”  The criminal complaint goes on to say, “Based on the suspects admission to the excessive nature of the strikes, it is reasonable to believe that there was potential for bodily harm.”  Investigators say the parents were asleep inside at the time of the fire.

(WOOD) — Two people were hospitalized after they were injured in a fire Wednesday night northeast of Grand Rapids.  When firefighters arrived at the fire in a detached garage on 4 Mile Road between Hoag Avenue and Bluewater Pines Drive in Grand Rapids Township, a man and a woman had already escaped. They were both injured in the fire, according to Grand Rapids Township Chief Luke Werdon.  He said crews worked throughout the night until around 8 a.m. Thursday.  “They had some assistance from Kent County. They brought over an excavator to help us dig. The building had collapsed on itself, so getting to some of the fire that was underneath layers and layers of all of this material was really difficult,” Werdon said.  Neighbors said they heard loud banging sounds — something the fire chief says is not uncommon.  “It’s likely that there are small containers, so people keep propane in their garages, gas containers, all of that sort of stuff and I suspect that that was a very similar situation,” Werdon said.  Firefighters also had challenges trying to keep the fire from spreading.  “The building that was burning was in close proximity to the home and it was such a large fire that it was on the edge of lighting the home on fire so we had to focus on protecting that structure,” Werdon said.  The fire chief did not have an update on the man and woman’s condition and said they may never know exactly what started the fire.  “The cause is likely going to be undetermined due to the extent of the fire. It destroyed a lot of the evidence,” Werdon said.  It is unclear what caused the fire.

The fire was apparently sparked by a lit cigarette and was unintentionally set, according to a tweet from Attorney General Ken Paxton. But as innocuous as it might have been, the blaze still added yet another twist to the days-long saga that’s gripped the state Capitol amid epic infighting between the Texas House and Paxton, the state’s top lawyer.  The fire began Wednesday evening, hours after the Texas House General Investigating Committee held a public hearing and detailed its investigation into what led up to a $3.3 million settlement between Paxton and his former employees-turned-whistleblowers. The former employees said they were fired in 2020 after reporting an array of alleged misdeeds by the Republican attorney general to officials.  Sound complicated? Wait, there’s more.  Let’s back up to Tuesday, when Paxton surprised lawmakers and reporters — along with almost everyone following the state’s current 140-day legislative session — by calling for House Speaker Dade Phelan’s resignation. Paxton accused Speaker Phelan, who is also a Republican, of being drunk at the House dais during a recent floor session.  In response, Phelan's communications director Cait Wittman suggested the attorney general made his comments after learning his office was under investigation.  “Paxton’s statement today amounts to little more than a last-ditch effort to save face,"" she said in a statement Tuesday.  OK, back to the fire.  As part of its investigation, the House committee instructed Paxton’s office to preserve certain documents. So, as expected, social media lit up Wednesday night after videos of the fire surfaced online. Scott Braddock, a veteran reporter and editor of the Quorum Report, posted a video of the fire that showed “maybe some documents” ablaze.  The fire was quickly extinguished, and Paxton’s office tweeted out a plea for information related to the “arson” that occurred outside his offices.  Thursday morning, though, he clarified the fire was unintentional.  “The 42-year-old female was charged with criminal mischief equal to or greater than $25,000 but less than $30,000,” Paxton’s office said in a statement posted to Twitter. “DPS questioned the suspect over possible political motivations and have preliminarily determined the fire was unintentional.”  Paxton ended the updated statement by admonishing the press — which is nothing new for the AG – and others for fueling speculation about what caused the fire or who was responsible.  “I have no doubt that those with the responsibility for informing the public of the truth will issue retractions and apologize for spreading disinformation about this incident,” the statement reads.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXJhbmV3cy5vcmcvdGV4YXMtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTI1L2EtY2lnYXJldHRlLW1heS1oYXZlLWNhdXNlZC1hLWZpcmUtb3V0c2lkZS1hZy1rZW4tcGF4dG9ucy1vZmZpY2UtaW4tYS1kdW1wc3Rlci1hLWR1bXBzdGVyLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-03-29","Not Discerned","{""Charlotte"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T20:38:00","YOUNGSVILLE, N.C. — During the South Park fire in Charlotte last week many firefighters showed up to bravely fight the flames. But those stories can spark memories for other firefighters who have experienced similar calls in the past.  What You Need To Know A.C. Rich is the former Raleigh battalion chief    Rich was part of the initial response to the 2017 Metropolitan fire in Raleigh    The inferno in Charlotte brought back lots of memories for the firefighter  A.C. Rich has seen many fires through the years as a firefighter and battalion chief.  “Firefighters have to be very prepared to adapt,” Rich said. “And that adaptability, I think, is at the heart and soul of every firefighter.”  He says one of the biggest things he’s learned is that you never know what to expect from the many different calls a fire department receives.  “We always have to be prepared for the worst,” Rich said. “And we always have to be aware of what may come from what we see when we arrive.”  That’s what happened to Rich when a call came in on March 16, 2017. He says he had never seen a fire that big. Rich was the Raleigh battalion chief at the time and part of the initial response team.  “A critical piece of the Metropolitan fire was, you know, keeping all of the responders safe,” Rich said. “But also keeping that particular fire from burning up more than what it had already consumed.”  The fire began at the empty unfinished Metropolitan apartment complex that didn’t have fire protection systems installed yet. Although that contributed to the rapid flames, Rich says the firefighters were ultimately able to overcome the spreading fire. He says those memories resurfaced after seeing the inferno that broke out in Charlotte last week.  “When I first became aware of it,” Rich said. “My first thought was for the firefighters themselves and just praying that they would be safe.”  Rich says he understands what the Charlotte fire department went through, as both were in apartment complexes that were under construction, and both were fast burning, five-alarm fires. But he says the Charlotte fire had an added layer of crisis because of the fatalities and active rescue situations.  “With everyone that's there on the scene having the mentality that we're not going to let this beat us, you know, we're going to do what we need to do, even at a relatively large risk to ourselves,” Rich said. “And that's what firefighters do. That's what we're here for. And we take a lot of pride in doing that. So much respect for all firefighters, especially the Charlotte fire department. And they did a outstanding job.”  Rich says after the Raleigh fire in 2017, there was a big evaluation of how they responded to the fire as well as fire codes and code enforcements.

The man was identified by Douglas police as Eric Ridenour, 58.  Just before 11 a.m. on Monday firefighters received reports of smoke coming from St. Stephen Episcopal Church located on D Avenue and 11th Street, according to Douglas Fire Department spokesperson Matt King.  King said the area was filled with heavy smoke and the fire took a while to put out as it had extended quickly.  At about noon, firefighters were notified of a second fire at First Presbyterian Church, located on the same block. The fire extended into the basement and the attic, consuming the roof of the structure.  No one was injured in the fires, King said.  Police said investigators determined both fires were intentionally started and identified Ridenour as a person of interest. Authorities searched Ridenour's home located outside of Douglas and detained him.  Ridenour was booked into Cochise County Jail and was waiting to be transferred to federal custody.

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  Despite recent scattered showers in some areas of the state, much of Michigan is dry. That means fire safety is a high priority for anyone working or playing outdoors as Memorial Day weekend nears.  With millions of residents expected to travel 50 miles or more from home during the holiday weekend, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources warned Thursday that fire danger is elevated across the state.  Fire danger goes up when the weather is hot and dry and increases further when it’s windy. Windborne embers can travel far and fast, turning a small fire into a large one. Lightning strikes are also an issue if stormy weather is predicted.  Fire danger is high or very high statewide, with pockets of extreme risk across the northern Lower Peninsula, according to the DNR in a Thursday press release.  “Whether you’re traveling north or not, conditions are dry in much of the state,” Don Klingler, resource protection manager for the DNR, said in the Thursday release. “Be careful with fire, ORVs and outdoor equipment and take precautions to keep yourself and others safe.”  Even if the landscape looks green, vegetation still can be dry, according to Keith Murphy, a DNR fire management specialist based in the Upper Peninsula.  “Due to the low relative humidity, needle moisture in pines and lack of good rainfall, certain areas of the U.P. can definitely burn,” Murphy said in the release.  Several of Michigan’s largest wildfires in the past have started during the last two weeks in May, he added.  Nine out of 10 wildland fires in Michigan are human-caused. And yard waste burning is the top cause of the fires.  “If a backyard fire gets away from you, call 911 immediately,” the DNR wrote in the release.  Check Michigan.gov/burnpermit before you burn to ensure weather conditions allow for safe burning, and use extreme caution when burning, the DNR added. In southern Lower Peninsula communities, consult local fire authorities.  Since the beginning of fire season in March, DNR wildland firefighters have fought more than 124 fires covering nearly 700 acres.  “People get out there and don’t realize how fast a fire can take off, especially if there is any breeze that can carry an ember,” Klingler said.  To keep safety top of mind, the DNR suggested these tips:  Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  Never leave any fire, including hot coals, unattended.  Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.  It’s illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air, causing harm to you or others. Dispose of these materials properly.  You can use a burn barrel with a screen on top to burn paper, leaves and natural materials.

The complaint goes on to say that a tenant reported they were awakened earlier to Carlson allegedly ""smashing glass and breaking things."" After about 20 minutes, Carlson knocked on the tenant's door and said that the building was on fire.  A neighbor called 911 and reportedly saw Carlson at around 3:30 a.m. wearing a helmet and smashing his own windows, according to court documents. The neighbor also said they saw Carlson under his truck with gas cans, going in and out of the home. The witness said they then saw what appeared to be fire coming from the upstairs apartment, the criminal complaint says.

"fire","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Paradise"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T03:24:30","I’m a strong proponent of Tesla. I co-own a Model Y, and I have a small portfolio of Tesla stock. I spread the word about reliability of the Supercharger network, the feelings of safety I get when I drive the Tesla, and the Y’s extensive perks. I admit it: I have drunk the Tesla Kool-Aid. But what I can no longer do is endorse Elon Musk as CEO. His once-strong vision for the company has deteriorated into a series of fantasy scenarios and partially completed plans. Yes, Musk is brilliant. His legacy is set — he nearly single-handedly ushered in the era of transportation electrification. But he is no longer functioning adequately in the capacity needed as head of Tesla. It’s time to fire Elon Musk.  Stating such a position openly is risky for me, I know. Since Musk purchased Twitter, free speech has become an Orwellian term, a means of promoting Musk’s neoliberal worldview. While I’m not a regular Twitter user, I do use it for this writing gig, and I apparently could become the object of shadow banning by speaking out against Musk.  But it’s got to be said — it’s time to fire Elon Musk as Tesla CEO.  I realize that taking this position may force oppositionists to scramble out of the proverbial woodwork; I could become the object of great antipathy and trolling.  Then again, I may not be alone in my vocal anti-Musk attitude.  Reputation hits are hard to reverse: An Axios Harris poll released this week says Tesla has fallen precipitously in reputation from 11th in 2022 to 62nd place this year, with a 74.3 RQ (79.5 in 2022). It seems people in the US have grown “wary and weary of big ideas and powerful moguls who they feel have overpromised and underdelivered.” They say that Musk’s influence at Twitter has displaced Rupert Murdoch and Fox News as the king of conservative media in recent weeks.  If Twitter has, indeed, become the center of media gravity for the Republican Party just as the 2024 election heats up, then progressives may find themselves becoming even more disillusioned with the Technoking. Musk has been critical of the Biden administration for its proposals to tax billionaires and give more tax incentives to union-made EVs. Maybe it’s time for some progressives to look at a Kia EV6 instead of a Model Y….  Autopilot errors: Musk has focused incessantly on the company’s self-driving capacity, and that single-mindedness has been a detriment to the company. Musk’s focus on Autopilot takes him away from other endeavors that could be more productive for Tesla. In February, regulators required Tesla to recall (read: send over-the-air updates) to more than 362,000 US vehicles to address its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta software. The regulators said that the driver assistance system did not adequately adhere to traffic safety laws and could cause crashes.  US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg isn’t convinced that Autopilot is correctly named or functioning. “There is a real concern that’s not limited to the technology itself but the interaction between the technology and the driver,” Buttigieg told reporters this week when asked about the Tesla Autopilot probe.  Introduce more models with greater frequency: In March, I wrote about 12 reasons why Tesla should offer a lower price vehicle. Among them was appealing to new audiences, keeping current with other automakers (who tend to release new models constantly), boosting Tesla stock value, bringing youth climate activists into the fold, and enhancing EV equity across demographic groups.  Cybertruck — when? Steve Hanley’s CleanTechnica April Fool’s Day parody, “Elon Musk: Tesla Cybertruck Is Dead, $20,000 City Car Is Coming” got the most hits of any of our articles this quarter. Why? People are sick of waiting — they want answers — and they also want the release of the “Model C.” They want to feel as if the Tesla brand they love is new and fresh and constantly ahead of the competition. Right now, with the Model Y release more than 4 years ago and the Roadster refresh yet to be formalized, all Tesla fans can do is wait. And wait some more. Maybe a new CEO would appreciate consumer delight when a new model is released….  It’s Elon’s antics and antipathy that are causes for concern: He’s interjected himself into politics (“Give people their freedom back!” he exclaimed as he objected to the Covid mask mandate), resorted to hyperbole (“A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar, & always being alert can definitely be superhuman,” he insisted), or insulted workers (he called remote work “morally wrong” and said that the “laptop classes are living in la-la land”). It’s time for the Tesla CEO to comport himself like an adult.  The internal influence of a new CEO: Robyn Denholm is little more than an Elon mouthpiece as board chair. Straubel hasn’t been removed long enough from the Tesla board for his board reinstatement to become objective. Tom Zhu could have a bigger North American influence — that is, if Tesla does fire Elon Musk and a new CEO is hired.  A new CEO would be able to function as a mentor to the other board members, helping to guide them in directions that are a bit more short-term risk aware as well as setting a trajectory that applies resources today to feasible 3- and 5-year goals.  Right-wing favoritism, trouble brewing with Tesla fanboys and fangirls: Politico called Musk “polarizing” and “a controversial and outspoken figure” as they anticipated Musk’s center stage participation at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ 2024 presidential bid announcement. Twitter’s press team sent an automated reply with a poop emoji in response to a Politico query on the event.  Republican strategist Rob Stutzman wonders why DeSantis decided to have Musk appear with him in a high-stakes event like the 2024 presidential bid announcement, as its always uncertain “what comes out of his mouth.”  Is Tesla’s decision to advertise borne out of appealing to fans? Concurrent with the May 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting, Musk revealed, “We’ll try out a little advertising and see how it goes.” Musk said he envisioned advertising that emphasized the features, safety, and affordability of Tesla vehicles, yet acknowledged he did not yet have a “fully formed strategy” for Tesla advertising.  A 2-minute video, posted on the Twitter account for Tesla Asia, is a driver testimonial from a mother of two young children in Singapore. She is delighted to share why she loves her Tesla Model 3, pointing out the design and environmentally friendly features of the all-electric sedan, which costs about $47,000. “The day-to-day drive is one of the smoothest and safest,” she says, noting her approval of the “autosteer” feature which offers her assistance to stay in her lane after a long day of work and driving.  This may be the start of a wonderful relationship — not exactly traditional advertising like your father watched on television, a lot more like a CEO who knows he’s on the edge of accepted decorum and reads the winds of change. Francine McKenna, writing a TIME magazine “Ideas” piece, argues that the SEC should have also barred Musk from serving as an officer or director of any public company long before he came to Twitter. Maybe Musk picked up the issue of TIME recently….  Tesla fans love the brand: Let it be said that, yes, Tesla has the strongest brand loyalty of any automakers, according to an investment note which lists Tesla with a 67% favorable rating. Citi analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a recent communication to clients that Tesla’s brand loyalty continues to be strong, according to quarterly S&P Global data and as detailed in a report from Barron’s. We love Tesla! The data indicate that Tesla’s brand continues to snatch market share from other automakers.  To fire Elon Musk would be tumultuous and really invigorating for the brand at the same time. It must be done.

Third St.  At 5:23 a.m., YCOM received multiple 911 calls reporting a fire in the alleyway near Northeast Third and Evans streets. Firefighters arrived within three minutes to find flames coming from a door in the alleyway off Evans Street. Firefighters quickly called a second alarm to bring in additional fire resources.  The building is attached to other properties which can cause fire to rapidly spread from one occupancy to another, according to department spokesman Scott Law. This block of downtown McMinnville is mixed with commercial and residential occupancy.  One resident was safely evacuated from the attached neighboring building. The fire was upgraded to a third alarm to ensure enough firefighters were on scene to handle the high-risk incident and to keep flames from spreading to the adjacent buildings.  An aggressive initial attack from the first arriving engine crew stopped the fire growth and contained all fire damage to 433 N.E. Third St.. the 3rd St. Pizza restaurant and full-size movie theatre.  The third alarm brought fire resources from Amity, Dayton, Carlton, Sheridan, Grand Ronde Tribal and Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue.

"fire","2023-11-01","Not Discerned","{""MillHall"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T05:06:28","MILL HALL — The Mill Hall Fire Company is working towards required training measures.  The fire company recently rejected a letter sent to them, via Mill Hall Borough Council, requesting they meet training requirements. Such requirements include CPR and first aid. The company has recently been unable to do a majority of lifting assists in the area due to a lack of training. However, an ambulance is the first call for such events by the communication center. Goodwill Hose Fire Company has recently stepped up to answer lifting assist calls as a secondary responder.  During Tuesday’s monthly meeting, Mayor Thomas Bossert announced the rejected letter by the fire company.  “The letter this council prepared and sent to the fire company — in good faith — was an encouragement to meet a goal that we all understand and is necessary. The response from the fire company was that they rejected the letter,” he said.  The reasons for the rejection, according to council president Dan McCloskey, was due to the letter coming from the safety committee. He reiterated that council is the safety committee.  The other reason was due to McCloskey’s illegible signature in the letter.  Bossert deemed the company’s response as “immature.”  “It is a struggle and a positive note by the council to reach or attain a goal that we all know is necessary,” he said.  The only thing the fire company wanted to know was what would happen if they did not meet the training requirements, according to McCloskey. The company has a six month period, until Nov. 1, to meet training requirements — with flexibility.  “We requested questions and concerns, so that we could get everything aired out. The only thing they wanted to know was what would happen to them if they didn’t meet the training requirements. We wrote the letter to the fire company, letting them know they hit the six month mark and they had till Nov. 1 to meet those requirements; and that if they weren’t met, then the borough was prepared to deal with them at that time,” McCloskey explained.  Borough council did not give the fire company members a specific breakdown of what would occur after Nov. 1.  According to McCloskey, the letter sent to the fire company did indicate if somebody is trying to get the required training and they are not going to be able to make it by the deadline, the borough is flexible. The borough will address those instances when they come up.  “It is not cut and dry that by Nov. 1 you don’t have them. If you are demonstrating that you are going to get them, I think this council is flexible enough that we will work with the person,” he said.  Mill Hall Fire Chief, Tony Walker, clarified the fire company is in the works of training and receiving necessary certifications.  “Through the county’s training committee we have, we are trying to take some steps — not only for Mill Hall but the whole county in general — to meet more of the requirements,” he said.  The fire company is also working on training requirements that go beyond the borough’s requirements. Such as requirements that other companies in the county have in place.  Last week the fire company members took CPR training, according to Walker. They are in the works of first aid training as well.  Until more members are trained, Flemington will continue to pick up lift assisting if an ambulance cannot, Walker said.  “Until we get all of these little things worked out to get our people trained,” he said.  The Mill Hall Fire Company can still do lift assisting, but is limited at this time.  In other business, supervisors voted to approve ordinance No. 05-23-2023 for the vacation of a portion of Jay Street between Wasson Street and West Church Street. A hearing was held prior to the borough’s regularly scheduled meeting by solicitor Paul Ryan. No public comment was made regarding vacating the portion of roadway.  Council also approved a $10,000 down payment for the police department cruiser loan to keep the payment budgeted rate of a $634 monthly payment for five years. Along with the approval, council voted to approve a loan update with First Citizens Community Bank for $32,000 with payment of about $34 per month for five years. There will be an interest rate of 6.1 percent, according to Ryan.  The police cruiser was obtained and is in possession of the Mill Hall Police Department, according to Chief Brandon Coleman. He said it will be going out for decaling next week.  Last Friday and Saturday, the Tri County Church volunteered to repaint the Mill Hall Community pool house.

Read more  A Delaware County fire chief was charged with obstructing an investigation into child abuse Tuesday, according to court documents.  The Delaware County District Attorney’s Office charged Thomas Weber Sr., chief of the Folcroft Fire Department, with endangering the welfare of children in addition to the obstruction charge.  The charges come after another department official, Folcroft Deputy Fire Chief Matthew Thomas Bateman, was charged late last year with a handful of sex crimes. Investigators alleged that the 28-year-old Bateman sexually assaulted a 15-year-old member of the department’s junior firefighter division multiple times inside the firehouse last summer.  The District Attorney’s Office could not be reached for comment on the latest charges, and it is not clear whether the investigation into Weber is related to Bateman’s charges. In January, though, law enforcement sources told CBS3 they were actively investigating other leaders within the Folcroft Fire Department who may have known about the alleged abuse and failed to report it.  Advertisement  Weber’s attorney also did not respond to a request for comment.  Folcroft Borough officials released a statement Wednesday saying that the mayor and council members would refrain from commenting on Weber’s charges.  “Those individuals entrusted to serve and protect our community are under a constant duty to protect children, including the prevention, deterrence, and reporting of suspected child abuse,” the statement said. “Silence in the face of child abuse has no place in Folcroft Borough and will not be tolerated from mandated reporters employed by the Borough.”  CBS3 first reported in December that Bateman and another high-ranking Folcroft fire official were suspended after Bateman was accused of assaulting the junior firefighter.  In CBS’ January coverage of Bateman’s court appearance, an attorney for the underaged victim said the assaults could have been avoided with proper oversight and reporting procedures within the department.  Bateman pleaded not guilty and awaits trial.  Weber’s bail was set at $200,000.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZvbGNyb2Z0LWZpcmUtY2hpZWYtY2hhcmdlZC1vYnN0cnVjdGluZy1jaGlsZC1hYnVzZS1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLTIwMjMwNTI0Lmh0bWzSAXxodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnF1aXJlci5jb20vbmV3cy9mb2xjcm9mdC1maXJlLWNoaWVmLWNoYXJnZWQtb2JzdHJ1Y3RpbmctY2hpbGQtYWJ1c2UtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi0yMDIzMDUyNC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Bradshaw described the entire ordeal as “a heartbreaking turn of events.” He said Kirkbrae Country Club can’t guarantee that the damage will be repaired by the end of June, which is what prompted the cancelations.  “This has been a stressful and traumatic event for everyone involved, including our members, staff and event guests,” Bradshaw said. “We are still in the process of assessing the damage to the clubhouse before we can determine when we’ll be able to open our doors in a safe and healthy manner.”  Bradshaw said the venue is “working feverishly” to find comparable venues with open dates to host their weddings.  “We have been in contact with the upcoming wedding parties and will continue to make every effort possible to help,” Bradshaw said. “We thanked them wholeheartedly for choosing us to host their special day and we are firmly committed to making sure they have a memorable and enjoyable wedding.”  Kirkbrae Country Club is also planning to offer impacted couples “something special” on their one-year wedding anniversary as a small gesture.

[Pompano Beach Fire Rescue]  By Diane Emeott-Korzen | New Pelican Writer  Pompano Beach – A 2:45 a.m. fire the Monday morning after Mother’s Day displaced more than 55 people from 22 units at the two-story Royal Atlantic Apartments on Northwest 7 Avenue, built around 1967.  Some 30 adults, 15 kids and 3 pets are among those suddenly without a home. One cat was deceased. There was no other loss of life.  The cause of the fire will not be determined until the State Fire Marshal’s office finishes their investigation. It usually takes a while, according to Pompano Fire Chief Chad Brocato.  “It was very smoky when we arrived, with black smoke down to the ground. It was hard to tell which building was on fire. We were out front. Once the smoke lifted we could tell (the fire) was in the back,” Battalion Chief Mike Gurr told The New Pelican.  “It was a two-alarm fire (other departments assisted) with 14 units, 40 people responding. It took two hours to get it under control. At one point, the roof started to cave in. We were able to pull our guys out.”  Commissioner Beverly Perkins said went over to check on the people around 7:30 a.m., finding them still standing along the street.  She started calling people to help. They needed chairs to sit on. The Broward Sheriff’s Office brought a tent, water and drinks. The American Red Cross brought food. The city brought a bus to transport those who wanted to go to nearby Mitchell Moore Recreation Center on Northwest 10 Street, where they have showers. About 10 people went.  Apartment owner Roy Shriki, who lives in Fort Lauderdale and owns several buildings, was awakened at 3 a.m. with news of the fire, and came to the scene, giving tenants $25 each.  He said after the residents had food and drink, his advice was to go to Mitchell Moore Park. But when he went to the park the next morning his tenants said the Red Cross gave them $150, not enough for a hotel stay, and asked them to leave. Shriki told them to put the Red Cross card towards food and gave 10 tenants two week’s worth of hotel stays.  Asked why the tenants were asked to leave Mitchell Moore, Red Cross Executive Director Paula Prendergast said, “The shelter was closed as we moved the individuals staying with us onto the next phase of their recovery plan. Each family was given immediate assistance, a resource guide, and contacts, and assigned a caseworker to help them on their road to recovery.”  Did everyone get $150 assistance?  “We cannot disclose the amount of immediate assistance given, but each family in the shelter was provided with a card. The families can use the assistance as they see fit for their immediate needs like housing,” said Prendergast.  At last Tuesday’s CRA meeting, Perkins said the city needs to have a plan in place for how to deal with the aftermath of a fire. She said she used to think the American Red Cross did everything. That is not the case. The Red Cross told her each city they work with has its own plan to respond to large fires.  Prendergast added, “Our Red Cross plan is the same for all types of fires: we respond, assess immediate needs, and provide assistance to help the community affected.”  In the aftermath of the fire, Shriki said, “We are not talking about people with savings accounts. Some lost everything; some lost less but still have damage. We need to figure out a way to help them.To a person who’s lost everything a hundred or so dollars is not enough. They need a solution for three or four months. “","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdwZWxpY2FuLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maXJlLWxlYXZlcy01NS1wZW9wbGUtaG9tZWxlc3Mtc29tZS1pbi1uZWVkLW9mLXNoZWx0ZXItYW5kLW90aGVyLXJlc291cmNlcy1wZXJraW5zLXNheXMtY2l0eS1uZWVkcy1hLXBsYW4tdG8tZGVhbC13aXRoLWhlbHBpbmctcmVzaWRlbnRzLWFmdGVyLWZpcmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It has an 11-inch screen, a fingerprint reader, and an optional keyboard and stylus package. Usually, Fire tablets are cheap consumption devices, but now maybe you can be productive on one?  The tablet starts at $229.99, with the ""productivity bundle""—the tablet plus the keyboard and stylus—clocking in at $329.99, or exactly the price of a 9th-gen iPad. For specs, the display is an 11-inch, 2000×1200 60 Hz LCD, and it has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (with an option for 128GB), and a ""14-hour"" battery of unknown size with 15 W charging (you'll only get a 9 W charger in the box, though). The SoC is a Mediatek MT8188J. That's an 8-core chip with two Arm Cortex A78 CPUs (those are the ""medium"" size CPUs in 2021's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1) and six junky Cortex A55 CPUs for background duty. The GPU is an ARM G57 MC2.  Advertisement  The fingerprint reader is on the side power button. There's also a MicroSD slot for extra storage. The keyboard connects to the tablet via pogo pins that power the keyboard and provide communication. The keyboard isn't backlit. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and sports front and back 8 MP cameras.  As always, the tough thing about Amazon tablets is not getting the usual Google Play Android ecosystem. Instead, you'll be limited to the Amazon App Store and won't be able to easily install the Google apps.

Android 12L was a release focused on tablet improvements, but you won't get that on Amazon's tablet. The $230 version features ads on the lock screen (you can pay $15 more to get rid of these), and many of the packed-in apps are designed around getting you to buy stuff from Amazon.  So, as usual, it's a budget device, but it's a cheap way to dip your toes into the tablet plus keyboard waters.

Fire crews and water supply from Alpine, Sparta, Plainfield, Grand Rapids and Ada townships as well as Grand Rapids fire responded to the scene.  4 Mile Road was closed east of the Beltline as crews worked to put the fire out.  It is unclear if anyone was injured in the fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2R0di5jb20vbmV3cy9rZW50LWNvdW50eS9jcmV3cy1iYXR0bGUtYmFybi1maXJlLW5vcnRoZWFzdC1vZi1ncmFuZC1yYXBpZHMv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29vZHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2tlbnQtY291bnR5L2NyZXdzLWJhdHRsZS1iYXJuLWZpcmUtbm9ydGhlYXN0LW9mLWdyYW5kLXJhcGlkcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2022-11-20","19:13:00","{""Springfield"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T19:35:19","Spurred by hopes of an economic boom, Liberty County commissioners over the last several years have rezoned thousands of acres of fallow farmland and forest east of I-95 to build warehouses and industrial zones.  Yet local officials haven’t shown the same zeal to ensure that the businesses coming to the county and thousands of residents already living there will be adequately protected if fire breaks out, according to a five-month investigation by The Current.  More than one-third of the county fire department remains part-timers despite the county transition to a full-time force in 2020. Although the budget has increased 1,630% in six years, the department lacks basic equipment to stop a two-story house fire. Standard safety plans, including how to respond to specific types of fires and a map of fire hydrant locations, don’t exist.  This lack of planning had disastrous results in November, when one of Liberty County’s oldest historic homes incinerated over a 12-hour period. Firefighters showed up to the property owned by Scott and Meredith Belford without enough water to manage the blaze and could not draw water from other available local sources, including the marsh or swimming pool located on the property, due to a lack of equipment.  In their after-action reports, several firefighters said a lack of crisis management, water and equipment were critical points of failure. Liberty County Fire Services Chief Brian Darby omitted mention of these issues in his final report to the state fire marshal.

The Belfords blame a lack of leadership and crisis management by Liberty County Fire Services Chief Brian Darby. Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current  In the aftermath of the Belford blaze, senior county officials have shied away from publicly explaining the county’s fire safety plans, despite rising local concern.  County Manager Joey Brown recommended to the head of the County Commissioners not to make Darby available for questioning during the monthly public meeting held by the elected body, according to a Nov. 23 email exchange reviewed by The Current. “Probably not advisable,” Brown wrote to Donald Lovette.  Darby, who previously worked as a U.S. Army fireman before taking over the county agency in 2017, did not respond to numerous requests for comment from The Current over the last four months.  Brown, who agreed to speak on these issues with The Current in May after multiple interview requests, defended the fire chief and the county’s safety record.  He described the Belford fire as complex, saying no one, not even the country’s best fire department, could have saved the historic residence. He thinks criticism that the county had ignored standards for fire prevention is unfair.  “Our focus has definitely been getting boots on the ground, getting people to respond to fires, getting equipment to fires, because that’s the most important thing. Next year’s budget takes us another step further and starts to get us into some planning,” according to Brown.  Eastern part of county sees growth  The waterways of eastern Liberty County are home to families whose lineages stretch back to the Revolutionary War as well as newcomers eager for serenity offered by the salt marshes and woods around Sunbury, Colonel’s Island and Yellow Bluff.  The two-lane Islands Highway is the only way in or out of East Liberty. Residents have expressed fears that rapid warehouse development will create excessive traffic and public safety delays on Islands Highway. Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current  From the early 1990s to 2018, the area east of I-95 was served by a volunteer fire department run by resident Joe Martin. His force had eight volunteer firefighters and covered over 800 homes from two fire stations, according to Allen Davis, who served on a county committee to assess fire safety.  In 2017, Liberty County commissioners expressed concern about the quality of its volunteer departments, citing statistics that showed close to half of the emergency calls to Midway and east Liberty’s volunteers went unresponded. After Martin retired in 2018, the county consolidated fire coverage to professionalize the force as the county grew, according to Brown, the county manager.  Liberty County took over fire coverage of five other volunteer agencies as well, but the handoff in east Liberty was rocky.  Residents awoke on New Year’s Day of 2019 without fire coverage and discovered that the closest fire station was at least 15 miles away, according to a report in the Coastal Courier newspaper.  Liberty County Fire Services Chief Brian Darby Credit: Screenshot, Liberty County  Darby became the focus of criticism from residents a year-and-a-half into his tenure, according to press coverage at the time, especially over decisions about equipment.  County officials voted to lease some equipment from the defunct volunteer fire department for the newly professional agency run by Darby, but not the ladder trucks because they were in disrepair, according to Brown.  Darby’s budget in 2018 was small – just $272,000, with a staff of 16 part-time firefighters. Since then, the county has made large investments in the department’s budget every year, to its current $4.7 million.  By 2022 the force was budgeted for 54 staff, including the chief, who makes $88,233 per year. Part-timers made up 42% of the department.  The county still lacked a ladder truck.  Brown said that was due to price hikes caused by the Covid-related supply shortages. The county tried unsuccessfully to get a federal grant to buy one, he said.  Plans outpace fire department  Even as Darby struggled to staff and equip the expanded fire department, county officials picked up the pace of their economic development plans.  Since 2004 the Liberty County Development Authority has been marketing the eastern area of I-95 as a hub for logistics companies. The Tradeport East Logistical Center landed its first major client, Target Corp., a year later for a 1.5 million-square-foot distribution center.  In 2005, Liberty County wooed Target Corp. to build a 1.5 million square foot distribution center in its Tradeport East site. It began a wave of logistical industry business in the region, pushed for by county officials. Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current  Tradeport East has since added more warehouse tenants, including two tire companies and an ATV and dirt bike distributor.  Since January 2022, Liberty officials have approved at least 16 new warehouses in the east Liberty corridor, according to a review by The Current.  Growth has animated many local residents. Some have complained about the county’s lack of planning to handle the growing heavy truck traffic to their once-tranquil neighborhoods. Others, like David Kay, have worried about a lack of attention to fire safety.  At a July 2022 county commission meeting, Kay spoke out to oppose a plan to rezone over 400 acres next to Tradeport East for more warehouses.  Building warehouses there would be a violation of national fire and insurance recommendations, Kay said. Those codes require a four-minute response time to the warehouses and a ladder truck to respond – both standards that Liberty County Fire Services wouldn’t be able to meet.  “Liberty County is putting employees, firemen, first responders and the community at risk,” Kay told the county commissioners. “There’s nobody that can respond, and I don’t think that Liberty County has a ladder truck.”  At the time, the county had not updated its fire safety plan in over a decade. Liberty’s fire department also lacked community risk assessments and standard of cover reports.  Standard of cover reports help departments foresee special hazards and plan the department’s response. It is recommended by the National Fire Protection Association and considered standard operating procedure by other regional fire departments.  “I would say it’s a best practice. But most fire departments are going to have them,” Chatham Emergency Services Chief of Fire James Vickers said.  “You basically map out your response area, and decide the challenges and how you’re going to approach mitigating those challenges, if at all possible,” Vickers said. “And then you take care of all that (and) you put it in the standard of cover.”  While approving construction of 16 warehouses since January 2022, Liberty County does not have a map of where its fire hydrants are located. County Manager Joey Brown said they are working to create one. Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current  None of these reports were raised at the July 2022 Liberty County Commissioners meeting, or were agenda topics in other meetings last year.  At the time, County Commission Chairman Donald Lovette complained about receiving a “barrage of emails” from residents about the rezoning. Still, commissioners voted to approve the warehouse expansion last summer.  Dearth of coverage exacts a toll  On Nov. 20, Scott and Meredith Belford experienced the consequences of the county’s fire safety decisions.  The Belfords lived on Springfield Plantation in a salt marsh-adjacent two-story house. The house was built in 1925 on land Meredith’s family has owned since the mid-1700s (Disclosure: the Belfords are donors to The Current).  That evening the couple had started a fire in their fireplace and settled onto their sofa to watch “Bob’s Burgers” on television.  But soon after an ember danced down in front of the TV. Smoke covered the fireplace mantle.  Alarmed, they quickly called 911. Two fire engines, the chief’s car and a tanker truck arrived at 7:13 p.m. At the time, the fire was localized in the wall behind the fireplace.  The remains of the Belford’s historic home, Springfield. Credit: Jake Shore/The Current  By dawn the next morning, the home had burned to the ground, with only brick chimneys standing in the ashes.  Body camera footage from sheriff’s deputies and after-action reports by firefighters as well as interviews of people on the scene that night suggest that errors in training, planning and staffing played a role in the disaster. Lack of water and equipment only worsened the situation.  Shortly after the trucks arrived, two firefighters went inside the house and used a tool to pry open the wall’s paneling. They sprayed water directly at the flames and the fire was pushed upstairs, the reports said.  There firefighters discovered the attic was also alight, and heavy smoke filled the halls. They tried to pull a hose upstairs from outside but it was too short, the reports said.  A ladder truck normally is used to fight a second-story fire, according to firefighters.  While this was happening, firefighter Steven Nessmith, was ordered to fetch a tanker truck from the nearby Islands Fire Station, built in 2021 to service Tradeport East and area residents. When he arrived there, however, he couldn’t get into the station.  He returned without the tanker to the Belford property. By then, a lack of water was the chief concern.  “I established that the resources that we had on scene were not enough for the operation that was quickly devolving,” Nessmith wrote.  At 7:41 p.m., firefighter Cory Webb arrived in an engine to find the initial fire crew “sitting on the ground, looking and watching the house burn.”  The 3,000 gallons of water brought to the scene via tanker truck was not enough, according to Nessmith.  Rural fire departments that cover vast expanses with little access to fire hydrants, like Liberty County, generally have two methods of fighting blazes, according to the fire chief responsible for Chatham County. They draw from nearby natural water sources or relay trucks to the nearest hydrant to keep a constant supply of water.  A firefighter shoots water from ground floor into second floor fire, a task that firefighters say would have been easier with a ladder truck. Liberty County Fire Services did not have one the night of the Nov. 20, 2022, blaze. Credit: Liberty County Sheriff's Office body camera footage  “Overcoming a lack of water … It’s a huge challenge,” Vickers said. “That’s where pre-planning comes into place.”  At the Belford’s home, local firefighters did not do either effectively, after-action reports suggest.  Liberty County firefighters have what’s known as a “turbo draft,” to suck up water to fill water supplies, but on the night of the Belford fire it was not used on the nearby water sources, including the salt marsh and swimming pool. That’s because the department didn’t have the right adapter with them to draft the water, according to people at the scene.  The Islands Fire Station, meanwhile, has no water reservoir.  Instead, firefighters transported water throughout the night from the closest fire hydrant to the Belford property, located four miles away in Tradeport East.  By that point, Chief Darby had called other fire departments to help provide water and firefighters.  With water intermittently arriving by shuttling tankers, firefighters brought a hose into the house to try to fight the blaze directly. Confusion in the ranks stymied them.  “I was starting to get a good knock down on the fire from my location until someone from outside the house pulled the hose line so hard the nozzle flew out of my hand and down the stairs,” firefighter Cory Webb wrote in a report.  “I yelled to (another firefighter) who was actively trying to get the hose line back to me but was unsuccessful because the outside crew kept pulling it out of his hands,” Webb wrote. They exited the house after that.  Darby’s directions at the scene were not always effective. At one point he ordered his troops standing on the ground to shoot water into the second-floor windows.  Webb wrote the tactic “was having no effect on the fire’s growth.”  In body camera footage, a firefighter tells Chief Darby they can’t get up to the second-floor fire on Nov. 20, 2022. A ladder truck would have allowed them to fight the fire on the upper floor.  Webb and firefighter DeAnthony Wike reported that their colleagues were making errors when pumping water. “We lost water on the lines trying to attack the fire,” Wike wrote in a report.  Several firefighter reports said the house eventually reached a point where there was little anyone could do and collapse was imminent. Darby ordered everyone to back away and commence a “defensive attack,” a phase when firefighters are trying to keep a fire from spreading, instead of saving a structure. They continued to shoot water at the engulfed home.  The chaos and confusion enraged the Belfords. While they managed to retrieve their pets from the house, they watched helplessly as generations of historic artifacts and archives burned.  Toward the end of the fire, Darby approached Meredith Belford. After asking if Belford got her pets out, she said Darby posed a request.  “The next thing he said to me was, ‘I just don’t want you to say anything bad about me. Please don’t say anything bad about the department or me,’ ” according to Belford.  “The next thing he said to me was, ‘I just don’t want you to say anything bad about me. Please don’t say anything bad about the department or me.’” Meredith Belford, recalling conversation with Chief Darby  In Darby’s final report submitted to the Georgia State Fire Marshal’s Office, Darby detailed his arrival at the Belford residence and then his initial impressions. He did not include other details and failures noted by his force. He simply says that he called for “a defensive attack.”  The morning after the fire, an investigator sent by the State Fire Marshal’s office came to the scene and expanded on his own conclusions: “Due to inadequate water supply and difficulty in getting equipment in place to draft water from on-scene sources, fire conditions continue to worsen, and the fire scene transferred from offensive to defensive mode.”  County officials appeared to shield Darby from scrutiny in the days after the fire, according to emails reviewed by The Current.  On Nov. 23, an east Liberty resident wrote to county commissioners that residents wanted Chief Darby and other employees to appear at a Dec. 6 commission meeting to answer questions about fire safety.  County Manager Brown forwarded the email to Chairman Lovette and wrote, “Probably would not be advisable to have employees at the hearing for ‘questioning.’ ”  Liberty County Manager Joey Brown wrote in a Nov. 23, 2022 email to County Commission Chairman Donald Lovette that it would “not be advisable” to have Fire Chief Darby appear at a public meeting. Credit: Screenshot  Changes to protection come slowly  It’s unclear to what extent the Belford blaze has affected county development planning, or the pace of those plans.  Liberty County purchased a ladder truck from the Pooler Fire Department within a month of the fire.  However, at the start of the year, east Liberty residents submitted 56 public comments to oppose more planned changes to rezone the east Liberty corridor. Fifty-five were against the expansion; one was pro development, but expressed concern about a lack of infrastructure.  The lack of a fire safety plan suggests that Liberty officials do not know how much water it would take to douse a fire at Tradeport East, where businesses like the tire warehouse pose their own unique fire risks.

A residential home recently burned to the ground 1.5 miles from a fire station. What’s going to happen when a tire warehouse goes up in flames?” resident Marcie Hamilton wrote.  A recent NFPA report found a dramatic decrease in U.S. warehouse fires between 1980 and 2009. But such fires have been on the rise in 2019 and 2020 due to the increase in large warehouses and their inventories, it said.  The layout of industrial warehouses allows flames to spread quickly, according to Brian O’Connor, a technical services engineer with NFPA. While building codes require each warehouse to have its own sprinkler system, a blaze could tie up firefighters and trucks from multiple area departments for hours, he said.  In March county commissioners approved the additional rezoning.  Officials say upgrades, info in the works  It took more than four months for county officials to respond to requests for comment by The Current about fire safety issues.  Brown, the county manager, was the only senior official to detail the county’s fire safety strategies.  He said the county is contracting with an engineering firm to construct a fire hydrant map. He said the process will take three years due to the difficulties of compiling that data from the county’s eight different water systems.  As for the standard of cover that most fire departments have, Brown said Liberty is lacking one because it doesn’t have data collection and analysis capacity.  David Kay, 58, of Sunbury, said he is not against development, but he feels the county has not done its due diligence when allowing warehouses to come to the county with few conditions. “You could have had a ladder truck, you could have had fire equipment paid for by the developers.” Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current  The number of fires Liberty County Fire Services responded to in 2022 was 106, two less than its five-year high, according to data from the Office of Commissioner of Insurance and Fire Safety. The Hinesville fire department saw a similar pattern, the data show.  The county, however, does not have a fire hydrant map, while Hinesville does.  According to Brown, improvements in Liberty County Fire Services funding will bridge gaps in staffing, improve response times and allow for better equipment. But he also conceded that hiring enough firefighters has been a yearslong challenge. “There’s just not the people out there,” he said.  Kay, who lives in Sunbury and works as a commercial builder, said many problems could have been addressed with planning early on.  He said when he brought up the fire department lacking a ladder truck in July 2022, county officials responded with “we do the best we can.”  “As a builder, the best we can is you build to the code and you protect your residents,” Kay said. “And if you can’t follow the rules, you need to slow down until you can.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3VycmVudGdhLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2RldmVsb3BtZW50LWNvbnRpbnVlcy1hcy1saWJlcnR5LWNvdW50eS1maXJlLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tbGFncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-02","14:00:00","{""SubletteCounty"", ""Wyoming"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T20:41:00","The grass is greening up across Wyoming’s rangelands and that bodes well for now, but when it starts to dry out and big lightning storms hit later this summer and fall, it could make for a mean fire season, some wildland firefighters said.  “With the precipitation this winter and spring, the grass is going to come in pretty strong, and that’s the primary fire carrier when the fire season comes,” Cass Urbigkit -- the training officer and wildland firefighting coordinator for the Sublette County Unified Fire District – told Cowboy State Daily.  Prairie grass is a “one hour fuel,” he added. Meaning that, “even if it’s 100 % saturated, it will take only one hour of sunshine and wind for it to be dry again,” he said.  Campbell County Fire Department Deputy Chief J.R. Fox told Cowboy State Daily that lightning has already been stirring up a ruckus in his territory – but nothing too serious yet.  “With the last two rainstorms that have come through, we’ve seen some fairly significant lightning, but the light fuels are still too green to ignite,” he said. “Fast forward another month, or two months, and the situation could be quite different.”  Watching For The Monsoons  As summer approaches, Urbigkit said he pays close attention to weather patterns in southern California and the Great Basin region of California and Nevada. That’s because the weather there can create a “low pressure trough that will funnel precipitation into Wyoming throughout the summer,” he said.  That can mean “monsoon” storms dumping massive amounts of rain across the low country. One such storm slammed into Laramie last August, turning streets into rivers.  Those monsoon storms are a mixed blessing, Urbigkit said. On one hand, they bring much-needed moisture to the prairie.  However, they also “bring all the lightning,” he said. “When there’s a strong monsoon weather pattern, we see more fire starts.”  The torrential rains in the center of a monsoon storm might keep wildfires from igniting, but “dry lightning” around the edges can set prairie grass and sagebrush ablaze, he said.  Tough To Say How It Will Turn Out  Urbigkit and Fox said they both keep an eye on reports from the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)and other wildland firefighting outlets.  So far, the NIFC is predicting continued relatively mild temperatures and plentiful precipitation though early summer. Farther out, into July, August and beyond, it’s more difficult to say how things might go, they said.  “The seasonal outlooks and predictions can be really challenging, there are so many variables that can come into play,” Urbigkit said. “If we keep the pattern of consistent precipitation every coupled of weeks, it might not be much of a fire season.”  Fox said green-up appears to be “about on time” in central and north-central Wyoming. That means the grass might start turning brown, and then reaching that dangerously crispy stage, sometime in July.  In western Wyoming, Urbigkit said green-up is lagging about a month behind normal, in the wake of a brutal winter and cooler, overcast spring. So, that means the time of heightened fire danger there could likewise be farther out.  And it’s not just grass he’s concerned about. Sagebrush can become fuel for massive fires later in the year.  Sagebrush generally starts to “go dormant” in August, he said. The brush starts pulling its moisture deeper into the roots, for storage over the fall and winter. That makes the tops of the sage brush go dry and brittle – perfect fodder for lightning strikes.  “That leave the sagebrush very susceptible for carrying fire,” he said.  Forest Fires A Concern Too  Some foresters recently told Cowboy State Daily that the outlook for forest fires looks about normal this year, even though massive blazes in Canada recently poured smoke into Wyoming and the surrounding region.  Urbigkit said he doesn’t discount the possibility of big forest fires in his region this year. Prime time for forest fires is usually later in the summer, and can run through October.  Trees and fallen logs in forests tend to be “100 or 1,000-hour fuels,” he said. They can take up to 1,000 hours for a soaked log to become dangerously dry.  However, the moisture from this year’s massive snowpacks and spring rains have made for robust undergrowth in some forested areas. And that’s frequently where forest fires start, he said.  “It (fire) is on the ground in the morning, and if you get wind and sun, by 2 p.m., it’s gotten up into the tree canopy,” Urbigkit said.

Two occupants escaped without major injury.  “When I arrived on scene, the house was fully involved, with fire coming through the roof and the roof collapsing into the house,” Edgecomb Fire Chief Roy Potter said.  The Lincoln County Communications Center paged his department at 1:56 a.m. for the structure fire at 58 Old County Road.  “While I was en route, I saw the glow and embers as I crested the hill by my fire station, and I sounded a second alarm,” he said.  The Alna, Boothbay, Damariscotta, Newcastle, Nobleboro, Wiscasset, and Woolwich fire departments responded as mutual aid shortly afterwards.  “Once I got on scene, I knew it was going to be a defensive attack,” Potter said. “We got a water supply set up, and we were able to get it extinguished.”  Elaine Wooster and her son, Theodore Wooster, were the only occupants of the home that night.  They left their cell phones in the house when the fire began, according to Potter, and drove to a relative’s house to call the fire department. Both went to LincolnHealth’s Miles Campus in Damariscotta in private vehicles, Potter said, and later returned to the scene.  He said the home had collapsed on itself and was a total loss. Potter did not know if it had been insured. The department called an excavator to remove rubble so departments could fully extinguish the site after the state fire marshal’s office investigated.  Potter said Maine State Fire Marshal concluded that the fire’s cause will remain undetermined, as not enough of the structure remained to provide evidence.  The fire was not suspicious in nature, according to Potter.  The scene was cleared around 8:30 a.m.  “I want to thank all the mutual aid towns that come” when his department needs assistance, Potter said. “We’re all shorthanded, and we have to call in a lot more towns now in order to get the manpower.”  Share this: Facebook  Twitter  LinkedIn  Reddit  More  Print  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbGNubWUuY29tL2N1cnJlbnRuZXdzL2ZpcmUtZGVzdHJveXMtZWRnZWNvbWItaG9tZS1vY2N1cGFudHMtZXNjYXBlLXdpdGhvdXQtbWFqb3ItaW5qdXJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hohenberger, who had been with the Argyle Fire District (now Denton County ESD No. 1) for 30 years, was indicted on 13 counts by a federal grand jury and arrested by the FBI in November 2022. Hohenberger was accused of taking money from the operating account of the fire district (which received federal funds in the form of Medicare reimbursements) and used over $490,000 of those funds to pay personal credit card bills, including in part cash advances at casinos, payments related to a family member’s business in Hawaii and other personal uses, according to the indictment.  “Throughout the last six months, the emergency services provided by the firefighters, paramedics and emergency medical technicians of the Denton County ESD No. 1 remains steadfast as they continue to deliver excellent service to the citizens of our community,” the ESD said in a statement. “The Denton County ESD No. 1 is committed to supporting the personnel impacted by these allegations as the federal court administers this case and subsequent plea.”  Hohenberger is also alleged to have failed to fund firefighter retirement accounts in the time required by federal regulations and thus embezzled or stole the funds, and that he made false statements related to the firefighter retirement plan on a form submitted to the Department of Labor.  After the court hearing, Hohenberger remains out on bail and will be sentenced at a later date. Hohenberger, 64, faces up to 10 years in federal prison.  “We are pleased he pleaded guilty,” said Sam Johnson, president of the Argyle Professional Fire Fighters Association. “We hope the court recognizes the damages that the department has sustained and the hurt the members have experienced, and that they give no favor or leniency in sentencing.”  In a statement, Johnson called the last six months a “difficult and dark chapter for Argyle and its professional firefighters.”  “While we are very thankful to the FBI and the U.S. criminal justice system, the damage from Hohenberger’s theft has left our department and public safety in jeopardy.”  Johnson said that as a result of a mismanaged budget by the ESD’s previous board, the fire district has a deficit of $1.5 million, and could run out of payroll funding by August or September without financial support from local, county and/or state governments.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyb3NzdGltYmVyc2dhemV0dGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvZm9ybWVyLWFyZ3lsZS1maXJlLWNoaWVmLXBsZWFkcy1ndWlsdHktdG8tZmVkZXJhbC1jaGFyZ2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On May 27, 2022, the vessel was conducting a sea trial in Shilshole Bay when its no. 3 diesel generator engine suffered a mechanical failure, resulting in an engine room fire that caused $1.1 million in damages.  After maintenance was completed on all four main diesel generator engines in January and February 2022, full-function tests of vessel systems were conducted in open waters. During the sea trial, the engineering crew heard a “large bang” and observed flames near the no. 3 main engine. The crew extinguished the fire using the vessel’s carbon dioxide fixed fire-extinguishing system.  As a result of the mechanical failure and ruptured engine block, the no. 3 main engine was damaged beyond repair. The area in the engine room around and above the no. 3 main engine sustained smoke and heat damage. Wiring harnesses on the remaining engines, electrical cables, lighting fixtures, walkways, and control cables in the engine room required replacement.  NTSB investigators found that the no. 3 main engine’s main bearing journals had been machined down to a smaller diameter, and undersized bearings were installed at some point prior to the 2022 maintenance.  Subsequently, during the 2022 maintenance, Caterpillar service technicians did not identify the bearing’s part number on the service report and replaced it with a standard-sized one. The bearing’s incorrect size allowed lube oil to leak from the larger clearances of the bearing. The decreased lube oil supply pressure resulted in a rapid temperature increase of the connecting rod bearings and multiple engine components breaking free while the engine was running.  “When maintenance is performed, correct replacement of machinery components is critical to ensuring safe and reliable vessel operation,” the report stated. “Vessel crews and equipment manufacturer technicians should carefully identify and document part numbers of all components removed from shipboard equipment. Tracking systems are an effective form of record-keeping that can be used to ensure proper replacement part selection for reinstallation.”  Following the engine failure and fire, the local Caterpillar service company switched to a new service tracking system that allows technicians to upload pictures and reports on their cell phones to improve documentation and information sharing between technicians.

The KCK Fire Department said the fire happened at the former Franklin Elementary building near S. 14th Street and Metropolitan Avenue.  About two hours after crews were dispatched, the fire was extinguished.  Fire officials have not released any information on the cause of the fire, but there is significant damage to the building’s roof.  “It’s a big building. That’s why when the roof collapsed, for the safety of firefighters, we switched from offensive to defensive strategy, just to extinguish the majority of the fire,” KCK Assistant Fire Chief Scott Schaunaman said. “One of the citizens was asking me how the building is and if it’s salvageable, and right now, I don’t have an answer for you until we get inside.”  The former KCK school building has been on the National and State Registers of Historic Places since 2013, according to the Kansas Historical Society.

The school closed in 1973 and sat vacant for several years before it was sold in 1978 to the Franklin Center, Inc. The organization used the school as a community building for over 30 years.  “This is like a community staple. We’re obviously devastated,” Topher Phil Green, chairman of the Franklin Center Board, said. “It’s devastating to everybody involved. Lots of tears as we see people come up. This was the worst case.”  In 2009, the Franklin school was abandoned and boarded up, resulting in significant vandalism damage. But two years later, neighbors reinstated the Franklin Center, Inc. with plans to once again revitalize it.  While the group did make some improvements around 2015, the community center has not reopened. The Franklin Center still holds frequent mobile food pantries with Harvesters in the parking lot for KCK families.  “We’re just surprised and upset about what that will mean for that ministry here,” neighbor Emily Rietema said.  “It’s hard.

The President of the Association, Chanley Delk said Big Spring Fire fighters already operate on 25% less than the national minimum standard, and these proposed cuts would cut an additional one-third in at least 40% of the city.  Now, Monday morning during Big Spring City Council meeting, the community was asked by the Big Spring PFFA to join the association to show their opposition to the proposed fire cuts.  “There’s not a problem not a problem that if we work together we can’t solve. We’re just going to keep working to make big spring a better and a safer place,” said Delk.  Under the Safer Grant, the City of Big Spring added staffing to the fire department, but now, the grant comes to an end and Big Spring City Council has proposed major cuts to their fire departments, on top.  Cuts that Delk said are too drastic for the community.  Delk said, “Any cuts to closing a fire station is going to delay fire response, EMS response, things that are just critical, especially to a community of our size, that we don’t need to cut.”  The proposed cuts would lower the number of firefighters in the community by 10 positions, only leaving the minimum staffing number of 17 firefighters, and would also permanently close Fire Station 2.  “Which would further mean a 20% further reduction in staffing and we’re just, for the safety of the community, for the safety of our residents, for the safety of our firefighters, we’re just opposed to any cuts of fire protection and fire service,” he emphasized.  He said funding is the biggest issue.  “You know we want to be good stewards of city resources but just look in the contracts of the budget and find room. I think there’s room to operate the fire department safely.”  Monday, when the council presented the proposed cuts, they were flooded with those in the community looking to help fight.  “We were at fire capacity for the city of chamber, we actually had firemen go out and stand outside so we could pull our community members in,” he said with a smile. “That overwhelming show of support just makes us feel that we’re doing a good job. It means the world to us.”  Delk continued to thank the community of Big Spring for their support.

The findings of this study were published in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science Reports.  The revelations uncovered by this research could rewrite our understanding of the history of human evolution as we know it.  Light my fire: The importance of fire in human history  The use of fire is one of the most important innovations in human history, and in fact, is considered a huge turning point that allowed humanity to achieve global dominance.  Homo sapiens, from the start, had achieved through evolution a few key traits that them stand out in their ecosystem. This included their high intelligence and opposable thumbs; the ability to run for long distances without stopping; and the ability to throw projectiles very far and fast, turning a rock into a deadly weapon.  Fire (Illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY)  But it was fire that saw humanity become able to spread. It allowed mankind to move out of Africa and into colder climates, with the fire helping keep them warm. The use of fire was also a defensive tool, helping keep would-be predators at bay. It also let humans cook their food, increasing calorie count and helping kill germs that can fester in raw meat.  The earliest known use of controlled fire was found in Africa over a million years ago. Outside of the African continent, the earliest known use of controlled fire was found in Israel's Gesher Benot Ya'aqov site, which dates back 790,000 years ago.  But for Europe, previous evidence suggests that fire was first used 200,000 years ago.  However, that may have changed.  The researchers behind the study investigated the Valdocarros II site in Spain, which is known to have a number of ancient archaeological relics from hundreds of thousands of years ago.  Here, the scientists were able to find evidence that not only were things deliberately being burnt but they were done so in an organized way, based on how the remains from the fires were organized.  What does this mean?  According to the study, the remnants of the fire were arranged as if they were encircling something. This could mean it was used as a way to keep animals at bay or to cook food.  What makes this study stand out, though was the methodology.  Normally, researchers analyze early uses of fire by trying to study the remains in ancient hearths. These archaeological finds can contain charcoal or signs of burning and are direct evidence of human-controlled fire.  This study, however, chose a different route: Geochemistry, which means studying the Earth by analyzing the chemicals that make up its rocks and minerals.  This method allows for the site to be studied using chemical analysis, rather than just studying the remnants themselves.  This presents some advantages. Most notably, some of this evidence may have lasted longer, surviving the passage of time rather than eroding.  However, further research is needed. By analyzing some of the tools found near these ancient hearths, the scientists can hopefully be able to tell how they were used in relation to the fire. That, too, could grant further insight into the distant past.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9hcmNoYWVvbG9neS9hcnRpY2xlLTc0NDE1OdIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vYXJjaGFlb2xvZ3kvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDQxNTkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Petrucelli said students told him they overheard conversations of a sexual nature and “statements that students felt should never be discussed in front of the public.”  In response, Chief Brade told Petrucelli he was “extremely upset” by the reports and that the fire district would, “both be looking into the matter further, and taking appropriate action to ensure our staff are not acting in a manner as described.”  In a follow up email about a week later, Petrucelli said another student had come forward with a complaint.  “During these clinical rotations there was a dinner prepared that was inappropriate, a meatloaf shaped like a large penis. Subsequently on another shift discussions took place on this dinner,” he wrote.  In another instance, a member of the fire department reportedly bent over and said to a male student, “I bet you are looking at my a**.”  In response, the fire district hired an attorney to investigate the alleged incidents of sexual misconduct.

There were no reported injuries in the fire, but the building suffered extensive damage to its roof and attic space.  At about 3:30 p.m., the Fire Department was notified by a 911 call of a fire with a possible explosion in a commercial facility at 41 Lowell St., according to a press release. The release did not specify any businesses operating out of that address.  The first companies to arrive at the scene found smoke and fire showing from the roof and exterior walls. Chief William Farrell struck a second alarm to bring additional manpower to the scene.  With no fire hydrants in the area, companies had to stretch several hundred feet of hose line from a nearby pond to establish a reliable water supply.  Crews initially attacked the fire from the exterior of the building, which was closed and not occupied at the time of the fire, according to the press release. Firefighters later gained access to the building and attacked the fire from inside, until the roof became compromised and was in danger of collapse.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Dunstable Fire Department, with assistance from the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit attached to the State Fire Marshal’s Office.  Firefighters from Pepperell, Groton, Tyngsboro, Townsend, Westford and Ayer, as well as Hudson, Hollis and Nashua, New Hampshire, provided mutual aid at the scene. PrideStar EMS also responded.

"fire","2016-05-01","00:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T04:00:00","Not for the first time in recent years, a major fire has consumed a public building in the Caribbean Community headquarters nation of Guyana, killing more than a dozen people. This time, however, the victims are all schoolchildren between the ages of 12–18 years old.  Most were asleep late Sunday in dormitories at the Mahdia secondary school in the southwestern jungle and mountain community near the Brazilian border when the fire broke out, trapping dozens of students in concrete buildings secured by iron grills that limited them from escaping.  According to authorities, the fire at the school—which had been designed and built mostly for indigenous students living in villages far away from Mahdia—began just before midnight and burned for several hours. By the time it died down and the smoke cleared, with the help of the area fire service, at least 19 high school students were killed and at least seven were badly burned and rushed by air to the city, about 200 miles away—14 died at the scene, while five others succumbed at the nearby district hospital.  Fire service headquarters in the city said officers and residents rescued at least 20 other students by punching holes into the building, saving them from certain death.  Students who live in villages beyond the mountains often return home only at the end of the academic term, while those from places closer to the gold and diamond mining town would visit parents and relatives at weekends. Police said keys to locked doors could not have been found in time to rescue those who perished.  No one has so far been arrested or held responsible for this tragedy.  The deaths of the children have plunged this oil- and gas-rich republic of nearly a million people into deep mourning, reigniting a debate about whether iron grills should be used to secure buildings of this nature, especially those used to house restless youths with minimum adult supervision.  The latest disaster also brings back memories of a May 2016 fire at the maximum security Georgetown Prisons in the capital that killed 17 inmates and injured eight others. Back then, prisoners, protesting a slew of complaints from poor food to overcrowding to long delays in court trials, had set fire to mattresses in cells. Officers say the fire raged so badly out of control that there was little they could have done to rescue prisoners and that they were badly outnumbered at the facility that had housed 1,100 prisoners guarded by less than 70 officers. That was the worst prison inferno in living memory.  Government officials, including President Irfaan Ali and Prime Minister Mark Phillips, journeyed to Mahdia on Monday, hoping to get explanations about what exactly happened and to comfort grieving relatives and friends. Officials said they are extremely worried about parents who live outside mobile phone signal areas and might not hear of the news for a few days yet.  The main opposition coalition said in a statement that is demanding “a thorough investigation into this horrific incident that has resulted in the loss of innocent young lives. In light of this tragedy, we wish to call on all to make this independence day (May 26) a day of mourning in solidarity and support with the families, friends, relatives, and the citizens of Mahdia.”  President Ali said in a statement that “we have lost beautiful souls in that fire.

""Mayday relay. Mayday relay. Mayday relay,"" the Canadian Coast Guard radio blared as it rebroadcast the ship's plea for aid, adding coordinates and instructions. The guard heard the initial call for help at about 10 p.m. Tuesday. ""All stations, all stations, all stations.""  The U.S. and Canadian Coast Guards, along with other vessels, swung into action. The overnight rescue ended the next day with the 20 crew members aboard safe, and a ship the size of two football fields anchored and damaged about 2 nautical miles northeast of Pelee Island.  In many ways, the nautical mishap is another example of the dangers that sailors face, but hope to never encounter, on the water that often are out of public view. In this case, a small bit of the drama was caught on video and audio, and, Coast Guard Petty Officer Jessica Fontenette in Cleveland said, had a good ending.  ""Everybody was fine,"" Fontenette told the Free Press early Wednesday. ""Of course, there's always the chance it could have been much worse, but, luckily, they were able to contain the fire and no one was injured, and no one had to abandon ship.""  The rescue team included a Coast Guard helicopter from Detroit that circled the freighter, as it was poised to rescue crew if needed, and recorded the incident from the air.  Still, Fontenette said, bad things happen and that's why ships call out for help, and everyone who can, responds, so ""it doesn't turn into a tragic event."" A mayday on the water, like a 911 call on land, is something that immediately lets everyone know ""you are in distress.""  It's unclear, she said, what caused the fire, how extensive the damage is or how long the freighter — which was carrying a load of stone — would be anchored there. Pelee Island, Canada's southernmost populated point, is the largest island in the western half of Lake Erie.  It is about halfway between Sandusky, Ohio, to the south; and Leamington, Canada, to the north.  Earlier this month, an electronics malfunction forced a new freighter, the Mark W. Barker, to lose power, then maneuverability, on the Detroit River and run aground, leaving it stranded for several hours. No one was injured in that incident, but it created a public stir that made national news.  More:Tugboat frees freighter after it runs aground in Detroit River near Belle Isle  More:Michigan introduces double red flags to beach warning system: What to know  In addition to the possibility of injury or death, big ships can block shipping lanes, pollute waterways, and if their hulls are breached, be difficult to move.  In contrast to the Mark W. Barker, the Cuyahoga, however, is an old ship.  The vessel, which is more than 600 feet long, was built in 1943 by the American Ship Building Co. and flies under the Canadian flag. The video, the Sault News reported, has had three name changes since its birth. Its original name, Mesabi, was quickly changed to the J. Burton Ayers.  And in 1995, the name changed again to the Cuyahoga in honor of Ohio's winding Cuyahoga River.  Fontenette said that in addition to a Coast Guard helicopter from Detroit, a rescue boat from Marblehead, and three more vessels from the Canadian Coast Guard were dispatched to help. A tugboat, and at least two other freighters —- the Indiana Harbor and Radcliffe R. Latimer — offered assistance.  By Wednesday eight crew members, identified as ""non-essential,"" were taken off the Cuyahoga, the rest stayed behind on to evaluate the damage and potentially make repairs, the Coast Guard said.  The rescue agency also posted a 10-second clip of the ship, taken at night by the Detroit-stationed helo. It ended its post with ""BZ to all involved!"" BZ — Bravo Zulu — is a Naval signal conveyed by flag-hoist or voice radio, meaning ""well done,"" followed by single word: ""#interagency.""

At about 1 a.m., a person on a scooter is seen riding toward a garbage can outside the restaurant, reaching into their pocket and then putting something in the garbage can before walking away. Moments later, the garbage can catches fire.  A few minutes later, another person begins to spray the garbage can with some sort of liquid while holding what appears to be a phone in their other hand, presumable calling for help.  The San Francisco Fire Department said it is reviewing the videos and said the cause of the fire is still under investigation.

The fire at 222 Brooklyn Ave. started just before 5 a.m. on Wednesday and quickly engulfed the entire building, according to neighbors and video on the Citizen app.  The FDNY said 130 firefighters responded to the two-alarm fire, with four of them sustaining injuries. By the time the blaze was under control at around 8:40 a.m., only the building's outer shell remained.  Decades before 222 Brooklyn Ave. drew attention for the fire, it made headlines as the home of the LeGrand family. The patriarch, Devernon LeGrand, was a self-described preacher who ran a cult-like church out of the building. He and his stepson were convicted of killing and dismembering two teenage girls in 1977. Dozens of people reportedly disappeared from the house and were never found.  LeGrand reportedly lured young girls and women to his home with promises of money and alcohol, and then forced them to panhandle for money, often making them pose as nuns.  On Wednesday afternoon, as neighbors passed by the four-story townhome, where workers were building scaffolding, many expressed fear about discussing the family.  Several locals who grew up near the house told Gothamist they did not want to speak on the record, because the family was powerful in the city. Others said the family’s influence and notoriety kept the area safe — no one looking for trouble dared to cross their path, they said. Some expressed relief that the building burned down.  Tracey, 57, who only shared her first name out of concern for her safety, has lived in Crown Heights most of her life. She remembers being warned to stay away from 222 Brooklyn Ave. when she was a child, and having to strategize her route to avoid walking too close to the LeGrand house on her way to her church, which is across the street.  “I just was like, OK, I will listen to my family and stay away like I'm supposed to because I didn't wanna go missing,” Tracey said. “I didn't know to the extent of what was truly, truly happening in there — it's all hearsay, I should say.”  Lauren Meyer has lived in the area for five years, and often walks her dog past the building. She said she noticed people living inside on and off, even while it was boarded up, but did not know who those people were.  Though she wasn’t aware of the building’s history, she said she’s always felt something was off.  “It's just spooky,” Meyer said. “It's just always been kind of like… very desolate looking, in an area that typically there aren't that many places that are empty like that and boarded up.”  The FDNY is investigating the cause of the fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZ290aGFtaXN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpcmUtZGVzdHJveXMtbm90b3Jpb3VzLWhvdXNlLW9mLWhvcnJvcnMtaW4tY3Jvd24taGVpZ2h0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Around 90 firefighters worked around the clock to extinguish the flames.  The fire killed two people.  Charlotte Fire's investigation determined the cause of the fire was accidental. An insulation foam sprayer caught fire on the ground floor while in use.  “Personally, I like using fiberglass insulation, because it’s a lot easier,"" Seabury said.  Seabury said he doesn't use the spray foam but knows people who swear by it. He said the application process is fast.  “They're like, 'I can save time on this, I can save -- what you do and I can do that in half a day, I can do two jobs when you do one,'” Seabury said.  But while it's faster, safety concerns have been raised. The EPA warned if ignited, the fire could release toxic chemicals into the air.  During the South Park fire, Charlotte Fire and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department warned everyone about the air quality. It said it wasn't sure what was in the air.  WCNC Charlotte called Home Depot and was told spray foam insulation is easily accessible and can be bought in-store, though a worker said they avoid it if possible.    “It would be better to use to [a] roll because there are chemicals in the spray,"" the Home Depot worker said.  Seabury said he can see the positives to using the spray foam, but said it isn't worth the risks.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53Y25jLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY29udHJhY3RvcnMtaW5zdWxhdGlvbi1zb3V0aC1wYXJrLWZpcmUtY2hhcmxvdHRlLzI3NS05OTBiNDU3YS02YzEzLTQwZTYtYWE2OS00NjYyNTQwOWIzYzLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2NuYy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb250cmFjdG9ycy1pbnN1bGF0aW9uLXNvdXRoLXBhcmstZmlyZS1jaGFybG90dGUvMjc1LTk5MGI0NTdhLTZjMTMtNDBlNi1hYTY5LTQ2NjI1NDA5YjNjMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Maine authorities announced Wednesday the state fire marshal’s office is working with the state's chief medical examiner to identify the remains. The hotel fire death, the first Kittery fatal fire victim in three years, was announced May 18 by the town fire department and Maine Fire Marshal Rich McCarthy, a day after the devastating fire.  “Once the remains have been identified, there will be an updated statement,” Lt. Thomas Pickering of Maine State Police stated Wednesday morning.  Smoke could be seen from afar as the Days Inn burned to the ground last week, with debris blown across the roadway and brush fires popping up as far away as State Road due to dry and windy conditions. Minor property damage was caused to a nearby residence and the roof of a gazebo in the neighboring lot.  The cause of the fire has not been released by investigators.

Firefighters took six hours to bring under control the fire at the hotel, which was built in 1956 and did not have a sprinkler system, Kittery Fire Chief David O'Brien said previously.  2 million gallons of water used to fight fire at Days Inn  Town Manager Kendra Amaral told Town Council members this week the blaze required mutual aid assistance from 14 area municipalities from Maine and New Hampshire, in addition to fire crews from Pease and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  Responding to the fire, along with Kittery’s fire and police departments, were fire crews from the following communities: Dover, Greenland, Newington, Newmarket, Portsmouth, Rollinsford and Rye in New Hampshire, as well as Berwick, Eliot, Ogunquit, South Berwick, Wells, York and York Beach.  “That is how many firefighters and how much apparatus it took to ensure that that building fire was handled in a safe manner and was able to prevent the spread of uncontrolled fires,” Amaral said.  The town’s public works department fueled the fire trucks on scene throughout the day, while the Kittery Water District provided additional water.  More than 2 million gallons of water were used, Amaral reported.  “It was exceptionally large,” she told councilors.  More local news:Glenn Close, 'Property Brothers' shoot 'Celebrity IOU' backyard makeover in Eliot, Maine  The town manager praised the town’s fire department leadership and called on residents to regularly check their smoke and fire detectors, as well as note weather conditions listed in daily fire danger reports.  Amaral cited the town’s stock of older buildings like the Days Inn, which was built before state law mandated each building has operating sprinkler systems.  “These buildings that are balloon construction, which catch faster and go up quicker, they’re buildings without fire suppression so they don't have sprinkler systems automatically and they don't have hardwired fire alarm systems,” she explained. “So we are seeing as our building stock continues to get older that this is going to be a greater danger as we go forward. There's not much we can do about that. This is one of the beautiful things about living in an old New England town. We have a lot of beautiful, wonderful old buildings, but that also means we have a higher fire danger.”  Previous coverage:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYWNvYXN0b25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQva2l0dGVyeS1kYXlzLWlubi1maXJlLWRlY2Vhc2VkLXZpY3RpbS1ub3QtaWRlbnRpZmllZC83MDIzNTk2NzAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WMTV) - Firefighters are continuing to work to put out a fire at a recycling facility off of Highway 16, the Portage Fire Department reported Thursday. People in the area are being asked to stay away from Highway 16 while crews work to fight the fire.  Officials say two firefighters were hurt while trying to extinguish the fire. It’s believed one firefighter overheated and the other one has a knee sprain.  Over 90 percent of the fire is currently contained at the recycling facility.  Columbia County Dispatch Center received reports of the fire just after 2 p.m. at the Columbia County Recycling and Waste Processing Facility. The agency told NBC15 earlier in the afternoon that crews were responding to three separate fires at the time.  According to the Columbia Co. Sheriff’s Office, several storage buildings were fully engulfed in flames when agencies first arrived, but the main recycling center remains unharmed.  Portage Fire Department Chief Troy Haase said one bale of cardboard was on fire and started to spread rapidly, quickly stretching to three structures. Haase said cardboard, garbage and recyclables were all on fire.  Columbia County Recycling and Waste Processing Wednesday, May 24. (NBC15)  There was a large fire just 10 days ago at the Columbia County Recycling and Waste Processing Facility, with nearly eight agencies battling the fire the evening of Sunday, May 14. The three-story building was considered a total loss. Haase said the sheriff’s office will be investigating to determine if Wednesday’s fire is in any way related to the previous one, but there was no information on that yet.  Wind was a factor in making Wednesday’s fire more difficult to attack than last week’s, according to Haase.  “It’s in the open this time,” Haase said. “Before it was inside that building, so we could control it inside there. No it’s out in the open, so the wind caught it and took it.”  A large plume of smoke could be seen on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation’s 511 camera on I-39 at WIS 33.  Haase said more crews plan to arrive at 6 a.m. Thursday. One building has all bales of cardboard inside, which Haase said is difficult to extinguish.  A large plume of smoke could be seen Wednesday afternoon from the Wisconsin DOT camera. (Wisconsin Department of Transportation 511)  Haase estimated 30 different agencies were on scene fighting the fire. Crews with Lodi Area Fire Dept., Town of Delton Fire Dept., Prairie du Sac Fire Dept., Wyocena Fire Dept., Baraboo Fire Dept., Arlington EMS and Montello Fire Dept. were all seen at the facility Wednesday. Columbia County Sheriff’s Office was also at the facility, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources was on scene to ensure no wildfires were birthed from the facility fire.

The Cause of the Apartment Fire in Sulphur  According to Sulphur Fire Chief Dan Selph, the fire broke out when a woman using an oxygen machine attempted to light a cigarette. Selph told KPLC reporter Theresa Schmidt,  She was lighting her cigarette with a candle she had lit in her residence, and it ignited and was accelerated by the oxygen therapy she was using.  If you're not aware, oxygen is very flammable and those who use it are cautioned not to use it around open flames such as candles and cigarettes. Oddly enough, Sulphur officials confirmed to the KPLC reporter that this was not the first time a fire had been started by someone attempting to smoke while using oxygen.

The fire broke out Tuesday evening as thunderstorms passed over his house, McClellan said. Fire investigators are now looking at whether a lightning strike sparked the blaze.  “It really started thundering, lightning,” he added.  He and his wife realized something was wrong when the smoke alarms went off.  “I could see smoke drifting past the window,” McClellan said.  He suspects lightning hit the chimney, traveled down the metal flue, and sparked the fire inside.  “It was just smoke that was seeping out of the cracks and only on this chimney,” McClellan said.  McClellan and his wife were able to get out of the home unharmed. He then tried spraying water at the chimney with a garden hose, but the fire kept growing.  “We had fire through the roof,” said Jake Beck, the deputy fire chief for the Lone Peak Fire District.  When firefighters arrived, the flames spread fast through the attic, Beck said. Fortunately, they had help from the Lehi Fire Department, which flew its drone over the blaze.  “Street level views only tell me so much, and having those aerial shots, I was able to direct water streams better, able to direct crews better,” Beck said.  The deputy fire chief said fire investigators are also looking at a lightning strike as a possible cause.  “It would make sense that lightning would hit there,” Beck said of the chimney. “It sits up above the house.

[Episcopal News Service] A late morning fire destroyed St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Douglas, Arizona, on May 22. A church-owned house next door also was destroyed. First Presbyterian Church, next door to the church house, also suffered severe fire damage. No one was injured. The cause of the blazes that hit both buildings remains under investigation, Arizona Bishop Jennifer Reddall told Episcopal News Service on May 23.  The fire at St. Stephen’s was discovered at about 11 a.m. on May 22, with flames visible both in the church and the church house. Minutes later observers noticed that the Presbyterian church also was on fire. The co-minister of First Presbyterian, the Rev. Peggy Christiansen, told a Tucson TV station that the two fires appear to have begun separately. “As the day went on, we were told [our] fire did not start from the Episcopal church. But rather, it was an independent fire. Somehow our fire started inside our church, and theirs started in theirs,” she said.  In a May 23 email to the diocese, Reddall said local police and fire officials and representatives from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, began investigating the evening of the fire.  Douglas is a town of about 16,000 people located on the U.S.-Mexican border. The town’s mayor, Donald Huish, on May 23 told a Tucson TV station that the origin of the two fires “does look suspicious.”  St. Stephen’s church itself is a total loss, Reddall said. “The walls caved in,” she told ENS. The office was heavily damaged and the church house also was a total loss. The parish hall is still standing and appears to be intact, although until there is access to the building, that remains unclear, she added.  Reddall made the four-hour trip from Phoenix to Douglas for a 7 p.m. English-Spanish bilingual prayer service on May 22. She joined the church’s vicar, the Rev. John Caleb Collins, on the street across from the church building to offer prayers and to give thanks for both congregations’ decades of ministry – 122 years for St. Stephen’s and 119 years for First Presbyterian. They were joined by members of both churches, residents of Douglas and the pastor of Grace United Methodist Church. That church, along with First Baptist Church and the two burned churches, occupy the four corners of one square city block.  In her email to the diocese, Reddall said that those who gathered “shared our sure and certain hope that while church buildings can be gutted by fire, the true church, the church of the people of God, cannot be burned down.” But she noted, “that does not take away the deep grief and loss of a space made sacred by generations of baptisms, Eucharists, quinceañeras, weddings and burials.”  St. Stephen’s is a small congregation, Reddall told ENS, that is both bilingual and bicultural and has in the past been active, along with First Presbyterian, in providing a place where people who have crossed the border can stay before traveling north to Tucson. “That’s part of the identity of both these places,” the bishop said.  Reddall said in her email to the diocese that she will be joining the congregation for worship on May 28 at 11:30 a.m. at St. John’s in Bisbee, about 30 miles northwest of Douglas, and invited others to join them as well.  She added that no plans for the future of the building can be made until investigators release the buildings, but the diocese is seeking donations to help the St. Stephen’s community.  –Melodie Woerman is a freelance writer and former director of communications for the Diocese of Kansas.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVwaXNjb3BhbG5ld3NzZXJ2aWNlLm9yZy8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L2FyaXpvbmEtZXBpc2NvcGFsLWNodXJjaC1vbi10aGUtdXMtbWV4aWNvLWJvcmRlci1kZXN0cm95ZWQtYnktZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Reports of the fire on Dyre Avenue and Light Street in Eastchester, right by the station serving the No. 5 line, came in shortly before 6 a.m. Wednesday. Dramatic footage captured a scene more reflective of a post-apocalyptic fit to ""End of Days"" than a regular Wednesday sunrise in New York City.  Video from the Citizen App showed flames devouring a box truck carrying propane tanks and epoxy. That epoxy was released from the truck and went under other vehicles, leaving eight cars burned, the FDNY said.  The flames engulfed multiple cars and whipped up next to homes. By the time the fire was finally doused, all that remained of the burnt vehicles was a charred mess.  Get Tri-state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox.

Prioritize safety by following these guidelines:  Recreational fires are allowed in the City of Mankato without a permit as long as state provisions are met and the fire is used for cooking, social or recreational purposes.  Fire pits, fire rings, or fireplaces must be 25-feet from any building, wood pile, dry brush, dry grass, flammables or other combustibles.  If using an enclosed fireplace, keep at least 15-feet from any building or other combustible objects.  Materials permitted in a recreational fire are wood from trees, small branches, brush or charcoal. Use clean wood with a maximum wood pile that is two feet high by three feet in diameter.  Treated lumber materials, construction debris, grass, garbage, plastic or waste materials are fire hazards and are not allowed to be burned in recreational fires. (Minnesota state statute 88.171)  Someone must attend the recreational fire until it burns out completely or is extinguished. (Minnesota state fire code section 307.5)  Keep a fire extinguisher, hose, sand, bucket or shovel nearby so the fire can be quickly and properly extinguished.  Once done with recreational fire, place remains in metal can, soak in water and allow at least 24 hours to cool before discarding them. Proper disposal can help prevent a fire from restarting and causing damage.  Ashes should be spread in gardens, buried on the property, or disposed of in a landfill.  Extinguish fires immediately if they pose a fire safety risk, are not in compliance with code, or a police officer, firefighter, fire warden or Minnesota Department of Natural Resources officer directs the fire must be put out.

The Hoquiam and Aberdeen fire departments responded to a fire call early Saturday morning at a Hoquiam residence.  No injuries were reported, said Hoquiam Fire Chief Matt Miller, and the residence, located on the 200 block of 5th Street was ostensibly unoccupied. A passerby called in the fire, Miller said.  “We were called at 7:02 (a.m.) for smoke coming from a house. The first unit on scene was a Hoquiam police officer,” Miller said in a phone interview. “He thought he heard somebody inside but there was no one inside.”  The call was escalated to a second alarm when the first unit arrived on scene and found smoke and fire venting from multiple locations, Miller said. Firefighters rapidly attacked the fire, which was concentrated in the kitchen area, Miller said.  “We had our first unit on-scene at 7:06. We had the fire knocked down at 7:12,” Miller said. “We had to do some overhaul.”  Efforts were slightly hampered by clutter inside and outside the residence, Miller said. Firefighters were able to determine the origin of the fire was in the kitchen, but were unable to discern the specific cause. Damage to the residence is thorough, Miller said.  “There was pretty expensive damage on the inside,” Miller said. ”It would take a lot of work to get it back to being livable.”  Heat and smoke damage were spread throughout both stories of the house, Miller said.  “If you do have a fire in your house, close all your doors and stop the spread of the fire through the house,” Miller said. “The front door was open, pulling the fire through the house.”  The Hoquiam Police Department is investigating the circumstances around the fire, Miller said.

Fire restrictions help to protect communities, areas we recreate, as well as enhance public and firefighter safety.  PHOENIX – Effective Friday, May 26, at 8 a.m. seasonal fire restrictions will be implemented on Bureau of Land Management managed lands in portions of southern Mohave, La Paz, and Yuma counties, in western Arizona. Fire managers have noted an increase in wildfire activity, which is anticipated to peak as the weather continues to get hotter and drier in the coming months. Fire restrictions help to limit activities on public lands that are known to be the most common causes of wildfires.  Beginning Friday, May 26, at 8 a.m., the following activities are prohibited:  Building, maintaining, attending, or using a fire, campfire, charcoal, coal, or wood stove fire, except within a developed recreation site, or improved site.  Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building. Smoking is prohibited in all federal buildings.  Discharging a firearm, air rifle or gas gun, except while engaged in a lawful hunt pursuant to state, federal, or tribal law, and regulations.  Fireworks and exploding targets are prohibited year-round on federally managed lands in Arizona.  Pressurized liquid or gas stoves, lanterns and heaters possessing shut-off devices are allowed. When using a portable stove, make sure the area is clear of grass and other vegetation and on a stable surface to prevent stoves from tipping and starting a fire.  Residents and visitors should check with respective county and municipal governments for information on fire restrictions in those jurisdictions.  Fire conditions as well as localized closures and restrictions are subject to change. Tribal, federal, state, and local mandates are different, they may have some differences in their restriction notices. Variations are possible, and visitors should check with the most local office for area-specific restrictions and regulations.  Violation of restrictions is punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. Violators may also be held personally responsible for reimbursement of fire suppression costs.  To further help to prevent wildfires, never throw cigarettes out of a vehicle window. Use an ashtray instead. Never park a vehicle over dry grass as the underside of a vehicle can get hot enough to ignite the vegetation. Make sure your vehicle is in good operating condition, tires are well inflated, and check for any dragging metal or chains from towed trailers.

(WFIE) - A historic Evansville home is now in need of more renovations after the Pearl Cleaners fire last Wednesday.  Water damage after the fire is just one more change in a home with a long history of changes. It’s also an extra item on a long list of renovations for the new owner.  For almost her whole life living in Evansville, the Carpenter House has been on realtor Theresa Catanese’s radar.  “I have always loved this building, have watched it for years, said Catanese. “The woodwork and the details of this building I just loved.”  Catanese said more than anything, she loves the house’s history.  “This home was tied to the Underground Railroad, and legend has it, there was a tunnel going from the house to the Ohio River,” said Catanese.  Catanese said she has been acquainting herself with the history of the home and the many changes it’s gone through over the years.  The home has stood since 1848, and over time it’s been a house, a tv and radio station, and soon to be a realty office. In each transition, change is needed.  “We were just about to close on it,” said Catanese. “We actually closed on it the day after the fire.”  Catanese said they watched from the upstairs window as crews fought the Pearl Cleaners fire right next door. Water from fire hoses seeped into the basement from a pipe carrying telephone lines.  Catanese said they just dodged the costs to pump water out, but there’s still some signs of the flooding. She says they’ll just add that to their pile of renovations.  “It’s worth it,” said Catanese. “Every dollar I put into this is just wonderful. It’s a piece of history and we’ve got to keep that history.”  When asked about that tunnel, Catanese said she hasn’t found that yet, but if you happen to know more about it, feel free to speak up.  They suspect it’s probably been covered up at some point, and they’d love to make it a local attraction.  In the meantime, Catanese suspects they’ll spend most of if not more than the next year revitalizing the home.  Copyright 2023 WFIE.

Located in the Chemult Ranger District within a footprint already planned for prescribed fire treatment, this fire offers a strategic advantage to return natural fire to a fire-adapted landscape.  The Dillon Creek Fire is burning approximately 15 miles southeast of Chemult, Ore., south of the Silver Lake Highway and east of US Highway 97.  Fire suppression resources are currently on the ground preparing containment lines to allow the fire to renew the forest landscape on 400 to 3,000 acres of restoration project area.  Fire managers can use natural ignitions such as lightning to mimic natural fire in the right conditions. The abundance of green grass this spring and coming moisture at week’s end opens this window of opportunity to reduce the buildup of surface fuels and minimize future catastrophic fires.  This natural low-intensity fire provides ideal conditions for a modified suppression strategy. utilizing natural barriers and road features to achieve fire-fighter safety, fuel reduction, and forest renewal which enhances wildlife habitat and restores nutrients while reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire. This low-intensity fire will protect this area against future extreme wildfire growth.  Fire managers employ a variety of tactics to protect forests and communities from wildfire. The Dillon Creek Fire offers an opportunity to accomplish this goal with natural tactics.  The Dillon Creek Fire lies within the Klamath River Basin Project area. The Klamath River Basin was identified as one of 21 high-risk landscapes to receive increased funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment Act and the Inflation Reduction Act in January 2023. This landscape encompasses the entire Klamath River watershed across California and Oregon. An area shared by five national forests including the Fremont-Winema.  In January 2022, the Forest Service launched the Wildfire Crisis Strategy in coordination with states, Tribes, and other partners to address wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities, and make forests more resilient. By prioritizing areas around communities most at risk and then increasing treatments across the whole landscape, these projects will help mitigate extreme wildfire and eventually result in sustainable healthy forests, resistant to extreme wildfire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtsYW1hdGhmYWxsc25ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvbmF0dXJhbC1maXJlLXN0YXJ0LW9mZmVycy1mdWVscy1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tb3Bwb3J0dW5pdHktZGlsbG9uLWNyZWVrLWZpcmXSAXhodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbGFtYXRoZmFsbHNuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzL25hdHVyYWwtZmlyZS1zdGFydC1vZmZlcnMtZnVlbHMtcmVkdWN0aW9uLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWRpbGxvbi1jcmVlay1maXJlP2Zvcm1hdD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Highland’s administration has been meeting regularly with PCSD 25 administration and investigation/insurance/restoration/city officials to receive progress reports and determine a timeline for next steps. Everyone has been working tirelessly to get the school back up and running. While there continue to be many unknowns and hurdles to overcome, the following information details some tentative plans moving forward.  Where will school be held for Highland during the 2023-2024 school year?  The goal for next school year is to be back home at Highland holding school on a traditional schedule. At this time, we are cautiously optimistic and on track to meet this target; however, we will continue to communicate through the summer if any delays arise that may require an alternate schedule.  What are the plans to accommodate the classes and extracurricular activities displaced by the fire?  We are working hard to identify alternate facilities and confirm space availability large enough to accommodate band, choir, orchestra, welding, P.E., weights, food service, and extracurricular activities including dance, cheer, volleyball, basketball, and wrestling. Staff, learners, and parents should anticipate that these plans will most likely become the norm for at least the next 2-3 years. Any offsite locations for classes will include transportation considerations. There are several potential spaces being explored/confirmed either through community donations or rental agreements.  What is the status of the lower gym?  Work has begun to restore the lower gym with floor replacement and other facility cleaning and repairs. Having a functional gym space is key to our ability to accommodate P.E. classes and extracurricular activities throughout this years-long process of restoration and rebuild. The timing for completion of the project is dependent on multiple factors; however, we anticipate that the lower gym will be functional by the fall.  What is the status of the cleaning/restoration process at Highland?  Classroom/Facilities Cleaning: Up to 40 people have been actively cleaning classrooms and other school facilities. Cleaning should be completed this week. All ducts and HVAC systems must be cleaned prior to occupation of the school.

The timeline for having these items in hand is dependent on availability.  What is the status of PCSD 25’s plans for rebuilding Highland?  Please note: any plans moving forward are dependent on the outcome of the replacement value as determined by the insurance adjustment process. As the district seeks to repair the damage at Highland, the Pocatello/Chubbuck School District 25 Board of Trustees will invite community stakeholders to participate in sharing ideas and, ultimately, make a decision on where we go from here. We recognize that the challenges and opportunities associated with this task warrants exploring more than one option for consideration. The district’s first priority is to fulfill its obligation to provide a safe learning environment for learners and staff throughout each stage of the restoration and rebuilding process.

THEY’RE PUTTING A LOT OF NEW THINGS OUT HERE, NEW SCHOOLS, THE NEW WATER PARK THAT’S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING IN. IT’S CLOSE TO THE OUTLET OUTLET MALL. SO I JUST THINK IT’S A NICE AREA. PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN RAISE THEIR FAMILIES OUT HERE. THAT SAME GROWTH IS THE REASON THE GRETNA RURAL FIRE DISTRICT ASKED THE SARPY COUNTY BOARD TO APPROVE A CHANGE TO A SUBURBAN FIRE DISTRICT. WE’RE REALLY GOING FROM A RURAL AREA, CERTAINLY IN THE LAST 20 YEARS TO A MORE OF A SUBURBAN AREA. SO WE’RE COVERING A LOT MORE. WE HAVE A LOT MORE CALLS. THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED IT TUESDAY. IT ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ON PAID STAFF AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW IN GRETNA. GRETNA FIRE CHIEF ROD BEATTY SAYS HIS STAFF WILL NOW BUDGET FOR HOW MANY FULL TIME STAFF TO HIRE AND WHAT THEY’LL BE PAID FOR. THAT CHANGE MEANS THE TAX LEVY MUST CHANGE TO. RIGHT NOW WE ARE THE LOWEST LEVY FOR A FIRE DISTRICT IN SARPY COUNTY AT ABOUT 4.2 CENTS. THIS WILL INCREASE THE LEVY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY THE PAID PERSONNEL SO THAT LEVY WILL GO UP. WELL, THE TAXES NOW ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY HIGH OUT HERE FOR US, SO HOPEFULLY THEY WON’T GO UP TOO MUCH MORE. THE MOVE WILL COMBINE THE CURRENT 55 VOLUNTEERS AND PAID STAFF. THE FIRE CHIEF SAYS RESIDENTS DEMAND TOP NOTCH SERVICE AND THIS CHANGE GUARANTEES IT INTO THE FUTURE. THINK IT’S A GOOD IDEA? UM, YOU KNOW, VOLUNTEER SERVICE BENNINGTON USED TO HAVE ONE WHERE I USED TO LIVE AND THEY KIND OF DID THE SAME THING. I THINK IT’LL GIVE PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED QUICKER. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE CALL VOLUME HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE. THE CHANGEOVER OFFICIALLY HAPPENS JULY 1ST. THE FIRE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS IT’LL LIKELY BE FALL BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT ON HIRING  Advertisement Gretna Rural Fire Department to become Gretna Suburban Fire, will hire paid emergency personnel Share Copy Link Copy  The Gretna Rural Fire District will begin its search for paid firefighters.Sarpy County commissioners voted Tuesday to change the department from rural to suburban as the area continues to grow.The Gretna Rural Fire Department covers the area from the Platte River to the outlet malls and Gretna city limits through an interlocal agreement.That's 71 square miles.With more of that farmland turning to front lawns, the chief said it was time to bring on paid staff.Ryan Olson mows the lawn of his new home in Gretna, surrounded by others with for sale signs. It's part of a new development as the area grows.“My girlfriend used to live in Lincoln. I lived in Bennington. Gretna was about halfway,” he said.Olson said he says he understands the explosive growth.“They're putting a lot of new things out here, new schools, the new water park that's supposed to be going in as close to the outlet mall. So, I just think it's a nice area. People feel like they can raise their families out here,” Olson said.That same growth is the reason the Gretna Rural Fire District asked the Sarpy County board to approve a change to become the Gretna Suburban Fire District.“We're really going from a rural area, certainly in the last 20 years, to a more of a suburban area. So, we're covering a lot more. We have a lot more calls,” said Fire District attorney Jim Lang.The board unanimously approved it Tuesday.“It's monumental and I think it's a good move on the part of the rural and the city,” said Commissioner Jim Warren. “It allows us the opportunity to bring on paid staff as we continue to grow in Gretna."" Gretna fire Chief Rod Buethe said his staff will now budget for how many full-time staff to hire and what they'll be paid.“The last few years have been about a 10% a year increase in call volume. We've got interstate, we've got highway, we've got industry. So yeah, we see a little bit of everything,” he said.That change means the tax levy must change too. “Right now, we are the lowest levy for a fire district and Sarpy County at 4.2 cents. This will increase the levy because we have to pay the paid personnel, so that levy will go up,” Lang said.“The taxes now are actually pretty high out here for us. So hopefully, they won't go up too much more,” Olson said.The move will combine the current 55 volunteers and paid staff. The fire chief said residents demand top-notch service, and this change guarantees it into the future.""I think it's a good idea. You know, a volunteer service. Bennington used to have one, where I used to live, and they kind of did the same thing. I think it'll get people the help they need quicker,"" Olson said.The fire department said call volume has doubled in the last decade. The changeover officially happens July 1.The fire district attorney said it will likely be fall before any movement on hiring — or calculations on how much it'll cost homeowners.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtldHYuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ3JldG5hLXJ1cmFsLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC10by1iZWNvbWUtZ3JldG5hLXN1YnVyYmFuLWZpcmUvNDM5ODIyMzjSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXR2LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9ncmV0bmEtcnVyYWwtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXRvLWJlY29tZS1ncmV0bmEtc3VidXJiYW4tZmlyZS80Mzk4MjIzOA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WJRT) - Michigan State Police released their investigative report on a deadly house fire on Pulaski Street in Flint, which claimed the lives of two young brothers.  Police looked into the actions of two Flint Fire Department members, who did not find the boys during a search of the house nearly a year ago. A second search crew minutes later found the boys on the second floor in a bedroom.  Ambulances rushed the boys -- 2-year-old Zyaire Mitchell and 9-year-old Lamar Mitchell -- to an area hospital, where they died from their injuries a few days later.  The fire happened on May 28, 2022, in the 600 block of West Pulaski Street.  Michigan State Police would later start an investigation to see if there was any criminal negligence by the two firefighters who admitted they just missed the boys in their initial search.  ABC12 News obtained a copy of the investigative report from Michigan State Police through the Freedom of Information Act.  The case is closed and no decision on criminal charges has been made, but at least one experienced firefighter told the investigator and an assistant prosecutor that there was no misconduct by the firefighters.  The more than 300-page report goes over everything related to the fire.  A first search of the upstairs of the home by firefighters Danny Sniegocki and Michael Zlotek showed no signs of the boys. But in a second search, the boys were found in a room that Sniegocki and Zlotek admitted they didn't search, because they didn't realize the smaller room was there.  Both firefighters declined to do interviews with the MSP investigator.  Other interviews were conducted and the detective sat down with an assistant prosecutor and the Genesee County Emergency Manager at one point. As a trained firefighter, the manager reviewed all the admissible evidence and determined that there was not any gross negligence or misconduct by the two firefighters.  New details in the report include a Michigan State Police fire investigator ruled the cause of the fire undetermined, even though former Flint Fire Chief Ray Barton said the cause was electrical shortly after the fire.  The report also includes the father of the two boys, who gave conflicting statements when he arrived at the home after the fire. He first said he was at a store, then said he was playing basketball.  Police took him into custody for a time.  The report also indicates at least four dogs were removed from the basement, that there were canine treadmills with different types of medicine and vitamins for canine consumption.  A Flint firefighter stated in a battalion chief's report that he believed one of the dogs belonged to another Flint firefighter. That particular statement went on to say the conditions in the basement were borderline abusive to the animals.  Barton has confirmed in the past that a vehicle he once owned was in the driveway of the Pulaski Street home and the report indicates he knew the family who lived there.  Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton said on Tuesday that he has not made a decision on whether to file criminal charges against the former Flint firefighters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9taWNoaWdhbi1zdGF0ZS1wb2xpY2UtcmVsZWFzZS1yZXBvcnQtb24tZGVhZGx5LXB1bGFza2ktc3RyZWV0LWZpcmUtaW4tZmxpbnQvYXJ0aWNsZV8yODFkYmY3Mi1mOWFlLTExZWQtOWJkNy05Mzk1ZTE2NjA3M2EuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Courtesy Dunstable Fire Department)  DUNSTABLE — Chief William Farrell reports that the Dunstable Fire Department and mutual aid partners extinguished a two-alarm structure fire in a large commercial building on Tuesday afternoon.  On Tuesday, May 23, at approximately 3:30 p.m., Dunstable Fire Department was notified by a 911 call of a fire with a possible explosion in a commercial facility at 41 Lowell St.  The first companies on scene found smoke and fire showing from the roof and exterior walls. Chief Farrell struck a second alarm to bring additional manpower to the scene.  There are no fire hydrants in the area, so companies had to stretch several hundred feet of hose line from a nearby pond to establish a reliable water supply. Crews initially attacked the fire from outside of the building, which was closed and not occupied at the time of the fire. Crews later gained access and attacked the fire from inside the structure until the building’s roof became compromised and in danger of collapse.  There were no reported injuries.  The building suffered extensive damage to its roof and attic space.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Dunstable Fire Department, with assistance from the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit attached to the State Fire Marshal’s Office.  Firefighters from Pepperell, Groton, Tyngsborough, Townsend, Westford, Ayer, and Hudson, Hollis and Nashua, New Hampshire provided mutual aid at the scene. PrideStar EMS also responded.  Firefighters from Ayer covered Dunstable stations.  “Companies did a great job establishing a water supply and knocking this fire down before damage was even more extensive,” said Chief Farrell. “I would like to thank all of our mutual aid support on this fire as well.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight In a hearing held by North Rhine-Westphalia’s Interior Affairs Committee on Monday, regional Interior Minister Herbert Reul revealed the details of a May 11 incident in the western German city of Ratingen that involved rescue workers and armed police units and left 35 people injured. Three rescue workers are still in a life-threatening condition and five others are being treated for serious injuries.  Police went to the 10th-floor apartment after being contacted by the building manager, who said that the 91-year-old tenant had not been seen in some time and that her mailbox was overflowing. Police said it was assumed there was a “helpless person” inside in need of aid.  After finding the door blocked by cases of bottled water, police smashed a glass pane in the door, cleared the obstruction and entered the apartment where they saw the man, 57, who turned out to be the tenant’s son.  According to authorities, one of the officers drew a sidearm and told the man to lie on the ground, but the man responded by spraying the officers with a flammable liquid — possibly gasoline — and setting them alight. The man then fled to the apartment’s balcony.  “Emergency and rescue services, some of whom were still burning, ran from the 10th floor to the street,” Reul told the committee. The police officer who first entered the apartment suffered burns on 80 percent of her upper body, the regional Justice Ministry said.  Advertisement  In a subsequent search of the apartment, investigators found the severely decomposed remains of a woman in a wheelchair. “It could be the 91-year-old mother of the accused. An autopsy on her body revealed no signs of trauma other than a fracture in her lumbar vertebrae. It was probably a natural death,” the ministry official told the committee. The identity is still to be confirmed via a DNA sample.  A 73-year-old man also was found dead in another apartment in the building. It was not clear whether the cases were connected, and investigations of both deaths were opened.  The suspect had a criminal record consisting of minor assault charges in disputes with neighbors and had been fined three times but did not pay the fines. An arrest warrant was issued for him in March, but no one answered the door when police went to inform him of it. A note was left for him in the mailbox.  After the discovery of documents criticizing coronavirus vaccinations and a large supply of food with distant expiration dates, police concluded that the suspect could be part of the anti-vaccine scene and one of those preparing for some kind of doomsday catastrophe.  Authorities said there was no indication that the suspect’s attack was politically motivated or that there was any connection to the extremist Reichsbürger case, an alleged far-right conspiracy to overthrow the state that made headlines in Germany last year.

The fire was burning on the property of a Public Storage in the area of Northwest 167th Street and 34th Avenue.  According to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue officials, the fire was reported at 5:38 a.m.  Firefighters arrived at the scene to find a light haze and fire coming from the rear of the facility.  “Crews immediately began a fire attack, attacking the fire which had spread to multiple storage units,” a spokesperson for the fire department said. “Firefighters utilized hydraulic tools to access storage units affected by the blaze to work on extinguishing the fire. Units are fighting the fire from multiple angles including the interior and the roof of the structure.”  Deputy Fire Chief Danny Cardeso said extinguishing the fire was difficult due to the layout and area of the storage facility “as well as the amount of stuff contained within these storage units.”  The fire brought out a massive first responder presence.  Firefighters could be seen fighting the fire from multiple angles, breaking down a wall at the back of the storage facility and also focusing on the roof to get the fire under control.

The village Board of Trustees approved purchase of the trucks earlier this month. According to their resolution, the ladder truck will cost $1,977,122 and the engine will be $981,861. The volunteer portion of the fire department is chipping in $250,000 as a down payment and the rest will be financed through Community Leasing Partners.  Fire Chief Joshua Myers told the OBSERVER the department was looking to get new trucks even before he started his job as chief in April 2022.  “This is something that started before I was even hired,” he said. “Things get old and when you talk about fire engines, the one fire engine we’re replacing is 32 years old. It’s just become a maintenance disaster for us.  “It’s the same thing with the tower ladder, which was purchased used. We’ve had nothing but problems with it over its life with Fredonia,” Myers added.  The chief said it was important to get the trucks approved in May, because as of June 1, each truck will cost an additional $100,000. Approving it in May saved village taxpayers’ money, he said, and he thanked the Board of Trustees for doing so.  “It’s not like going to buy an SUV. This stuff is expensive,” he said. “It’s got a 25-year life span so we’re talking about a long-life investment.”  It will be a while until the vehicles are in the fire department’s service — Myers estimated 22 to 24 months.  Fredonia’s purchase of firefighting vehicles comes just weeks after the Dunkirk Common Council approved two new trucks for the city fire department. Like Myers, their chief, Mike Edwards, said the new equipment was badly needed to replace unreliable old vehicles.  For Myers, it’s a simple equation: “Someone calls 911, they expect us to come. We can’t have equipment break on us.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVydG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvMjAyMy8wNS9mcmVkb25pYS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtZ2V0dGluZy1uZXctdHJ1Y2tzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire department will receive notification now for more than 30 additional situations, determined by a medical dispatcher. They include certain calls for allergies, burns, diabetic problems, overdoses and falls.  Fire Chief Jim Davis has also given his staff freedom to determine if fire response is needed on any 911 calls that roll over to the department, allowing them to dispatch a fire crew depending on the circumstances, time of day and location.  Adding fire personnel back to the calls comes after an April update to the city council on a new prioritization plan from MedStar. Designed to save resources for the most urgent calls, it reduced the number of calls in that category by 30 percent, and improved response time by about 30 seconds.  The Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association said at the time the change caused a dramatic drop in the number of calls for some fire stations. Some firefighters also began noting calls where patients were waiting for an ambulance to respond, while nearby fire stations were unaware of the call, or conditions changed during the wait and the call became a higher priority.  ""We have identified 10 or 12 call types that really seem to make sense we move the pendulum back toward the middle,"" Davis said.  An analysis from the Office of the Medical Director determined it might add back about 45 calls a day city-wide that firefighters would respond to.  That analysis also found that from 2019 to 2022, less than 1% of the type of calls added back, have needed a critical, life-saving intervention.  Sherman Dedrick, the director of governmental affairs for the Fort Worth Professional Firefighters Association Local 440, said the adjustment was a start, but he expected more calls may need to be added to the list.  ""To those citizens, it's an emergency, and they deserve to get someone there in their time of need,"" he said.  Faster treatment on a non-priority call, he said, may prevent it from escalating or from needed a paramedic response at all.  The reprioritization for calls doesn't prevent fire departments for any city in the MedStar system, from going on any calls they want to go to.  Davis said reports were being reviewed daily and that he expected the response process would continue to be refined.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3RleGFzL25ld3MvZm9ydC13b3J0aC1maXJlLWNyZXdzLXJlc3VtZS1qb2luaW5nLW1lZGljYWwtY2FsbHMv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3RleGFzL25ld3MvZm9ydC13b3J0aC1maXJlLWNyZXdzLXJlc3VtZS1qb2luaW5nLW1lZGljYWwtY2FsbHMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Their mother, Asia McKenzie, said she believes an electrical issue sparked the fire at her home on Strand Lane.  “I was already having some electrical problems in my unit that I had expressed with CMHA (Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority),"" McKenzie said.  She said her daughter plugged her laptop into the wall and blew a fuse, resulting in a fire.  ""It cut all the electricity off inside the house immediately,"" she said. ""I didn't know where it was coming from because it was pitch black.""  McKenzie said she did everything she could to get her four children out of the house.  ""I felt helpless. I kept running back in, and kept running back in,"" she said. ""And every time I had to come back down the steps, I felt more and more helpless because I know that they were in there looking for me to come and rescue them.""  She was able to get two of her kids out safely. The other two were rescued by firefighters and taken to the hospital, but died a week later.

""They wouldn't have it any other way.""  In the aftermath of this tragedy, the McKenzie family is now taking it one day at a time.  ""I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy,"" Shawnez McKenzie said. ""Not only is she losing one, she’s losing two.""  The two said it's been difficult to see judgments and misinformation circulating about the fire on social media.  ""There’s all kinds of things out there. There’s things saying she was not home. Yes, she was home. And if some people would just have some compassion for her, I think it would go a long way,"" Shawnez McKenzie said.  But the love and support from friends, family and even complete strangers have made a difference.

It's not been easy, but it's been comforting to know I have this support.""  The family also commended teachers and staff at Winton Hills Academy for going above and beyond to show their support in the days following the fire.

The fire department responded with three engines, one aid unit, two command vehicles, and two support vehicles, staffed by a total of 14 personnel.  Ney said the flames were contained in about 10 minutes, and overhaul of the fire took about two hours due to heavy fuel load inside the structure.  No firefighters were injured and no other occupants were inside the home during the fire, although one cat was found deceased inside the structure.  The cause of the blaze is unknown at this time.  Puget Sound Energy was called to the scene and disconnected power due to severe damage to wiring inside the structure.  Deputy Chief Jon Beck said that the house was declared a total loss in the fire report, due to the extensive damage caused by the blaze. Ney said the damage was throughout the interior and originated in the kitchen.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaWRiZXluZXdzdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvc291dGgtd2hpZGJleS1ob3VzZS1maXJlLWNsYWltcy1saWZlLW9mLWNhdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Firefighters received a report of a grass fire that was threatening several buildings at the intersection of Northeast Hillside Drive and Northeast Wheatland Drive at about 12:30 p.m., the fire department said.  Strong winds spread the fire to buildings, which prompted the Pullman Fire Department to call for help from Whitman County and Moscow fire crews, the department said.  While fighting the fire, an overhead power line fell and landed on a fire truck, causing sparks and minor damage, the department said. Avista cut the power to the line, and the truck was able to function normally.  The unit that the family of six was staying in was badly damaged by smoke and water. They're being assisted by the Red Cross, the fire department said. The adjacent unit was also damaged, but not as badly, said Mayor Glenn Johnson, who also serves as the fire department spokesman. It was unclear if residents of the adjacent unit were able to return, he said.  Another building nearby also received some heat damage, but residents were able to return after the fire was extinguished, the fire department said. Five vehicles and a boat were also damaged in the fire.  Three people were treated by firefighters for smoke inhalation but none was taken to the hospital. It was not clear if they were residents in the duplex, Johnson said.  The cause of the fire is under investigation, but Pullman Fire Marshal Darren Jones said the fire started in the brush west of the buildings and rapidly spread to the duplex with the help of the wind.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmlyZS1jb2xsZWdlLWhpbGwtcHVsbG1hbi1kaXNwbGFjZXMtMDIwNDAwOTMyLmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL25ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvZmlyZS1jb2xsZWdlLWhpbGwtcHVsbG1hbi1kaXNwbGFjZXMtMDIwNDAwOTMyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Harold Bumgarden was on his way to deliver food and passed by an apartment building, which he noticed was on fire. He stopped and immediately began alerting residents to get out of their homes.  The delivery man said God put him in the right place at the right time.  “And there was a lady sitting outside the apartment and I asked her, I said, ‘Do you know your apartment’s on fire?’ she said, ‘Yes, I’ve got a fire extinguisher inside.’ I said, ‘That’s not going to help.’ So, I put it in park, and I ran to the apartments, started knocking on everybody’s door telling them to get out. As I was doing that I told the lady to move away from her apartment because I didn’t want no explosions,” Bumgarden said.  Sulphur Fire Chief Dan Selph confirmed the blaze started when a woman tried to smoke while on an oxygen machine.  “She was lighting her cigarette with a candle she had lit in her residence, and it ignited and was accelerated by the oxygen therapy she was using. She removed that from her person and threw it on the ground and it caught the apartment on fire,” said Selph.  He said the woman admitted it to their fire investigator.  Residents of the apartments say they likely would have perished if not for Bumgarden.  “If that DoorDash guy had not knocked on our door, we’d probably all be dead right now. It was about 15 seconds later the whole place was full of smoke. All I did was grab my cat and my guitar and I ran out there. That’s all I had time to take,” said resident Trent Stroupe.  Resident Albert Schultz agreed.  “We would have been dead from the smoke. It was a fast fire. It was hot,” Schultz said.  But Bumgarden said he’s no hero.  “I’m not the hero, God’s the hero. He put me here for a reason,” he said.  And, he said, if there’s a lesson from the fire: “Don’t smoke with an oxygen mask on.”  Fortunately, officials say the woman was not injured when the fire erupted. Residents said a kitten in the woman’s apartment apparently died.  Sulphur officials told us this is not the first time a fire started when someone smoked while using oxygen. The chief said a woman died in a similar fire several years ago.  Copyright 2023 KPLC.

"fire","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T21:33:14","National Guard officials are gearing up for what they anticipate will be a hectic year mobilizing troops for disaster responses. Right now, more than 8,000 service members are deployed supporting domestic missions within the United States as storms and wildfires become more powerful and frequent due to climate change.  The bulk of those thousands of soldiers are National Guardsmen, many of whom are already combating wildfires in California and Colorado and preparing for Super Typhoon Mawar, a massive storm that local officials say will be ""catastrophic"" and is expected to smash into Guam.  Guard officials held a press conference Tuesday in which senior officers updated the press on issues facing the force, with preparation for natural disasters taking center stage. The issue has become central to the Guard's mission.  Read Next: VA Claims Backlog Expected to Grow to 400K, Largely Due to the PACT Act  ""Planning and preparing for disruptions to critical infrastructure from hostile actors or climate change is key to developing resilience in the homeland,"" Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the National Guard's top officer, said last year.  On Tuesday, officials said calls to the Guard for help are only growing.  ""The demand for the Guard for domestic activities has increased. It's safe to say that, in the post-Katrina environment, the goal is to not be late,"" Brig. Gen. Jonathan Beddall, who oversees the Guard's domestic response missions, told reporters Tuesday. ""The repetitions and sets become more frequent and refined so we can respond more quickly.""  Hurricane Katrina in 2005 served as a moment of change for the military, and particularly the National Guard, in how troops could be utilized in noncombat emergencies. The hurricane, one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, claimed some 1,800 lives.  Fifteen years later, the Pentagon would be needed in another massive response: The COVID-19 pandemic effectively deployed the entire National Guard -- tasking soldiers with manning hospitals, delivering food to low-income communities, and administering COVID tests and vaccinations. The Guard would immediately transition into responding to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection to protect the U.S. Capitol after rioters attempted to violently keep then-President Donald Trump in power after he lost the election.  Those increased responsibilities placed on the Guard in recent years come as the force has reduced in size since the peak of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Governors saw the Guard's response to the pandemic and have subsequently been increasingly using the force to respond to protests and even missions outside the military's typical portfolio, such as filling in for a substitute teacher shortage and driving school buses.  But the underlying cause of more missions within the United States is climate change. Rising temperatures are making storms more violent and frequent and set the conditions for wildfires, both of which have ramped up in recent years and are expected to continue becoming even more frequent and disastrous through the next century.  Wildfire season is when the conditions are most ripe for out-of-control fires to spread in the wilderness and sometimes into residential areas. That season used to be about five months long, most of that being in the summer, but grew to seven months in the 1970s, starting earlier in the spring and lasting through a chunk of fall, according to the Department of Agriculture.  Likewise with hurricanes, the season for powerful ocean-based storms starts in June and extends into late November. Experts have warned that hurricanes have become more extreme and frequent over the past 40 years, a troubling trend that's only expected to ramp up.  ""We have three storms coming in. We have a hurricane in the mid-Atlantic that's a strong Category 5. We have another Category 3, growing into a Category 5, crossing the Virgin Islands and [making] landfall in Puerto Rico, and we have a late season storm building in the Gulf of Mexico which can become very, very large, very quickly and cross into New Orleans,"" Maj. Gen. William Prendergast IV said Tuesday, referencing future hurricane models.  -- Steve Beynon can be reached at Steve.Beynon@military.com.

You didn’t want to inhale any of the grayish particles that surrounded you. But ash is strong stuff. It adheres to your skin, finds its way into your nasal passages and clings to your clothes as stubbornly as cheap Christmas tree tinsel. Ash — whether on a hearth or in an urn — beckons you to remember what once was and taunts you because it will never be again.  In his absorbing new book, “Built From the Fire: The Epic Story of Tulsa’s Greenwood District, America’s Black Wall Street,” Victor Luckerson combs through layers of soot and ash, the physical and psychological residue of the Tulsa race massacre, which continues to haunt the city’s Black community more than a century after it occurred.  Over the course of two days in the spring of 1921, Tulsa’s Greenwood district was destroyed and hundreds of its residents were killed. Heralded as a model of Black entrepreneurial success and self-determination in the Jim Crow era, Greenwood became a target of violence when a rumor spread that Dick Rowland, a Black teenager, had sexually assaulted a white woman in an elevator. A show of force by Greenwood men to prevent Rowland from being lynched escalated into an all-out attack on Black Tulsans by white vigilantes, who in some cases had been handed arms by the police. As Luckerson recounts, “More than 1,200 houses were leveled, nearly every business was burned to the ground and an unknown number of people — estimates reach as high as 300 — were killed.”  Luckerson, a journalist based in Tulsa, adeptly takes us through Greenwood’s history, resisting the impulse to glorify its founders or endorse the idea that more Black-owned businesses can repair the ravages of racial capitalism.

Steps to Stay Safe this Summer  As we head outside to enjoy the sunshine and warm weather this summer, the Red Cross offers 20 steps you can follow to stay safe.  Do your plans include a road trip? With more people on the roads, it’s important to drive safely.  1. Be well rested and alert, use your seat belts, observe speed limits and follow the rules of the road.  2. If you plan on drinking alcohol, designate a driver who won’t drink.  3. Avoid distractions such as cell phones.  4. Use caution in work zones. There are lots of construction projects underway.  5. Turn your headlights on as dusk approaches or during inclement weather. Don’t overdrive your headlights.  Drowning can happen quickly and silently. Unless rescued, it could take as little as 20 to 60 seconds for a drowning person to submerge.  6. Prevent unsupervised access to water, provide constant, active adult supervision and know how to swim.  7. Swim in an area with lifeguards.  8. Designate a “water watcher” whose sole responsibility is to keep a close eye and constant attention on everyone in and around the water until the next water watcher takes over.  9. Don’t just pack it, wear your life jacket — always on a boat and if you are in a situation beyond your skill level.  10. Reach or throw, don't go! In the event of an emergency, reach or throw an object to the person in trouble and tell them to grab on to it. Don’t go in! You could become a victim yourself.  Summer is a great time for a picnic. Be careful grilling, which causes 10,000 home fires every year.  11. Wash your hands, utensils and workstation before preparing the food.  12. Separate uncooked meats, poultry and seafood from ready-to-eat foods like salads, fruits, vegetables, cheeses and desserts. Use separate plates and utensils to prevent cross-contamination.  13. Always supervise a barbecue grill when in use and never grill indoors. Keep the grill out in the open, away from the house, deck, tree branches or anything that could catch fire.  14. Make sure everyone, including pets, stays away from the grill.  15. Don’t leave food out in the sun. Keep perishable foods in a cooler with plenty of ice or freezer gel packs.  Camping is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in the U.S. Being prepared for emergencies is critical when you’re headed to an area with limited access to phone services and help.  16. Know the ability level of the people in your group and the environment around you. Plan accordingly.  17. Pack a first aid kit to handle insect stings, sprains, cuts and bruises and other injuries.  18. Sprains and falls are some of the most common misfortunes travelers may face. Dehydration is also a danger. Take a Red Cross first aid and CPR/AED course and download the free First Aid app so that you will know what to do in case help is delayed.  19. Share your travel plans and locations with a family member, neighbor or friend.  20. Bring nutritious food items and water, light-weight clothing to layer and supplies for any pets.

"fire","2019-05-18","Not Discerned","{""CleElum"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T04:43:00","The current shelter, carried by all wildland firefighters, was designed by the U.S. Forest Service in 2002.  Example video title will go here for this video  SEATTLE — Wildfire smoke from Canada covering the skies of western Washington in May is a stark reminder of the change in recent years in wildfire behavior.  As we head into the 2023 wildfire season, elite current and retired firefighters and wildland fire experts tell the KING 5 Investigators the federal government needs to develop a better version of the equipment meant to save firefighter’s lives in acute emergencies – the fire shelter.  Fire shelters are portable, tent-style blankets, considered the last resort for firefighters who become trapped by flames, without a safe route out. The current shelter, carried by all wildland firefighters, was designed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in 2002. There have been some modifications, but the shelter has essentially remained the same for two decades.  Washington and California wildland firefighters interviewed said the federal government should get serious about developing a better shelter, especially because climate change has created fire seasons that are longer and more intense.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, “human-caused climate change” led the number of large wildfires in the western United States to double between 1984 and 2015.  “You have to think about all the technological advancements in the world in the last two decades,” said a 40-year veteran wildland firefighter from California. “You think about even our telephones and how far they’ve come, so why don’t firefighters have something more advanced?”  “I love the United States. I love the fire service, but we are not where we need to be (with shelters),” said retired smoke jumper Jason Ramos of the Winthrop area who fought fires for 33 years.  Ramos has been a vocal advocate for better life saving equipment for people on the front lines. In 2016 he wrote a book, “Smokejumper,” that criticized the limitations of the current shelter.  “There’s no excuse for a piece of safety equipment not doing what it was designed to do – every time,” wrote Ramos in his book.  According to the USFS, the 2002 shelter referenced by Ramos, known as the new generation shelter, offers greater protection from the original design from the 1960’s. The new generation shelter “will provide improved protection from radiant heat and flames,” wrote Forest Service Equipment Specialist Tony Petrilli in 2003.  But according to government documentation, the adhesive holding the layers of the shelter together begins to break down at 500 degrees Fahrenheit. Wildfires at ground-level burn between 1,800 and 2,000 degrees.  “Over 500 degrees and the shelters are nothing more than glorified tin foil,” said a retired Washington state smoke jumper with four decades of experience who asked not to be named. “Many wildland firefighters are young college students who work in the summer. They aren’t well trained and don’t have the experience to really understand the limitations of our current shelter.""  Representatives from the USFS said their wildland firefighters are trained to know fire shelters are not survivable in every situation.  “All wildland firefighters are trained that carrying a fire shelter should never be considered a justification to take on risk. Instead, wildland firefighters are trained to evaluate, mitigate, and manage hazards through developing risk-based firefighting strategies. Wildland firefighting has inherent dangers, but the Forest Service's core value of safety and the agency's focus on evaluating and mitigating hazards is part of our risk management culture,” wrote Wade Muehlhof of the USFS National Press Office in a statement.  Research by the KING 5 Investigators shows approximately 50 firefighters have died attempting to use their fire shelters since 1990. Approximately half died using the original shelter, including four firefighters working on the Thirty Mile Fire in eastern Washington in 2001. The other half died using the new generation version. That number includes 19 elite firefighters who died trying to use their shelters after getting trapped on the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona in 2013.  Map: Firefighter deaths involving shelter deployment  “For the extreme fire conditions we work in nowadays, you see the fuels, you see the fire activity. Do you want to make operational decisions thinking that shelter’s going to save you? I would not bet on that,” Ramos said.  A deadly wildfire in 1994 inspired research that eventually led to the new generation shelter. That year, 14 firefighters from Oregon and Idaho, armed with the original shelters from the 1960’s, lost their lives on Storm King Mountain in Colorado.  Two months after the tragedy a California-based aeronautical engineer, Jim Roth, started researching ways to build a shelter than the one designed in the 60’s. His brother, 29-year-old Idaho smokejumper Roger Roth, was among the fallen on Storm King Mountain.    “Here it is, almost 30 years later, but I feel like it was yesterday,” said Roth. “I was very, very angry. How he could be taken away at such a young age? I just thought ‘OK, show me, show me (God), what do you want?’ And that’s when the lightbulb went on and I said: ‘OK, I get it.’ That’s when I realized (with my background) I can (create a better shelter).”  Roth traveled the world, collaborating with other scientists, gathering data on thermodynamics, fire behavior, and material tolerance. He altered his entire life’s purpose – to create a shelter survivable in any condition. To carry out his vision, Roth began a company dedicated to his brother: Storm King Mountain Technologies.  “I didn’t do anything with fire until I lost my brother. And it totally changed my life,” Roth said.  After Roth launched his project to improve on the old shelter, researchers at the USFS did as well. By 2002 Roth had designed a prototype that could withstand a heat load of 1,800 degrees. The Forest Service came up with a design that started to break down at 500 degrees. With both versions on the table, a panel of government officials chose the government version.  “It ended up being a political decision. And they went with the Forest Service fire shelter,” Roth said. ""It's still inadequate. It's not made to handle these environments that we (now) see in wildfires.""  Officials from the USFS said their design was lighter in weight, easier to open, and had a tougher outer foil shell, especially during windy conditions.  “(The SKM design) showed significant delamination of outer foil during (extended) flame exposure,” wrote scientists at the time.  Forest Service representatives also said the SKM design showed more damage when “shaken vigorously to ensure they would hold up to deployment and turbulence.”  From the beginning, fire shelters have saved lives. According to the Forest Service, the old-style shelter prevented 300 injuries and saved 300 lives between 1964 and 2009.  Between 2004 to the present, the Forest Service says the new generation shelter has prevented 114 injuries and saved 61 lives.  In 2008, three Forest Service firefighters were saved while working on the Indians Fire in Central California. The men became trapped and disoriented in the chaos of a fire tornado. They thought there wasn’t a way out.  “I looked at the pavement and thought this is it, this is it for us,” said Engine Captain Roberto Moreno.  Moreno said he knew it was time to deploy their shelters. They threw their shelters over their heads and walked out of the danger zone backward. They were burned, but alive.  “(It) was a big relief (to have the shelter’s protection). At that time, I was able to breath. It was cool underneath the fire shelter, so we just turned around and just started walking back with (them over our heads),” said Moreno.  “Yes, they’ve saved some lives, I’m not arguing that. But why are we not having the best?” said Ramos, the retired smoke jumper. “We want to be varsity. Why are we giving firefighters some JV gear?”  In 2014 the Forest Service launched a fire shelter review project. They worked with 23 different organizations on the effort, including engineers from NASA. Forest Service representatives said hundreds of materials were tested during the five-year review. In the end, government officials decided to stick with the 2002 design, saying “the current fire shelter model continues to provide the most practical amount of protection given tradeoffs of weight, volume (bulk), durability, and material toxicity.”  Currently, there is no organized effort to improve the 2002 shelter, but Forest Service representatives said they will always listen to and pursue new ideas.  ""NTDP (the National Technology and Development Program) continues to evaluate materials, material combinations, adhesives, and shelter designs, always working towards the goal of making a better fire shelter for firefighters,” wrote Muehlhof of the USFS.  Jim Roth said in 2023 the shelter he developed in the 1990’s is now out of date due to advancements in materials. He said a re-design is necessary, which would take research, development, and input from the best minds possible.  “That’s the only thing left in life that I have to do, is develop that fire shelter,” Roth said. I’ve been working on it for 30 years. I’ve done it once before. I can do it again. I’m not getting any younger, so now’s the time to really make it happen. I want to get a fire shelter that works in every wildfire into the hands of the firefighters who are putting their lives at risk.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raW5nNS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2ltcHJvdmVkLWZpcmUtc2hlbHRlcnMtd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29ucy1tb3JlLWRlYWRseS8yODEtNzY2NmU1OTgtZjc0Mi00MWM2LThjMTgtNDk0ZGRhODZiYWEx0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2ltcHJvdmVkLWZpcmUtc2hlbHRlcnMtd2lsZGZpcmUtc2Vhc29ucy1tb3JlLWRlYWRseS8yODEtNzY2NmU1OTgtZjc0Mi00MWM2LThjMTgtNDk0ZGRhODZiYWEx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At about 8:20 a.m. Tuesday, the explosion was reported at Wynnewood Refining, located near 906 S Powell Ave., about 60 miles south of Oklahoma City. The fire occurred in the refinery's gasoline hydrotreater, according to a statement from Brandee Stephens, a spokesperson for CVR Energy, the Texas-based company that owns the refinery.  A cause for the fire was not identified, but “company officials are conducting a thorough investigation into this incident,” Stephens said.  Within two hours, emergency crews had managed to contain the fire and were working to extinguish it, Garvin County Undersheriff James Richardson told The Oklahoman. Two refinery employees were injured and flown by helicopter to a hospital for treatment, Richardson said.  Stephens did not disclose the severity of the employees’ injuries or their conditions, but said “all other employees have been accounted for.”  Garvin County Emergency Management director Dave Johnson said during a news conference that the area is safe.  ""There's no threat to the community; there's no issue outside of the refinery,"" Johnson said. ""The part (of the refinery) that was impacted and secure is shut down, but the rest of the refinery is safe and running.""  Johnson said nearby U.S. Highway 77 and a section of railroad were shut down briefly as a safety precaution, but both were being reopened.  The refinery is a small crude oil refinery that stores waste produced during refining operations, according to Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality records.  DEQ spokesperson Erin Hatfield told The Associated Press the agency is investigating the fire and potential hazards, but was immediately focused on making sure the fire is extinguished.

"fire","2023-07-09","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T21:13:20","WATERVILLE — The independent senior living complex that caught fire Monday, resulting in the death of a 65-year-old man and displacing 48 people, did not have a sprinkler system because the safety measure wasn’t required when the building was constructed in 1971.  Ronald Kennerson died in the fire, according to Lt. Thomas Pickering with Maine State Police.  “I can confirm that FMO (Office of State Fire Marshal) is still investigating to determine the cause of the fire, but there is no evidence or indication of foul play,” Pickering said in a statement Tuesday evening. “The building did not have a sprinkler system.”  He said there was no further comment.  Diane Townsend, executive director of the Waterville House Authority, which owns and manages the seven-story, 50-unit building on Elm Street, said earlier Tuesday that a sprinkler system was not required when the building was constructed 52 years ago.  Townsend said each unit has a metal, well-sealed fire door to help prevent fire spread.  “The other thing is, the building was built as a whole block of cement rooms stacked on top of each other,” Townsend said Tuesday. “The whole thing is essentially cement. That’s the other reason we fared as well as we did.” She was referring to the fire’s not spreading more than it did.  Advertisement  Built with federal Housing and Urban Development money and dedicated in 1972, the building remained unoccupied on Tuesday, as there was smoke and water damage throughout the structure, Townsend said. The local fire and code enforcement departments will determine when people can move back in, and a company called ServiceMaster is assessing what needs to be done to make it habitable, including whether the units can be dried out, how much cleaning is needed and whether Sheetrock needs to be removed, according to Townsend. She said the building is insured.  Kennerson lived on the fourth floor. The building has eight units on each floor, from floors two through seven, and two handicapped accessible units on the first floor, where there is also a community room, according to Townsend.  The fire marshal’s office worked with Waterville police on the fire investigation. Waterville fire Chief Shawn Esler said Tuesday that his department is not taking part in that investigation and he had not yet received a report from the fire marshal’s office.  Firefighting foam that was used to battle the fire seeped into the public water system, leading the Kennebec Water District to issue an advisory Monday warning people not to consume public water. The advisory was lifted Tuesday after testing showed the water system was free from contamination. A backflow prevention device was placed in a wrong location when the building was constructed and that allowed the foam to spread into the water system.  Related Water advisory lifted as officials say public water in Waterville area safe to consume again  “What we have in place is what we’ve been told to have in place,” Townsend said. “We haven’t been approached about changing anything.”  Esler said the fire department expects a fire suppression system to perform as such, and firefighters expect that it is separated from the public water supply. Not knowing the suppression system wasn’t separated from the water supply, crews put about a gallon of foam into the system to help suppress the fire, he said.  Advertisement  He reiterated a statement by Roger Crouse, general manager of the Kennebec Water District, that the water contamination was not the fault of the fire department. Esler said if the department had done something wrong, he would have been the first person to say so. He said the department feels badly about the situation.  “There is some perception out there that we made a mistake or we caused this, and that’s simply not true,” Esler said. “It’s an unfortunate circumstance that occurred.”  He said the department views the water situation as a serious event and “we will work hand in hand with the water district to make sure that this doesn’t happen again.”  About 35 firefighters responded to the scene from area towns, but initially, not enough firefighters were present to be able to rescue everyone in the building, according to Esler. “I’m not really grandstanding for staffing, but I think a daytime emergency certainly played a factor here,” he said.  The majority of those who are members on Waterville’s call force work other jobs during the day in other communities and can’t get to the scene, he said, adding that he thinks that’s a factor for all fire departments that rely on call firefighters and volunteers.  Townsend said some building tenants are staying with family, and Best Western was able to get all the others into one hotel in Augusta, which was critical to making sure they get the help they need. They will be housed there for at least five nights, she said.  Advertisement  Townsend said Waterville Public Schools provided a bus to take the tenants to Augusta and Delta’s wheelchair transport drove a couple of tenants who needed it.  “I can’t say enough about everybody who has been involved,” she said, citing fire and police officials, Delta, Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, Best Western and her own staff, which has “really stepped up. I’m really proud of them.”  She said churches have been providing clothing for displaced tenants and other people are providing personal necessities.  Townsend said people have been asking if the building insurance covers the contents of tenants’ apartments and she wanted to emphasize that it does not. Tenants may buy renters insurance for a small sum and officials tell them that when they move in, she said. She said the cost for such insurance is minimal — one tenant with the insurance said the cost is about $6 a month.

According to officials, the fire broke out at a home on Lafayette Street Tuesday at around 3:05 a.m.  Officials tell News 12 the seven occupants self-evacuated from the home as first responders arrived.  A total of 60 firefighters from nine different departments were on the scene and officials say the fire was under control within 90 minutes.  ""The fire was heavily involved, blowing out all the windows of the structure…almost impossible to get anybody inside to try to affect a rescue,"" said Mike Uttaro, Nassau's chief fire marshal.  Officials tell News 12 a body was located inside the home. The victim was later identified by family as 60-year-old Kashmira Patel.  According to the family, the home's occupants were in town from India for the funeral of another family's patriarch who died last week. Patel was the daughter of the male family member who recently died.  The family says all those who were hospitalized due to the fire have been released.  ""We are just all devastated. In shock. Obviously, we didn't expect this. Waking up to screams that everybody needs to get out. It's just horrifying,"" said survivor Bhumi Patel.  The family says it took too long for first responders to arrive at their home and get water on the house.  ""We are living in one of the best countries in the world, the United States of America, and we are with these services from the fire department and police department,"" said Tarun Patel. ""There's nothing to do to run over?""  Fire officials say the heavy fire and smoke conditions made the second-floor collapse, making it impossible for firefighters to get inside.  Uttaro says there were other challenges, including a downed live power line blocking the front door and a malfunctioning fire hydrant nearby on Herricks Road. He says firefighters were forced to tap into another hydrant further down the block.

"fire","2019-07-03","Not Discerned","{""WestSeneca"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T21:20:39","Maybe you’ve seen them on social media or in neighborhood backyards. Smokeless fire pits like the Solo Stove are hot, so to speak. But how smokeless are they, really?  Consumer Reports put some of the bestsellers to the test to find out which ones make building, tending to, and cleaning up a backyard fire easier and safer.  Popular backyard fire pits—often called smokeless fire pits—like the Solo Stove conjure up images of a roaring outdoor fire sans smoke.  Consumer Reports just tested seven of them. Here’s a quick takeaway.  It’s a misnomer to call them smokeless; they’re less smoky. You will always have some smoke; that’s the nature of burning wood.  But the way these fire pits are designed, there’s less smoke once the fire really gets going, especially when compared with a traditional campfire.  In its tests, CR started lots of fires, noting how fast each fire pit lit and how effectively it burned.  For the ones that did well in the ratings, you can have a small fire or a large one, they start quickly so that they’re out of the smoky phase sooner, and they burn wood completely so that there’s not a lot of clean up afterward.  Consumer Reports found the Solo Stove left behind lots of wood, and cleaning it up wasn’t as easy as with some of the other fire pits.  The top performer was the Cuisinart Cleanburn Fire Pit, which starts around $249.  Yes, the kitchen appliance brand, Cuisinart! It’s fast to light and it burns wood more thoroughly than any other model tested, so there’s less waste and less mess.  If you want to skip chopping and lugging around firewood, the Inno Stage Smokeless Fire Pit for $79 burns wood pellets instead.  And while it’s not as easy to clean as the other two fire pits, the Blue Sky Outdoor Living Peak Smokeless Fire Pit PFP2416 for about $215 can burn pellets or logs.  And remember, no matter what type of fire you’re enjoying, keep it safe.  Place your pit on an uncovered, hard flat surface at least 20 feet away from anything flammable.  CR says avoid placing any fire pit on your deck.  The heat could cause wood to catch fire or melt composite decking materials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDZub3cuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXRlc3RlZC1zbW9rZWxlc3MtZmlyZS1waXRz0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94Nm5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy90b3AtdGVzdGVkLXNtb2tlbGVzcy1maXJlLXBpdHMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’s because the town has seen hundreds of water main breaks in the past couple of years.  As a result, town officials are putting a stop to using hydrants until a solution is found.  “We’ve put in an emergency order to not use the fire hydrants at this time,” said Town Supervisor Scott Allen.  He says the town has seen about 300 water main breaks in the last four years. In the last few weeks, there have been more than a dozen.  “It’s a lot of water main breaks for the town and a lot of cost to the town,” he said.  Allen says the order, sent to local fire departments, will help prevent further water main breaks and keep water flowing to residents and businesses.  “I actually received the letter yesterday, but was notified a week, week-and-a-half ago about the issues with the water main,” said Northpole Fire Chief Chris Hanlin.  He says using the hydrants could make a tough situation much worse.  “We flow so much water out of it if there’s a hole somewhere in it, it’ll collapse the pipe and they’ll have to replace the whole line,” he said.  Chief Hanlin says town of Pamelia residents shouldn’t be concerned about the lack of fire hydrants. He says the Northpole Fire Company typically takes its 2,000-gallon tanker to every call.  “When we respond to a working fire, vehicle fire, structure fire, we usually take our tanker anyway, so it’s really not any different for us. We just carry our water with us as opposed to getting it from the hydrant,” he said.  The town is currently undergoing a $22 million project to replace and add water lines. But the area where some of the breaks have been concentrated isn’t part of that project.  Allen says the town will work to get the hydrants back online, but he doesn’t know when that will be.

A blue house and its barn caught fire around 12:38 p.m. and was considered a total loss, according to Fire Chief Darren Walker with Jefferson Fire & Rescue.  Walker said no injuries were reported and the cause of the fire is under investigation by the Office of State Fire Marshal.  The fire started in the barn and made its way into the house, Walker said. Wind gusts blew the flames across Route 17, which also caused a brush fire.  “It jumped (Route) 17 and started a fire on the other side,” Walker said. “The wind was blowing it hard.”  At nearly 5 p.m., Walker said crews were still finding hot spots to put out in the house. Around 10 other local agencies assisted Jefferson Fire & Rescue.  Route 17 partially opened back up to one lane, but Augusta Road was still closed late Tuesday afternoon.

At about 10:30 p.m. May 19, the Jackson Fire Department responded to a structure fire reported in the 1200 block of South Elm Avenue on the east side of Jackson.  A passerby called Jackson Fire after seeing flames coming from a residential building, said Cpt. Joe Smith.  Heavy flames and smoke were pouring out of the home’s windows as police and fire crews arrived at the scene, Smith said.  A resident who had managed to escape the burning building spoke with firefighters. Due to a slight language barrier, fire crews were unsure if any of the man’s roommates were still in the home, Smith said.  “Crews did an aggressive interior search and ended up not finding anybody -- the people believed to be inside were not there,” Smith said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for about three hours, Smith said.  Smoke and fire damage throughout the house was significant, Smith said, adding the building will not be inhabitable for some time. It is unknown if the residents are seeking help with the American Red Cross.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation, Smith said.  Jackson Fire was assisted by the Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety and the fire departments of Summit, Napoleon and Spring Arbor townships.  Want more Jackson-area news?

"fire","2023-05-24","20:00:00","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T20:22:02","Coming off back-to-back wins in league play last week, Austin FC now looks to take another step closer to capturing silverware on Wednesday night, when the Verde & Black will host Chicago Fire FC in a U.S. Open Cup Round of 16 match at Q2 Stadium. The match will be the first-ever competitive meeting between the two teams, with an Open Cup Quarterfinal berth on the line. Kickoff is set for 8:00 p.m. CT.  Tune-In  Austin FC Outlook  Austin picked up a pair of statement wins last week, earning a 2-1 road result over Seattle and a 1-0 home victory against Toronto. The Verde & Black have moved back above the playoff line as the team finds itself in its best run of form so far this season, with a 3-1-1 record across its last five games in all competitions.  Gyasi Zardes was a driving force behind the six-point week, scoring the winner in both matches. The team, anchored by the center back trio of Julio Cascante, Alex Ring, and Leo Väisänen, held Toronto to zero shots on target and just 0.21 xG on Saturday. Aleksandar Radovanović also impressed in his first Austin FC start in Seattle, winning 100 percent of his aerial duels.  With attention now turning to the Open Cup midweek, Austin will once again need contributions from the entire squad as it prepares for its sixth match in 19 days. Left back Adam Lundkvist is just one of several players who have stepped up during that busy stretch.  Lundkvist picked up an assist in Austin’s Round of 32 Open Cup match against New Mexico United, then set up Ethan Finlay’s opener against Seattle. While it doesn’t show up on a stat sheet, his initial cross created the chaos that led to Zardes’ game-winner vs. Toronto, and his thunderous volley earlier in the match was close to flying in and becoming a goal of the season candidate.  If Austin are victorious on Wednesday night against Chicago, Head Coach Josh Wolff’s side would find itself three wins away from lifting the Open Cup.  Chicago Fire FC Outlook  Though Austin and Chicago have no matchup history between them, the Fire are one of MLS’ most historic clubs, having joined the league in 1998. They’ve also won the Open Cup four times, including twice when Josh Wolff was a player there in 1998 and 2000.  To reach the Round of 16 in this year’s edition of the competition, the Fire defeated fellow Windy City side Chicago House AC 3-0 in the Third Round and St. Louis City SC 2-1 in the Round of 32. In league play, the team had a rocky start to the season which saw the departure of Head Coach Ezra Hendrickson.  Frank Klopas replaced Hendrickson and won his first two games in charge, though those victories were followed by a loss at Charlotte and a home draw with Atlanta. In all, Chicago has been a different team home and away, going unbeaten through 10 home matches across all competitions but with just three total points from five games on their travels.  Former Liverpool and Bayern Munich man Xherdan Shaqiri is undoubtedly the biggest name on the Fire’s roster. MLS veteran Kei Kamara leads the team with four goals though, and Kacper Przybylko is another one to watch for up front.

"fire","2020-05-25","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:00:00","MARINA, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management is issuing seasonal fire restrictions effective Thursday, May 25, for public lands managed by the Central Coast Field Office, primarily located in western Fresno, Monterey, San Benito and Santa Cruz counties, due to dry conditions and wildland fire danger. These seasonal restrictions are in addition to the year-round statewide fire prevention order, issued on April 28, 2020. This seasonal fire order will remain in effect until further notice.  On average, human-caused wildfires make up 95 percent of all wildfires in California. Records show recreational target shooting has sparked more than half the wildland fires within the Central Coast Field Office boundary in the last decade. Many of these wildfires occur close in proximity to roadways, communities and recreational areas, posing considerable threat to public safety. Taking individual responsibility to reduce wildfire risk, while recreating on public lands, around homes and communities, before a fire occurs can help keep property, the public and firefighters safe.  “Due to drying conditions, significant dead and dying grasses and high fire danger, it has become necessary to implement additional fire restrictions,” advises Central Coast Field Manager Zachary Ormsby. “We ask for your cooperation to help minimize fire potential. These proactive measures are put in place to protect public land visitors, communities, adjacent private lands, and natural resources from the risk of wildfire.”  An increase in wildfire severity is expected based on forecasted climate scenarios, as well as an expansion of wildfire season over much of the western United States. The following restrictions will remain in place until the fire danger subsides:  No Campfires, briquette/charcoal barbeques, or stove fires are allowed outside of agency-provided fire rings or barbeques at designated developed recreation sites.  No Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, or a developed campground with a three-foot diameter area clear of brush and all flammable materials.  No welding or operating acetylene or other torch with open flame.  No motorized vehicles or tools powered by internal combustion engines off designated roads or trails.  No target shooting, except with a state of California hunting license and in accordance with California hunting regulations. The use of any steel-jacked, steel core or incendiary ammunition of any caliber is prohibited. Visit www.wheretoshoot.org for alternative recreational target shooting locations. Exploding targets or metal used for recreational shooting is prohibited.  As always, possessing, discharging or using fireworks or pyrotechnic devices are prohibited across Bureau of Land Management lands. Additionally, a valid California Campfire Permits is required to operate a stove or fire on these public lands.  HELP PREVENT FIRES  Residents and visitors are reminded to help prevent human-caused fires:  Make sure all campfires are dead out! Drown it and stir around the fire area with a shovel to wet any remaining embers and ash. If it’s not cool, it is not out.  Be sure to maintain proper tire pressure for all vehicles, ensure adequate tire tread, and check brakes for overheating. Do not drive or park on brush or grass. Do not drag chains while towing.  Motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and chainsaws require an approved spark arrestor.  Remember the use of steel-core ammunition, although legal while hunting, can greatly increase the chance of a wildfire if ricocheted off objects such as rocks.  Anyone found guilty of violating a fire prevention order may be fined not more than $100,000 and/or face imprisonment for not more than 12 months. Restitution for total fire suppression and damage costs incurred may be borne by the trespasser.  To learn how to prevent wildland fires, visit online at www.readyforwildfire.org.

The Last Resort: A Chronicle of Paradise, Profit, and Peril at the Beach by Sarah Stodola  Published in June 2022  The 2023 book that has most influenced how I think about higher education is Bryan Alexander’s superb Universities on Fire. (See my review here). Alexander’s book persuaded me that we must look at every higher education trend through the lens of an accelerating climate emergency.  It is from the perspective of Universities on Fire that I approached The Last Resort.  Most Popular Stories Most Popular  Travel and society writer Sarah Stodola approaches the question of the future of the beach resort in much the same way that Alexander approaches the future of the university. She understands the fate of oceanfront tourism to be inextricably bound up with sea-level rise, extreme heat and intensifying weather events.  The beach resort is both a victim and perpetrator of climate change. A beach resort is changed and perhaps destroyed when rising ocean levels erode beach sand away. The intensification of hurricanes and other tropical storms bring wind and flooding capable of decimating oceanfront hotels.  As Stodola points out, resorts require that customers travel to the place of manufacture. Unlike universities that have opportunities to digitize some of their services, moving teaching, learning and accreditation to online education platforms, a resort can’t go digital.  A theme of both The Last Resort and Universities on Fire is that hotel owners and academic leaders have done too little to prepare for the likely impacts of climate change. The attention of the resorts and the universities remains overly focused on near-term challenges, too often leaving the work of climate resiliency for tomorrow.  The problem with waiting is that all indications point to an acceleration of the negative impacts of climate change. Extreme heat, weather and flooding will not worsen linearly but instead along some accelerating curve of destruction.  Where beach resorts contribute the most to climate change is through the carbon impact of airplane travel. Global tourism means international flights.  The Last Resort is a fun combination of travel writing, environmental reporting and sociological analysis. Stodola flies all over the world, including to Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, Mexico, France and many other countries, to report on what she finds at the resort. She purchases carbon offsets to assuage her guilt for producing all this jet travel–related carbon.  The impact of air travel on climate change is also discussed in Universities on Fire. Alexander argues that universities and academics should be more mindful of how and when they choose to travel. Where possible, we should replace flights with digital connections, or at least try to take the train when possible.  The Last Resort is full of suggestions for how beach-side hotels can design their physical structures and guest services to minimize ecological damage. The book also shows why most resort operators fail to take these steps, mainly due to poor government policies and misaligned incentives.  Reading The Last Resort may provide academic leaders with some sideways inspiration for thinking about universities and climate change.  Pair Universities on Fire and The Last Resort together, and now we have the potential for some creative conversations.

Ms. Longacre purchased it from the Ranney family in 2015, had it restored it to running condition, and drove it in several Daffodil parades and at the Island Fair.  The New England Museum of Firefighting was established in 2021 by Mike Nugai, a retired Pittsfield, MA firefighter. The museum intends to add Nantucket’s 1957 fire engine to its working collection, which are maintained in operating condition and can make appearances at musters, parades, and other events.

(WSAZ/Gray News) - A homeowner in West Virginia has filed a lawsuit against a water company after firefighters reportedly encountered low water pressure at nearby fire hydrants that led to the destruction of their home.  WSAZ reports the fire in question occurred at a house on May 5. Firefighters arrived roughly five minutes after the initial call. However, crews didn’t gain control of the flames until about four hours later.  According to the lawsuit, the fire hydrants near the home were nonfunctional and failed to deliver enough water pressure to fight the fire.  The homeowner said they lost personal belongings and the family dog in the fire.  “[The homeowner] was forced to endure those consequences when his home burned to the ground while firefighters scrambled around the neighborhood for hours desperately searching for a fire hydrant with water supply,” the lawsuit reads. “[The homeowner] and neighbors looked on in dismay as firefighters scoured the neighborhood, trying – but failing – to get water out of the three hydrants.”  The lawsuit claims American Water Company failed its legal and contractual duties to deliver sufficient water pressure to the fire hydrants.  According to the lawsuit, the homeowner seeks to hold the water company accountable for failing to maintain adequate water pressure.  In a statement, water authorities said the three hydrants were installed on 4-inch water mains and have since been out of service.  According to WSAZ, state law changed nearly 30 years ago, requiring all hydrants to be installed on 6-inch water mains with larger lines allowing for the water flow needed to fight fires.  In 2017, the water company added a surcharge to customers’ bills for infrastructure improvements.  In media releases, the company stated that specific amounts of money would be used for upgrades and replacement of fire hydrants.  According to the complaint, the house destroyed in the fire was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Since the fire, the water company has reportedly covered the non-functioning fire hydrants with garbage bags.  Copyright 2023 WSAZ via Gray Media Group, Inc.

The trend involves houses and buildings that somehow have gone up in flames even though they had no working utilities. In some cases, they’ve threatened or damaged other people’s properties and potentially put fire crews in danger.  RELATED: Vacant house on West Side goes up in flames in early-morning fire  In the latest case, San Antonio police officers who happened to be in the area first noticed the fire in a home located in the 700 block of S. San Augustine. They called for fire crews shortly after 4 a.m.  “Our first engine crews, they reported a fully involved structure. We could actually see it from a ways off,” said Battalion Chief David Prado with SAFD.  Firefighters quickly knocked down the fire, but not before it caused major damage to the house. Prado says it is possible it had been smoldering for some time before anyone noticed it.  “No utilities to the structure, so it was vacant,” he said. “There were squatters going in and out. There’s evidence of activity.”  Arson investigators spent some time going through the home, looking for evidence of what caused the fire.  Prado says it appears someone may have had a hand in starting it, either by accident or intentionally.  “We’ve been seeing a lot of vacant structures that are actually catching fire,” he said.  Just last Thursday, some of the same fire crews were called to put out a fire in a vacant house in the 800 block of Poplar Street.  RELATED: Fire investigators looking into reports of ‘squatters’ seen inside home that burned  At that scene, Prado told KSAT 12 News he also suspected someone who didn’t belong had gotten inside and started the fire. It caused heavy damage to the home, which had stood in that location for nearly 100 years.  During the past month, there also have been several other fires throughout the city that have started mysteriously in similar structures.  One of them in a vacant apartment building, located in the 6800 block of Pecan Valley, sent up smoke and flames across the city’s Southeast Side.  In most cases, the damage has been limited to property.  However, firefighters fear they could put human lives in jeopardy.  They urge everyone to report any suspicious activity they may notice in and around any vacant structures.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9maXJlLWluLXZhY2FudC13ZXN0LXNpZGUtaG9tZS1wYXJ0LW9mLWEtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXRyZW5kLWZpcmVmaWdodGVycy1zYXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Winn announced the graduation of 20 recruits from the Academy's Call/Volunteer Recruit Firefighter Training Program this evening. The graduates received certificates of completion at a ceremony held at Department of Fire Services’ Bridgewater campus.  The graduating firefighters represent the fire departments of Acushnet, Dighton, Freetown, Hanover, Lakeville, Norwell, Onset, Plympton, Rehoboth, Swansea, and West Bridgewater.  “First responders are on the front lines of any crisis and these newest firefighters are needed now more than ever,” said Academy Director Winn. “The rigorous training they’ve completed provides them with the fundamental skills and knowledge necessary to protect their communities safely and effectively.”  Video of the ceremony will be posted tomorrow at the Department of Fire Services’ YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/dfsosfm.  The Call/Volunteer Firefighter Recruit Training Program is unique in that it delivers a standard recruit training curriculum, meeting national standards, on nights and weekends to accommodate the schedule of firefighters in suburban and rural areas. Making the training more accessible means more firefighters can participate and allows them more time to practice training skills with instructors.  The MFA, a division of the Department of Fire Services, has offered the program since 2003. About 3,000 call and volunteer recruits have graduated since then.  Today’s Firefighters Do Far More than Fight Fires  Today’s firefighters train for all types of hazards and emergencies. They are the first ones called to chemical and environmental emergencies, ranging from the suspected presence of carbon monoxide to Fentanyl overdoses or a gas leak. They may be called to rescue children who have fallen through the ice or locked themselves in a bathroom. They rescue people from stalled elevators and crashed vehicles. They must test, maintain, and utilize equipment such as self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), hydrants, hoses, power tools, and apparatus.  At the Massachusetts Firefighting Academy, they learn all these skills and more, including the latest science of fire behavior and suppression tactics, from certified fire instructors. They also receive training in public fire education, hazardous material incident mitigation, flammable liquids, stress management, and self-rescue techniques. The intensive program involves classroom instruction, physical fitness training, firefighter skills training, and live firefighting practice.  Students receive classroom training in all basic firefighter skills. They practice first under non-fire conditions and then during controlled fire conditions. To graduate, students must demonstrate proficiency in life safety, search and rescue, ladder operations, water supply, pump operation, and fire attack. Fire attack operations range from mailbox fires to multiple-floor or multiple room structural fires.  Graduates have completed 240 hours of training on nights and weekends. Upon successful completion of this program, all students have met the standards of National Fire Protection Association 1001. In addition, they have the ability to become certified to the level of Firefighter I and II and Hazardous Materials First Responder Operations Level by the Massachusetts Fire Training Council, which is accredited by the National Board on Fire Service Professional Qualifications.  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3MuZ292L25ld3MvMjAtbG9jYWwtZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXJzLWdyYWR1YXRlLWZyb20tZmlyZS1hY2FkZW150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was at a third-floor window that firefighters saw smoke and flames coming from the Nottingham Apartments when they arrived a little after 1 a.m. Tuesday.  Dan Ahonen, the owner of the building, explained how he found out about the fire (My son called and said,) ”Dad, we got a fire, it’s really a fire, he said. Ok, I’m on my way.”  The owner said it was a studio apartment that burned and was rented by one man. Five other people needed to be rescued, using the ladder truck, as they couldn’t exit because of the smoke and heat.  Battalion Chief Joe Tribbey says on a secondary search of the building some people were found who had slept through the alarms. “The fire alarms were working,” said Tribbey. “We did have some people who slept through those alarms. On our secondary search, we found two more people that had slept through in an apartment two apartments away from the fire.”  Tribbey says the fire alarm system helped alert the residents. One tenant, Valerie Sweeney, whose apartment is on the second floor, was back at the building this afternoon to retrieve a special pillow she needs because of a recent surgery. Sweeney said, “I was sound asleep and sleeping in a lounge chair, or a recliner because of my surgery and just heard a bang, bang, bang and jumped, and they’re just yelling it’s a real fire you need to get out, get out now.”  The fire department was called back to the scene Tuesday afternoon when insulation in the wall of the burned-out room was smoking. An 8 x 10 hole was cut in the roof and the smoking insulation was doused with foam.  Smoke and water damage forced all residents of the 35 apartments in the building to find alternate housing last night. However, the owner had some good news about when they might be able to return. Ahonen said, “Hopefully by the end of the week if things go right we can get 34 of the 35 people moved back in and then one apartment is charred, so that one’s gonna be a gut job.”  The Fire Department estimates the fire resulted in about $150,000 in damage. The cause of the fire is under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDIxb25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL3N1cGVyaW9yLWFwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlLWZvcmNlcy01MC10ZW5hbnRzLWZyb20tYnVpbGRpbmctNS1yZXNjdWVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Video shows the intensity of flames, which grew quickly, and smoke.  Thankfully, nobody was injured, but it could have been much worse if it wasn't for the heroism of the person behind the wheel of what's now a totally charred out school bus.  It happened at around 3:45 p.m. on Saunders Street by 65th Boulevard in Rego Park.  The driver said he had six kids between the ages of 5 and 11 on board and was taking them home from school when all of a sudden the front engine on the bus started smoking.  The flames spread quickly, but the driver stayed calmed and got all the kids off and they waited until their parents picked them up.  Meanwhile, the fire spread to five other vehicles and completely ruined a total of three.

Actually, the flames were as high as the fourth-floor window,"" Hanrahan said. ""It was almost like a fire tornado. But I just wanted to say the bus driver did an excellent job getting the kids -- there were six kids still on the bus and he got them off quickly before the fire really took off.""  ""I pulled them out the front and opened up the back door to get them out,"" the driver said. '""Don't be scared. Everything is going to be all right.'

The concept of backburning is a well-known firefighting technique, but doing so from a helicopter is something we don't often see. It could, however, be a bigger part of Cal Fire's fight in the future.  A prescribed burn is nothing new to Cal Fire or residents in certain parts of Calaveras County.  ""It's a way that we can light fire on our terms as opposed to an out-of-control wildland fire,"" said Matt Harrison with Cal Fire.  This is something we don't often see.  ""We're providing some training for aerial ignition and our ground folks in fire operations,"" Harrison said.  The unit is training pilots with an added application to their helicopters: a helitorch that can be used to backburn the area.  ""It is a great tool to get us into areas that we don't otherwise have access to,"" said Emily Kilgore of Cal Fire.  It is an application that can be helpful in the future of firefighting.  ""It's just a matter of the right tool at the right time with the right application,"" Harrison said.  Don't expect to see it in every fire. The planning for such use can take days and for specific conditions.  ""There is some criteria that has to be met ahead of time and a plan put in place,"" Kilgore said. ""So there's several days of planning before they can use helicopter ignition.""  It's a tool in the belt as fire season this year has the potential to still be dangerous.  ""Things have dried out later than last year. In California, eventually, everything is going to dry out. It's just a matter of when.  Heading into this summer, the agency wants people to remain vigilant. Just because there was a lot of water over the winter doesn't mean the risk level is zero.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jYWwtZmlyZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXJlZHVjaW5nLWZpcmUtcmlzay1mcm9tLXRoZS1haXIv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3NhY3JhbWVudG8vbmV3cy9jYWwtZmlyZS13b3JraW5nLW9uLXJlZHVjaW5nLWZpcmUtcmlzay1mcm9tLXRoZS1haXIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-12-01","Not Discerned","{""Marshalltown"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T05:06:10","Marshalltown Fire Chief David Rierson and Lt. Nick Hanus came before the city council on Monday night to share their annual report for 2022, offering some highlights from the previous year and renewing a call for increased staffing in the future.  For the fourth straight year, the MFD saw a higher number of requests for service, which, Rierson added, was the sixth time in the last years it had increased.  “It’s not a trend that is strictly a Marshalltown thing. It is an issue that’s nationwide. In speaking with other fire chiefs in the state of Iowa, they’re seeing 15 to 20 percent increases in their calls, so it’s not anything that’s new to us,” Rierson said.  He then segued into discussing a slew of suspicious fires set in 2021 and 2022 and noted that two second degree arson arrests had been made along with additional trespassing charges. In those cases, intent to burn could not be proven, but the individuals were proven to be on the properties where the fires occurred.  “It wasn’t everything. It didn’t solve all the arson cases that we had, but I think we sent a message that we weren’t gonna tolerate it and that we were going to address it as best as we could,” Rierson said.  The report also broke down where the calls for service in 2022 came from by quadrants, with the northwest section of the city from Olive Street north and from Center Street west far and away accounting for the highest number. Of the total calls, 80 were fires, and among those, about half were building fires.  According to Rierson, 43 of the fires were unintentional, three were arson and three were intentional. The rest were either “undetermined” or “acts of nature.” Although the number of total calls for service was again up, the number of actual fires went down slightly from 2021 to 2022. The fire loss in 2022 was estimated at $449,000, and the value of those properties was about $2.6 million. He estimated the department saved about $976,000 worth of property.  The chief reported a 17 percent increase in the number of overlapping calls, with 841 in 2022, making up about 25 percent of all of the calls for service. An overlapping call simply means the department is responding to more than one request for service at the same time, with as many as three calls sometimes occurring at the same time.  “That trend has gone up almost every year for the last four years, and I can’t stress how important it is for us to look at ways to resolve those issues because, in the end, it could mean the difference between somebody getting a firetruck to their house to put out a fire or not,” Rierson said.  He shared an example from last week when firefighters were on an EMS call, and they couldn’t send an ambulance. Ultimately, the patient was transported in the back of a police vehicle with an EMT taking care of them.  One positive note Rierson highlighted in the report was a 47 percent increase in the number of building inspections in 2022 — a total of 308 compared to just 164 in 2021. The department also continued a partnership with a private company to inspect sprinkler systems and fire extinguishers at businesses. In 2022, there were 726 inspections completed, and 61 — around nine percent — were noncompliant.  After wrapping up some of the highlights, Rierson opened the floor for questions, and Councilor Gary Thompson sought clarification on what the noncompliance meant, both for the building inspections and the system inspections contracted through the private company.  “It could be that a hood system wasn’t clean or it didn’t have its annual inspection or the fire extinguisher wasn’t serviced. For sprinkler systems, it could have been that it hadn’t had its annual inspection tests or, every five years, they’re required to have the internal components inspected. It could have been that they hadn’t had a five-year inspection as well,” Rierson said. “When it comes to building inspections that we do, a lot of times it’s just simple stuff. An exit sign isn’t working. The emergency lighting isn’t working, just simple things like that.”  Hanus, who serves as the president of the firefighters union, had a chance to comment and thanked the members of the council who have visited the station, inviting more to do the same.  Nonetheless, he spoke of a concerning trend.  “I guess brass tacks (is) we need more help. I know nobody has a magic bullet. I know that there are some solutions we can work through to get us some more people. The increase in calls is real,” Hanus said. “My guys are getting tired. I hate to be that plain about it, but if we can find a way to spread this load out, it’ll be better for everybody involved… We’ve had such an increase in medical calls that it takes away from our ability to respond to fires, which is ultimately what we’re here for.”  According to Hanus, other cities are often responding with twice as many firefighters as Marshalltown. A roster provided as part of the report showed the MFD currently has 18 full-time firefighters, three lieutenants, three captains, Rierson and Deputy Chief Christopher Cross on staff along with Fire Marshal Josh Warnell, Chaplin David Shearer and Administrative Assistant Maria Ramirez.  “I will say the people I work with, and I’m happy to work with, are some of the best people in the world. But we’re playing a numbers game, and I would hope we don’t get caught,” Hanus said. “I’m not up here to ask you to hire 10 more people tomorrow because I know that’s not the reality, but we can all work together to try and figure out a way to increase the staffing. It’s gonna be better for everybody involved.”  ——  Contact Robert Maharry at 641-753-6611 ext. 255 or rmaharry@timesrepublican.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzcmVwdWJsaWNhbi5jb20vbmV3cy90b2RheXMtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3JpZXJzb24tc2hhcmVzLTIwMjItZmlyZS1yZXBvcnQtd2l0aC1jaXR5LWNvdW5jaWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2020-09-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T21:55:00","As raging wildfires in western Canada put Wyoming and the surrounding region under a blanket of smoke, it raises the question of whether the Cowboy State also may face a monster wildfire season. Probably not, experts told Cowboy State Daily.  “Long-term forecasts do not indicate any significant anomalies for Wyoming, so a normal fire season is expected,” said Laura McConnell, a fire communications specialist for the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region.  Rapid growth of greenery now could turn into tinder for forest fires later, said Aaron Voos, spokesman for the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest.  “There is the possibility that lots of moisture now could lead to rapid growth of fine fuels and the potential for that to become wildfire fuel later,” he said. “That is all very dependent on whether our wet/cool weather pattern continues or changes, and the rate of snowmelt.”  The Wind River Mountains have been hazy because of smoke from wildfire in Canada. (Cowboy State Daily Staff)  Summer Could Be Rainy  It should be a wetter summer as the overall weather trend shifts from a hot, dry La Niña pattern to the milder El Niño, said meteorologist Don Watzel of Cheyenne’s Day Weather Inc.  And in the short term, some rain and cooler temperatures could “scour out” the lingering smoke from fires in Canada, he said.  That smoke caused air quality alerts in Montana and Nebraska, but none so far in Wyoming, Watzel added.  A buildup of greenery during the spring that dries out over the summer can make for a bad wildfire season, but grazing can mitigate it, said retired forester and wildland firefighter Karl Brauneis of Lander.  “The question of increased forage as it might contribute to an extreme fire season always comes up in years where we have a wet spring,” he said. “I have never seen that play out except in areas that exclude livestock grazing.”  2020 Mullen Fire Was A Whopper  Wyoming had a nasty fire season three years ago, particularly the Mullen Fire in the Snowy Range Mountains near Laramie.  That fire ignited in September 2020 and scorched nearly 177,000 acres.  Likewise, the current fires in western Canada sparked under unusually hot, dry conditions, Watzel said.  “Last week, they were running temperatures 15 or 20 degrees above normal for that area. They were hitting the 80s,” he said, adding that western Canada is expected to cool off and get some rain soon, which might help quench those fires.  Higher Temps, But More Rain  Meanwhile, it might start to get toasty in Wyoming over the summer, although that should be balanced out with ample rain, Watzel said.  “The seasonal outlook for June, July and August, not only for Wyoming, but the Rocky Mountains in general, does call for slightly higher-than-normal temperatures,” he said.  There could be windows of time between rainstorms when things dry out, meaning dry lightning strikes could cause forest or grassland fires, he said.  McConnell agreed that more rain than the region has gotten the past couple of summers could help dampen the fire season. Rainfall should return to “normal” levels, at least in parts of Wyoming.  “Near normal precipitation was reported over the mountains of Wyoming and Colorado maintaining the strong snowpack,” she said. “Eastern Colorado and eastern Wyoming saw deficits of 1 to 2 inches of moisture, which maintained abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions.  “The overall impact through this outlook period is for normal temperatures in May to transition to above-normal temperatures to the (Rocky Mountain Region) for the summer, with near-normal expectations for precipitation,” she added.  Management Is The Key  Brauneis said that based upon his experiences as a firefighter, he’s an advocate for forest and rangeland management through grazing, controlled burns and other means.  “I have been on fires where the range resource has not been managed and extreme conditions existed. In California, I once observed an official standing in waist-high forage talking about the extreme fire season due to the increased forage. The solution was easy — turn out the cows, the sheep and the goats,” he said.  “I believe the official was more interested in obtaining additional budget dollars for his agency through fear then understanding the actual impacts to the land by excluding range management,” Brauneis added. “This is why I believe that a good fire management officer must first be grounded in resource management.”  Mark Heinz can be reached at Mark@CowboyStateDaily.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vY293Ym95c3RhdGVkYWlseS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi93eW9taW5nLXNlZW1zLWhlYWRlZC1mb3Itbm9ybWFsLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLWV2ZW4tYXMtYmxhemVzLXJhZ2UtaW4tY2FuYWRhLWV4cGVydHMtc2F5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It happened Saturday near the intersection of Bellaire Boulevard and Chimney Rock Road. Houston Fire Department investigators are still trying to figure out what happened and what caused the fire.  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said the state bears some of the responsibility due to certain laws that are and are not, in place.  Crews on Monday were still cleaning up the aftermath of the fire. Linda Norah-Davis has lived in the area for 20 years. She said the fire at High Tech Finishing has ignited some worry.  ""Very concerning because it was about 10:30, 10:40 before we had any alerts,"" Norah-Davis said. ""I live in a community where most of us are older, a lot of us live alone and, of course, I’m a paraplegic in a wheelchair so it’s imperative that I know ahead of time so that I can make provisions for them to either evacuate me if that’s the plan in advance.""  The alerts didn't get to her until about three hours after the fire started.  ""I was already standing out there for 30 minutes while the fire was going on and to find out it was a chemical fire the whole time ... I was, like, dang, should I have worn a mask?"" Connor McNamara said.  Turner said the Texas Legislature has made it hard for cities, including Houston, to be in the know when it comes to potentially dangerous chemicals.  ""(HFD) Chief (Samuel) Peña, for I think two or three sessions in a row, has asked the Legislature to make it a requirement for businesses, or those with chemicals, to identify, at least to the fire departments, what those chemicals are,"" Turner said. ""We do need added notification of when people are storing chemicals, especially in close proximity to where people live, or quite frankly, where other businesses are.""  The City of Bellaire said it provided support to HFD and also notified residents about the shelter-in-place order. Norah-Davis said she thinks there should be a task force to update the alert system across the Houston area.  ""Make sure that you alert the residents, whenever there's a fire or when there's ever chemicals that may affect the health of the people in the neighborhood,"" Norah-Davis said.  KHOU 11 News reached out to High Tech Finishing for a comment but hasn't heard back. HFD said it's reviewing the fire reports to figure out what happened.

Woody was named to lead the Fire Academy last February.  ""We've got a lot of things that are happening there. We're kind of trying to revamp our reputation within the community and within the state,"" Woody told Rotarians.  Step one in those efforts has been rebuilding the Fire Academy's (AFTA's) relationship with SAU-Tech, through which AFTA provides training and college credit.  ""We're massaging what has historically been a poor relationship with the college... It's just one of those things that's been there for whatever reason and we haven't really relied on each other the way we could, to the fullest extent,"" Woody explained.  The relationship between SAU-Tech and AFTA is mutually beneficial, Woody said. Firefighters who train at AFTA earn college credit, which boosts SAU-Tech's enrollment numbers. SAU-Tech also helps provide for AFTA's technological needs.  ""We've even changed our fire trucks; our logos have SAU-Tech's on them,"" Woody said. ""That is a mutually positive relationship that benefits us both in a lot of ways.""  AFTA is currently working to expand curriculum. Currently, 39 courses that can go toward certification are offered there, and Woody said the school is working to add some additional non-certification classes.  ""We still have one of those few jobs where you can do everything right and it still kills you, so we've got to make sure we get out lots of relevant and current information,"" Woody said.  And starting in the 2023/2024 school year, high school students will be able to begin training at AFTA for future careers in the fire service.  ""This is going to enable them to immediately enter the workforce,"" Woody said. ""It's a three-way partnership, a true partnership, between the school district, the local fire department and SAU-Tech. They're going to earn college credit; the fire department has to be involved because they need the equipment, the truck, the gear; and then the school has to coordinate with the parents and move kids from Point A to Point B.""  AFTA is a premier fire training facility, Woody said, and barely missed out on being the site of the National Fire Academy.  ""Beautiful campus, nice dorms, great curriculum, instructors from all over the country – but no hands-on classes at the National Fire Academy. We have all of those things,"" Woody said.  AFTA's capabilities are so sought-after that even the Department of Defense selected its bid to train service members. Woody said instructors from AFTA will travel to Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Okla. next month to provide training. He hopes to win more DoD training bids in the future, he said.  ""That's a really big deal, because that could be a sustained revenue source,"" he said.  Woody said AFTA currently operates with about 20 employees on a $2 million annual budget. Enrollment has increased steadily since 2021, when AFTA served 12,123 students in 1,600 classes. In 2022, enrollment jumped to 17,800 students, and this year, AFTA is on pace to deliver classes to ""well over"" 20,000 students across about 1,800 classes.  The Fire Academy, in addition to serving paid fire departments, also serves volunteer fire departments, and Woody said he's hoping to grow the Academy's capabilities there as well.  Woody is currently waiting to hear back on a grant he requested that would purchase mobile props to provide off-campus training to volunteer firefighters. Approximately 96% of firefighters in Arkansas are volunteers, he said.  ""So we can take a burn building to the local fire department so they're still in service to make their calls with their equipment and their people to protect those areas,"" he explained.  But to continue growing, AFTA will need additional funding. Woody said he has submitted a capital budget proposal of $8 million to Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that he's awaiting word on.  ""It's critical to the present and future of the Fire Academy that we increase that revenue,"" Woody said. ""I told somebody a while ago, the sky and our budget are the limit to what we can get done at the Fire Academy because we have such a great team. Fortunately, we've got an ever-increasing demand for our services.""

Jaramillo says Asaya is her hero and saved multiple lives Saturday afternoon when he ran back into their burning house to get his siblings.  On Monday, Asaya Chaves walks through his front yard, pointing out the rooms of what used to be his home.  “This was the living room, that is where JJ was playing,” Asaya said holding his 2-year-old brother’s hand. “If you see back there, that back room, that’s my room. That is where I first smelled the smoke.”  Asaya explained he knew exactly what to do in the situation because of a lesson he learned at school.  “One day firefighters came, and they told us what to do and stuff like that, and the firefighters said if you smell smoke get out the house. I smelt that exact same smoke, so I told my grandma let’s get out there it’s a fire,” Asaya said.  Asaya’s grandma, Anna Jaramillo, was the only adult home at the time with her four grandkids.  “It was hard, but Asaya was the one that had it, he did, he took the kids out, the youngest ones and said ‘Grandma get out hurry,’ and we got Santi out,” Jaramillo explained.  But his 2-year-old brother, JJ, and 7-month-old sister, Armani, were still inside. So, Asaya ran back into the burning house before the firefighters arrived on scene.  “I got Armani out because she is little, and then I got JJ out, and after I got out everything started blowing up! Boom, boom, boom because the fire got to my grandma’s oxygen tanks and the second I got out of there everything started blowing up,” said Asaya.  The 9-year-old said it was like a scene from an action movie.  “When the firefighters came up, they seen me coming out with JJ, and after I came out they started running all the hoses and running around the house,” Asaya said.  “They saw him bringing the babies out, and they asked him ‘how did you know to do that?’ And he told them from school, and they told him you are a little hero,” Jaramillo said with tears of pride in her eyes.  The family moved into the house only a month ago, but now all that is left is charred wood and burnt toys scattered through the yard.  “It’s hard we have nothing left, but you know what that’s OK, we have each other, we are still here, we didn’t lose anybody. We can always replace everything else, but you can’t replace a life, so I’m really, really thankful for being here,” Jaramillo said wiping tears from her eyes. “I’m thankful for my grandson.”  Jaramillo says next week they were going to celebrate her daughter’s and granddaughter’s birthdays with a BBQ in the yard of their new house, but now they are working on a new plan.  If you would like to donate to the family, they have set up a Spotfund account.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvYi5jb20vbmV3LW1leGljby85LXllYXItb2xkLWJveS1zYXZlcy1zaWJsaW5ncy1mcm9tLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUtaW4tc2FudGEtZmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Officials say a portion will have to be completely torn down.  Investigators believe this could be arson.  “It just looked like a ball of fire,” said Frances Wolfe.  Wolfe was babysitting on Saturday evening when officers came banging on the door telling her to get out. When she came outside, she saw the old Granville Elementary School engulfed in flames and smoke billowing from the windows.  “We got evacuated at 6:30 p.m. and I know they didn’t leave here until almost 11 p.m. and then they were back yesterday,” Wolfe said.  Eight fire departments worked for several hours to battle the fire before getting the flames out.  “I just stood there for a minute and said, ‘Whoa, This is a wall fire, this one will go on the wall,’” said Fire Chief Tom Hartley Jr.  The historic school was built in 1910, with an addition added in 1916.  “I went to kindergarten here,” Hartley said.  While it was empty at the time of the fire, it was rich with history and design. We asked the chief if the building will be torn down. He said that’s up to the owners.  “The right side of it has to be torn down. The stairs are gone, the roof is gone,” Hartley said.  “I’m glad it is out, and I am just glad nobody got hurt,” Wolfe said.

According to the club's general manager, Michelle Yenni, it was the golf cart shed that housed about 70 golf carts, drink carts, machines that pick up golf balls, merchandise and miscellaneous storage.  Yenni was at the club Saturday evening when the fire broke out.  “Heard some noise and looked over and we could see a flame coming out of the cart shed. So, we immediately called 911,"" Yenni said.  Yenni said there were several events happening at the club that night, but thankfully, no one was injured.  “Assuming the building is a total loss, but I can’t put a value on it yet,"" Yenni said.  On Monday, fire investigators were on scene again.  Kenner Fire Chief, Terence Morris, said they got the call around 8:30 p.m.  “We had the fire under control in about 20 minutes into it, which was relatively good,"" Morris said.  Witnesses told Eyewitness News they heard what sounded like explosions.  “A lot of times when autos are involved their tires will blow out and that’s what people tend to hear,"" Morris said. “And that could’ve been anything from a fuel can inside the storage or some battery.”  A few cars parked near the shack were scorched.  Morris said they've called the ATF and Louisiana Fire Marshal's office to assist with the investigation. As of Monday, they had not released a cause of the fire.  Now, the club is working on getting golfers rolling on the green again and rebuilding the shack.  “I don’t know how long, but I hope we can come back bigger and better, and that’s the plan,"" Yenni said.

Despite record snow packs across the state, the OSU researchers agree that fire season could last longer this year and start later as well.  Although they say there aren’t any specific concerns for Southern Oregon, state climatologist and professor Larry O‘Neill said the larger snow packs will have an affect on our region.  “Many of the snow tell sites in the southern Oregon Cascades are projected to melt a little later than normal,” O’Neill said. “That’s basically a function of how many snow there was this year. So that tends to push back the start of fire season a little bit.”  As fire season rapidly approaches, it’s only a matter of time before the Oregon Department of Forestry’s fire danger level goes up.  “We start fire season June 1st at the very latest every year just because we live in such a fire prone environment,” ODF Southwest spokesperson Natalie Weber said in April. “So fire season won’t start later than June 1st.”  ODF Southwest said in the last several years, fire season began much earlier, starting in May.  O’Neill said the biggest difference going into this fire season compared to last year is the precipitation.  He said the its warmer and dryer now, than it was after record spring rain in 2022.

A 50-year-old man died Saturday in a house fire on the northeast side of Indianapolis, according to the fire department.  The fire was reported shortly before 6 a.m. by 911 callers who also said they heard a loud boom. Fire engines arrived minutes later to the two-story home, in the 9500 block of Timberline Drive, which was emanating heavy fire and smoke.  The homeowner, the mother of the deceased man, escaped on her own after the fire began. Crews found Todd Anthony Vendely unresponsive at 6:31 a.m. Multiple animals also died from the fire.  The department said the blaze was under control a little over an hour after fire crews arrived. Officials said “excessive clutter” inside the home made the response difficult.  The fire’s cause remains under investigation. The home had working smoke alarms, officials said.

"fire","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Kittery"", ""Maine"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T19:24:32","Identifying the person who died in a Kittery hotel fire could be difficult and time-consuming.  After the Days Inn was destroyed by fire and a body was found in the rubble, investigators said no one had reported a person missing. The hotel’s records were lost in the fire and the innkeeper had not kept a guest list as required, factors that investigators said made it more difficult to determine if everyone staying there was accounted for.  The medical examiner’s office said Monday that the body has not been identified and any information about the person’s identity will come from the state fire marshal’s office. A spokesperson for the agency did not respond to a phone call or email Monday requesting an update on the investigation and an interview with the fire marshal’s office.  “The process of identification can be arduous, and takes cooperation with the investigating law enforcement agency as they are the ones checking for previous law enforcement interactions, possible next of kin and talking with people who may have known the deceased person,” Lindsey Chasteen, administrator of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, said Monday.  It’s unclear how long it will take officials to release the identity once it is confirmed.  Related One person found dead in rubble of Kittery hotel fire  Investigators have released no new information since late last week when they announced that the body had been recovered. They have not determined a cause and have not said if they believe the fire is suspicious.  Advertisement  The medical examiner uses several methods of identification, starting with visual identification. If the deceased person is recognizable, they try to compare it to a driver’s license or identification photo. If that doesn’t work, they look to identifying marks such as scars or tattoos. But for burn victims, there may be no identifying markings visible depending on the severity of their burns, Chasteen said in an email.  If the medical examiner’s office has a tentative identification and a known dentist, they will attempt to use dental records to confirm a person’s identity. Many times, Chasteen said, a person’s dentist is not known, so the medical examiner will attempt a DNA comparison with a parent, child or male relative.  Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien said Monday that there have been no issues at the fire scene since the remaining hot spots were extinguished last week. Any updates about the cause of the fire will come from state investigators, he said.  The fire at the Days Inn on the Route 1 Bypass broke out around noon on May 17 and spread quickly through the wood-frame building. Kittery police helped evacuate people from the hotel as firefighters arrived and tried to check rooms that may have been occupied. Within minutes, the fire grew intense and the focus shifted to an exterior attack to contain the flames.  Related Fire destroys Days Inn hotel in Kittery  The hotel, which was valued at $1.7 million by the town, did not have a fire suppression or sprinkler system. There were working smoke alarms in the building.  It was built in 1956, according to town records, and was not required to have a sprinkler system, which state law requires for all hotels built since 1992. Older hotels are required to have approved smoke, heat and fire detection systems.  The victim’s body was pulled from the rubble of the building on Thursday afternoon. O’Brien said last week that the body was in the most badly burned part of the structure, but the building was too damaged to tell if the person had been in a room or hallway. The victim was not found in the area that firefighters had tried to reach before being pushed back by intense flames.  Investigators say the hotel owner, Kamlesh Patel, has been cooperative.

"fire","2023-05-28","02:00:00","{""RedHook"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T18:22:53","RED HOOK — A large fire tore through Migliorelli Farm along Budd Corners Road early Friday morning, taking out a 20,000-square-foot barn housing equipment, supplies, hay and more. Firefighters from 12 local companies worked for nearly nine hours to put the fire out. No one was injured and one baby raccoon was rescued.  “When you go there, it’s like going to a funeral,” Ken Migliorelli, the farm’s proprietor, said. “I got a phone call at 2 a.m. from the fire department. By the time I got there, it was in a blaze.”  Several days later, it’s not yet clear what started the fire. Migliorelli has been meeting with Dutchess County investigators and said that so far, he does know that whatever happened wasn’t his fault — a big relief.  “The investigator was there; we were both scratching our heads. Where the fire started, there was no equipment and minimum electric. We are thinking it came from another source. We are having a meeting with my electrician, too,” he said.  Migliorelli Farm is one of the largest regional farms, stretching across 650 acres throughout Red Hook and Tivoli. This particular location has been a farm for over 100 years, though not in Miglorielli’s name. “That was the farm my uncle purchased in 1969. I acquired it not too long ago,” he said.  Migliorelli has never experienced anything like this blaze before, though it’s the sort of thing any farmer worries about. He learned in the past few days that the original barn on this property actually burned down before, in 1954.  “It’s one of these old barns with beams and all that. What was there was built in 1955,” he said. A big wooden structure filled with apple bins, hay and firewood is “perfect for a fire,” he lamented. The electricity had been upgraded to new panels five or six years ago.  “You always take precaution to prevent things like this,” Migliorelli said.  Late May is the busy season on any regional farm, and the aftermath of the fire has been chaotic. The fire didn’t hurt any crops, just the equipment needed to tend to them. Migliorelli said his farmers are putting in the first big planting of tomatoes and preparing to plant peppers and eggplants.  “The normal farm activity has to continue,” he said. He has heard from some people who assumed he would shut down after the fire. “I was like, we can’t. The show has got to keep going.”  Migliorelli has also heard from what feels like the entire community — “150 texts from friends, colleagues and other farms,” he said. His voicemail is full. A GoFundMe fundraiser set up by Katherine Hardeman, a friend’s daughter, asked for $75,000 and is currently at $86,000 and climbing.  While Migliorelli Farm is a large operation locally, farming isn’t a lucrative business. “Most farmers are land rich and bank poor,” Migliorelli said. “You never have enough insurance to have enough. That could put you out of business itself.”  What insurance he did have will help, but not enough to replenish supplies and equipment, Migliorelli said. Not to mention rebuild demolished structures. A building as large as the one that burned houses a lot of forklifts, farm implements and other necessities.  Farmer friends are offering needed supplies, equipment to borrow, as well as advice. Another farmer who went through a similar ordeal last year has been sharing thoughts on dealing with insurance companies. And the GoFundMe response has been huge — loyal donors offering everything from $10 all the way up to a handful of $1,000 donations. Rhinebeck Farmers Market and Falcon’s Fields, a local beef farm, both gave $1,000, while Hudson Valley Garlic Growers as well as Scenic Hudson pitched in $500. The donor list is a who’s-who of a region eager to help, including chefs, restaurants, markets and longtime clients.  “I am pretty entrenched in the community here,” Migliorelli said.  Migliorelli is now or has been in the past involved with several Red Hook committees and is a longtime proponent of conservation easements of farmland. He has worked with Dutchess County farmland protection groups as well as planning boards. All of these people are showing up for him now in his time of need. “It almost feels like ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ kind of story,” he said. “One of my sisters just flipped me $25,000.”  Migliorelli is grateful for the help as he continues to farm and wade through the post-fire chaos. He’ll be relying heavily on the community this growing season, too, to purchase his well-known and loved vegetables and fruits at his farm stands in Red Hook, Rhinebeck, Mount Tremper, and at farmers’ markets in New York City.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL2h1ZHNvbnZhbGxleS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvbWlnbGlvcmVsbGktZmFybS1maXJlLXJoaW5lYmVjay0xODExMjE0My5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T20:26:15","Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  A sign at the Arthur ""Smokestack"" Hardy Fire Station in Baltimore displays the number of fatal fires and the total of people killed. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun )  On the side of every Baltimore firehouse, a white sign adorned with flames presents a stark record: 10 people dead in fires already in 2023.  The count serves as a reminder of how lethal fires can be, a reality that city and state officials seek to emphasize since Maryland experienced more deaths in the first quarter of this year than in the same period each year for the past two decades.  Advertisement  It’s typical to see more fatal fires in the winter months when people use heaters and other appliances to stay warm. However, 31 people in Maryland perished in fires from January to March, double the number during the same period in 2022 and an acceleration of the rate in a state that has averaged 64 fatalities a year in the past decade.  Twelve other deaths from the first three months of 2023 await confirmation by the medical examiner’s office of whether they were due to fires, meaning the total could reach 43 fatalities. The total includes building fires and fires in car crashes.  Advertisement  “Forty-some people in the first three months, that’s a huge, huge discrepancy for us,” said Maryland State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci.  Maryland’s population was smaller in 2004, the last time 40 or more people died in the first quarter of the year. Geraci wrote a letter March 30 to Marylanders, warning of the dangers of house fires, in hopes of slowing the disturbing trend.  The state saw some respite the next month, with only one death in April. At least four deaths, including one in Baltimore City, have occurred so far in May.  Geraci, a 50-year fire veteran whose office investigates arson and other fire crimes as part of the Maryland State Police, believes more people are dying in part because modern furniture burns more quickly and spreads flames faster. Furniture made of synthetic materials can combust and contribute to flashover fire, when all items in a room simultaneously ignite.  “You got a sofa that’s a solid brick of gasoline sitting in your living room because it’s all plastic,” Geraci said. “It’s all synthetics. It’s not the cotton-based materials that we saw when your parents and my parents had their homes.”  Maryland State Fire Marshal Brian Geraci talks about a fatal fire in Edgewood in May 2019. (Matt Button / The Aegis / Baltimore Sun Media Group)  Driving the high number of deaths in 2023 are eight fires that took multiple lives, including a West Baltimore fire that killed three children, ages 1, 2, and 7, in March. Baltimore fire investigators still are investigating the cause but found issues with a smoke detector. Chief Khalilah Yancey, a fire department spokesperson, declined to specify the issue, citing the open investigation.  That fire’s devastating toll weighs on Geraci, who considers it his responsibility to prevent such tragedies.  “It’s hard to tell people when they show up, ‘Your mom and dad didn’t make it out of the house,’” said Geraci, who placed his head in his hand and briefly cried at the memory while sitting in his office on a recent afternoon.  Advertisement  “It’s a failure for us. It’s a failure for me. Either we didn’t get the message to them, or they didn’t receive the message,” about how to keep a fire from starting or how to escape a burning home, he said.  Nationally, the rate of fire deaths has increased over the past decade. Residential fires are the leading cause of fire death, and modern houses burn faster than ever, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.  A sign at the Arthur ""Smokestack"" Hardy Fire Station says “Number of fatal fires this year: 7” and “Number of fire deaths this year: 10.” Thirty-one people have died in fires from January to March. The state average is 64 deaths each year. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun )  The speed at which blistering flames and thick, toxic smoke spread leaves only two to three minutes to escape a home after an alarm sounds, according to the National Fire Protection Association. That window is significantly smaller than in previous decades, when people had about 15 minutes to get out.  Many fatal fires involve houses that don’t have working smoke alarms. Two Anne Arundel County men, one a wheelchair user, died in separate house fires within three days this month. Both houses lacked a working smoke alarm.  People with physical disabilities and people who hoard are common victims of fires. An 82-year-old man died May 11 in Dundalk after an electrical failure in his mobility chair started a fire. Baltimore County Police officers tried amid intense heat and heavy smoke to rescue the man from the second floor of his house before firefighters arrived but were unsuccessful.  Two people died this year trying to save other people or personal items from their burning homes.  Advertisement  “If your house is on fire and you go back in, you’re not coming out alive,” Geraci said.  Some of the most common causes of fires are cooking, such as when someone leaves a stove on, and electricity, like when an overloaded extension cord heats up and sparks. Other leading causes are cigarettes and other smoking materials and heating appliances, such as space heaters placed too close to flammable items. Deaths can be caused by infection from burns and from inhaling smoke, which damages the heart and lungs and results in cardiac arrest.  An early morning house fire in West Baltimore killed three children. (Dillon Mullan / Baltimore Sun)  Fires in Baltimore pose a unique danger as more than 14,000 buildings are vacant. Fires in vacant houses, sometimes caused by people living inside, spread quickly to neighboring units and can be treacherous for firefighters. In early May, a towering plume of smoke and fire consumed five houses in West Baltimore. Four were vacant and marked as “Code X-rays,” a designation given to unstable buildings that are too dangerous for firefighters to enter.  Baltimore consistently has the highest number of fire fatalities in the state, followed by the populous counties of Baltimore, Montgomery and Prince George’s, according to data from the fire marshal’s office. Seven Baltimore residents died in 2022, and at least six of the nine people killed in 2021 residential fires were in buildings without working smoke alarms, three of which were vacant, according to the most recent annual data.

Citywide, firefighters knock on doors weekly to check and replace smoke alarms for free. After the three children died in the Rosemont fire, crews descended on the neighborhood the next day to install alarms and conduct safety inspections.  Advertisement  Acting Baltimore Fire Chief Dante Stewart said the department is focusing fire prevention efforts on older adults and young children, who are the most vulnerable. Fire officials hold a monthly fire safety class, visit retirement homes to raise awareness of risks, and teach children under 18 who are caught setting fires about the dangers of arson.  Safety messages soon will be advertised on Charm City Circulator buses and posted on social media. City residents can call 311 to have fire crews install an alarm or perform a home safety inspection.  All new Maryland residences are required to have sprinklers, which are triggered by heat and extend the amount of time people have to escape.  Geraci warns that people are too complacent about fires starting in their own homes, which he believes has contributed to an uptick in deaths. He wants them to think ahead.  “You can imagine when the smoke is back down to the floor and you can’t see your hand in front of your face. It’s like, ‘Oh hell, what am I going to do?’” Geraci said. “You’ve got to be ready for it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vbWFyeWxhbmQvYnMtbWQtY2ktbWFyeWxhbmQtZmlyZS1kZWF0aC1pbmNyZWFzZS0yMDIzMDUyMi1rMnMzdHN3YWNyaHlycGFxaWg1b3pxY3Q0cS1zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In one of its latest budget adoptions, the board opted to close three fire stations in Concow, Berry Creek and Stirling City through the winter months because of financing viability. In the meetings following the decision, many residents aired grievances and noted the distance between their communities and the next nearest fire stations.  In April, the board asked that staff come back with a report on how many calls for service came in last winter. The report is expected to go over the number of fires, medical calls and response times.  According to the related agenda report, the total number of calls between the three stations during the 2022/2023 winter months was 157.  Based on reports from the county, each station costs about $197,000 per year to staff and operate.  Other business  Along with discussing these numbers, the board is also set to look over the following items:  The board will continue going through project proposals to potentially be funded by American Rescue Plan Act money. With the remaining $3.5 million, the board will be choosing from eight new proposals, totaling $3.34 million.  An information presentation will be given on the county’s current ground ambulance service contract with the Sierra-Sacramento Valley Emergency Medical Services Agency, which has been the county’s sole provider of these services for a decade.  Once again the board will go over a series of public nuisances and determine whether liens should be imposed on properties.

There were no immediate reports of injuries, but hikers were advised to stay away from the area.  Israel experiences long, hot and dry summers, with conditions ripe for wildfires. Large blazes broke out in 1989, 1995, 2010, 2015, 2019, and 2021. Most of them are suspected to have been sparked by negligence or arson.  Climate models show that such large-scale blazes are getting more frequent and more fast-spreading, in part due to the climate crisis raising temperatures and causing even more extreme summers with drier conditions.  Governmental authorities and other bodies have worked to prepare for the 2023 wildfire season, clearing underbrush and other overgrown flora that could provide fuel for brush fires.  A 2017 government report advised establishing a single supervisory body to oversee a coordinated nationwide effort to implement fire prevention measures in all Israel’s forests, irrespective of who owns or manages them.

All but one of the victims were Indigenous girls, officials said Monday.  “This is a horrific incident. It’s tragic. It’s painful,” President Irfaan Ali said, adding that his government was mobilizing all possible resources as he requested help from the region to identify the remains of 13 bodies.  The fire broke out at about 10:50 p.m. Sunday in the dormitory building of a secondary school that serves remote, mostly Indigenous villages and is located in the border town of Mahdia, a gold and diamond mining community about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the capital, Georgetown, the government said in a statement.  Deputy Fire Chief Dwayne Scotland said ""the fire was maliciously set” and began in the building's southwest corner. However, Police Chief Clifton Hicken said “initial investigations suggest that it was maliciously set."" He also said that while the girls' dorm had five doors, iron grill work trapped the students inside.  Authorities did not provide further details and did not share what evidence, if any, points to arson.  “This is the saddest day of my life as president. I wish it had not occurred,” Ali said.  A total of 59 girls usually reside in the dorm, but only 56 were in the rooms when the fire began because three of them went home for the weekend. Thirteen girls and a small boy died at the dorm, while five died at Mahdia Hospital, the government said.  Of those injured, six children were flown to Georgetown and 17 remain hospitalized in Mahdia, officials said.  Officials initially said 20 students were killed but later updated the toll to 19, with several others injured. National Security Adviser Gerald Gouveia said the figure was revised after doctors revived a very critical patient that “everyone thought was dead.”  “When firefighters arrived on the scene, the building was already completely engulfed in flames,” Guyana’s Fire Service said in a statement. “Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to the relatives and friends of those young souls.”  Officials said two children remain in critical condition and four have severe injuries.  “Firefighters did manage to rescue some 20 students by breaking holes in the northeastern wall of the building,” the department said.  The school serves mostly Indigenous children aged 12 through 18, Gouveia said. He said it was too early to speculate what might have caused the fire, adding that heavy thunderstorms in the area posed a challenge to those responding by air.  “It was a battle for us,” he said. “The pilots were very brave, very determined.”  He added that the government and emergency responders “made a gigantic effort” to save as many people as possible.  Ali said officials were contacting parents and mobilizing psychologists to help those affected by the fire.  “I cannot imagine the pain right now of the parents,” he said. “This is a major disaster.”  The opposition party, APNU+AFC, issued a statement saying it will seek a thorough investigation and thanked people in the small community for helping authorities rescue children who were trapped.  “We need to understand how this most horrific and deadly incident occurred and take all necessary measures to prevent such a tragedy from happening again in the future,” opposition lawmaker Natasha Singh-Lewis said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9ueXMvd2F0ZXJ0b3duL2FwLXRvcC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZmlyZS1yYXplcy1zY2hvb2wtZG9ybWl0b3J5LWluLWd1eWFuYS1raWxscy1hdC1sZWFzdC0yMC1jaGlsZHJlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The blaze was reported at 3:10 p.m. near 55 N. 400 East.  According to emergency radio traffic, the home’s occupants called 911, reporting smoke inside the residence, believed to have been caused by electrical wiring. Several crews responded to the area.  Four people were in the home at the time of the fire. They were advised by 911 dispatch operators to evacuate the home.  The first firefighters to arrive reported no flames visible. However, heavy smoke was coming from the eves of the roof, prompting additional crews to be paged to the incident.  Firefighters located heat coming from the attic in the garage. After removing some of the ceiling, they found the fire smoldering in the attic’s insulation and were able to extinguish it.  The homeowners told firefighters, they were cooking something in a toaster, when the power went out. They then started smelling smoke.  Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly with only minimal damage. They were also able to keep it from spreading into the rest of the home.  The fire is suspected to have started in the garage. The homeowners had told first responders, they had bought an electric vehicle and had placed a charger inside of the garage. They noticed their home appliances stopped working a few hours before the fire started.  Officials are still investigating the exact cause of the fire, but they believe the electrical wiring is to blame.

"fire","2023-09-06","Not Discerned","{""Asbury"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T03:24:30","ASBURY, Mo. — Agricultural experts say it only takes about 20 seconds for an adult to fall victim to a grain bin. It actually resulted in 11 deaths in 2021.  Prevention is the focus of two training events this week. The first was held earlier tonight at the “Asbury Fire Protection District.” It’s thanks to “Specialty Risk Insurance” — which donated the equipment to the “Asbury Fire Protection District.” Officials with the “National Education Center for Agricultural Safety” will be on the road the next two weeks to train departments in rural communities across the Midwest.  When an adult falls into a grain bin, firefighters now have the capability of rescuing the person with a grain rescue tube. The tube is made of metal panels that piece together, making a circle around the trapped person. Rescue personnel then place an auger in the grain surrounding the person – to extract the grain. The person is then able to free themselves by pulling themselves out – or receiving help from first responders.  Asbury’s new equipment will also benefit 6 neighboring departments.  “Our department alone, which is a very small volunteer department, we cover 45 square miles of area, so, and all the other departments cover large areas, and there’s darn near a grain bin every, probably about every square mile, there’s at least one-grain bin. And the bins are getting larger and larger as time goes by,” said Tim Bartley, Volunteer Firefighter, Asbury Fire Protection District.  “We walk through how we set the tube up, then we actually put it into practice. We fill our trailer with about 120 bushels of grain. We actually physically sink people into the grain with an auger. The very thing we’re going to teach ’em not to do. We’re gonna simulate them having an accident. We’re gonna sink them down to their waist, and then the fire department is actually gonna go in there, use their rescue tube, and rescue them,” said Brian Freese, National Education Center for Agricultural Safety.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Vyc3RhdGVzaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamFzcGVyLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzL3RoZS1kYW5nZXItb2YtZ3JhaW4tYmlucy10aGlzLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtaGFzLW5ldy1yZXNjdWUtZXF1aXBtZW50L9IBigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3Vyc3RhdGVzaG9tZXBhZ2UuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvamFzcGVyLWNvdW50eS1uZXdzL3RoZS1kYW5nZXItb2YtZ3JhaW4tYmlucy10aGlzLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtaGFzLW5ldy1yZXNjdWUtZXF1aXBtZW50L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(KPTV) - It’s been nearly four years since a brush fire in Northeast Portland broke out in an empty field and now the man who was accused of starting the fire was sentenced to two years in prison.  Allen Singerhouse pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree arson for a fire he started at his camp near Northeast 85th Avenue and Siskiyou Street back in August of 2019. The wind that day blew flames south towards Northeast 84th Avenue and Russell Street. Thick black smoke could be seen all around Portland. The fire destroyed businesses, cars, and a townhouse. Singerhouse was arrested a few months later and charged with arson. He apologized for his actions in court Monday.  “My poor decisions destroyed property and put innocent lives in danger of the homeowners and the firefighters in general,” Singerhouse said. “For that, I’m truly sorry.”  But after bailing out of jail, the court and prosecutors recognized his determination to turn his life around. Prosecutors said between then and now, he broke free from his addiction to meth, got a job, and became an influential member of his local church.  “The fact that he has been out of custody for an extended period of time and has gotten himself into treatment, gotten himself sober, and now becoming a valuable member of society, we have given him a very unusual offer for a fire of this magnitude,” The prosecutor said.  Judge Christopher Ramras also acknowledged the work Singerhouse has done over the last few years to get his life back on track.  “When we first met well over a year ago, when we had the first settlement conference, my recollection even then, you we actively engaged in treatment,” Ramras said.  No victims were present in court Monday, nor did they make a statement. But FOX 12 did speak to Freddy Ryan, Manager and Trainer of Grand Avenue Boxing Club. The gym was one of the businesses destroyed in the fire. He stood in the empty lot where his business once stood, recounting the destruction of the place he used to work.  “It was gone,” Ryan said. “They started demolishing the building. It was an unsafe building. We did our best to maintain it but you know, nothing you could do.”  Ryan said even after all these years trying to rebuild the gym, he never wanted to see Singerhouse go to jail.  “We’re not looking for vengeance,” Ryan said. “We’re looking for a little bit of redemption.”  Singerhouse was sentenced to two years in prison with five years of probation. There is also a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence on hold. But that would only be activated if Singerhouse fails to maintain a job and stay sober. He is also ordered to pay more than $160,000 in restitution to the victims. But Singerhouse said he’s dedicated to keep his life on the right track.  “I believe my actions warrant more than just an apology but a living amends that I will work through and continue to do by living an active role in my community, in my recovery community, and those about my life affecting them for the greater good,” Singerhouse said.

Police said they were supporting the bereaved families and arresting the rioters — but faced questions about whether officers' actions contributed to the fatal crash. Two teenage boys, ages 15 and 16, died in a crash involving an electronic bicycle in the Ely district of the Welsh capital on Monday evening, police said.  The South Wales force said “large-scale disorder” broke out after officers were called to the scene.  Chief Superintendent Martyn Stone said the force had received video footage showing a police van following an e-bike in the area minutes before the crash. But he said there were no police vehicles on the street when the crash occurred.  He said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which investigates deaths in which police may be involved.  Scenes livestreamed on social media Monday night showed dozens of people, many wearing hoods or ski masks, milling around while others threw objects and shot off fireworks at a line of police officers with riot shields blocking one end of the street.  A fire was burning and a helicopter could be heard hovering overhead. Shortly before midnight, a car was set on fire and burned fiercely, while a second vehicle was overturned and set ablaze.  The mayhem continued into the early hours of Tuesday, and at one point police officers were stationed outside Ely Police Station after suggestions it could be targeted.  Stone said 15 officers were injured, with 11 needing hospital treatment. He said police had made “a number” of arrests.  Resident John Urquhart said tensions rose in the area when police failed to tell local people what had happened.  “There was no attempt to communicate with the crowd and they showed nothing but disdain for the community and acted like we didn’t deserve to know what happened on our own doorstep,” he said.  “There was nobody going through the crowd. Crucially, I think the police really needed people to be out talking to the community and putting their minds at ease.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbG9jYWxuZXdzLmNvbS9uYy90cmlhZC9hcC10b3AtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL2NhcnMtc2V0LW9uLWZpcmUtaW4td2Vsc2gtY2FwaXRhbC1hcy1wb2xpY2UtZmFjZS1sYXJnZS1zY2FsZS1kaXNvcmRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rural fire districts rely heavily on the services of volunteer fire fighters, a resource pool that has dwindled noticeably in recent years.  ""Mohawk Fire, like most rural fire agencies, and really over 50% of the fire service in general in this country are volunteer fire fighters,"" said Mohawk Valley Fire Chief Steven Wallace.  Wallace's department serves roughly 4,500 people over a 27 square mile district around Marcola. He says they receive close to 500 calls a year.  Wallace's volunteer base has been cut in half over the last decade, going from over 40 volunteers in 2012, to under 20.    ""We've seen our volunteer numbers dropping routinely over the last ten years,"" Wallace said. ""It definitely sped up during the COVID-19 pandemic.""  The primary issue stems from a lack of incoming volunteers, according to Wallace, and burnout has only caused more and more people to leave.  ""Burnout becomes a bigger issue when we have lower numbers, which helps drive people out the door,"" Wallace said. ""[During] the summer, it becomes very difficult with the heat. People get wore out quicker. They get tired easier, so we need to have enough people to keep accomplishing the mission, but as well as not hurting anyone in the process.""  Just last week, Wallace and the Mohawk Valley Rural Fire Department responded to a house fire in Marcola. The fire would take hours to get under control with hotter temperatures and a small number of volunteers.  It ended up being a two-alarm fire, requiring help from other local fire departments.  ""Most fire districts are expanding their mutual aid agreements, because all of us are experiencing shortages in staffing,"" Wallace said. ""Even the paid departments are seeing a shortage of people applying for jobs.""  To rectify this, Wallace and his department have begun reaching out over social media, going to high schools, and trying to increase their reach to bolster these numbers. Wallace adds that the Oregon Fire District Directors Association has created a retirement account for volunteers, as well as offering residency programs where these volunteers can live at a fire station for free while they train.  One of Mohawk's volunteers, Jerry Oglesbee, says that had he started volunteering sooner, his career path might have been different.  ""If I would have done this when I was 20, this would have been a career for sure,"" Oglesbee said. ""Now it's a hobby, and I tell people that, it's a hobby. I enjoy it, I love it. I don't know, if they told me I couldn't do it, what I would do.""

The fire started at the six-story Mona Lisa co-op building around 1 a.m. on March 8 in a first-floor apartment. It quickly traveled up the building and through the roof.  More than 100 firefighters worked at the scene. It took about seven hours for them to get the fire under control. A 67-year-old man on the fourth floor died in the fire, and many other residents and first responders were injured  Two months later, a group of residents are still asking to retrieve what’s left of their personal belongings.  ""We have all of our memories there,” said one resident. “My parents – they passed away. Her pictures, the only one video I have – this is devastating for us.""  They also say that they are concerned about burglars picking through their possessions.  News 12 was told by a spokesperson from the City of Yonkers who said residents are not being allowed back in the building due to dangers posed by asbestos. They would be willing to expedite an application to remediate it, but the co-op board has yet to file any paperwork.

"fire","2022-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:36:12","Fires affected some 1.8 million hectares in Argentina in 2022.  Many of the country’s 2022 fires occurred in the country’s northern Chaco region and were largely caused by industrial agriculture coupled with drought conditions, according to Indigenous residents and researchers.  The arid Gran Chaco is the second-largest forest in South America after the Amazon, and extends across 110 million hectares and portions of four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia  Experts said deforestation of Argentina’s Chaco is affecting Indigenous communities’ access to resources.  “We couldn’t see the sun for a whole month because of the clouds of smoke. For an entire month, between October and November (2022), we didn’t see the sun,” said David Sarapura, from the Indigenous Kolla Tinkunaku community in Argentina.  “It was awful,” Sarapura said, “the older people told us that fires like this had never happened before. Even airtanker planes couldn’t be used to fight the fire because there was no visibility.”  A similar situation occurred in General José de San Martín, another of the departments located in the province of Salta, near Orán.  Satellite data from the Global Forest Watch (GFW) monitoring platform began registering deforestation alerts associated with fires on Oct. 1, 2022. According to a report by Greenpeace Argentina, which includes data from the National Fire Management Service (SNMF), forest fires affected around 95,000 hectares of forests in Salta province in 2022. Nationwide, fires affected some 1.8 million hectares.  In mid-December, rainfall slowed the spread of the fire, although it still burned in some places. By the beginning of 2023, there were still some areas with fire, but very few, Sarapura said.  “Last year, Salta had a significant number of fires. It is a growing problem and one that has persisted over the last three years thanks to drought,” said Hernán Giardini, Coordinator of Greenpeace Argentina’s Forests and Climate Change campaigns.  Giardini says it is unusual for a large number of areas to catch fire in Salta. This is especially true for the Yungas forest, a mountainous area.  Giardini said Argentina has been experiencing a severe drought, which caused “many outbreaks of fire to spread.”  Since 2019, much of Argentina has been experiencing droughts, with 2022 12.8% drier than average and ranking among the 14 driest years since 1961, according to a report from Argentina’s National Meteorological Service.  Another report published by the meteorological service in February 2023 suggests that extreme temperatures at the beginning of the month were mainly concentrated in Patagonia, but from Feb. 6, heat moved from south to north.  Giardini said that 95% of Argentina’s forest fires are caused by humans, explaining that some are intentional, while others are accidental or caused by negligence.  “When I say accidental, I mean everything from a poorly extinguished barbecue or cigarette butt through to burning pasture for regrowth, a practice that in times of drought can lead to fire spreading easily,” Giardini said. “Areas are burned after a clearing, or are burned just to avoid having to secure a deforestation permit.”  The other 5% of the fires, Giardini continued, are caused by lightning storms that strike the middle of the forest and ignite a fire that spreads easily in the dry season.  “It also happens sometimes in areas that are difficult for the fire service to access, and it gets more challenging in the mountains,” Giardini said.  But Giardini cautioned that it’s not always possible to determine the cause of a fire.  “We were on the ground with communities helping them to fight the spread of the fire, the causes of which are not yet known,” Giardini said.  “If you ask the older people, our grandparents, they will tell you that climate change has occurred dramatically in a short space of time. This includes a lack of water, the disappearance of some species, and the movement of wild animals from one place to another,” Sarapura said. He added that until recently, jaguars would never have been seen in areas above 2,500 meters of altitude; but, over the last few years, due to with fire activity, they have been spotted at 3,000 meters.  Sarapura, a member of the Indigenous Kolla Tinkunaku community, said that many species of wildlife fled because of the fire, but others were burned to death.  “We have jaguars (Panthera onca), tapirs (Tapirus terrestris), brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira), black squirrel monkeys (Saimiri vanzolinii). There are a lot of animals, because this region is one of the most populated with wildlife in the whole of Argentina,” Sarapura said.  “Without their natural habitat they had to migrate to other areas in order to survive,” he added. “Let’s hope that this year is not as dry, because if it happens again it will wipe out the entire forest. For the time being, some trees have been left standing.”  Ana Álvarez, President of the Chaco Argentina Agroforestry Network, explained a large, forest-dependant Indigenous population inhabits Formosa, Chaco and Salta—three provinces in the Argentine Chaco region.  Álvarez said deforestation in Salta province is affecting Indigenous communities’ access to resources, and is being driven by industrial agriculture.  Álvarez explained that the region’s agriculture boom began in the 1970s and intensified at the beginning of the 21st century as soy and other commodity crops prospered due to temporary increases in rainfall. .  “It was then that the entire region first opened up to crops, mainly soy, but also beans, corn and sugarcane,” Álvarez said.  But the aridity the Chaco is known for eventually returned. Álvarez said that in order to stay profitable, many crop growers became cattle ranchers and expanded pastureland by clearing forests.  The Gran Chaco is the second-largest forest in South America after the Amazon, and extends across 110 million hectares and portions of four countries—Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. The ecoregion is home to some 3,400 plant species, 500 bird species, 150 mammal species and 220 reptile and 100 amphibian species.  Argentina’s Forest Law was passed in 2007 after a petition spearheaded by civil society garnered 1.5 million signatures, putting pressure on the National Congress to act. Through this law, which requires all provinces to implement Territorial Planning of Native Forests (known by its Spanish-language acronym, OTBN), deforestation was prohibited in almost 80% of forested areas. However, some land-use plans, such as those affecting Salta and Chaco provinces, were modified by their provincial governments, leading to a reduction in areas where clearing is prohibited. The law also ordered that the OTBN be updated every five years, but not all provinces have complied with this.  “Since the Forest Law was enacted, some 400,000 hectares of forest have been lost in the Chaco province —close to half a million. If we zoom out and talk about the entire Gran Chaco, in the 13 years from 2004 to 2017, seven million hectares were lost. This figure includes Paraguay and Bolivia, but a large part of these seven million hectares is in Argentina,” said Italian physicist Ricardo Tiddi, a member of the citizens’ platform Somos Monte.  “There has been so much clearing in Argentina that there are almost no wildlife corridors left for animals to move between the Argentine Gran Chaco and the rest of the Gran Chaco in other countries,” Tiddi said.  Lecko Audencio Zamora, Indigenous peoples’ rights activist and member of the Wichi people, lamented the spread of soy in the region.  “They have always preached that [soy cultivation] brings health and progress,” Zamora said, “but in reality, for Indigenous peoples, it has brought the opposite; land evictions, more poverty, more hunger and less health.”  This is a translated and updated version of a story that was first reported by Mongabay’s Latam team and published here on our Latam site on March 9, 2023  Banner image: A community member from Orán grieves over the devastation caused by forest fires.

A massive fire tore through Manila’s historic post office building overnight, slightly injuring seven people and razing the nearly 100-year-old landmark in the Philippine capital, police and postal officials said Monday.  The fire started before midnight Sunday in the basement of the Neoclassical five-story building and was brought under control Monday morning more than seven hours after it began, firefighters said.  An investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire and the damage, officials said, adding that seven people, mostly firefighters, sustained minor injuries or were overwhelmed by thick smoke.  Advertisement  The Manila Central Post Office was one of the capital’s busiest office buildings but was closed when the fire started. The building was the country’s main mail-sorting and distribution hub and was the central office for the Philippine Postal Corp.  The building, recognized as a national landmark, was built in 1926 with high columns in the traditional Neoclassical style. It was severely damaged during World War II and was rebuilt in 1946.  It has been used as a backdrop for many Philippine movies and stands near a plaza named after national hero Andres Bonifacio, which has been the site of protests by left-wing and nationalist activists over a range of political and social issues.  It sits along the Pasig River on a main intersection of Manila’s key roads.

Crews searching the rubble of a massive construction fire in North Carolina on Friday found the bodies of two people that firefighters couldn’t reach before the flames became too intense.  Authorities didn’t identify the victims, but officials said two workers were missing after the Thursday fire on the site of a new apartment building in the upscale South Park neighborhood of Charlotte.  No one else was injured in the five-alarm fire, including more than 90 firefighters and a worker trapped for a time on top of a crane as a fire engine sprayed water on the metal to keep it from collapsing.  “I’ve never ever seen a fire of this magnitude,” said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings, a 31-year veteran of the force. ”It’s devastating, heartbreaking.”  Investigators think the fire started about 9 a.m. Thursday in a trailer used to spray insulation into the building’s walls, Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said.  The chief said they aren’t sure exactly what set off the blaze and haven’t been able to do a thorough investigation of the trailer.  “Obviously, the building’s still in a state where it is not safe for all of our members to go in,” Johnson said.  The massive fire sent huge red flames and dense black smoke into the sky. At least two small crews of firefighters had to make mayday calls and be rescued from the fast-moving blaze, including one who could hear the cries of the trapped people on the sixth floor but couldn’t see them through the smoke, Johnson said.  “They were going by sound, trying to get to them but were unable to get to them before conditions changed,” Johnson said. “They had to call a mayday.”  The firefighters did rescue 15 workers inside the building, including the crane operator. Firefighters delivered protective clothing to him until he could climb down to safety, Johnson said.  Photo: Firefighters at the scene.

(WLUC) - A fire destroyed a building at 209 Calumet St. on M-26 in Lake Linden Sunday night, however, no people were injured.  The Lake Linden Fire Chief says the fire happened near the corner of Calumet St. and 2nd St. Firefighters first responded just after 11:00 p.m. Sunday. It was described as an explosion by multiple callers.  “I was standing outside, about a block away,” said Lake Linden Resident Kim Taunton. “When I heard a loud boom, and then I saw a puff of smoke, and then I saw it light up with flames, so I ran out into the road, and I saw the fire on the garage.”  Taunton says there was a total of three separate explosions as it covered the garage. Once the garage caught fire, it quickly spread to the neighboring building.  “The garage was fully engulfed in flames, the stairwell to the building was fully engulfed in flames, and then the fire was on the roof of the big building here that’s now knocked down,” continued Taunton.  The fire chief described it as a very intense fire, with over 400,000 gallons of water used to put out the fire.  The first floor of the building is a former dentist’s office, with an apartment in the upper half. People who live on the second floor were out of town Sunday night, but a cat died in the fire.  The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department, Lake Linden Village Police, and eight or nine agencies from surrounding areas also responded. The cause of the fire is under investigation.  “There’s no indications right now of a natural gas leak or anything like that until the fire marshal can take a look at it and kinda make a determination of it,” said Lake Linden Fire Chief Andrew Kotila.  The state fire marshal is expected to visit the scene this week.  The scene was first cleared by 5:30 a.m. Monday. The Lake Linden Volunteer Fire Department returned at 6:00 a.m. and left again by 8:30 a.m. Some smoke may still be visible, but the fire chief says it’s just leftover steam.

The Kirkman Street restaurant posted a note on social media about the fire, saying the restaurant is temporarily closed, but will “soon reopen with even more passion to come back together as a family again.”  The post shows ashes in the outdoor area of the restaurant.  “I wake up every day with a passion to serve you. This place is my first home. It’s our home,” owner Gus Garden said in the restaurant’s post. “This morning I woke up to a call from the Lake Charles Fire Department. ‘Don’t tell me this,’ I told them when they gave me the news. This is not the news I want to give you, but it is what’s happening now.”  Garden initially believed the fire to be an electrical issue, but according to Lake Charles Fire Prevention Bureau Captain Brandon Spooner, surveillance video shows otherwise.  “[The video shows] a person, probably about 120 pounds, five-foot-three or -four, entering the rear fence gate of the business, walking directly to the window, setting the liquid accelerant on the window and lighting it on the window sill,” Spooner said. “It ignited immediately. They turned around and walked off pretty calmly.”  “They did have their face covered, they knew where the cameras were, they knew how to get into the premises, they didn’t try to break in, they didn’t pull any doors. They didn’t try to do anything but set the place on fire,” he said.  The owner and investigators are now looking into previous employees who may fit the description of the person in the video.  Garden said the first call came in around 2 a.m. from his alarm system provider, telling him the building had lost connection with the panel and there was no power. Soon after, he got a call from the city that his restaurant was on fire.  “Firefighters were here, and they were already cleaning, making sure that everything was down,” Garden told us earlier today. “The fire kind of started on the roof and worked its way down, you know, affecting this side of the bar.”  Area 337 has been serving Latin cuisine to the community for just over two years, and Garden hopes to continue.  “I’ll keep my attitude positive,” Garden said. “I’m gonna relocate a couple of my employees. I got a bunch of support from different restaurant owners in town, and we take care of each other. That’s why Lake Charles is Lake Charles.”  The community is holding a benefit for Area 337 at Crying Eagle on Friday, June 16.  Copyright 2023 KPLC.

He said the fire probably started when wind hit the heat lamps and they blew over in the chicken coop and it caught fire. The fire jumped to the garage next, then on to the house.  The winds were reported to be in the 50 to 60 mile per hour range that night.  “My phone records show that I called 911 at 3:25,” Stephanie said. “Ryan saw the fire, he told me and I grabbed the phone on my way to get my elderly mom home out of the house.”  Stephanie’s mother had stayed the night and she was the closest to her so she got her up and the kids were sleeping on the couch. They got everyone out of the house, including most of their pets and moved their cars to a safe space.  “After moving the cars and getting the pets out of the house we had about 10 minutes before it jumped to the house,” Ryan said. “It was the saddest thing I’d ever seen.”  When the neighbors heard them screaming and saw the flames they came to help.  “We didn’t have time to get anything out of the house,” she said. “We did manage to get five of our six pets out of the house. We’re still missing a cat.”  They called the fire department, but they had to go around the flood zones. Smithfield Fire Department showed up first. When they got there the house had just started to burn. The fire was throughout the attic and the west side of the home was on fire. Four fire departments were on the scene but too late to save the house.  “There we were in our robes with no shoes on watching the fire take everything,” Stephanie said. “We had original pictures of family members that went back generations and school pictures of our kids all gone.”  The wood frame house was first built in 1949 and had at least two additions. The older wood accelerated the fire and it didn’t take long for the fire to engulf the home.  “I had both of my grandfather’s flags, genealogy, huge framed pictures of my great, great grandfathers, my husband’s grandmother’s pictures, family history and lot of other priceless stuff,” she said. “Everything we saved, is gone.”  After all the destruction and lost family history they are still grateful they all got out safe.  “We feel very lucky and blessed,” Ryan said. “We are grateful to the community, church, employers, neighbors and friends that they have stepped up to help us,” he said. “People have been coming out of the woodwork to help us. It is a very humbling experience.”  Next door neighbor Jim Seamons and his family jumped to help evacuate the Oswald family and helped get grandma out of the house and their cars out of the way. There were four different fire departments at the scene that came to help.  “I look back at that day and there are so many things that could have happened that could have been worse,” Ryan said. “We are lucky to have all of us here.”  The front of the house is still standing but inside behind the front door was badly burnt and the detached garage was reduced to rubble. A fire restoration company has fenced the area off.  “We had nothing. The neighbors gave us shoes for our feet and shirts for our back,” Ryan said. “We are indebted to those who helped us.”  The Oswalds plan to rebuild in the same location when all the ruble gets cleaned up. There is a GoFundMe account set up on social media to help the family.

"fire","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T13:57:20","Get In-Depth Insights and Exclusive Content Delivered Direct to You.  Over the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, fire departments across the United States responded to roughly 347,000 home structure fires per year. That data, courtesy of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), underscores the significance of home fire protection measures.  Smoke detectors are a key component of fire protection, but there’s much more homeowners can do to protect themselves, their families, their belongings and their homes from structure fires.  ROUTINE INSPECTIONS  Smoke detectors can only alert residents to a fire if they’re working properly. Battery-powered smoke detectors won’t work if the batteries die. Routine smoke detector check-ups can ensure the batteries still have juice and that the devices themselves are still functioning properly. Test alarms to make sure the devices are functioning and audible in nearby rooms. Install additional detectors as necessary so alarms and warnings can be heard in every room of the house.  HIRE AN ELECTRICIAN  Electricians can inspect a home and identify any issues that could make the home more vulnerable to fires. Ask electricians to look over every part of the house, including attics and crawl spaces. Oft-overlooked areas like attics and crawl spaces pose a potentially significant fire safety threat, as data from the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) indicates that 13% of electrical fires begin in such spaces.  AUDIT THE LAUNDRY ROOM  The laundry room is another potential source of home structure fires. NFPA data indicates around 3% of home structure fires begin in laundry rooms each year. Strategies to reduce the risk of laundry room fires include leaving room for laundry to tumble in washers and dryers; routinely cleaning lint screens to avoid the buildup of dust, fiber and lint, which the NFPA notes are often the first items to ignite in fires linked to dryers; and ensuring the outlets that washing machines and dryers are plugged into can handle the voltage such appliances require. It’s also a good idea to clean dryer exhaust vents and ducts every year.  LOOK OUTWARD  Though the majority of home fires begin inside, the NFPA reports that 4% of such fires begin outside the home. Homeowners can reduce the risk of such fires by ensuring all items that utilize fire, including grills and firepits, are always used at least 10 feet away from the home. Never operate a grill beneath eaves, and do not use grills on decks. Never leave children unattended around firepits, as all it takes is a single mistake and a moment for a fire to become unwieldy.  SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF  Hair dryers, hair straighteners, scented candles, clothes irons and holiday decorations are some additional home fire safety hazards. Never leave candles burning in empty rooms and make sure beauty and grooming items like dryers, straighteners and irons are unplugged and placed in a safe place to cool down when not in use.  Fire departments respond to hundreds of thousands of home fires each year. Some simple strategies and preventive measures can greatly reduce the risk that a fire will overtake your home.

The battery-powered truck, a nonsalable test vehicle, was in storage when the fire started, according to the company Monday.  “Emergency protocols were followed, and the Lordstown Fire Department was called to the scene,” according to a statement from Lordstown Motors. “No one was injured, and the company will investigate the cause of the fire.”  Firefighters were called just after 7:30 p.m. to the Hallock Young Road plant and left about two hours later, according to a report.  Messages were left Monday with Lordstown fire Chief Travis Eastham seeking more information were not returned.  In January 2021, a developmental version of the Endurance burst into flames on its first-ever road test in a suburb of Detroit. The fire destroyed the truck.  Foxconn acquired the massive factory last year for $230 million, allowing new Lordstown Motors’ leadership to further transition the company from manufacturing toward EV development and engineering. The company, however, has experienced troubles lately.  Lordstown Motors has issued three recalls of the truck, its flagship vehicle, since limited production began in November. The company also announced in February it stopped production temporarily due to supplier parts issues that led to the recalls. Production resumed in April.  Now, Lordstown Motors finds itself grappling with Foxconn over future funding in a $170 million equity investment agreement the companies signed in November and trying to find a way to pump up the company’s poor-performing stock price.  Without Foxconn closing on a common stock purchase worth about $47.2 million and other obstacles in Lordstown Motors’ way, the company has stated in regulatory filings it could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  The dispute with Foxconn started with an April 21 notice from the Taiwanese technology and electronics company it believed the EV maker was in breach of the investment agreement because of a delisting notice the company received from Nasdaq.  Lordstown Motors has stated in regulatory documents the discussions with Foxconn are at an impasse, however, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said recently the company remains “open to continued dialogue to find the best solution for each other.”  On Monday, Lordstown Motors stockholders at their annual meeting were expected to vote on a path to try to cure the sagging stock price through a reverse stock split. Doing so would consolidate the company’s existing shares into fewer shares with the intended result of a higher price.  Details were not available Monday but are expected today.  The company has 180 days to come back into compliance with Nasdaq’s rule. The stock closed trading at 30 cents per share Monday, up 9.2 percent from Friday.  rselak@tribtoday.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbmR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9sbWMtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzLWNhdXNlLW9mLXRydWNrLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WPRI) — A fire at a popular wedding venue and golf club in Lincoln has left some couples worried about their special day.  Kirkbrae Country Club has a full calendar this season which is why they said they hit the ground running after a fire damaged the venue early Monday morning.  Lindsey Goulet is the maid of honor in her best friend’s wedding — just over two weeks away — and the ceremony and reception are both booked at Kirkbrae.  “My jaw was on the floor,” Goulet said. “Like, oh my god, I can’t believe this is happening. It’s insane.”  Goulet said her friend is “completely distraught” by the news, and hopes the worst-case scenario is that the wedding will be held outside in a tent — but her friend wants what she paid for.  “She wants it here, she wants it inside. She wants everything she paid full price for,” she added.  Goulet stopped by the venue to get a look at the damage herself.  “The main areas looked fine, but the whole kitchen side was all burnt and I could smell smoke,” she said.  In a statement, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Golf Association said Kirkbrae is using all of its resources to ensure the facility is “safe and operational sooner than expected.”  However, it’s unclear what the expected timeline is and just how many events this is impacting.  Goulet said her friend did get a phone call from the venue soon after the fire on Monday, and they told her they hope to have some answers Tuesday.  Workers were inside the venue all day Monday trying to get things back to normal, and they’ll be back first thing Tuesday morning. The power is back on in some parts of the building, 12 News has learned.  Meanwhile, other local venues are offering help. Jerry Garcia, the general manager of Agawam Hunt in Rumford, told 12 News they’re “more than willing” to assist in accommodating displaced events, if feasible.  “The club market is relatively small and we all need to help each other where we can,” Garcia said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwcmkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ibGFja3N0b25lLXZhbGxleS93ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnRpZXMtaW4tbGltYm8tYWZ0ZXIta2lya2JyYWUtY291bnRyeS1jbHViLWZpcmUv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3ByaS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2JsYWNrc3RvbmUtdmFsbGV5L3dlZGRpbmctcGFydGllcy1pbi1saW1iby1hZnRlci1raXJrYnJhZS1jb3VudHJ5LWNsdWItZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I rushed to the canyon and saw the fire, with huge billowing smoke clouds, driven by fierce winds, racing downhill from the mountains to the Pacific.  The fire coming over the preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Within a few days, we realized the huge impact the fire had upon the preserve. For all the many visitors who had enjoyed the immense biodiversity of Arroyo Hondo over the years, the scorched earth left from the fire may have seemed like a hopeless tragedy. But for me, as a botanist, I knew this was the beginning of an exciting time watching how this beautiful canyon would recover.  Fires in Mediterranean climates such as ours are well-documented. We know that many native plants and animals are especially adapted to survive recurrent wildfires. What I could not know at the time was what a variety of intense weather conditions Arroyo Hondo would experience in the next few years. The following is the tale of how a resilient regional ecosystem responded to devastating fires and torrential rains.  The Lay of the Land  The mud flows at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  The preserve remained closed until May 2022; however, staff and a few dedicated volunteers continued to work. At first, I walked the trails, photographing the scene: smoking trees with deep cavities carved into their trunks, some burned down through to their roots. Others had open windows where fire had burned right through their trunks. Most trees had been scorched, some turned into curious sculptures, but what we didn’t know was which ones had actually been killed.  Hillside sycamores | Photo: Sally Isaacson  The scene, recently painted in autumn greens and golds, was now a monotonous expanse of blacks and browns. On the steepest slopes, clad with the oldest chaparral, the fire burned hottest. Only charred shrubs remained. Gray ash covered the bare, baked soil. When we tried to climb up a slope, the soil slid out beneath us.  The surface was so fragile that we wondered what would happen when it rained. But long before any rains, green fern fronds, blades of grass, and even mushrooms began pushing up through the blackened leaf litter.  The old adobe and the barn also survived intact. Cattle and sheep had recently grazed the front part of the canyon, and this, combined with fire crews who bulldozed the surrounding area, saved the buildings.  A smoking tree trunk at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  At first, all was eerily silent. What animals would survive such an inferno? But soon we saw signs of life: A big rattlesnake slithered over the blackened earth, and the canyon’s resident deer herd, looking thinner than a few weeks before, began to quietly return. We speculated that they had sheltered in the orchard where the paths between the trees were clear of brush.  Fresh tracks of foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and at least one mountain lion reassured us that other animals had survived, though we found a number of rodent skulls and the remains of a coyote. Almost all of the stick-pile nests of the big-eared woodrats had burned up, and we wondered how many of their residents had survived, though we saw some tree squirrels that had sheltered in the tallest sycamore.  Big hawks roosted in the trees watching for prey. And once we were surprised to see a blackened bush covered with bright, tiny, yellow things — a flock of goldfinches. What joy to see color returning to the canyon.  Showers and Flowers  The seedlings sprout at Arroyo Hondo Preserve | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Despite years of drought, the winter of 2022 brought renewed hope for a wet season. We had two significant storms. With those rains, and the lengthening days as spring approached, came an almost miraculous awakening of plants, many of which we worried had been killed. Bay trees that had appeared dead sprouted madly from their bases, and most of the oaks and sycamores soon had new leaves along their branches. Ferns, which had not waited for the rain, were now flourishing in their special spots.  With spring came special wildflowers: delicate red fire poppies, blue large-flowered phacelias, pale yellow whispering bells, cream-colored ear drops, and others that are rarely seen except after fires. Other plants produced more flowers than usual, probably due to nutrients from the ash as well as absence of shade from surrounding plants. We saw luxuriant giant stream orchids, unusually abundant golden stars, mariposa lilies, and a host of others.  Fire Poppy | Photo: Sally Isaacson  Along the stream, the pools were covered with ash, yet fish, at first, could still be seen. But that changed after the two rain storms of that winter (2021-2022).We often talk about devastation caused by wildfires, but it is really the combination of fires plus the floods that follow that cause the greatest changes to ecosystems.  Although those rains were unusually high along the coast, the burned mountains above received much more precipitation. Ashy mud soon covered a flat area below the slopes. Floodwater, carrying gravel, rocks, and branches, changed the creek habitat. Pools were obliterated, and the creek bed became wider and flatter.  Our rare turtles, frogs, and newts survived, but the entire population of rainbow trout and/or steelhead vanished from Arroyo Hondo Creek. This creek is known to be an important steelhead spawning stream, and we do not know how long it will take before the rare Southern California steelhead return.  The big floods of this winter (2022-2023) have further changed the course of the creek. Much fine sediment has been washed out, and the creek bed is now lined with big clean cobbles and boulders. New pools are forming, and these should provide good habitat for aquatic animals. The water is sparkling and clear, and it flows fast to the ocean. A big pool has formed at the estuary once more, and we hope for a pair of mature southern steelhead to enter this pool from the ocean, swim upstream through the man-made fish passage under Highway 101, spawn, and repopulate the stream.  The ever-changing Arroyo Hondo has given us all, visitors and scientists alike, an opportunity to witness the natural recovery of a resilient ecosystem after fire and flood — a uniquely Californian recovery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL2Etc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1jYW55b24tcmVjb3ZlcnMtZnJvbS1maXJlLWFuZC1yYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The low- to moderate-intensity fire is burning in grass and pine needles and has grown to approximately 193acres.  “We are applying a confine and contain strategy on this fire and allowing it to play its natural role in this fire-adapted ecosystem,” said Agency Administrator Elizabeth Toney. “We’re seeing really excellent fire effects, burning surface fuels in pine understory, consuming dead grass and dead and down logs.”  Fire weather conditions so far this season are much less volatile than this time last year, given the wet summer, fall, and winter of the past 11 months, as well as unseasonal rains that fell over the area last week. Recent and ongoing fuels sampling shows that trees and shrubs are holding enough moisture that they are not yet available for burning.

"fire","2023-09-04","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:40:39","Over the Labor Day holiday in 2020, with east winds picking up toward the end of a long, hot and dry summer, Leland Ohrt was dispatched to a home not far from his own, where a tree branch had fallen on a powerline and started a small brush fire. Ohrt was Mill City Fire Chief, a VFD chief in a small town in western Oregon’s Cascades; he hosed down the fire, then drove over to Schroeder Road, where another tree branch had fallen over another powerline and was still arcing sparks into the dry fuels below. Ohrt couldn’t stop the sparking, so he hosed the utility lines with water until they exploded and de-energized themselves.  Those two incidents initiated a frenzied 48 hours for Ohrt, acccording to an OPB report today, and he was later recognized for his efforts to save Mill City as the fires destroyed thousands of homes down the Santiam Canyon and across other parts of western Oregon.  Chief Ohrt saw Pacific Power’s utility lines start those fires, but he took the stand last week to defend the utility company in a class action trial against Pacific Power. He told a jury in Multnomah County Circuit Court that he immediately blew off attorneys who’d sent him paperwork in the weeks following the fires — lawyers who were trying to contact fire victims.  “I threw all that paperwork away,” Ohrt said. “You could tell right off the bat they were going to go after Pacific Power for this.”  Ohrt’s testimony highlighted a key aspect of the defense Pacific Power’s corporate owners, PacifiCorp, expect to lay out in the coming weeks of the trial: Most of the wildfires in the Santiam Canyon started not from their powerlines, but from embers of the Beachie Creek Fire. Even in places where powerlines did start fires, PacifiCorp’s attorneys contend that people fighting those fires quickly got them under control.  The defense follows what has been several weeks of plaintiffs’ attorneys alleging that PacifiCorp acted negligently by keeping its lines energized during the Labor Day fires, even though they had plenty of warning from weather officials and state government about fire danger. The decision to keep the power on contributed to fires spreading out of control, according to the plaintiffs and their attorneys.  Ohrt though, under questioning from PaficiCorp’s lawyers, pointed to another culprit: the U.S. Forest Service. Ohrt has more than 45 years’ experience with Mill City’s volunteer fire department, but he does not have any experience fighting wildfires.  Weeks before the Santiam Canyon fires, a lightning strike started the Beachie Creek Fire — northeast of Gates in the Opal Creek Wilderness. Forest Service officials said then that steep terrain made it difficult to get crews to the site to contain the slowly growing fire. According to Ohrt, though, letting the Beachie Creek Fire smolder allowed it to throw embers into the Santiam Canyon when winds picked up on Labor Day.  An excellent “storymap” about the Beachie Creek Fire is [HERE].  “The U.S. Forest Service was supposed to be fighting that fire,” Ohrt said in his testimony.  Late in 2020 Linn County had to sue the Forest Service to get fire documents.  The Type 3 IC at the time knew that air support was critical, according to a USFS review of the fire, but he also recognized that the fire was burning in an old growth stand, meaning there was a multistory canopy with abundant down logs, duff, moss, and fuels. He knew that getting firefighters on the ground to dig deep for hotspots was the only way to successfully contain the fire.  “Everyone assumes that if you hammer a fire with aerial resources, it will go out, but that’s not the case. There needs to be boots on the ground working in tandem with aircraft. There are hidden hotspots, sheltered from aerial attack, under big logs and deep roots that have to be dug out.”  ~ unnamed Type 3 Incident Commander  Whether jurors in the case find PacifiCorp responsible for the wildfires in the Santiam Canyon will likely be influenced by which attorneys’ experts they find more believable. Oregon State University professor John Bailey, for example, testified that there was no way the Beachie Creek Fire could have thrown embers far enough before midnight on Labor Day 2020 to start fires near the town of Gates. Bailey, who teaches fire management and has been studying forestry since the 1980s, said he used topography data, recorded weather conditions, and fuels analysis to estimate where the Beachie Creek Fire could have thrown embers ahead of its front to start new fires. He said strong east winds that night would have — at most — lit spot fires north of Gates and other residential areas in the canyon.  PacifiCorp’s attorneys, on the other hand, had atmospheric sciences professor Neil Lareau of the University of Nevada testify, and he said the extreme weather conditions that night did indeed throw firebrands miles ahead of the Beachie Creek Fire. Lareau explained to jurors how he used satellite data from the fire to determine when plumes of debris burst from the fire and cast embers thousands of feet aloft. He said those plumes matched up with on-the-ground reports of spot fires in the Santiam Canyon. Bailey, by contrast, said embers thrown by fires can rarely travel more than a mile — a far shorter distance than needed to start the fires Lareau claimed originated from the Beachie Creek Fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd2lsZGZpcmV0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9wYWNpZmljLXBvd2VyLWxhd3N1aXQtbWF5LWNvbWUtZG93bi10by1maXJlLWJlaGF2aW9yLWV4cGVydHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","{""Bakersfield"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:00:00","BAKERSFIELD, Calif. – The Bureau of Land Management will issue seasonal fire restrictions for public lands managed by the Bakersfield Field Office effective Thursday, May 25, due to dry conditions and high wildland fire danger. These seasonal restrictions are in addition to the year-round statewide fire prevention order, issued on April 28, 2020. This seasonal fire order will remain in effect until further notice.  The BLM-managed public lands affected by these fire restrictions are in eastern Fresno, western Kern, Kings, Madera, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare and Ventura counties, as well as the Carrizo Plain National Monument, Keysville Special Recreation Management Area, Lake Isabella and San Joaquin River Gorge.  “Due to dry conditions, significant dead and dying grasses and high fire danger, it has become necessary to implement additional fire restrictions,” advises Bakersfield Field Manager Gabriel Garcia. “We ask for your cooperation to help minimize fire potential. These proactive measures are put in place to protect public land visitors, communities, adjacent private lands and natural resources from the risk of wildfire.”  The additional restrictions include no campfires, barbecues, or open fires, in or outside of developed campgrounds. Portable stoves with gas, jelled petroleum, or pressurized liquid fuel are allowed with a valid California campfire permit available free at all BLM, U.S. Forest Service and Cal Fire offices, or at www.readyforwildfire.org/prevent-wildfire/campfire-safety/.  On average, human-caused wildfires make up 95 percent of all wildfires in California. Many of these wildfires occur close in proximity to roadways, communities and recreational areas, posing considerable threat to public safety. Taking individual responsibility to reduce wildfire risk, while recreating on public lands, around homes and communities, before a fire occurs can help keep property, the public and firefighters safe.  The following restrictions will remain in place until fire dangers subside:  No Campfires briquette/charcoal barbeques are allowed . Stoves/grills are allowed only with a valid California Campfire Permit.  . Stoves/grills are allowed only with a valid California Campfire Permit. No Smoking, except within an enclosed vehicle or building, a developed recreation site, or in an area at least three feet in diameter barren of all flammable materials.  No welding or operating acetylene or other torch with open flame.  No motorized vehicles or tools powered by internal combustion engines off designated roads or trails.  No use of any steel-jacketed, steel core or incendiary ammunition of any caliber, except with a state of California hunting license and in accordance with California hunting regulations.  As always, possessing, discharging or using fireworks or pyrotechnic devices are prohibited across Bureau of Land Management lands. Additionally, a valid California Campfire Permit is required to operate a stove or fire on these public lands.  HELP PREVENT FIRES  Residents and visitors are reminded to help prevent human-caused fires:  Make sure all campfires are dead out! Drown it and stir around the fire area with a shovel to wet any remaining embers and ash. If it’s not cool, it is not out.  Be sure to maintain proper tire pressure for all vehicles, ensure adequate tire tread, and check brakes for overheating. Do not drive or park on brush or grass. Do not drag chains while towing.  Motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles and chainsaws require an approved spark arrestor.  Remember the use of steel-core ammunition, although legal while hunting, can greatly increase the chance of a wildfire if ricocheted off objects such as rocks.  Anyone found guilty of violating a fire prevention order may be fined not more than $100,000 and/or face imprisonment for not more than 12 months. Restitution for total fire suppression and damage costs incurred may be borne by the trespasser.  To learn how to prevent wildland fires, visit online at www.readyforwildfire.org.

In 2022, fire agencies also reported 6,536 natural vegetation fires which resulted in more than $3.2 million in loss. These fires can grow into large wildfires.  More than 1,500 wildfires were reported in Washington State, burning over 173,000 acres according to the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center (NICC).  Last year the SFMO responded to 14 mobilization incidents in which the largest was the Vantage Highway Fire that burned 26,490 acres, and mobilization costs were estimated to be in the excess of $8 million for 2022.  Residents are urged to plan and practice wildfire safety by preparing your property now to reduce the chance of embers and flames igniting material on or near your home.  Homeowners can take the following actions to create a defensible space and protect their home:  Clear fallen leaves, pine needles, branches, and other debris from roof valleys and gutters. Remember to use extra caution when working on ladders whenever accessing your roof or gutters.  Remove any flammable materials on the ground around your home, deck, porch, or patio out to a minimum of 5 feet. This includes any mulch, dead leaves or pine needles, shrubs or other plants and materials for construction projects. Wood piles should be kept at a minimum of 30 feet from your home or other structures.  Make sure trees are limbed at least 10 feet up to reduce the likelihood of a fire getting into the tops of trees.  Plants that are within 30 feet of your home should be well-watered and spaced to avoid fire moving from plant to plant.  Grass and weeds should be mowed to a height no more than 2 to 3 inches.  Keep all vegetation, including grass hydrated.  Whenever possible, use fire-resistant materials for any home improvement projects.  Attic and garage vents should be screened with 1/8-inch metal mesh material, or a fire resistive vent design should be used, to prevent ember penetration during the windy conditions of a wildfire.  Prepare your community by working with your neighbors. Remember, ignition of one home within a neighborhood will threaten other homes so encourage all neighbors within wildfire risk areas to work together to reduce the community risk.  Create a Wildfire Action Plan to prepare your family for evacuation at a moment’s notice.  An evacuation plan should include alternate routes out of the area and prepacked essentials including medications, family records, credit cards, a change of clothing, and enough food and water for each household member for up to 72 hours.  Create a family communication plan that designates an out-of-area friend or relative as a point of contact to be a single source of communication among family members in case of separation.  Be aware of family, friends, or neighbors who have disabilities who require assistance and additional lead-time in order to prepare for a disaster.  Remember to prepare a plan for pets and other animals.  If there is a wildfire alert system available in your area, consider signing up to receive notifications.  When told to evacuate, go promptly and safely. If you feel unsafe at any time during a wildfire, do not wait for an evacuation order – leave immediately. Do not return home until directed by emergency personnel.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (CN) — After years of massive, destructive wildfires, California and much of the American West may see a shorter and more manageable wildfire season thanks to an extraordinarily wet winter.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the state has only just begun to see a historic snowpack melt into streams and rivers, and the flows could be high for many weeks. The agency's Southern California coordination center reported in a briefing Monday that most of California has seen below normal temperatures since Oct. 1. These conditions have helped about 68% of the state exit drought conditions within three months — a feat that would have required two or three wet years otherwise.  A map of California precipitation levels since October 2022. (The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)  Julie Kalansky, climate scientist and program manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said that Northern California and central Sierra reservoirs have mostly reached or exceeded average water capacity levels. Southern Sierra reservoirs remain much below normal levels but are expected to approach historically high levels once all of the snow melts.  The wet winter and lingering snowpack may also translate to fewer wildfires. The Southern California coordination center reported that California typically experiences about 62 significant fires over more than 308,000 acres each year. But experts anticipate fewer than 100,000 acres will burn this year — a rare event.  Gina McGuire Palma of the agency's Great Basin coordination center said that coming out of extended drought years, soil moisture does improve as snow melts, subsequently priming grass growth. Once grasses begin to “cure” or dry out, expected to begin by sometime in July, is when the active season is really expected to kick off.  “We’re expecting quite a bit of fine fuel growth,” Palma said. “That will kind of delay our start to our real active fire season. We're definitely looking at a shorter (fire) season at least.”  Once monsoon season arrives during July, thunder and lightning activity could spark fires. This will coincide with normal fire risk for lower elevation areas, as grasses dry out. However, few mountain fires are expected thanks to the impressive, ongoing snowpack.  The state has invested $2.7 billion into reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires by managing forests and bolstering manpower. Governor Gavin Newsom said this month that California added 37 additional fire crews statewide in 2022, alongside more helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. California is the first state in the nation to fly night firefighting operations, completing the first-ever operation last year.  In August 2020, Newsom signed the Shared Stewardship Agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, mapping out a 20-year strategy to achieve wildfire resilience and forest health. This commitment included a goal of jointly improving 1 million acres of California’s forest and wildlands annually by 2025.  Cal Fire treated approximately 110,925 acres across more than 600 projects last year in preparation for the fire season, surpassing the state goal to treat 100,000 acres by 2025. During the current season, more than 420 fuels reduction projects have been completed, treating about 43,065 acres.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWZpcmUtc2Vhc29uLXByZWRpY3RlZC10by1iZS1zaG9ydGVyLWFuZC1sZXNzLWludGVuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As those at the center of the extraordinary story told it to CBS News, Joe Hollins and his wife have been experiencing homelessness and happened to be camped out near an apartment which caught fire early on Thursday in Phoenix. Hollins became aware of the emergency when he heard screams coming from the apartment.  “All I see is a lady pull open the window, and she’s screaming, ‘Please help me, please help me,’” he recalled in an interview which CBS aired over the weekend.  Hollins immediately ran up to the window of the woman, Claudia Jimenez. According to Jimenez, the blaze was blocking the front way out of her apartment, and she was trapped inside with her two daughters and two dogs as flames and smoke spread throughout the place.  So Hollins told Jimenez to drop her children to him, according to what Jimenez said to CBS.  “He was like, ‘Yes, throw your daughters out. I’m going to catch them, I’m going to get them’,” Jimenez recounted to the network.  Jimenez first dropped her one-year-old, Valerie. She then did the same with her eight-year-old, Natalie, and the family’s two dogs. One by one, Hollins safely caught them.  Then, when it was time for her to leap out the window and away from danger, fear gripped Jimenez and she froze in place, she and Hollins recalled.  “She was scared she was going to fall,” Hollins told CBS. “I was like, ‘I got you, don’t worry’.”  Trusting Hollins with herself as she had done with her girls and her pets, Jimenez soon jumped and landed safely in his arms.  Local firefighters later arrived to extinguish the flames consuming the apartment. Jimenez and others in the apartment building lost virtually all of their possessions in the fire, the cause of which remains under investigation.  Nonetheless, community members have been trying to raise money and collect donations for Jimenez, her loved ones and other victims of the fire.  Jimenez, meanwhile, was just grateful that she and her family were able to walk away from the fire physically unharmed.

But for multi-family complexes, such as apartments and condos, it's an even bigger undertaking.  To prepare local landlords and property owners, Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue hosted its annual Landlord Training Program on fire safety. This year, the agency partnered with Hillsboro and Clackamas Fire, teaching landlords and property owners what they need to know about fire safety. This training is one way to help streamline communication between the Red Cross, fire agencies and landlords.  “We’re more than 20 years strong on this program,"" said Piseth Pich, the public information officer for Hillsboro Fire and Rescue. ""It originated in TVF&R and we’re so happy to be partners with them and Clackamas Fire. We've looked to try to rotate this opportunity to make it more accessible. This program has evolved as we think about topics and make sure we’re covering essential items.""  The training covered everything from fire inspections to fire behavior, ordinances, legislation and safety recommendations.  Linda Lavelle is a property owner in the area and said she's attended these sessions for several years. She says she knows firsthand how much damage a fire can do.  We had a fire in one of our complexes. The manager knew how to respond, which was to break the fire extinguisher box. He got into the apartment, but the people were standing around a fire. They were frozen, they didn't know what to do. He got them out of the house. If he had not had that training, we could have had three people perish in the fire,"" she said.  The Red Cross also attended the training to provide information on recovery efforts. Allison Mora, a disaster program manager for the Cascades Region, was one of the responders to . Collaboration with property owners is crucial, she said.  ""We want to make sure the landlords are looped in. Especially in a multi-family fire, it’s usually affecting more than one resident or home. We want to get the correct information in terms of residency. We need contact information to verify who is who and who else might be affected, such as if someone's of town,"" Mora said.  Even though some parts of the course have changed over the years to keep up with the times, the training has remained true to what the departments see out in the field.

"fire","2023-05-20","18:00:00","{""LePallet"", ""PaysDeLaLoire"", ""France""}","2023-05-21T22:16:26","The Good Moves  Generally speaking, Fire Spin is the gold-standard for Fire Type Fast Moves. It’s the move of choice for many of the top Fire Type attackers, and it definitely deserves the title given its solid stats. However, it's not the top Fire Type Fast Move, as Fire Fang tends to out-pace Fire Spin most of the time. Despite having a lower base power and lower energy generated per use, Fire Fang’s speed allows it to have a higher DPS and an energy generation that’s just slightly below Fire Spin, so Pokemon with access to both will tend to stick with Fire Fang. Moving on, we come to a doozy of an attack; Incinerate. This Fast Move has the highest base power of any Fast Move in the game, to the point where it’s actually stronger than a few Charged Moves. It’s also got very high energy generation per use, ranked 2nd in the game alongside Gust, Ice Fang, Present, and Splash, and surpassed only by Volt Switch. So how could this monster of a move possibly fall below Fire Spin and Fire Fang? It can because it holds one other record currently; the slowest Fast Move in the game. Executing a single Incinerate takes 2.3 seconds, which is more than double the execution time of Fire Spin, so it actually tends to fall behind a bit in terms of actual performance. Oh, and forget dodging when you’re locked into a Fast Move that lasts an eternity to fully execute. Incinerate is best utilized by bulky attackers like Ho-oh that can tank hits and keep firing back, and even then it’s best classified as “usable” as it is substantially weaker than the big-two, but it’s still enough to make some Fire Type attackers acceptable. Honestly, it BARELY gets a pass here, and primarily because it’s one of the moves that finally made Ho-oh decent.  For Charged Moves, we have to start with V-Create, the signature move of Victini and the strongest Fire Type Charged Move in the entire game to date. This attack mixes power and flexibility, making it the move that any Fire Type would want, but its extremely limited distribution means we probably won't see it take the top ranks any time soon, or rather at all. Next up is Fusion Flare, which is the move that really put Reshiram back on the map. Again, this is a move with pretty limited distribution, so it's unlikely to spread far beyond what we have now, but it's still objectively great. Following that is Blast Burn, the signature move of all Fire Type starters. It's another genuinely powerful move and is strong enough to make many starters viable despite lower stats. After Blast Burn is Sacred Fire+, which is a great move for anyone lucky enough to have a good Apex Shadow Ho-oh. Next up is Weather Ball Fire, which is a strong and versatile move.... that basically no Fire Types actually learn. And then we come to Overheat, which is the gold-standard of the type. It's the strongest Fire Type Charged Move with general distribution, making it the move of choice for a great many Pokemon. After that are Blaze Kick and Mystical Fire, which are great moves... but they have to directly compete with Blast Burn on the only two Pokemon that can currently learn them, so they're not going to see much utility in practice. We follow that up with the other move that finally brought Ho-oh out of the abyss, the basic version of Sacred Fire. Despite being weaker than the + variant, it's still a solid move that.. is actually pretty close to Flamethrower in practice. And speaking of, we finish up this side of the list with Flamethrower, which is the borderline move of the type. Flamethrower is the Fire Type equivalent to moves like Thunderbolt and Ice Beam, and is just good enough to keep Pokemon like Heatran from falling into total obscurity. It's not a good move, but it's serviceable.  The Bad Moves  When it comes to the bad Fast Moves, we come at last to Ember. And… It's pretty unremarkable. Its overall attack profile is pretty unappealing, and it just doesn’t have many saving graces. Honestly, an argument can be made that it’s better than Incinerate due to the fact that it only has a slightly lower DPS, but at least it’s possible to dodge with it. But Ember didn’t help to save Ho-oh from obscurity, now did it? And just when you thought that we'd hit the bottom of the barrel, Hidden Power (Fire) is here again. And as usual, it's really underwhelming. You roll the dice for this move, and if you happen to get it on a Pokemon that may actually want it, it generally won't be enough to push said Pokemon into viability.  The Charged move list starts with Fire Blast. Despite being iconic in the main series, this move got a bad treatment in Pokemon Go, and is one of the moves that Pokemon genuinely don't want to see in their moveset. From here, we have Fire Punch, Flame Burst, Heat Wave, Flame Wheel, and Flame Charge, all of which are disappointing moves for any Fire Type. ""But wait!"", I see some of the more eagle-eyed readers already getting ready to type. ""You've missed a couple of Charged Moves on the list!"". Well, these moves weren't missed so much as reserved a special place in this section just for them! First is Techno Blast (Burn), which is a great move that gets relegated down here due to the lack of Pokemon that ever have a chance of utilizing it. And second is Sacred Fire++, strictly because no Ho-oh should ever, ever have this move! Seriously; do not purify your Apex Shadows! In no way is having ""++"" on the move able to compete with the sheer power Shadow Boost combined with a single ""+""!.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXByZXNzLmdnL3Bva2Vtb25nby90eXBpbmctcmV2aWV3LW92ZXJ2aWV3LWZpcmUtdHlwZXMtcmFpZHMtcG9rZW1vbi1nb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The command says that Russians fired a total of 16 missiles of various types and 20 Shahed-136/131 attack drones:  4 Kh-101/X-555 air-launched cruise missiles from Tu-95MS strategic bombers from the Caspian Sea area;  5 Kh-22 cruise missiles from Tu-22M3 long-range bombers from different directions – the Sea of Azov and Kursk Oblast;  2 Iskander-M ballistic missiles from the temporarily occupied Crimea;  5 S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles from the temporarily occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia Oblast;  20 Shahed attack drones from the southern and northern directions.  “During the night attack on 22 May, Ukrainian air defense forces destroyed four X-101/X-555 cruise missiles and 20 Shahed attack drones,” the Air Force wrote.  Also, the Command confirmed that late on 21 May, a Russian Sukhoy Su-35 fighter jet crashed in the territorial waters of Ukraine in Kherson Oblast, but didn’t immediately attribute the crash to the actions of the Ukrainian aircraft or air defenses:  “The circumstances that caused this are being clarified,” the command says.

According to Lysak, Russian strikes injured a man, 27, in Dnipro City, and at least seven other people in the oblast, including two women aged 52 and 70 who were hospitalized.  The Russian missiles damaged several buildings in the rescue unit (firefighting facility) destroying more than 10 special vehicles and damaging “the same number” of those.  “At night, the enemy insidiously fired at the rescue unit. Three buildings were destroyed, more than 20 pieces of equipment were destroyed. One rescuer was injured,” the Emergency Service’s update reads.  “25 private cars and two buses were also damaged.

A few months ago, Hempfield Township Volunteer Fire Department training officer John Kirchner was headed to a brush fire when a driver crossed the center line on a narrow road, coming at Kirchner head-on.  “I literally had a second to make a decision,” Kirchner said.  And that decision saved a driver’s life.  “Even if we were both doing 35, that’s a closing speed of 70 miles an hour,” Kirchner said. “Somebody would have been seriously hurt, or possibly killed or both of us.”  Courtesy: Hempfield fire department  Courtesy: Hempfield Twp. fire department  Instead, he swung into a ditch, saving their lives — but creating $95,000 in damage to their only engine, which they don’t expect to get back for months.  Even with insurance — the cost wasn’t easy for a volunteer department without a fire tax.  “With a small volunteer department like this that we rely on, majority of our funding is through donations. It is getting very, very hard to keep doing business, keeping trucks on the road,” Kirchner said.  “We know how much we get from our fund drives, our membership drives, stuff like that, our fundraising, and we set our budget,” Chief Dave King said. “This was not in the budget. Trust me.”  The Hempfield department was able to buy an engine from Slippery Rock for about $25,000. It was still without an engine for about a month, putting strain on the department, which serves around 4,000 people in mostly rural areas with little access to hydrants.  “You hope you can make the initial hit and get it knocked down while you’re waiting on other resources to get there,” King said. “We’re shy a thousand gallons of water. We’re shy our attack lines.”  During that time, King said the accident has also put strain on the many departments in northern Mercer County they serve mutual aid for.  Both firefighters said they’re just glad no one was hurt in the incident, but they have a message for drivers: Pay attention on the road.  “We may be going to your family member if your loved one needs help,” King said. “Give us a little bit of room.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtc3RpbGwtcmVjb3ZlcmluZy1hZnRlci1jcmFzaC10YWtlcy1vdXQtb25seS1lbmdpbmUv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2tibi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2ZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1zdGlsbC1yZWNvdmVyaW5nLWFmdGVyLWNyYXNoLXRha2VzLW91dC1vbmx5LWVuZ2luZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Page by page, the Conway Fire Department turned up the heat.  “The best-looking guy goes on the cover,” Conway firefighter, Justin Adlong said.  Their funding efforts are becoming a challenge after struggling with other methods like Fill the Boot, which is a way for the fire department to give back to the Faulkner and Perry County communities.  “Everything’s cashless nowadays and so we will stand outside at like the Conway Commons or target all that area and you will see us holding a boot just asking for money and every year that number is going down,” Conway firefighter, Blake Brents said.  The Conway Fire Department uses the money from the fundraiser to support around 650 kids in both counties with toys, clothes, and food for Christmas.  This year, as a way to help increase funds they decided to create a calendar, the last one was made about 20 years ago.  “At first everybody was like, I don’t know if I want to be in it, so we had a couple of guys back out but if we keep this going I think people will realize it’s a good thing,” Brents stated.  Firemen Blake Brents and Justin Adlong talked about the community response and how it has been well received through town.  “It’s been a big hit so far,” Brents stated. “I think we have raised 7-8 thousand dollars so that’s a big help,” Adlong said.  As the flames grow higher, and the room gets hotter, they hope this calendar will be something that will help elevate some of the financial stress around the holidays.  “If we start now, we will be able to fund this year’s Christmas without having to rely on that money out there collecting the boot as much,” Brents said.  All proceeds go towards Fill the Boot, and they will still be doing that on top of calendar sales.  If you would like to purchase one of the $25 calendars you can visit this link or you can go to the Central Fire Station in Conway to pick one up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jb253YXktZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhlYXRpbmctdXAtdGhlLXdheS10aGV5LWZ1bmRyYWlzZS1mb3ItdGhlLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ib290LWRyaXZlL9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9jb253YXktZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWhlYXRpbmctdXAtdGhlLXdheS10aGV5LWZ1bmRyYWlzZS1mb3ItdGhlLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ib290LWRyaXZlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire started around 3 p.m. outside an apartment in the building on Sheffield Avenue.  Residents ran outside in shock but said what shocked them even more was when they watched back the footage from their Blink camera.  ""Like, I really wouldn't wish this on anybody, not even my worst enemy and I don't even have any,"" said resident Katiana Ciceron after her Blink camera captured the incident.  In the video, a man is seen walking up to her family's apartment door, dousing it with liquid and setting it on fire.  ""It was shocking because I've never seen somebody with that kind of intention,"" Ciceron said. She was not home at the time, but her mother was.

Jeff DeBuck who lives nearby told us his family saw the beginning of the smoke, ""I just got on the golf cart, I grabbed my daughter and said ‘Let’s go!' It’s the biggest fire I’ve ever seen. I literally was standing on that porch and it was hot, it was like the sun.""  Cars lined Weeks and Pound Road as people drove in to see what was the cause of the towering smoke that could be seen from over 25 miles away.  ""You could see the trees all burnt, it was blazing,"" said DeBuck.  Mallory Quinn who drove in to see the fire said, ""This was, I’ve never really seen this before, it was just pouring out.""  Social media became flooded with all these videos and pictures of the fire.  The owners of Theut's Flower Barn did confirm to us off camera the most important news that no one was hurt.  ""We’re all very interested in what happened, and then you see people who live here and it's like, 'Wow, this must really affect them and their livelihood.'""  At this point the fire departments who responded to the fire could not tell us what caused the flames.  DeBuck said, ""At one point the fire was coming this way, and the wind was picking up. If that wind would have picked up, this would have been gone.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd4eXouY29tL25ld3MvdG93ZXJpbmctc21va2UtZnJvbS1mbG93ZXItYmFybi1maXJlLWluLXJpY2htb25kLWNvdWxkLWJlLXNlZW4tZm9yLW1pbGVzLXN1bmRhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WMTV) - The Madison Fire Department is reminding residents how to properly discard cigarettes after two smoking-related fires last Thursday.  Madison Fire officials responded to two separate fires Thursday, both of which were caused by improper disposal of cigarettes.  Shortly after 3:30 p.m., firefighters were dispatched to 4322 Melody Lane after a report of a smoke-filled home and a burning ashtray. According to MFD, the tenant was smoking on her balcony before she discarded the cigarette in a plastic container she used as an ashtray.  The tenant left for nearly two hours, and upon her return, noticed charring on the outside of the building. She put out the fire before crews arrived but was temporarily displaced from her home due to the damage.  At around 11 p.m., firefighters were dispatched to 9321 Glencoe Drive for an apartment deck fire. Officials determined the fire started in a plastic planter full of old cigarette butts. The fire did not spread past the planter box, according to the fire department.  MFD is emphasizing how smoking-related fires can spread quickly if cigarettes ignite building siding and other flammable materials, especially if there are no automatic fire sprinklers in the area. Fire officials are encouraging residents to keep the following tips in mind:  Dispose of cigarettes in a non-flammable container, such as an ashtray or metal coffee canister.  Put cigarettes out completely by pouring water on the ashes and butts.  Empty ashtrays frequently to avoid butts piling up and catching on fire.

Example video title will go here for this video  PORTLAND, Ore. — Many people are still without a home after a fire destroyed the May Apartments on Southwest 14th and Taylor Street Tuesday morning. Fire crews are now using new technology to try and figure out the cause — by using a drone.  Jeff Pricher, the Scappoose Fire Cheif, says more agencies are working to get their Federal Aviation Administration commercial drone license and he’s helping them along the way with a two-week program.  ""We are taking our students from an entry-level and teaching them to be professional pilots,"" said Pricher.  Pricher is leading a two-week aviation course at Powell Butte Nature Park. Teaching state government and land management agencies alongside law enforcement and fire officials how to fly drones and obtain their FAA commercial drone license and more.  ""[It] teaches them aeronautical decision-making, crew resource management, and safety management systems which are the pillars of a successful aviation program,"" said Pricher.  Scappoose Fire has been flying drones since 2015. Since then, it has created its aviation program — a first of its kind in Columbia County.  After the two-week program, some students will go through additional training to obtain an additional certification that will allow them to fly up to 1,200 feet across the entire state of Oregon compared to the 400 feet FAA limit.  ""Our goal is to build a trust climate with the crew aviation community as well as the public so they don't think we're out here playing with toys,"" said Pricher.  This past week, Pricher assisted Portland Fire with a drone to map out a 2D and 3D picture of the scene to help investigators pinpoint where the May Apartments fire started.  ""And then, we're going to do some very specific photos to help enhance one of the areas of interest that the fire investigators have,” said Pricher.  Scappoose Fire nor Portland Fire were able to share the 3D picture obtained of the May Apartments on Friday due to the ongoing investigation.  Scappoose Fire used the same drone tech at the Portland Korean Church fire back in February — but it doesn't stop at commercial buildings. This new technology will soon help wildfire crews map out the perimeter of the fire and help direct water resources. They also expect to help investigators with major car crashes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtndy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNoL3NjYXBwb29zZS1maXJlLWhvbGRzLWZhYS1kcm9uZS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uLW5ldy10ZWNoLzI4My0xMjI4OTk4My02OTM2LTQ3MTctOTQzZS04NTRiMTg4OTU0Y2TSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2d3LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNoL3NjYXBwb29zZS1maXJlLWhvbGRzLWZhYS1kcm9uZS1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uLW5ldy10ZWNoLzI4My0xMjI4OTk4My02OTM2LTQ3MTctOTQzZS04NTRiMTg4OTU0Y2Q?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

During an investigation the following day, the body of a person was found in the rubble around 2:15 p.m. Thursday.  It is still unclear how or where the lone victim died. Their identity is awaiting confirmation from the state medical examiner, officials said.  Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien said building owner Kamlesh Patel has been cooperating with the investigation. The building, valued at almost $1.7 million, is a total loss, O’Brien said.

A person answering a phone at a business listing for Patel said the owner was unavailable and declined to comment further.  Kittery issued violation notices for code problems at the hotel several years ago, O’Brien said. He said every issue that was found was corrected.  The hotel did have fire alarms but did not have any sprinklers. The cause and origin of the fire remain under investigation.  Kittery Fire Chief David O'Brien, who had said he was extremely hesitant to send his firefighters into the building, sat down with NBC affiliate News Center Maine on Friday to talk about how challenging it was for crews.  ""They did everything they possibly could; everything. Bar none, they did everything,"" O'Brien told News Center Maine. ""And we sent two people into a building we shouldn’t have, but we got them out instantly. They knew the decision-making process.""  One of those firefighters was Phil Posa, who recalled feeling the intense heat as they entered a corridor in the building and having to make a difficult choice to pull out.  ""You could tell that nobody was gonna be able to have survived in that area,"" Posa told News Center Maine. ""The conditions were just very poor.""  O'Brien estimates that nearly 2,000,000 gallons of water were dumped onto the two-story hotel, News Center Maine reported. He said he hopes Wednesday's fire will be the largest that his young firefighters ever have to face.  The chief also noted that it was the first fatal fire that some of his crews were dealing with, noting there would be help for them.  Firefighters from about 16 area communities in Maine and New Hampshire were called in Wednesday to help extinguish the fire.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lY24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1jb250aW51ZXMtYWZ0ZXItbWFzc2l2ZS1maXJlLWRlc3Ryb3lzLWhvdGVsLWluLWtpdHRlcnktbWFpbmUvMjk4MzgxNy_SAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZWNuLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb24tY29udGludWVzLWFmdGVyLW1hc3NpdmUtZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95cy1ob3RlbC1pbi1raXR0ZXJ5LW1haW5lLzI5ODM4MTcvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

News4's Mauricio Casillas reports.  No one inside the buildings was hurt, but a firefighter did suffer injuries that were not life-threatening.  “I feel very bad, you know, because it was hard for me to buy this property and now when I see the way it is right now inside, I don’t want to go inside,” said Jose Diaz, who owns the building.  Karen Serpas, a worker inside the Mariachi Restaurant and Bar, recorded video of the flames.  “It was full of smoke, and we all ran out,” she said.  Raul Lopez, who owns the restaurant, said he has about 15 employees who are now temporarily out of work.  Ambzam Misgina, a business owner who is about to open a restaurant a few doors down, said he was shocked when he heard the news but was thankful it wasn’t worse.  “Wow, I was so nervous. I thought the entire building was on fire, but thank God it’s saved and the fire department is close by, so it was good luck for us,” Misgina said.  Investigators said the fire started after someone was grilling behind the church, which neighbors said has been vacant for years. It’s not believed to have been intentionally set.  Karen Abbott, who lives next to where the fire started, said she’s noticed people starting fires behind the vacant church a few times and has had to call the fire department before. She said she was scared something like this would happen.  “It could’ve been my house. That’s what I think,” she said. “It could’ve been my house. It could’ve jumped over here on my fence, onto my storage. It could’ve been us. It could’ve been the whole neighborhood.”  There is no word yet on estimated damage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3dhc2hpbmd0b24uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmlyZS1yaXBzLXRocm91Z2gtY2h1cmNoLWJ1aWxkaW5ncy1pbi1ub3J0aHdlc3QtZGMvMzM1MjUxMS_SAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmN3YXNoaW5ndG9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ZpcmUtcmlwcy10aHJvdWdoLWNodXJjaC1idWlsZGluZ3MtaW4tbm9ydGh3ZXN0LWRjLzMzNTI1MTEvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advertising Read more  More than 80 fire trucks were sent to the decades-old landmark after the blaze broke out late Sunday, the Bureau of Fire Protection said.  Thick, black smoke billowed hundreds of metres into the sky as flames gutted the neo-classical Manila Central Post Office that overlooks the Pasig River.  It took firefighters more than seven hours to get the inferno under control.  ""The whole building has burned down from the basement all the way to the fifth floor,"" Postmaster General Luis Carlos told DZBB radio.  The cause of the blaze was being investigated, he said.  Fire brigades from across the capital deployed personnel to fight the blaze that left one volunteer firefighter with minor injuries.  Originally built in 1926, the post office was once considered the ""grandest building"" in Manila, according to its website.  It was destroyed in World War II as US forces recaptured the capital from Japanese occupation forces, and rebuilt in 1946.  Letters, parcels and the postal agency's entire stamp collection were in the building and are likely destroyed, Carlos said.  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MjItZmlyZS1kZXN0cm95cy1oaXN0b3JpYy1waGlsaXBwaW5lLXBvc3Qtb2ZmaWNlLWJ1aWxkaW5n0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZnJhbmNlMjQuY29tL2VuL2xpdmUtbmV3cy8yMDIzMDUyMi1maXJlLWRlc3Ryb3lzLWhpc3RvcmljLXBoaWxpcHBpbmUtcG9zdC1vZmZpY2UtYnVpbGRpbmc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-05-20","00:30:00","{""Wellington"", ""Wellington"", ""NewZealand""}","2023-05-22T04:04:00","Nearly a week after the horrific fire at the Loafers Lodge boarding house in New Zealand, the number of deaths has still not been confirmed. Yesterday, police said the toll was fewer than 10, with five bodies recovered so far from the damaged building in Wellington.  Loafers Lodge on May 20, 2023. [Photo: WSWS]  An unnamed man is in custody after appearing in court on Friday charged with arson. Police say more severe charges could be added. Many questions remain about how the fire was started and how it spread.  What is clear is that the hostel, which housed nearly 100 people in 92 rooms on four storeys, was a death trap. It had no sprinkler system, which firefighters say would have saved lives, and only one functional exit. Fire alarms were reportedly faulty, with some residents saying that they only went off in part of the building, and others saying there were so many false alarms that residents had learned to ignore them.  When the fire broke out just before 12:30 a.m. on May 16 on one of the upper levels, it spread rapidly, making it impossible for many residents to reach the stairwell to escape.  On Saturday, the World Socialist Web Site spoke with Simon Hanify, who had lived in a small room on the first floor of Loafers Lodge for about four months. He said the front door had been “sealed shut for about a month; someone kicked it in.” A notice said: “Door broken, use side entrance.”  Simon Hanify outside Loafers Lodge in Wellington, May 20, 2023. [Photo: WSWS]  During the fire, some people who could not reach the stairwell to the side entrance were forced to jump onto the roof of an adjacent building. Others were rescued from the Loafers Lodge rooftop by a fire truck ladder.  Describing the night of the fire, Hanify said an initial alarm had gone off at 10:30 p.m. Police say someone had set fire to a couch, which was then extinguished. When Hanify heard the second fire alarm two hours later, he checked and realised there was smoke in the building. Then, he said, “I went around, smashing on all the doors saying: ‘Get out, this one’s real.’ I’ve talked to other people [who say] the alarm didn’t go off on other floors.”  On the third floor, one resident said “he opened his door and he just hit the floor. There was a black wall of acrid smoke, real nasty, poisonous smoke. He crawled to the stairwell.”  Hanify said if someone had not lived in the building long and didn’t know their way around, it would have been very difficult to escape. Several residents “are mentally ill or medicated, or infirm, or old, and they wouldn’t have stood a chance.” He hoped that those killed had “died of smoke inhalation in their sleep without knowing about it” instead of being trapped and knowing they could not escape.  Most of the people made homeless by the fire have been moved to temporary accommodation, and Hanify has been allocated a public housing unit. He praised the Downtown Community Ministry, which has been helping him.  Many have lost everything they owned in the fire, Hanify explained. “I did hear from someone that most things on the first floor should be okay, and they’re secure,” but items cannot be retrieved “until they’ve got rid of all that asbestos and the water that carried it all through the building.”  The building’s residents included meat workers, hospital workers, retired people, people with disabilities, and a number of people recently deported from Australia.  Hanify, who had been homeless before getting a room at Loafers Lodge, said: “I’ve lived in a few [similar places]. We call it the last resort. It’s where you go when you’ve got nowhere else and the only alternative is a tree or the concrete.  “I was really grateful when I first got in there, because sleeping under a tree in the mud is not that comfortable. I was grateful at first and then the bedbugs started eating the f..k out of me. I have all these scars. There was an infestation of bedbugs.” The property managers had heat-treated his room twice to try and kill the bugs, but they kept coming back.  In addition, Hanify had been concerned about the leaking asbestos roof. “I’m a roofer by trade,” he explained. “They’ve had exposed asbestos with seven panels cut out because there’s a leak from the roof. The water was dripping down into the rooms and they even allowed new tenants in without fixing the roof leak.” He said he believed there should have been “a total re-roof.”  Hanify had observed people doing repair work on the roof leak without protective clothing or masks. “It makes me sick. I don’t want to point fingers but I’m disgusted,” he said.  Because of contamination from asbestos-laden smoke, businesses next to Loafers Lodge remain closed to the public.  Hanify was charged $280 a week for the room, including power. Others were reportedly charged as much as $320. “Do the maths for 92 rooms—and they can’t even put a sprinkler system in or replace the roof,” he said.  Building professionals have raised concerns about the fact that Loafers Lodge was able to pass a building warrant of fitness inspection, carried out earlier this year for the Wellington City Council.  An anonymous building inspector told Newshub on May 17 that if a building fails an inspection, the owner can “easily” find another inspector “that is a bit more lax or… not as skilled and get it passed, because the system allows for that. Something needs to be done about this [because] it’s absolutely criminal.” Without changes, he predicted that there would be more tragedies.  According to the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ), some countries require sprinklers in buildings four storeys and above, whereas in New Zealand they are required only for buildings more than 10 storeys high.  Labour Party Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he had asked the Housing Minister to “look particularly at issues of building regulation to see if there’s anything we should be doing at this point.”  This morning, however, Radio NZ reported that laws to strengthen fire protections for high-density infill housing—including townhouses and terraced housing—had been “stymied” just days before the Loafers Lodge fire. On May 4, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment withdrew proposals to raise fire resistance ratings for walls and protections to limit the risk of fire spreading, because of disagreement from some figures in the building industry. Cost was reportedly a factor in the decision not to proceed with the changes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvZWNrei1tMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Wednesday, all four fire chiefs of the county imposed a total fire ban that Algonquin Highlands Fire Chief Mike French says is part of an effort to protect local resources and the environment. The ban will be in effect until Wednesday at least.  ""It was a really hard decision, and that's why we wait until last minute, but we had to do it for the protection of our force and our community.""  Starting last weekend and into Monday, French says local firefighters responded to at least 15 fire calls — many more than what's he says is usual.  Fines of hundreds of dollars  One particular fire on Monday took over seven hours and dozens of firefighters to contain — something that severely restricted their ability to respond to other calls. Luckily, no injuries were reported.  ""It is taxing on our community because if there would have been another medical fire call that came in anywhere within the county during that time period, the fire departments weren't in a position to respond to anything,"" said French.  The ban, which encompasses the Municipality of Dysart et al, Township of Minden Hills, Township of Algonquin Highlands and the Township of Highlands East, means all open fires, campfires, fireworks and lighting charcoal barbecues are prohibited.  While the news might be a disappointment to visitors looking to spend the weekend in nature, French says it's important they heed the warning.  Those who choose to light fires despite the ban could be charged hundreds of dollars for each vehicle that's sent to respond to an intentional fire call, he says.  Authorities hope cottagers heed warning  All of the approximately 200 firefighters in the county are volunteers. Right now, several of them are deployed to assist in containing the Alberta wildfires, French says. Given the volume of calls coming in and the number of people available to answer them, he says there's no choice but to impose a ban.  At one point, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry came in to help, French says.  Fire bans are usually only imposed once a year near the end of summer, French says, to protect the county during extreme fire conditions.  But because of the ""fluke"" dry conditions, high heat and lack of rain over the past two weeks, the chiefs had to act, he says.  Minden Hills Coun. Pam Sayne had a fire scare of her own this week.  Firefighters were called to battle a blaze near Black Lake in Minden Hills on Monday. The fire scorched parts of councillor Pam Sayne's cottage property. (Submitted by Pam Sayne)  Sayne says she spotted the smoke on her cottage through her security cameras while she was away. While nearby cottagers called for help, she says it was still a close call — her property and several others could have burned down Monday.  ""They were very lucky it stayed close to the ground,"" said Sayne.  Sayne says around this time of year, the county starts to swell with seasonal cottagers and visitors. As a cottage country destination, they know to expect the influx in people, and try to raise awareness on fire safety through signs and on social media.  ""A lot of people don't understand how fire works in rural areas. It can be quite frightening, so it's good just to pay attention,"" she said. ""Rules are there for a reason.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS90b3JvbnRvL2hhbGlidXJ0b24tY291bnR5LWZpcmUtYmFuLTEuNjg0Njg5MdIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS42ODQ2ODkx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Read more                KINSHASA, May 20 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo security forces fired tear gas and fought running battles in the streets of the capital Kinshasa with anti-government protesters demonstrating on Saturday over alleged irregularities in voter registration.  The protesters are also angry over the rising cost of living and prolonged insecurity in the east of the country, where armed militias and rebel groups have killed hundreds and displaced over a million.  Around a dozen protesters were detained by security forces just after the start of the demonstration, which was called for by opposition leaders.  A video shared on social media showed a shirtless youth being kicked, repeatedly bashed with a helmet, and dragged along the ground by several men in uniform. Reuters could not authenticate the video.  Police spokesman Sylvano Kasongo told Reuters that three policemen had been detained for violence against a minor during the demonstration. He added that 27 police officers were injured during the clashes.  Congo's human rights minister Albert-Fabrice Puela, in a statement on Saturday, condemned the violence by security forces against demonstrators and the minor, and called for an investigation.  Congo is due to hold a general election on Dec. 20 when President Felix Tshisekedi is expected to seek a second term.  But political tension is on the rise in the world's leading cobalt producer, with some opposition candidates complaining of delays and alleged irregularities in a voter registration drive.  Four opposition leaders including Martin Fayulu, who came second in the 2018 presidential election, and Moise Katumbi, a millionaire businessman and former regional governor who is expected to run in 2023, called for the protest on Saturday.  ""It's sad, you see, they are firing tear gas. Just before, it was real ammunition,"" Katumbi told journalists near the protest venue.  Fayulu said by telephone that his vehicle was surrounded by security forces who continued to fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators.  ""The electoral register is not reliable and we'll not compromise on this issue,"" Fayulu added.  Congo's electoral commission is expected to publish voter registration data on Sunday.

The center was last used as a mosque in 2021 and was currently being used as office space.

Court records show he has several past convictions, including one for arson at the Dorothy Day Center in St. Paul in 2020. He has also undergone several mental health evaluations.

What You Need To Know The Grafton Fire Department invited the community in for an open house Saturday    They hope the event leads to more recruits    Grafton is a call fire department, meaning you aren't required to respond to every call if you're at work or out of town    More information on applying can be found on the town's website  Lieutenant Eric John is in charge of recruiting for the department, and hopes its first ever open house leads to some new hires down the road.  ""It's definitely been more difficult than it was in the past, I think the more advanced training we're requiring is making it tougher for a lot of people to put the time and energy into it,"" John said. ""We've probably only started recruiting less than a year ago now, we've had some success with a few members and hopefully with the open house we'll see a few more.""  While the department is never short-staffed to the point where it can't respond to an emergency, like many local departments, it would be nice to have some extra hands around.  Grafton works as a call fire department, meaning you don't have to respond to every call, just the ones you can get to.  “If you’re at home having dinner with your family, you get up and go to the call, but if you’re out of town or at work you don’t have to respond to the call,"" John said. ""It’s kind of whenever you can respond you respond, there’s no commitment you have to make every call.”  And despite the more rigorous training involved in becoming a firefighter nowadays, there's still new recruits coming in. Andrea Sivakova signed on in January.  “I’ve been an EMT for about five years and I love helping people, I live very close to the station here so I was like ‘Why not become a firefighter?""

(WYMT) - One Floyd County fire department hosted a fundraiser at Mine Made Adventure Park benefiting both the community and themselves.  Even through rainy weather, the Middle Creek Volunteer Fire Department hosted “Ride 4 Rescue” to raise money for rescue operations.  Participants young and old strolled through the trails.  “We’ve had people from all over the different states coming out and supporting with donations. We greatly appreciate the community,” volunteer Patricia Bentley said.  In an area that has dealt with flooding, water rescue equipment has become a crucial part of emergency response.  “The water rescue is gonna be one of our main focuses with this,” volunteer Joshua Ratliff said.  “We have low line creek areas on route 114. I’d say every spring and fall, the department is out helping people,” Patricia Bentley added.  Whether it is fire or flooding, volunteer fire departments are often the first ones to receive a call to respond.  So, access to more equipment is important.  “Normally if there’s a medical cause. If there’s someone in a car accident. Any 911 emergency. Normally we’re gonna be notified first to be there,” Joshua Ratliff said.  Anyone that is interested in joining the Middle Creek Volunteer Fire Department can go to one of their weekly Tuesday meetings at 6:30 p.m. The meetings are normally held at one of their stations.

(WTOC)- Two fires in Bluffton on Friday left several people displaced, in what the Bluffton Fire Department says is an unusual number of devastating fires for them to see in just one day.  Stephen Combs, the public information officer with the Bluffton Township Fire District, says, ”[Friday] was really quite an unusual day for the Bluffton Township Fire District. We don’t typically see a lot of fires in our area.”  On this particular day, Bluffton firefighters found themselves responding to two fires. The first was in the Woodbridge subdivision in Bluffton, and started around 9:00 in the morning. Flames were visible from the kitchen and attic when crews from multiple stations arrived.  Steven McNulty, who saw the fire, says, ”They were like a well-oiled machine here. There were probably about six or seven firetrucks. Everybody knew their role. They were on it. It was just pretty impressive to watch.”  The people that lived in the home, as well as their pets, were able to get out safely. The victim of the second fire, however, did not.  Not twelve hours after the first fire, Combs says crews were dispatched to a medical emergency, but when they arrived, they found a home visibly on fire. Multiple stations were sent to Cherry Point Road, including some that had responded to the Woodbridge fire earlier in the day.  One man inside the home was taken to a hospital with serious injuries, after calling out for help while still inside the home.  Combs says, ”These types of situations are very taxing mentally. It’s not just a single incident, but a lot of times it’s that compounding effect where you have multiple incidents back-to-back. And we have resources in place for our firefighters to discuss those stressors that they might experience on a daily basis.”  Fire investigators believe that both fires were caused by unattended cooking.  Combs says these situations are a good reminder of the importance of keeping safe while cooking.  “The majority of house fires that we see that start in the kitchen are a result of unattended cooking on the stove, so we just want to encourage people that if you have to leave the kitchen, please turn the stove off so you don’t leave things that could catch fire.”  Combs also adds that people should be sure to check their smoke alarms, keep a fire extinguisher in your kitchen- and under no circumstances should you throw water on a grease fire, because it only makes it spread.

It was a wild night in the Windy City as two red cards were shown, one for each side, and six goals were scored in a match that went back-and-forth. Andrew Gutman, wearing the captain's armband for the first time, and halftime sub Giorgos Giakoumakis were the goal scorers for Atlanta United as the visitors played Chicago Fire to a 3-3 draw to secure a result on the road.  The Fire went down to 10 men in the 26th minute with the match scoreless, and Atlanta United immediately took advantage. The sequence started when pressure from Atlanta United forced a giveaway that was recovered by Miguel Berry. On the dribble, the striker was clipped from behind, resulting in Chicago midfielder Federico Navarro's second yellow card of the night. Navarro was shown a red card then exited the match, leaving Chicago with 10 men on the field. Atlanta United was awarded a direct free kick right near the edge of the 18-yard box, taken by Thiago Almada. His low, driven shot was initially blocked by Chicago goalkeeper Chris Brady but Gutman cleaned up the rebound to put the visitors on the board 1-0 in the 29th minute.  “Right place, right time,"" Gutman said. ""I kind of had a feeling that Thiago might go back post. And whenever you go back post, the only thing the keeper can do with the way he hits it is kind of push it, so I just tried to position myself there and it fell right to me and I just had to tap it in.”  Chicago answered on a corner kick in the 42nd minute. Xherdan Shaqiri at the right corner flag curled the ball near post with his left foot. Atlanta United goalkeeper Quentin Westberg got his hands on the ball, but the block ricocheted off the back of his center back Juanjo Purata, who was in the area trying to make a clearance with his head. The bounce trickled over the goal line for an Atlanta own goal that equalized the match 1-1.  Chicago Fire, with just 10 men on the field, scored their second goal in the 49th minute. Chicago striker Kacper Przybyłko posted up inside the box, positioned with his back to goal. He brought down a pass with his chest that midfielder Maren Haile-Selassie could run onto. Haile-Selassie's one-touch strike was driven low and evaded Westberg's diving attempt. The home team took their first lead of the night.  ""It came from a throw-in and we’re not ready for that throw-in. And then it’s so easy. It’s so simple. A throw-in, a long switch, received with the chest inside the box, no pressure at all and then no closing down the opponent, no blocking shots which is something that we message very often. So, frustrated with that one,"" Atlanta United head coach Gonzalo Pineda said.  Atlanta United answered right back with a goal in the 55th minute to make it a 2-2 match. Winger Derrick Etienne Jr. pivoted to move the ball from one side to the other, feeding it to to Ronald Hernández on the right. The fullback, who made his second consecutive start Saturday, crossed the ball long all the way to the far post. Gutman was there to head it down to Giorgos Giakoumakis, who had entered the match at halftime as a substitute for Berry. The striker knocked it home for his seventh goal in 10 MLS appearances.  Then, Giakoumakis broke the 2-2 deadlock for his brace on the night. Almada, who was played quickly from Gutman, fed the striker a through ball. Giakoumakis cut to avoid Brady coming off his line and scored with his left foot. The flag came up, so the striker was initially ruled offside on the play. However, VAR overturned the initial call and the goal was allowed, which gave Atlanta United the go-ahead goal in the 64th minute.  The final 20 minutes of the match were played even with 10 men on each side because Atlanta United's Luiz Araújo also received a second yellow card. The red card came in the 71st minute, and Araújo will miss Atlanta's next match against Orlando City.  A wild night in the Windy City ended with the equalizer from Chicago Fire in the 89th minute. Miguel Navarro sent a left-footed cross to the far side that trickled through a crowded box to Haile-Selassie. The midfielder tapped it to Georgios Koutsias who was able to poke it past Westberg and even the match 3-3.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0bHV0ZC5jb20vbmV3cy9hbmRyZXctZ3V0bWFuLWdpb3Jnb3MtZ2lha291bWFraXMtYnJhY2UtYXRsYW50YS11bml0ZWQtMy0zLWRyYXctY2hpY2Fnby1maXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He seems to be saying that 15 tons of wood framing enclosed within a house was a major cause of the fire.  Cal Fire and various fire departments have very stringent requirements for building houses in rural fire prone areas. These requirements are designed to protect the houses from wildfire. They have been developed by trained fire engineers. While houses contain wood framing, they also contain large amounts of plastics, and multiple other flammable materials. Most new houses are also sprinklered to protect the interior of the house. They do not protect the exterior.  The fire started near federal lands that were totally overgrown with huge fuel loads that were supposed to have been cleaned up. Once the fire reached that, it created its own winds and roared to Paradise. Ponderosa Pine trees near homes did not help matters and further fueled the fire. For Mr. Roddy’s edification … one large Ponderosa can weigh 15 tons … and when exposed to fire can be a wonderful torch.  Wood framing is preferable to most others. It is preferable in earthquake zones. It is protected by fire retardant outside materials. As people and governments have added multiple restrictions, codes, and requirements to building houses, they are rapidly raising the costs above the average person’s income and accomplishing little in many cases.  — Frank Solinsky, Chico","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNvZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbGV0dGVyLXdvb2QtZnJhbWluZy1ub3QtdG8tYmxhbWUtZm9yLWZpcmXSAVFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljb2VyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL2xldHRlci13b29kLWZyYW1pbmctbm90LXRvLWJsYW1lLWZvci1maXJlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2017-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Waco"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T22:49:00","Waco Fire Station No. 4 could find a new home on La Salle Avenue by 2027 as the Waco Fire Department looks to upgrade its 63-year-old facility near Baylor University. Design is also coming along for the planned Station No. 15 on Panther Way, meant to improve Waco’s response times at the southwest edge of the city.  Waco Fire Chief Gregory Summers said Station No. 4’s current facility at 1002 Speight Ave., built in 1960, is a small and outdated building on a lot with little room for expansion. The property — with about 3,500 square feet of living area and 4,000 square feet of paved area, according to the McLennan County Appraisal District — is too small to upgrade to meet the growing department’s needs and only has room to house one firetruck, he said.  “We have to move it off that property because the property is not big enough to update like we need to update for a present-day fire station,” Summers said.  The new station is planned for a lot on La Salle Avenue between Eighth and Ninth streets that the city bought from Baylor last year. Summers said it would have three bays able to house vehicles for the multi-company operation, with room for a fire engine, ladder truck and a third company vehicle. The three-bay setup is similar to the proposed design for Fire Station No. 15.  Also in line with current designs, Station No. 4 will upgrade to Jack-and-Jill bathrooms to support separate living quarters for male and female firefighters, Summers said.  “It’s not new in the fire service, but the older your fire stations, less likely they are gender-friendly,” he said.  Each new station will be equipped with large washing machines made to extract carcinogens from firefighters’ gear, which Station No. 4 does not currently have the plumbing capacity for, he said.  A request to start the design phase will go to city council late this year, with selection of a design firm slated for April or May of next year, according to a presentation Summers gave to the council last month. The project has a preliminarily budget of about $7 million, with substantial completion slated for 2027.  The building on La Salle Avenue will sit next to the former Cen-Tex Hispanic Chamber of Commerce site, which Council Member Alice Rodriguez said is still occupied by the owner, Cen-Tex Community Projects Inc. She said she likes the mission revival-style architecture presented last month, with stucco walls and a tower, to keep the consistency of the look of buildings in the La Salle Avenue corridor.  Summers said the fire department does not have plans for the existing facility on Speight Avenue and he is not yet sure if it will house other city operations or if it will be sold.  “At this point I don’t know what those plans are, but there’s nothing that we can do with it in its current location or condition that it’s in,” he said. “And it’s not a bad fire station. It’s just outdated.”  Fire Station No. 15  Summers said Station No. 15 at 10905 Panther Way, next to a city water tower along Ritchie Road, will take priority over Station No. 4’s relocation, given a lack of coverage in the area.  He said the new facility is almost out of its design phase.  The closest fire station to the new location is No. 14 in Speegleville or No. 11 on Imperial Drive. Taking Imperial Drive to Hewitt Drive is a straight shot into the area that Station No. 15 would cover, but response times vary and lag from their goal of 6 minutes, depending on traffic, Summers said.  “The response time for Station 11, which are more than likely to be the first station to get there, is anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes, and it varies … depending on traffic, the time of day,” he said.  “We have not had an issue. I don’t anticipate us having an issue in getting there, but if we’re going to cover the city like it needs to be covered, then we need to make sure we have adequate protection.”  The area near Hewitt and Woodway has seen rapid residential growth in recent years, including the 1,000-home Park Meadows subdivision.  The new location was chosen with input from the Insurance Services Office, a third-party entity that ranks fire departments based on their performance on a 100-point scale, Summers said. The ISO assesses how prepared a community is to respond to fires and determines where fire stations are needed. Its ratings affect property insurance rates.  “When they looked at our city, they identified that we need a fire station out here,” he said. “And so we began to look at putting that into the budget process to make the city aware of where we need a fire station.”  The department as a whole is scored out of 50 points, looking at how many firefighters the department has, how many trucks it has, what kind of equipment it has and the amount of training done monthly. For 40 points ISO scores the department’s water supply, and 10 points are allocated for dispatch.  Waco scored about 97 points, sitting in the highest rank, Class 1, Summers said.  Station No. 15 should have a finalized design this month, with a request for proposals going out for contractors next month and construction starting by the end of the year. The department is looking to move into the new facility in early 2025, he said.  According to Summers’ presentation to the city council, the construction project’s budget is $5.46 million.  Summers said the department has started the hiring process for firefighters to staff Station No. 15, seven already hired and working in Waco with five more on the way in October. When the station opens it will be fully staffed with trained firefighters, and promotions for a captain, two lieutenants and three drivers will come from within the department, he said.  Taking salary, benefits and uniforms into account, hiring one firefighter costs about $93,000, totaling some $1.1 million to staff the new station, Summers said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3dhY290cmliLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2dvdnQtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzL3dhY28tdG8tYnVpbGQtMi1uZXctZmlyZS1zdGF0aW9ucy1pbi00LXllYXJzL2FydGljbGVfMDQwNDNiNTYtZjU5YS0xMWVkLWE4MWEtZWZjMmU3Y2U5M2ViLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The silence from Sacramento echoes into the hills of California’s wildfire country where 70,000 people affected by man-made disasters are still waiting to receive settlement money from PG&E.  A lack of answers about their plight – being paid low-and-slow in a PG&E bankruptcy settlement California Gov. Gavin Newsom brokered, blessed, and bolstered – adds to growing scrutiny of how the Newsom administration handles tough questions and provides answers to pressing issues.  As Newsom assumed office in January 2019, the power monopoly filed for federal bankruptcy protection to settle damages with 70,000 victims of 24 different wildfires.  PG&E was a major donor to Newsom’s 2018 campaign. Just 30 hours after he became governor-elect in November 2018, PG&E sparked the deadly Camp Fire leading to 84 felony manslaughter convictions against the company.  ""He doesn't care,” said fire survivor Carol Cassel. “Isn't the governor supposed to be for the people of the state that he lives in?""  After Cassel escaped the deadly Butte Fire in 2015, Cal Fire investigators found PG&E at fault.  But settlement talks were frozen by the bankruptcy, which PG&E declared after starting fires that killed more than 100 people in 2017 and 2018.  The survivors of all of the 2015-2018 fires settled by PG&E were lumped together in the bankruptcy plan, to be paid from a new entity: the Fire Victim Trust.    Nearly three years after PG&E emerged from bankruptcy in 2020, no fire survivors have been paid in full.  They’ve been warned not to expect to receive their full settlements.  “The state should ensure fire victims are treated fairly and fully compensated,” Newsom’s own task force on the crisis declared in 2019. “Any reorganization plan should not disadvantage current and future wildfire victims.”  FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY  ABC10 has lodged 12 interview requests with Newsom since he was governor-elect, all of which have been rejected or ignored.  In 2021, the governor walked away when asked at a news conference about the shortfall to fire survivors.    It’s not a problem isolated to this issue. The Newsom administration has made a habit of avoiding interviews and comments on stories.    “It's just making it impossible sometimes to do this job,” said reporter Alexei Koseff, who recently reported on the lack of press access in Governor Newsom’s administration for nonprofit news site CalMatters.    “It is a strange position to be in as a reporter, because you never want to make yourself the story,” Koseff said. “But this has been a growing issue for the press corps over the past few years.”  Koseff chronicled a shift away from granting in-person interviews with the governor and state agency officials, urging reporters to submit questions by email instead.    His report also noted multiple occasions when staffers “physically blocked journalists” from approaching Newsom.    ABC10 aired footage Saturday of Newsom staffers using their bodies to block its journalists from asking the governor questions after a March news conference.  “The governor is not obligated to answer our questions,” Koseff said. “But to physically block reporters at an event from even trying to do their job… it's beyond simply ignoring a question then it becomes obstruction.”  QUESTIONS ABOUT FAIRNESS AND MAKING IT RIGHT  With the governor evading questions and refusing to provide answers, the frustration and anger from the victims and their families continue to mount.  In an investor call, PG&E recently announced plans to restart dividend payments to shareholders in the second half of this year.  This means PG&E plans to resume paying profits to Wall Street while its fire survivors go without full payment.    ABC10 wanted the governor to answer two main questions: How is this outcome fair? And what is he prepared to do to help get the survivors paid?  They are questions survivors want to be answered.    ""No one should be making any extra money until those victims have been paid for,” said Steve Bradley, whose grandmother Colleen was one of PG&E’s 84 manslaughter victims. “I know legally there is no way to hold them to that standard, but it is the right, moral thing for them to do.""    PG&E’s dividends had reached $1 billion annually prior to the Camp Fire.  Before PG&E’s federal criminal probation for its San Bruno felonies expired, a federal judge banned the monopoly from paying dividends as a way to protect public safety. He found PG&E had paid billions in profits to investors, some of which should have been spent on maintaining a safe power grid.  QUESTIONS AND NON-ANSWERS  In an exchange of emails with Newsom deputy communications director, Alex Stack -- who promised on-camera in March to help get answers to our questions -- the administration received and rejected our 12th request for an interview with the governor about PG&E.    In April, we finally had the opportunity to ask the governor the two questions during a press conference the governor called to talk about protecting abortion access:  ABC10: “Governor, PG&E on its most recent earnings call said it was going to go back to paying a dividend later this year. Meantime, the 70,000 wildfire victims are still waiting on their payments. They’re being told not to expect to be paid in full. I’m curious to know whether you think that’s fair and why. But more importantly, after your administration said that ‘the state should ensure fire victims are treated fairly and fully compensated…’ what do you plan to do to try to get those victims to 100 percent of what they’re owed?”    NEWSOM: “Well, we’re here talking about the pending, looming fire that’s in front of us. I appreciate the question on PG&E. That’s well established territory in terms of the public comments we’ve made and the work we did collectively, not only this administration but in partnership with the legislature. I don’t know about the dividends call at PG&E and I’ll have to get back to you on that.”    ABC10: “Why is it fair that they pay their shareholders but not their victims?”  NEWSOM: [Ignores question]  With neither question answered, we emailed Stack to ask the governor to get back to us on that.    Stack replied with a line the governor’s office has sent ABC10 on multiple occasions before: “No governor in California history has done more to hold PG&E accountable.”    The statement, which appears in its entirety below, goes on to describe the bankruptcy process. It does not answer the two questions: Does Newsom think this treatment of PG&E’s victims is fair? And does he plan to help them?  EMPTY BULLY PULPIT  Some fire attorneys asked the governor for a state loan to help pay the victims. It went nowhere.  “PG&E created that debt. They need to pay that debt,” said Bradley, who doesn’t want the state to pay.  If PG&E has enough money to pay dividends, he says the company should pay.  He wanted to hear the governor say that. He wanted to hear Newsom speaking from his bully pulpit as the chief executive of the state, which governors frequently do.  “He could call out PG&E, he could mention the payment to the shareholders, to put public pressure or public shaming on them,” said Sacramento State University Political science professor Kristina Flores Victor.    The governor’s response makes it clear he’s not planning to use his bully pulpit for the fire survivors.  “It seems like ‘we've already dealt with this,’” she added. “Whatever political energy has been expended on this topic is done.”  Newsom has raised his national profile, frequently booking interviews with national outlets about hot-button issues.  But some of the issues the California press wants to ask about: homelessness, problems with state programs, or the bailout of PG&E.  “They don't get him the good headlines. They maybe get him the bad headlines,” Koseff said. “You can understand the strategy, right? Say nothing, and perhaps the story will go away. And sometimes it does. That's what makes it an effective strategy and that's why people continue to do it.”  A CALL FOR COMPASSION  For Carol Cassel and thousands like her, the story won’t go away.  It’s her life.  She finally has a real roof over her head. She bought a house from friends who sold it below market value.  “I wanted to emphasize this isn't because of PG&E. We're not home because of something they did to make up for what they did,” Cassel said. “This is because I have good friends and there are good people in this world.”  She’s received 60 percent of her PG&E settlement. Fire survivors are being held at 60 percent as the trust liquidates shares of PG&E stock used to fund their claims.  The Fire Victim Trust acknowledges victims won’t be made whole in the end, but won’t say by how much.  Some projections forecast that victims will only get 80 percent of their money. Survivors have also asked Congress for help. On top of paying lawyers’ fees out of their settlements, they must also pay federal income tax on them.  Cassel would like to pay only 80 percent of her PG&E bill, but knows she can’t.  “Would we get away with that? They would come after us until the day we died,” she said.    Survivors also have a bone to pick with Congress. Efforts by members of California’s congressional delegation, a majority of which accepted campaign funds from PG&E after the company became a convicted felon, have fallen short of winning tax relief for these 70,000 survivors.  If she gets less than 100 percent of her settlement, Carol will struggle harder to keep the roof she finally has over her head.  She sums up what she wants to hear from Governor Newsom in one word: “Compassion.”  “When you're in that position, you can change the world, you can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem,” she said. “Where's your humanity?”    MORE FROM FIRE - POWER - MONEY: www.FirePowerMoney.com    EDITOR’S NOTE: The following is a complete, unedited statement received via email from Alex Stack in Gov. Newsom’s communications office, responding to our questions:    No governor in California history has done more to hold PG&E accountable. The Newsom Administration worked with the Legislature to ensure that PG&E could not exit bankruptcy without first entering into a settlement agreement with fire victims, while also protecting ratepayers from rate increases. That settlement had to be approved by both the bankruptcy court and by a vote of the fire victims themselves, with the help of their lawyers and financial advisors.  Regardless of the settlement terms approved by the court and fire victims, the state is supporting communities hardesthit: providing additional relief for communities devastated by wildfires, including property tax backfills for schools, stabilizing finances of local critical infrastructure, debris and tree removal, and more.  Additionally, the state held PG&E accountable by forcing the company to make fundamental changes by passing strict new safety requirements, creating new protections for PG&E customers, getting PG&E shareholders to pay billions for safety improvements, and more.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hYmMxMC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FiYzEwLW9yaWdpbmFscy9uZXdzb20tdW5kZXItZmlyZS1hbnN3ZXJzLXBnZS1maXJlLXZpY3RpbXMtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1tb25leS8xMDMtYTU2YTY4MjItN2ZkZS00OGFlLTkwMDAtMTA3YmFlMzE3MmJi0gGhAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzEwLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FiYzEwLW9yaWdpbmFscy9uZXdzb20tdW5kZXItZmlyZS1hbnN3ZXJzLXBnZS1maXJlLXZpY3RpbXMtZmlyZS1wb3dlci1tb25leS8xMDMtYTU2YTY4MjItN2ZkZS00OGFlLTkwMDAtMTA3YmFlMzE3MmJi?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Edson"", ""UnitedStates"", ""male""}","2023-05-20T14:07:02","Flames from a prescribed burn, started by wildland firefighters in an attempt to halt the spread of larger wildfires, in Shining Bank, Alberta, Canada on May 19, 2023. (Jen Osborne/The New York Times)  EDMONTON, Alberta — As acrid smoke filled the air, turning the sky around her sleepy hometown, Fox Creek, Alberta, a garish blood orange, Nicole Clarke said she felt a sense of terror.  With no time to collect family photographs, she grabbed her two young children, hopped into her pickup truck, and sped away, praying she wouldn’t drive into the blaze’s menacing path.  “This feels like a Canadian Armageddon, like a bad horror film,” said Clarke, a 37-year-old hair stylist, standing outside her truck, a large hamper of dirty laundry piled in the back.  Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times  In a country revered for placid landscapes and predictability, weeks of out-of-control wildfires raging across western Canada have ushered in a potent sense of fear, threatening a region that is the epicenter of the country’s oil and gas sector.  Climate research suggests that heat and drought associated with global warming are major reasons for the increase in bigger and stronger fires.  Amid frequent fire updates dominating national television news broadcasts, the blazes have also helped unite a vast and sometimes polarized nation, with volunteers, firefighters and army reservists from other provinces rushing in to lend a hand.  Roughly 29,000 people in Alberta have been forced from their homes by the recent bout of wildfires, though that number has been cut in half in recent days as fires subsided.  Clarke said her family had been staying in cheap motels since they were ordered about a week ago to evacuate. But she and her boyfriend were unemployed and money was quickly running out.  “I don’t know if I’ll have a home to return to,” she added Thursday, sobbing.  The fires have produced such thick smoke that during recess, children in some towns have remained in their classrooms rather than risk smoke inhalation outside. Dozens of residents left in such a frantic panic that they left pets behind.  On Highway 43, a long stretch of Alberta highway peppered by small, evacuated towns, the thick layer of smoke blanketing the road on Thursday conjured the feeling of a dystopia.  Story continues  With helicopters hovering and dropping water, police cars with flashing lights blocked parts of the highway as fires approached the road. Residents trying to return to homes they hoped were still intact commiserated as they were forced to turn back.  Fires have broken out throughout western Canada, including British Columbia, but hardest hit has been neighboring Alberta, a proud oil and gas producing province sometimes referred to as “the Texas of the North,” which has declared a state of emergency. More than 94 active wildfires were burning as of Friday afternoon.  British Columbia was the site in 2021 of one of Canada’s worst wildfires in recent decades, when fires decimated the tiny community of Lytton after temperatures there reached a record 49.6 degrees Celsius, or 121.3 Fahrenheit.  Not since the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic buffeted the region has the area been so overcome by apprehension, accompanied by the all-too familiar need to wear masks outside. Only this time, residents say, a silent killer has been replaced by something more visceral and visible.  So far, no deaths have been reported. But in Alberta, Frankie Payou, a firefighter and 33-year-old father of three from the East Prairie Métis Settlement in Northern Alberta, was in a coma with severe injuries after being hit in the head by a burned tree. His home was also destroyed by a fire.  The bulk of the fires are in the far north of the province, home to many Indigenous communities, dealing a heavy blow to people who depend on the land and natural resources.  At a sprawling evacuation center in Edmonton, Ken Zenner, 61, a father of eight, two of whom are members of the Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, said he and his family had been evacuated from the town of Valleyview. He worried how they would get by.  Families that have been displaced for a cumulative seven days are eligible for government-provided financial support, according to provincial regulations. But Zenner said he didn’t qualify because he had only been evacuated for six days.  “Indigenous communities have been underfunded for years and now we are seeing the consequences,” he said.  The rest of the country is mobilizing to help. Some 2,500 firefighters are battling the fires, among them 1,000 from other provinces. Joining them are wilderness firefighters from the United States.  The fires have even affected Alberta’s largest city, Calgary, where residents this week said they sat down for breakfast only to see and smell pungent smoke entering from cracks under their front doors.  Environment and Climate Change Canada said the air quality index for the city Wednesday afternoon was at 10+, or “very high risk.” Canadian health authorities have warned the smoke could cause symptoms ranging from sore and watery eyes to coughing, dizziness, chest pains and heart palpitations.  In Alberta, the blazes have brought back bad memories of 2016 when a raging wildfire destroyed 2,400 buildings in Fort McMurray, Alberta, the heart of Canada’s oil sands region with the third-largest reserves of oil in the world.  Alberta is Canada’s main energy-producing province and the United States’ largest source of imported oil and the fires have compelled some companies to curb production.  As flames bore down on wells and pipelines, major drillers such as Chevron and Paramount Resources together shut down the equivalent of at least 240,000 barrels of oil a day, according to energy consulting firm Rystad Energy.  For now, the disruptions affect only a small proportion of the country’s total oil and gas output. Still, they underscore how the production of oil and gas, the main driver of climate change, is also vulnerable to increasingly dire consequences of a warming planet.  Some say the fire may help galvanize Canadians about the perils of climate change. “The smoke from forest fires has an in-your-face impact affecting millions of Canadians that makes it harder to ignore,” the CBC, the national broadcaster, observed this week.  The human toll of the fires will reverberate for weeks to come. Christine Pettie, a business manager for a logging cooperative in Edson, a rural town about two hours west of Edmonton, said residents were still shellshocked after being evacuated.  She and her husband left in such a rush that he forgot his insulin medicine. They were fortunate that their home remained standing.  Still, Pettie said, the experience “definitely shook me to my core.”  c.2023 The New York Times Company","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2FuYWRpYW4tYXJtYWdlZGRvbi1zZXRzLXBhcnRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tMTQwNzAyMTAyLmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL25ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvY2FuYWRpYW4tYXJtYWdlZGRvbi1zZXRzLXBhcnRzLXdlc3Rlcm4tMTQwNzAyMTAyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WHSV) - The Swoope Volunteer Fire Company tried a different way to raise money on Saturday. The Dice Run fundraiser was a big deal since the fire company remains 100% volunteer.  Organizers explained how the Dice Run worked. Motorcyclists paid an entry fee to ride through a course with checkpoints. At each checkpoint, dice were rolled. The winner was determined and prizes were awarded at the last checkpoint.  Swoope Fire raised at least $2500 from a donation, but the big turnout made them confident they will have the money to get what they need.  “We use it for many different things, and then we had to look at bills... that we have to pay. Our firetrucks cost anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, so it’s very important that we have money to be able to get out the door and go to calls,” Swoope Volunteer Fire Company Deputy Chief Ben Piner said.  Collaborators of the Dice Run said this event needed to happen so Swoope Fire can get the thank you they deserve in the best way possible.  The fundraiser was a year in the making, so many people could be in for a good safe ride.  “It was a great ride. We had good weather; got cloudy a few times over but never did hit any rain, and I won two prizes on the ride so even better. Supporting the fire department is a great cause. When I saw they were doing a run, I want to be part of it so here I am,” Waynesboro -Based Biker Corey Lewis said.  Motorcyclists came from near and far just to show that they were Swoope strong.  “It’s about love, and it’s about our community and doing what’s right and making sure that people have someone there when they have an emergency; that we can take care of them,” Deputy Chief Piner said.

The April 10 fire at South Fork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, about 66 miles southwest of Amarillo, killed nearly 18,000 cows and left one person injured. A report from the state fire marshal's office found there was ""no intentional act to cause a failure"" but did not determine the cause of the engine fire.  The findings, which were first reported by the Associated Press, noted the dairy farm had a second manure hauling truck on the property outside of the barn, and a dairy manager told investigators it had also previously burned. Investigators found burn marks near the engine compartment that were consistent with the truck fire inside the barn.  Investigators and the dairy manager waited until the next day to make entry into the facility because of the limited visibility at night when the fire started, the threat of the building collapsing and injured cattle wandering.  Investigators note in the report that the structure had only been in use for two and a half years and that the 17,500 cattle housed in the dairy were milked around the clock. Investigators also allowed dairy workers to move injured cattle out and reassured them it would not hinder the outcome of the investigation.  The Animal Welfare Institute, which tracks barn fires, said it was the deadliest barn fire involving cattle since 2013. Investigators with the Texas State Fire Marshal's Office previously stated the fire began as an accident, and the explosion was the result of flammable liquids, including liquid fuel, hydraulic oil and other materials ""expanding rapidly."" The investigation into the fire is now closed.  The Texas Tribune previously reported that the massive dairy operation was authorized by the state to more than double the number of cattle allowed on-site in 2019, from 11,500 up to 32,000. The state also authorized the facility to increase its manure production by more than 50% in the same permit with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Inverness"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T02:34:17","Marin County fire Chief Jason Weber says the chance of a major wildfire during the early part of this summer has been greatly reduced by the persistent rain this year.  However, he said, “We can’t let our guard down.”  During a briefing on preparations for the 2023 fire season before the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, Weber displayed maps that illustrated expected fire risk in June, July and August.  “The good news is there is no red on the maps,” he said. “In previous years we did see a lot of red and potential for significant and above-normal fire occurrence.”  Weber noted that 1995, the year of the Mount Vision fire, was also a very wet year in Marin. The Mount Vision fire burned 12,000 acres and destroyed 40 homes in Inverness.  Weber said all the rain Marin has received has stimulated the growth of annual grasses.  “If you’ve been out hiking, you know the tonnage per acre is really significant,” Weber said. “You’re looking at oats that are 6 feet tall.”  By fall, when hot dry winds typically ramp up fire danger, those green grasses will be dry and highly flammable.  Weber said the good news is that the county has taken a number of steps to protect itself since the Mount Vision fire. It has increased the number of fire crews clearing vegetation and boosted home inspections, and it is building shaded fire breaks around population centers.  Approximately 33,000 home inspections were conducted in Marin last year to determine if homeowners are creating defensible space around their homes by clearing away combustible materials. Weber said removing all vegetation within 5 feet of homes is “super important.”  Some Marin jurisdictions collaborate to do the inspections while others, such as San Rafael and Novato, do their own. Until now, Marin jurisdictions had resisted the idea of issuing citations to residents who don’t clear space, despite a 2019 Marin County Civil Grand Jury report recommending the enforcement action.  Quinn Gardner, a San Rafael emergency manager, said it’s a new day in the city. Inspectors have issued more than 200 citations.  “We did our first big round of citations two weeks ago,” Gardner said. “If they correct the issue before the next citation, we won’t charge them. The folks have about three or four weeks before we issue them another citation.”  The initial fine is $250. For violators who don’t comply, he said, “eventually fines can increase to thousands of dollars and people could be charged abatement costs.”  A limited number of grants to help defer associated costs are available through the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority.  The shaded fire breaks being created remove some understory trees and vegetation while retaining tree canopies so they can continue to provide shade to help preserve the moisture content of potential ground fuels.  Work began about a year ago on a 38-mile shaded fuel break that will extend from eastern Corte Madera to Fairfax. So far, 14 miles of the break have been completed. The buffer will eventually run along the backyards of about 1,700 parcels and span 1,300 acres.  An even larger shaded fuel break that will encompass Novato is expected to begin this summer. The break will be 300 feet wide and 60 miles long, skirt 5,200 residences on the city’s outer edges and cover 3,000 acres. A matrix of fuel breaks already exists in San Rafael, southern Marin and western Marin.  Supervisor Mary Sackett said, “We do hear concerns when we talk about fire breaks.”  Sackett asked Weber to speak to that issue as well as public concerns about how the biomass created by vegetation management is being disposed of.  Weber said some people worried that the fire breaks would result in the clearcutting of large areas. He said that is not the case.  “We’re working with biologists and ecologists to make sure we’re doing this holistically,” Weber said, “not just from a fire prevention perspective.”  Weber said the public is also curious why the fire department is leaving biomass on the ground at sites where it is being chipped instead of hauling it away. He said this approach is more effective at sequestering carbon dioxide.  Bill Carney, who serves on the steering committee of the Marin BioMass Project, said, “That is one of the options, which is often very cost effective.”  A $500,000 study is underway to estimate the amount of biomass being created in the county and research options for its best use. It is funded by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research and led by the Marin Resource Conservation District.  Weber said another major concern he is hearing from residents is how the new state housing mandate will affect their ability to evacuate in case of a major wildfire.  In January, supervisors rejected a Planning Commission recommendation to tighten regulations on accessory dwelling units in the wildland-urban interface and very-high-fire-hazard-severity zones.  On Tuesday, however, Supervisor Stephanie Moulton-Peters noted that state housing officials have granted the city of Portola Valley permission to continue restricting accessory dwelling units in fire hazard zones.  “It might be worth touching base down there,” Moulton-Peters told Weber.  A study that evaluates every road in the fire authority’s jurisdiction for its evacuation risk is nearing completion, Weber said.  Following the meeting, Mark Brown, executive officer of the Marin Wildfire Prevention Authority, said he couldn’t predict when that study will be made public.  Brown said it might never be feasible to release the full report because information in the study could affect the property values and insurance rates of residents along the studied roads.  Brown said the county has a “very solid and comprehensive” evacuation plan in place that was created in 2016. He added that for many residents there are no evacuation options, because there is only one road in and out of their neighborhoods.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluaWouY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbWFyaW4tZmlyZS1jaGllZi1uby1tYWpvci13aWxkZmlyZS1yaXNrLW9uLWhvcml6b24v0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFyaW5pai5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9tYXJpbi1maXJlLWNoaWVmLW5vLW1ham9yLXdpbGRmaXJlLXJpc2stb24taG9yaXpvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With the front door blocked by the blaze, she and her two young daughters were trapped, and all she could do was call for help.  ""I opened my window and I started yelling 'Please, someone help me, there's a fire, I can't get out through the front, I need someone to help me,"" Jiminez told CBS News.  Even before the firefighters arrived, help came from an unlikely place. Joe Hollins, who is homeless, and his wife were camped out near Jiminez's apartment, and when they heard the screams, he ran to help.  ""All I see is a lady pull open the window and she's screaming 'Please help me, please help me,'"" Hollins said.  Hollis got under the window, Jiminez said, and told her to drop her two children to him.  ""He was right underneath and he was like 'Yes, throw your daughters out, I'm going to catch them, I'm going to get them,"" Jiminez recalled.  First went one-year-old Valerie. Next up was eight-year-old Natalie. Then, Jiminez threw out the family's two dogs. Hollis safely caught each and every one of them, but when it was her turn, Jiminez froze.  ""She didn't want to come at first. She was scared she was going to fall,"" Hollins said. ""I was like 'I got you. Don't worry.'""  Jiminez finally made the jump and landed safely in Hollins' arms. The fire department soon arrived to fight back the flames, and as things calmed down, the grateful family said they owe Hollins their lives.  ""I will forever be thankful to him, you know? Like I said, to me he was an angel,"" Jiminez said. ""Because of him we're here, we're alive and my daughters are safe.""  Hollins wouldn't listen to the praise, though: He said anyone would do the same.  ""Those are children,"" he said.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Crews searching the rubble of a massive construction fire in North Carolina on Friday found the bodies of two people who firefighters couldn't reach to save before the flames became too intense.  Authorities didn't identify the victims, but officials said two workers were missing after the Thursday fire on the site of a new apartment building in the upscale South Park neighborhood of Charlotte.  No one else was injured in the five-alarm fire, including more than 90 firefighters and a worker trapped for a time on top of a crane as a fire engine sprayed water on the metal to keep it from collapsing.  ""I've never ever seen a fire of this magnitude,"" said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings, a 31-year veteran of the force. ""It's devastating, heartbreaking.""  Investigators think the fire started about 9 a.m. Thursday in a trailer used to spray insulation into the building's walls, Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said.  The chief said they aren't sure exactly what set off the blaze and haven't been able to do a thorough investigation of the trailer.  ""Obviously, the building's still in a state where it is not safe for all of our members to go in,"" Johnson said.  The massive fire sent huge red flames and dense black smoke into the sky. At least two small crews of firefighters had to make mayday calls and be rescued from the fast-moving blaze, including one who could hear the cries of the trapped people on the sixth floor but couldn't see them through the smoke, Johnson said.  ""They were going by sound, trying to get to them but were unable to get to them before conditions changed,"" Johnson said. ""They had to call a mayday.""  The firefighters did rescue 15 workers inside the building, including the crane operator. Firefighters delivered protective clothing to him until he could climb down to safety, Johnson said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2NoYXJsb3R0ZS1maXJlLXR3by1wZW9wbGUta2lsbGVkLXNvdXRocGFyay1tYWxsLzEzMjc2MzMyL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2FtcC9jaGFybG90dGUtZmlyZS10d28tcGVvcGxlLWtpbGxlZC1zb3V0aHBhcmstbWFsbC8xMzI3NjMzMi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ball reports that the Plainville Fire Department has extinguished a 2-alarm fire at a YMCA pool clubhouse Saturday night.  The clubhouse building, at the YMCA Family Pool Club at Park Terrace located at 5 Berry St., was a total loss. The building was under renovation and is a popular swimming spot for local residents and families.  At approximately 5 p.m., Plainville Fire responded to 5 Berry St. for a report of a structure fire. Upon arrival, there was heavy fire showing from the clubhouse building.  Chief Ball struck a second alarm to activate mutual aid from surrounding communities to help put out the flames. Firefighters from North Attleborough, Wrentham, Norfolk, Foxborough and Cumberland, Rhode Island, arrived on scene, in addition to ambulances from Walpole and Mansfield.  Plainville Fire used multiple tanker trucks and ran hydrant lines to help put out the flames. It took approximately an hour-and-a-half to fully knock down the fire. Crews are currently overhauling the scene. There were no injuries reported.  The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Plainville Fire Department and State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s Office.  “The pool club is a beloved community gathering spot for many families here in Plainville during the summertime,” Chief Ball said. “Thankfully no one was hurt, but it’s very unfortunate that the fire resulted in a total loss of the building.”  ###","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vamdwci5uZXQvMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9wbGFpbnZpbGxlLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1leHRpbmd1aXNoZXMtMi1hbGFybS1maXJlLWF0LXltY2EtcG9vbC1jbHViaG91c2Uv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9qZ3ByLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3BsYWludmlsbGUtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWV4dGluZ3Vpc2hlcy0yLWFsYXJtLWZpcmUtYXQteW1jYS1wb29sLWNsdWJob3VzZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cause of the fire is suspected to be a heating lamp being used to warm baby chicks, firefighters said. No injuries were reported.  At approximately 4:10 a.m. Saturday, Columbus firefighters responded to 2676 Central Ave. after one of the home’s occupants awoke to an odor of smoke within the single family home, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  A female occupant told firefighters that the smell of smoke led to the discovery of a small fire located within an enclosed breezeway leading from the home to the garage. When firefighters arrived, they found the home had been evacuated but flames had grown to the point of engulfing the breezeway in flames with fire extending into the residence, Wilson said.  Firefighters attacked the fire from the exterior of the home before transitioning into the interior. As crews battled flames, additional firefighters conducted a search of the home. Firefighters located a cat inside the home and removed the pet to the exterior of the home. Firefighters said the cat ran to a neighboring yard and appeared to be unharmed. The interior search concluded the home was clear of occupants. Firefighters battled the flames from approximately 30 minutes before the fire was marked under control, Wilson said.  Homeowner Diana McGrady told firefighters that she was sleeping, when her niece woke her up to report that the home was on fire, Wilson said. She and her niece quickly escaped the home and called 9-1-1. McGrady told firefighters that in the area where the fire was located, there were baby chickens that were situated under a heating lamp.  Columbus Fire Department investigators believe an extension cord was used to power the heating lamp. As firefighters and investigators worked at the scene, McGrady and her niece escaped a light rain after Columbus Police Department officers offered a patrol car as refuge from the elements.  Firefighters collected a few salvageable items from the home including shoes, shirts and pants, as the occupants had escaped with only the clothing they were wearing. Firefighters also located a cell phone and two pairs of reading glasses from within the heavily-damaged home. Firefighters believe the home and contents may be considered a total loss estimated at approximately $200,000, Wilson said. McGrady told firefighters that the home is insured.  Due to the damage, the family was displaced and is being assisted by the Salvation Army. The fire investigation is ongoing at this time.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include Duke Energy, CenterPoint Energy, Columbus City Utilities, Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2NlbnRyYWwtYXZlbnVlLWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWJ5LWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Video: The Washington Post)  Listen 5 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  First Shell, then Marathon, then Valero. In the last three weeks, major fires have broken out at these companies’ oil refineries and chemical plants in East Texas, leaving one dead and over a dozen injured. Want to know how your actions can help make a difference for our planet? Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter, in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday. ArrowRight The blazes in Deer Park, Galveston Bay and Corpus Christi follow a years-long string of explosions, fires and toxic releases in a region where oil refining and chemical production is highly concentrated, often close to residential neighborhoods. And while some residents have grown accustomed to the incidents, others are alarmed by how frequently they are hitting home.  “I have grown up here and watched neighborhoods near the refineries become too toxic to live in and people forced to leave their homes due to the toxicity,” Kristina Land, a resident of Corpus Christi, told The Washington Post.  On Wednesday, a fire broke out at the Valero West Refinery in Corpus Christi, sending smoke plumes into the sky and prompting emergency responders to mobilize. The cause of the fire is yet unknown.  Land, who is 45 years old, was in her home 20 miles from the refinery when she saw the black smoke on the horizon. She had to go on social media to find out what was happening.  Advertisement  She blames local officials for not encouraging more transparency.  “Our local government doesn’t ever want us to know how bad [the fires] really are, so we never truly know,” Land said. “They just sweep everything under the rug and never talk about it again.”  Refineries in the Lone Star State are regulated by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which did not make officials available for an interview, but issued a statement.  Victoria Cann, a media specialist for TCEQ, said the three recent fires appear to be unrelated, “but investigations are underway into the cause, response, and clean up actions associated with each incident.”  She said the agency responded to each of them by deploying staff with monitoring equipment as appropriate and has “conducted surveillance to assess potential impacts to the local community.”  Advertisement  The first of the May refinery fires happened two weeks ago.  On May 5, heavy gas oil, gasoline and light gas oil ignited at Shell’s Deer Park chemicals facility in Deer Park, which sent 9 workers to the hospital. The plume from the fire, which occurred right outside of Houston, was visible for miles.  The fire, which started at 2:59 p.m., blazed on and off for days — after being reignited multiple times — before crews could completely neutralize it nearly three days later.  Emergency crews responded to the fire less than 19 hours after the TCEQ hosted a hearing to expand the Intercontinental Terminal Plant — a plant near Shell which blanketed the area with high levels of benzene, a chemical linked to cancer, in 2019.  Environmentalists say the accidents keep happening because the oil industry has little fear of penalties from regulators.  Advertisement  “Without a change from industry … communities are going to continue to feel the effects of these chemicals being spewed out by these facilities,” said Cassandra Casados, the communications coordinator at Air Alliance Houston.  A week after Shell’s fire was contained, a new plant fire erupted in Texas City, under 40 miles away, erupted. Galveston’s Marathon Petroleum confirmed that the fire caused the death of one employee and sent two others to the hospital. Emergency crews extinguished the fire — caused by a failed pump seal — in under four hours, according to city officials.  This is the second fatal incident to occur at Marathon’s Galveston Bay refinery this year. In March, a contract worker died after being electrocuted at the refinery.  Air monitoring at the state and facility level for all three sites is ongoing to determine the exposure risks to harmful levels of chemicals. Officials at the refineries and in nearby communities said the fires were not cause for concern:  Advertisement  “There is no danger to the nearby community,” Shell Deer Park said in a post following the incident.  Texas City Emergency Management stated that there was no need for a shelter in place following the fatal fire and that there was no threat to residents.  Valero’s west refinery did not warrant any “action from the community,” the city of Corpus Christi said in a news release.  Over the last several years, the Environmental Integrity Project — a D.C. based watchdog group — has monitored refinery fires and emissions, in East Texas and elsewhere. Too often, local officials minimize the impact of these incidents and issue “all is well statements,” said Eric Schaeffer, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who directs the watchdog group.  Black plume smoke is usually indicative that fine particulate matter — too small to see generally — is lingering in the air, according to Schaeffer. When refineries catch fire, the chemicals from the plumes aren’t contained to the site: They drift into residential areas.  “You’re going to have a lot of pollutants released,” Schaeffer said of these incidents. “That’s probably the biggest concern for the residents.”  GiftOutline Gift Article","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9jbGltYXRlLWVudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvcmVmaW5lcnktZmlyZXMtZWFzdC10ZXhhcy1wb2xsdXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Keep people safe.”  Since 2020, Jessy has helped with fire drills and completed monthly inspections of fire extinguishers at the school. On Thursday, May 18, the school and local fire agencies hosted a special ceremony to thank Jessy for his work, allowing him to deploy several fire extinguishers on an active fire in a burn barrel behind the school.  “That really made my day,” Jessy said as a smile spread across his face.  A cloud forms as Jessy Dorton uses a fire extinguisher to put out a flame in a burn barrel at Summit High School on Thursday, May 18, 2023. Local leaders organized the demonstration as a way to say thank you to Jessy, who has helped promote fire safety at Summit School District and beyond.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  Surrounded by friends, school employees and fire officials, Jessy wore a firefighter’s protective gear, complete with the signature firefighter helmet, as he sprayed the extinguishers on the flames.  “‘P’ you pull the pin out, and it breaks the seal,” Jessy said. “‘A’ is for ‘Aim at the base.’ You squeeze the handle, and then you sweep at the base, not the flame. That’s what you do. So the acronym is PASS: Pull, Aim, Squeeze and Sweep.”  Now, Jessy said, he’s prepared if there is ever a real life situation where he might have to use a fire extinguisher.  “Grab the nearest one and — boom! I’m going to be right on it,” he said.  Jessy — who is also involved with the Special Olympics and is a strong athlete in skiing, track, bowling and golf — has been deeply interested in fire safety and fire extinguishers for most of his life, according to his grandfather, Chris Dorton.  At home, Jessy has a collection of about 20 fire extinguishers and, almost no matter where he goes, he’s on the lookout to make sure the fire extinguishers are up to date and in working order, Dorton said. Once, Jessy found an expired extinguisher at the middle school and, another time on a vacation, he discovered an empty fire extinguisher at a hotel that the local fire inspector had just inspected, his grandfather said.  “He’s got a sharp eye,” Dorton said, adding, “People on the spectrum often have grand obsessions.”  Dorton noted the Netflix series “Atypical,” a heartfelt comedy that follows Sam, a teenager on the autism spectrum who has decided he is ready for romance. In the TV show, Sam’s obsession is penguins, Dorton said. For Jessy, it is fire extinguishers and fire safety.  Jessy Dorton smiles and begins to give a thumbs up to a crowd that gathered to celebrate him and the work he’s done for fire safety across Summit School District. Officials organized a demonstration to allow Jessy to use a fire extinguisher to put out a controlled flame at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  Kelly Finley, a counselor at the high school, said that as students returned to the classroom after the COVID-19 pandemic, Jessy was apprehensive about coming back and wanted to make sure that everything was safe. So the school got him involved with Brandon Smith, the district’s safety and security manager.  “He absolutely can tell you everything you need to know about fire safety,” Finley said. “How to use a fire extinguisher properly. How to evacuate properly. How to have a plan. He could be a spokesperson for Red, White & Blue or Summit Fire (& EMS).”  Every month, Jessy would inspect the fire extinguishers at the high school with Smith. Since December, Jessy has taken on more responsibility and has started inspecting the fire extinguishers himself. He even gets to pull the fire alarm during fire drills.  “He’s my safety buddy for sure. It’s been a lot of fun,” Smith said. “This year, I kind of gave him the freedom when he has time in school to check (extinguishers) on his own, and then I come by and take a look. He does a great job. He does it exactly as it should be. Checks everything all the time. Sometimes he checks them twice.”  Summit County Sheriff’s Office School resource officer Patrick Finley said, “Jessy is awesome.”  Jessy Dorton stands with fire, law enforcement and school officials after successfully putting out a controlled fire with an extinguisher at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  “He’s such a visible presence in the school. He’s such a great, likeable person. He loves to talk with us, and he educates me on fire extinguishers,” Finley said.  “Hopefully we can build a relationship between Summit Fire and Red, White & Blue so that when he does get out of school, they can find him something that he can help out with,” he added.  After a day deploying fire extinguishers, riding in an ambulance and a fire truck, and showing off his fire safety skills in front of his friends and peers, Jessy said he now wants to share his knowledge of fire safety with the community.  Every home should be equipped with smoke detectors, carbon monoxide alarms and home fire extinguishers, according to Red, White & Blue Fire Inspector Will Newton. As Jessy will tell anyone who asks, Class ABC fire extinguishers are best for at home.  Those portable fire extinguishers work well when the fire is confined to a small area, such as a wastebasket, and is not growing, Newtown said. Extinguishers should be used once everyone else has left the building, the fire department has been called and only if the room is not filled with smoke, he said.  Jessy added that it is important to know where the nearest fire extinguisher is and for families to have an escape plan and designated meeting area outside the house that everyone knows.  Jessy Dorton prepares to use a fire extinguisher during a demonstration at Summit High School on May 18, 2023.  Andrew Maciejewski/Summit Daily News  “If it’s a real life situation — you have a little fire and you need to use (an extinguisher),” Jessy said. “You would have someone call 911, pull the fire alarm and then I would have adult supervision with me using the extinguisher.”  But fire extinguishers can only do so much, so it is important to get out early if the flames get too big, Jessy said. Keep fire extinguishers close to an exit and keep your back to a clear exit while deploying it for an easy escape, if the fire cannot be controlled.  “If the fire is too big, you would close the door behind you, get everyone out safely,” Jessy added, “then still call 911 and have someone activate the alarm system and let’s get out of there.”  It’s best to know how to use a fire extinguisher ahead of time, in order to be prepared to use it in an emergency, Jessy said. Every year, families should review their fire plans, test fire alarms and check that fire extinguishers are up to date and in working condition, he said.  But the most important thing is always to stay safe, Jessy said. If fire alarms are going off, he said, “You just get out.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW1taXRkYWlseS5jb20vbmV3cy9zdW1taXQtY291bnR5cy1qZXNzeS1kb3J0b24ta25vd3MtaG93LXRvLXJlc3BvbmQtaWYtdGhlcmVzLWEtZmlyZS1hbmQtaGUtd2FudHMtdG8tc2hhcmUtaGlzLWZpcmUtc2FmZXR5LWtub3dsZWRnZS13aXRoLXRoZS1jb21tdW5pdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Video from a building in the 200 block of New Dorwart street shows the car swerving left and right in front of a gold van headed southeast on New Dorwart Street toward the intersection of Saint Joseph Street at 3:55 p.m. After swerving in front of the van multiple times, the driver of the car steps out, pulls a handgun from their waistband and fires at least four bullets into the driver side of the van.  The van begins backing up the one-way street, unable to swerve around the car, while the gunman, of slender build and wearing a black hoodie and sweatpants, begins running east on New Dorwart. At one point, the handgun falls from the gunman’s pants, but they pick it up and keep running before meeting back up with the red car, now driven by a passenger who was in the car. The car turns north on what appears to be either Poplar or South Arch Street.  The driver of the van, who is believed to be in his 50s, traveled to a hospital. According to city police Chief Richard Mendez, the man did not have life-threatening injuries.  Multiple witnesses appear on the video footage, including a girl with a backpack running from the scene. City police are investigating and do not yet have anyone in custody.  The crime scene Thursday had many yellow evidence markers on the road. Another resident in the neighborhood said two parked cars had been struck by bullets as well.

"fire","2023-07-28","Not Discerned","{""George"", ""WesternCape"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-20T01:40:36","ST. GEORGE — Bees from a local honey company came dangerously close to going up in smoke as a truck caught fire Friday in a field that houses the bees.  St. George Fire Capt. John Taylor said they were quickly called to the fire and found a Mazda truck engulfed near the hives in a dry field on West Monterey Drive.  “There was a single vehicle on fire, fully engulfed near the beehives, and we had some exposures with the grass and next to this wash right here as well,” Taylor said. “We made an initial attack pass attack, and we used foam and that knocked to out pretty quick.”  Taylor said firefighters were able to protect the beehives, field and wash from catching on fire. The cause of the fire is unknown at this time, he said.  The owner of the bees, Melvin Taylor, said he feels fortunate that only two days prior, he had received permission from the city of St. George to have a controlled burn. Otherwise, he said he could have lost so much more. All of his 100 hives appeared to be spared.  “So by my truck sitting where it was, we got enough water on it before the fire department got here,” Melvin Taylor said. “And if the weeds hadn’t been burned a couple of days ago, the whole thing would have just went up. The St. George Fire Department has been good to me.”  At almost 75 years old, he started his Taylor Honey business in Santa Clara, Utah, when he was 14. Currently, his son Jared and his grandson help out with the company. Taylor Honey works with local farmers like Sterling’s Fruit and Vegetables and Frei’s Fruit Market.  According to their Facebook page, Taylor Honey also assists Stehli Farms to help educate school children about bees and beekeeping.  Video submitted by Matt Yourglich.

"fire","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Florence"", ""Toscana"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-20T00:09:16","NORTHAMPTON — The city’s fire chief, Jon Davine, has ordered the Bombyx Center for Arts & Equity to cease all its indoor music events until an automatic sprinkler system is installed in the center’s sanctuary, where concerts are held.  The order comes a week after the department’s fire prevention officer, Capt. Mark Curtin, came to the Florence center unannounced and, after inspecting the sanctuary, told Bombyx Executive Director Cassandra Holden he was ordering all indoor music events immediately shut down.  According to a letter that Davine sent Friday to Holden, Curtin, who was accompanied by Kevin Ross from the city’s Building Department, came in response to “noise complaints from neighboring properties.”  Davine said an inspection of the sanctuary and a review of aspects of live music presentations, such as the occasional sale of alcohol, led him to determine that Bombyx is considered a nightclub — and as such must have an automatic sprinkler system in place for safety reasons, under a state law known as Section 26G ½.  In his letter, Davine said he is prohibiting all events “that constitute a nightclub, dance hall, discotheque, bar or similar entertainment purposes inside the premises” until a sprinkler system is installed and then inspected by the Fire Department.  Davine’s order followed a meeting Thursday between Holden and other Bombyx staff with officials from a number of city departments. Alan Wolf, chief of staff for Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra, characterized that meeting both as an effort to determine if Bombyx was operating safely and to find a way for Holden “to be able to keep doing what she’s been doing.”  “We all want [Bombyx] to succeed,” Wolf said.  In the letter Davine sent to Bombyx officials, the fire chief’ noted his decision can be appealed to the Massachusetts Fire Safety Commission and Automatic Sprinkler Appeals Board.  Thursday’s meeting also followed a tumultuous week for Bombyx staff, who in an interview with the Gazette, and in a letter they sent to city officials, said they were bewildered by Curtin’s order because they had previously shared all their plans with city building inspector Jonathan Flagg and city planner Carolyn Misch — both of whom had approved what they’d done, Bombyx said.  In an email Friday to the Gazette, Holden wrote that after getting Davine’s “cease and desist” order, she and other staff are “Talking with our lawyer later this afternoon. Mapping out a path forward. We can share something this evening or tomorrow morning.”  The Bombyx Center is located in Florence’s historic Congregational Church, whose parishioners continue to use the sanctuary. The center is also home to the Beit Ahavah Reform Synagogue and the Cloverdale Preschool, while numerous other local groups, such as the Young@Heart Chorus, use the facility on a regular basis.  Since taking over management of the property in the fall of 2021, the Bombyx Center, a nonprofit group, has also opened the facility for art exhibits, public talks, educational workshops and other events, including private functions such as memorial services.  At the same time, especially since the worst of the pandemic ended in late winter 2022, Bombyx has become an important part of the local music scene, offering concerts most weekends and during the week that range from jazz to folk to blues to classical music, as well as a variety of international music.  Just in the coming week, the center has shows scheduled for this weekend and May 26-27 that will need to be moved or postponed; some might be able to move outdoors to the center’s lawn. Tonight’s (May 20) show, by indie pop musician Brian Fennell, who performs under the name SYML, has been moved to Race Street Live at Gateway City Arts in Holyoke, and the May 21 concert, by the classical music ensemble Balourdet Quartet, has been shifted to St. John’s Episcopal Church in Northampton.  A two-day music event called “Collider! Fest” that had been scheduled for Bombyx May 12-13 was canceled last week following the initial shutdown order from Curtin.  Earlier this week, Bombyx staff told the Gazette they view their operation as more akin to 33 Hawley, the downtown space operated by the Northampton Community Arts Trust. “We’re a community arts and cultural center that also hosts live music,” said Elizabeth Dunaway, head of Bombyx’s board of directors. “We’re not a nightclub.”  However, Davine cited audiences of over 300 people at some Bombyx concerts, and wheels added to church pews that enable some of them to be moved to allow space for dancing, as factors that do make the center fall under the definition of a nightclub.  Yet Wolf acknowledged a strange discrepancy in the state’s laws that exempts religious institutions from needing sprinklers. Under that standard, he agreed, 300 parishioners could be in the Bombyx sanctuary, a choir could be singing with accompaniment by a string quartet, and they’d be in compliance with the law.  In a statement, Sciarra said the safety of people attending events in Northampton “is of utmost importance,” and as such she agreed with the fire chief’s decision.  And while praising Bombyx for its programming, the mayor said the center’s responsibility was “to adhere to all safety codes … and it appears that city regulators and Bombyx’s own consultants informed them about the necessity of fire safety equipment to function as a music venue.”  However, Sciarra also said she wants to help the center finance the installation of a sprinkler system, in part by allowing them to repurpose a $79,000 city grant that Bombyx received for other renovations.  Wolf said the center may also be able to tap some Community Preservation Act funds in the city for a sprinkler system, since the Florence church is a historic building that dates to the 1860s.  There will be some additional meetings next week, Wolf added, between fire and building departments to review state laws and codes to try and get a better sense of what activities can take place at the center.

After dropping three straight in MLS, Atlanta United bounced back and dominated Colorado Rapids 4-0 at home behind four different goal scorers. The performance landed Brooks Lennon and Luiz Araújo on the midweek MLS Team of the Matchday. Meanwhile, Chicago Fire went on the road to Bank of America Stadium on Wednesday. The Fire held a 1-0 halftime lead only to concede twice in the second half and fall to a confident Charlotte FC.  Series History and Last Meeting  Atlanta United leads the series with a 7-4-1 all-time record against Chicago in MLS regular season play. Last time these two teams faced each other was just a few weeks ago for the One Planet match on April 23. Atlanta United held a 1-0 lead for most of the match, then gave up a goal in the 90th minute. It looked like the match was headed toward a draw until an own goal from Chicago tilted the result Atlanta's way 2-1. Chicago had a different coach then (the Fire parted ways with Ezra Hendrickson on May 8) and are now managed by Frank Klopas.  Players To Watch  Brooks Lennon (Atlanta United) – His name wasn't on the score sheet Wednesday in Atlanta United's 4-0 win over Colorado Rapids, but the fullback played a part in a major way. Lennon contributed to two of Atlanta's four goals on the night, the third multi-assist game of his career, an effort the league rewarded by naming him to the MLS Team of the Matchday. Lennon ranks second on the team in assists (6) and second in MLS in chances created (32) behind only his teammate Thiago Almada.  Kacper Przybyłko (Chicago Fire) – The lone goal scorer for Chicago Fire in the last meeting between these two sides is a guy Atlanta United will want to keep an eye on. He's scored six goals in seven career matches against Atlanta in all competitions, equaling his most against any opponent. Hany Mukhtar and of Nashville SC and Luciano Acosta of FC Cincinnati are the only active MLS players to score more career goals on the 5-Stripes.  Atlanta United head coach Gonzalo Pineda on Chicago Fire:  ""Since the last time we faced them, I think we have to be way better. I think the movement of the ball was very slow with too many touches.

"fire","1923-03-20","Not Discerned","{""WestUnion"", ""Iowa"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:01:49","Town officials hosted NextEra company brass, NYS Department of Public Service  By Andrew Harris  A second public meeting that focused on the March 2023 wind turbine fire in the Town of West Union wasn’t as heavily attended or as contentious as the first. The little town hall was nonetheless still full of residents who were curious, disgruntled, impacted, and worried about the aftermath from the fire.  About a dozen landowners attended the regular monthly meeting of the town board, three representatives from NextEra Energy, and a representative from the New York State Department of Public Service(DPS.) Landowners were there for an update on the clean up effort from the fire, NextEra was there to update and answer questions (as best they could.) The DPS ecologist was on hand to answer questions from the regulatory perspective, mostly questions about agricultural cleanup from the fire, but also lots of questions about noise pollution from the wind turbines.  After Town Supervisor Randy Heckman finished running through the standard town board meeting business, he opened the floor to NextEra which owns and operates the Eight Point wind farm.  Company officials explained that the process of cleaning up debris from the fire was about three weeks from completion. They also announced that the entire tower would be taken down early next week with a controlled demolition.  This raised some questions about why, when, and with what means. NextEra explained that because the tower was four hundred feet tall, simply replacing the turbine was not practical. The company plans to drop the massive tower early in the week of May 21 but indicated the event would not be publicly announced for safety concerns. Local fire departments will be notified and a large horn will be blasted in the minutes before the demolition.  Explosive charges will be used to drop the tower and NextEra intends to have that wreckage removed within the aforementioned three-week timeframe. If the demolition causes damage to the land, NextEra explained they would remediate and repair such damages. The main concern being oil and due to structural and safety concerns, the company can’t be sure that all the oil in the unit burned off during the fire.  NextEra revealed some of the details of the fire, details that make this not just a rare event in general, but one full of happenstance.  According to NextEra, the turbine was not operating at the time of the fire and two maintenance workers were doing work inside the structure at the time of the fire. Those employees were able to safely vacate the structure according to the company. While the unspecified cause seemed to be electrical, the company said that no investigation into potential arson or criminal activity has been conducted. They also stated that the fire was not caused by the maintenance work being done when the fire started, it was caused by a random electrical issue.  Another interesting point that NextEra explained was that the undetermined cause, was located in the base of the structure, not in the turbine that burned. This massive wind turbine caught fire while it was non-operational, because of a electrical issue housed in the base of the tower. The NextEra representatives were very honest about their lack of technical expertise and directed all detailed questions to the number provided to find the proper NextEra department(see below.) .  Concerning the nature of the debris which fell from the burning tower, which was blown over a mile away by the wind, NextEra reported that laboratory analysis was complete. That analysis stated that the material, even after being burnt, was non-toxic to humans and may simply cause minor skin irritation if handled, just like house insulation. After a question from the residents, NextEra admitted that no analysis was done to confirm if the material is toxic to livestock. Many of the concerns about the fallout are from farmers who are concerned about future land quality, feed/hay contamination, animal health, and economic losses.  Residents asked if the destroyed tower and turbine would be replaced and NextEra confirmed that a new wind turbine structure would be installed on the same site in the future. When pressed about the root cause of the fire, and the potential for more fires, NextEra stated that they had isolated the component that wasn’t working properly and tested that component in all the other turbines in West Union. NextEra reported that all other turbines were working normally and that the incident remains a, “rare and random” event.  Since the April town board meeting, NextEra has had staffing changes and has consolidated all of the previously provided phone numbers into one. If residents, landowners, or farmers have questions or need to file a claim for damages with NextEra call this number:  607 661 4369  The New York State Ecologist from the Department of Public Service was on hand to explain to residents and landowners how to provide documentation to the state regarding the incident. A dedicated website is and has been available as a resource, a place to make a complaint, and read all the documents related to the “Five Point Wind” farm in West Union. Here is a link to that site.  https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/MatterManagement/CaseMaster.aspx?MatterCaseNo=16-F-0062  The DPS Ecologist also spent a large amount of time talking about another major issue with the wind farm in West Union: Noise pollution from the wind turbines.  That is another story for another day. Clearly the noise from the wind turbines has had a serious impact, perhaps even more of an impact than the fire.

Make fire safety a top priority when working in the yard, riding all-terrain vehicles or building an evening bonfire.  “Humidity is low, so the environment is drying out fast,” , said Jeff Vasher, fire specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. “A fire can take off with very little warning in these kinds of conditions, especially if it’s windy at all.”  Before burning yard debris or lighting any fire, check Michigan.gov/BurnPermit to make sure weather conditions allow for safe burning.  People cause most wildfires  Nine out of 10 wildland fires are caused by people, and yard waste burning is the top cause of wildfires in Michigan.  Here are tips to keep your outdoor activities fire-safe:  – Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  – Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  – Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  – Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  – Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.  – It’s illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  – Use a burn barrel with a screen on top to burn paper, leaves and natural materials.

The children - 5-year-old Addyson and 7-year-old Alijah - were both moved overnight from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to the Hamilton County morgue, coroner’s officials say.  Cincinnati firefighters pulled the girl and boy out of the second story of the burning apartment on Strand Lane in Winton Hills early the morning of Thursday, May 11.  The cause of the fire remains under investigation, a city spokeswoman said Friday.  “Our entire community mourns for Alijah and Addyson, their families and loved ones, and all of Winton Hills in the wake of this unfathomable tragedy,” Mayor Aftab Pureval said in a statement to FOX19 NOW.  “I want to thank our Cincinnati Fire Department and first responders for their bravery under incredibly difficult circumstances, and I know this loss is deeply felt throughout the city.”  Four children in all and their mother were inside when flames broke out. The mother and two of the children self-evacuated but Alijah and Addyson were trapped upstairs, according to the fire department.  When crews arrived, they found “heavy fire blowing out the front first-floor windows of an end unit two-story townhouse,” according to a fire department news release.  Firefighters “initiated a rapid attack on the fire with handlines on the first floor while simultaneously advancing crews to the second floor to search for the reported children.

[GoFundME created to help family from apartment fire]  The children’s grandmother’s Go Fund Me post indicates it is accidental.  “The fire started when one of the children plugged up their laptop, and the fuse blew, we are assuming this is an electrical fire,” the Go Fund Me post states. “They have lost everything. I want to thank CFD for rescuing my grandkids - when everyone is trying to get out of a burning building, you courageously go in, and there’s not a thank you big enough to express my gratitude.  “I want to thank Winton Hill Academy staff for your donations and for coming to assist my family at the Cincinnati hospital and Columbus hospital.

Dr. Weber had been keeping patients updated on his Facebook page and as of February announced that the new office was nearly complete.  It is now fully operational.  Robbins, who owns Barrett Printing and Local Awards — two businesses that were inside Flagler Center — also moved his operation to 913 Eaton St., the home of Southernmost Signs.  “I bought Southernmost Signs, which is still in its same location at 913 Eaton St.,” he said. “But I also moved the other two businesses to that location and are up and running.”  Many of the businesses destroyed by a fire at Flagler Center in September 2022 have reopened in new locations, or their staff is working remotely. An architect has been hired to begin the rebuild. MANDY MILES/Keys Weekly  Robbins added that employees of Barnes Alarms are working from home, as are most staff of Ward & Meyers accounting firm, although they have rented a small office at 3706 N Roosevelt Blvd., in the plaza next to McDonald’s, Robbins said.  “Curry Printing is still in business and handling jobs out of their homes and in conjunction with their son’s printing business out of town,” Robbins said. “Island Refrigeration moved into the old Dion’s corporate offices at 638 United St., and Melissa Munoz of Bone Island Chiropractic is sharing office space with fellow chiropractor Steve Oropeza in Luani Plaza on Kennedy Drive.”  The cause of the fire was undetermined, but is thought to have started in a “chaseway,” or area between the two floors that contains miles of electrical wiring, Robbins said.  The damage is estimated to be $12.8 million, according to reports from the Key West Fire Department and fire and insurance investigators.  The fire started before dawn on Sept. 28, while Hurricane Ian fanned the flames with 50 mph winds and flooded nearby roads.  “High hurricane force winds quickly spread the fire from west to east, through the utility chase that ran the entire length of the structure,” wrote Key West Fire Department shift commander David Zarate in his report. “Once the roof began to show distortion and the eaves began to sag, I changed from offense to defense and ordered all (firefighting) personnel out of the structure.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va2V5c3dlZWtseS5jb20vNDIvZmxhZ2xlci1jZW50ZXItbW92ZXMtYWhlYWQtd2l0aC1yZWJ1aWxkLWFmdGVyLWZpcmUtZGlzcGxhY2VkLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtZmluZC1uZXctbG9jYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

That pad, at SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas, took a beating during the first-ever test flight of a fully stacked Starship vehicle — the most powerful rocket ever built — on April 20.  The immense power of Starship's 33 first-stage Raptor engines blasted out a crater beneath the pad that day, sending chunks of broken concrete flying through the dusty air.  Related: Relive SpaceX's explosive 1st Starship launch in incredible photos  SpaceX blasts a water-cooled steel plate with a Raptor engine in this still from a video that the company posted on Twitter on May 19, 2023. The plate technology is being developed to strengthen the ground beneath SpaceX's Starship orbital launch mount in South Texas. (Image credit: SpaceX via Twitter)  A day after the highly anticipated test flight, Elon Musk tweeted that SpaceX was already working on a way to prevent or minimize such damage — ""a massive water-cooled, steel plate to go under the launch mount.""  Such efforts had begun three months prior, the billionaire entrepreneur said. The plate system wasn't ready in time for the April 20 launch, but SpaceX went ahead with it anyway, assuming that the concrete beneath Starship would survive a single liftoff. That turned out not to be the case, as we saw on April 20.  The steel-plate work has continued apace since then. Indeed, the company recently tested a prototype plate against the power of a single Raptor.  SpaceX tweeted out a 20-second video of the test on Friday (May 19). When the steam clears at the end of the clip, the plate appears to still be in one piece — no mean feat, considering what it was up against.  ""One hell of a plasma beam!"" Musk tweeted on Friday, in a reply to the SpaceX tweet.  One hell of a plasma beam! https://t.co/y8uOTeFlsDMay 19, 2023 See more  SpaceX is developing Starship to launch astronauts to the moon and Mars, and to take over most, if not all, of the company's spaceflight portfolio down the road. NASA is a believer in the vehicle, choosing it as the first crewed lunar lander for its Artemis moon program.  The April 20 test flight aimed to send Starship's upper stage most of the way around Earth, culminating in a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. That didn't happen, however; the vehicle's two stages failed to separate as planned, and SpaceX ordered the prototype to self-destruct high over the Gulf of Mexico a few minutes after liftoff.  SpaceX is building multiple Starship vehicles at Starbase and aims to launch the next one soon. Musk said recently that the next Starship flight could occur within the next month or two — provided the steel-plate system is ready by then and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration greenlights the mission.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9zcGFjZXgtc3RhcnNoaXAtc3RlZWwtcGxhdGUtcm9ja2V0LWZpcmUtdmlkZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

James Roger Carpenter Jr., 54, sought judicial diversion in the case as an alternative to jail at a hearing in April, when prosecutors deferred to Circuit Court Judge Andrew Freiberg on what Carpenter's punishment should be, according to court documents. Freiberg denied Carpenter's motion for diversion and handed down the sentence earlier this month.  On Feb. 10, 2022, authorities were dispatched to Little Lambs on Waterlevel Highway at 11:41 a.m. on a report of a fire. Twenty-seven children and four staff members were moved to a nearby building, authorities said at the time in a news release. There were no injuries in the fire.  While first responders were getting the children out of the day care, they noticed open beer containers in a room at the facility, authorities said. When they questioned Carpenter, he told authorities he had multiple alcoholic beverages while working at the center that day, according to the release.  Carpenter was arrested and charged with child neglect, but when the case came before General Sessions Judge Sheridan Randolph, the charges were dismissed because the day care was ""not in custody"" of the children, officials said at the time.  District Attorney Stephen Crump presented the case to the Bradley County grand jury, and new charges were issued against Carpenter in an indictment containing 27 counts of reckless endangerment and one count of reckless burning, the Chattanooga Times Free Press previously reported.  According to court records, Carpenter admitted to drinking beer and small ""airplane"" bottles of liquor while he was in charge of the children, and to smoking in the day care in the area where the fire started. Freiberg in his May 11 ruling found Carpenter was impaired and said he had a history of criminal convictions and criminal behavior.  Carpenter's actions placed the 27 children at the day care at serious risk of bodily injury or death, Freiberg ruled in issuing the three-month sentence.  According to court documents, Carpenter is to report May 28 to the Bradley County Jail and will be given credit for the time he spent in jail in February and April of 2022 while being held.

That cloud dropped from firefighting aircraft is a fire retardant called PHOS-CHEK, a sign of relief for firefighters trying to increase containment lines on the ground. The widely used chemical that helps slow the spread of flames is produced at a factory in Rancho Cucamonga east of Los Angeles.  PHOS-CHEK essentially turns dry brush and other fire fuels into something non-flammable.  But why is it pink?  Get Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.  ""We tested every color in the rainbow, and the pink was by far the most visible. And, it's pretty,"" said Melissa Kim, vice president of research and development at Perimeter Solutions.  The bright color allows firefighters to see where the PHOS-CHECK has been dropped and where it hasn't. Ground crew can then create fire lines around it, potentially saving lives and property.  ""If you can't see it, then it's essentially not effective,"" Kim said. ""The purpose is they're flying in high smoke, low visibility with winds. The pilots have to get it right the first time. This job doesn't offer many second chances.""  A resident near the San Bernardino County community of Highland captured this dramatic view of a fire retardant drop from a firefighting air tanker as it soared over the Mart fire. The tanker flies behind a spotter plane before dropping its payload of red Phos-Chek, a fire retardant, to slow the fire's spread. The Mart fire broke out Tuesday June 27, 2017.  The product was created about 60 years ago. The recipe is a guard secret, but the main ingredient is phostphate, basically fertilizer that can be stored for many years. The phosphates react with vegetation to prevent it from catching fire.  The recipe has gone through some changes, including a formula that won't leave a permanent stain on hillsides, homes and cars.  The Rancho Cucamonga company produces PHOS-CHEK as a powder that's then delivered anywhere around the world. The urgent nature of wildfires means shipments of the 2,000-pound bags must be ready to go.  Sacks of PHOS-CHEK ready for shipment at Perimeter Solutions in Rancho Cucamonga. Credit: NBCLA  ""We are an emergency response business, so when we get an order we ship within hours,"" said Oscar Sanchez, who has worked at Perimeter Solutions for 25 years. ""So we are always on alert, always on call 24-7.""  After the sacks are delivered, to air attack bases, the powder is mixed with water and loaded into firefighting aircraft.  ""So all the aircraft you see dropping retardant, this is what they're dropping,"" Sanchez said. ""It does give us a sense of pride because it was a lot of hard work to get there.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2xvc2FuZ2VsZXMuY29tL25ld3MvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS13aWxkZmlyZXMvcGhvcy1jaGVrLWZhY3RvcnktcmFuY2hvLWN1Y2Ftb25nYS1maXJlLzMxNTY1MDQv0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbG9zYW5nZWxlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXdpbGRmaXJlcy9waG9zLWNoZWstZmFjdG9yeS1yYW5jaG8tY3VjYW1vbmdhLWZpcmUvMzE1NjUwNC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Officers responded to a two-story, multi-family residence on a 400 block of East Second Street for a domestic violence investigation shortly after 1 p.m.  A 29-year-old woman was able to make her way to a neighboring home, but the man remained barricaded inside the house with a can of gasoline, the media release said.  Officers say they got the upstairs tenants to leave and tried to talk with the man, but he hung up the phone multiple times.  During the negotiations, officers say they saw flames on the first floor along with smoke.  The man briefly exited the home with a severe self-inflicted wound to his throat, but subsequently reentered the nearly fully engulfed house, the department said.  Moments later, the man left the home and was taken into custody.  Fond du Lac Fire/Rescue crews extinguished the fire, but not before it caused extensive damage to the home.  The man was transported to SSM Health St. Agnes Hospital, as was a police department community service officer, who suffered smoke inhalation while assisting with blocking off the street.  The department says the investigation into the domestic violence and cause of the fire is at the preliminary stages and remains under active investigation.  The man will be taken to the Fond du Lac County Jail after being medically cleared.

With summer right around the corner, it's time to get outside and spend the night out under the stars. There's really nothing better than gathering a few friends and hanging out around a campfire late into the night after a big adventure together. It's also the time of year to remember some basics with Smokey Bear to prevent a cozy campfire turning into a dangerous wild fire. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, in 2022, nearly 70,000 wildfires burned approximately 7.6 million acres of land nationally. There is, of course, the golden rule of never leaving a campfire unattended, but here's a few other things to think about.    Our very own Amy Jane David out there to remind you to make safe choices with fires this summer. | TGR photo.      1. DO NOT build a campfire if the campground, area or event rules prohibit them. Sometimes digging of pits may be prohibited due to archaeological or other concerns.  2. Always choose a site at least 15 feet from tent walls, shrubs, trees or other flammable objects.  3. Choose an open, level location away from heavy fuels such as logs, brush or decaying leaves - these can unexpectedly catch a spark and quickly lead to an out of control fire.  4. Take wind, and its direction, into account when choosing the site. Choose a spot that’s protected from gusts.  5. Always put out your fire completely. Let wood burn to ash if possible, and pour water over the fire or bury it with sand until the hissing sound stops. Remember, if it’s too hot to touch, it’s too hot to leave.  There are babes in the woods. | TGR photo.

New Zealand police Friday lowered the confirmed death toll from a Wellington hostel fire from six people to five, although they said they still haven’t finished searching the dangerous four-story building.  The reduced toll came as a man charged with two counts of arson in connection with the fire made his first court appearance. The 48-year-old suspect, whose name has not been released, was not required to enter a plea and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance June 19.  If found guilty, the man faces a maximum of 14 years in prison on the charges. Police said they’re treating the case as a homicide investigation and could add more serious charges later.  Advertisement  Police Inspector Dion Bennett did not offer an explanation for why authorities had reduced the death toll after having put it at six since Tuesday, hours after the fire ripped through Loafers Lodge.  But Bennett did say that police have still not been able to search all areas of the building after parts of a roof and a floor collapsed in the fire and created piles of debris.  “The scene examination in itself, and in the third floor in particular, is quite dangerous,” Bennett told reporters. “And there are still parts we can’t cross.”  He said that urban search-and-rescue teams had been working with police to prop up sections of the floor as police inched forward with their examination. He said police had removed four bodies and hoped to remove the fifth soon.  The man charged with setting fire to a couch and to the lodge wore a black hoodie in court, waved his arms about and tried to fire his lawyer, local media reported.  Lawyer Douglas Ewen later told the Associated Press that the man remained his client. The judge granted the man temporary name suppression, a routine practice in the New Zealand legal system.  Police had earlier said there was a couch fire at Loafers Lodge about two hours before the larger fatal fire. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The deadly fire ripped through the building about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or jumped from windows.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers, which are not required in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he has asked his housing minister to investigate current building regulations to see if they need changing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdGltZXMuY29tL3dvcmxkLW5hdGlvbi9zdG9yeS8yMDIzLTA1LTE5L25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLWhvc3RlbC1maXJlLWRlYXRoLXRvbGwtbG93ZXJlZC010gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sebastian Police said on May 15 around 11 p.m., officers responded to the home on Dolphin Avenue and saw it was completely engulfed in flames.  Police said when officers arrived, Cpl. Richie Revis kicked open the front door and found an unresponsive elderly female lying on the floor.  Cpl. Revis pulled the woman from the burning home to safety, and found out there was another person inside the home.  Police said officers tried going into the home via multiple different entrances but because of the flames weren't able to go further into the house.  Indian River County Fire Rescue responded to the scene and transported the female victim to a hospital, where she is recovering from her injuries.  Unfortunately, after the fire was extinguished, police said they searched the home and crews found a male resident had died in a bedroom.  Friends and neighbors said the two people were 90-year-old Grace Follett and her 60-year-old son, Charlie Follett.  A close friend, Ron McCullough, told WPTV Charlie and Grace Follett lived their with their dog, and that the dog likely didn't make it out either. He also said Grace Follett was flown to a burn unit in Miami.  “She was lucky to get out of here, wasn’t she? She was lucky,"" said McCullough.  McCullough said Charlie Follett was a great chef, and incredibly intelligent. He also said he was a great friend to him and to others, and would be extremely missed.  ""He was a good guy. All his friends, me, we really hate it [that he was killed],"" said McCullough.  The fire is one of several devastating structure fires to hit the Treasure Coast this year.  According to Indian River County Fire Rescue, since 2022 there have been 21 structure fires in the county, resulting in one fatality.  In St Lucie County, there were 102 structure fires, resulting in three fataliies.  In Martin County, there were 285 structure fires, resulting in zero fatalities.  ""I'd say the top causes of fires in Martin County, and in home fires specifically, are cooking, electrical fires, as well as open flames, smoking, even heaters, those are all major concerns,"" said the Martin County Fire Rescue Community Relations Liaison Cory Pippin.  According to the National Fire Prevention Agency, that rings true across the State. The top five causes of house fires are, in this order:  Cooking Heaters Electrical Smoking Candles  Indian River County Fire Rescue's Bureau Chief Bill Herrington said the Dolphin Avenue fire is still under investigation.  However, fire officials across all three counties urged people to be prepared.  ""It takes less than 30 seconds for a small flame to turn into a major flame, and then a fire, and then your house can be engulfed in flames in minutes,"" Pippin said.  Some ways you can prepare yourself and your family include:  Making sure you have working smoke detectors  Have an evacuation route planned  Plan a spot for the family to meet once you do evacuate  Make sure all exits are not blocked  Remember to Stop, Drop and Roll  If you are in the home with flames and heavy smoke, drop to the floor and crawl to avoid the heavy smoke, which can be just as dangerous as flames.  ""It could be pitch black in your house and you wont even be able to see,"" said Pippin.  For more information on fire prevention, click here.

Each fire was caught quickly by occupants, but one household was temporarily displaced due to fire-related damage.  At 3:36 p.m., east side firefighters were dispatched to 4322 Melody Lane for a report of a home full of smoke and an “ashtray” burning. A tenant explained to firefighters she had been smoking on the balcony prior to leaving home approximately two hours earlier. Prior to leaving, she put her cigarette out and placed it in a red plastic coffee container she used as an ashtray. Upon returning home around 3:30 p.m., she found charring on the outside of the building, signaling a fire that spread from the plastic container. She threw water on the fire, and there was no active flames when fire crews arrived, but Engine 8 did cool hot spots with water. The occupant and her son were temporarily displaced due to damage related to the fire.  At 11:04 p.m., west side firefighters were called to 9321 Glencoe Drive for another fire on the deck of an apartment. Engine Co. 12 arrived to find flames showing from an exterior patio and the resident of the apartment unit was in the process of extinguishing the fire. The fire originated in a plastic planter, where firefighters noted an accumulation of used cigarette butts discarded among plant soil and other organic material. There was no fire extension beyond the planter box. The patio was made of poured concrete, limiting the spread of fire.  Both incidents serve as a reminder about the importance of discarding smoking materials in proper receptacles. Smoking-related fires have the potential to spread quickly when coming in contact with exterior building siding and other materials, especially if the patio or balcony is not protected by automatic fire sprinklers.

Detectives identified the troubled man who dared to steal the fire rescue truck in North Miami Beach — after finding an opportunity during a fire rescue training exercise — as Aljenard Lekambrick Hanna, police said.  After the swift heist at fire station 32, at 358 NE 168 St., surveillance video shows Hanna driving northbound on Interstate 95, just as commuters were stuck in traffic, police said.  While speeding through the streets of northern Miami-Dade, Lekambrick crashed into a parked Opa-locka Police Department cruiser, but it was empty, so no one was injured, according to police.  Aljenard Lekambrick was in the custody of the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office on Friday, records show. (PBSO)  Police scanner chatter audio indicated unmarked undercover officers joined the pursuit that lasted for about an hour and ended along the northbound lanes of the Florida Turnpike.  The Florida Highway Patrol was also among the agencies involved. The frantic pursuit ended on the Turnpike. A witness recorded a video of Hanna’s arrest north of the Boynton Beach exit.  Local 10 News went to Hanna’s northwest Miami-Dade home to learn more about what would prompt him to allegedly steal the vehicle when a woman living there charged at a Local 10 News photographer.  Another relative told Local 10 News reporter Roy Ramos that Hanna suffers from a mental disorder, which likely led him to commit the crime.  “What I have to say is focus on mental health. I don’t know what that was, but I know he is under mental duress,” she said.  Records show Hanna was in the custody of the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office on Friday morning after corrections officers booked him shortly before 2:40 a.m., and he was facing a charge of grand theft of emergency medical equipment, which carries a $25,000 bond.  While in court, Hanna was hea  BACK IN COURT…MORE FROM HANNA…GETTING SNIPPY WITH THE JUDGE.  BOND 2.1 :34 “Where do you expect me to get $2500 bucks from? I don’t know.

Last week, devastating wildfires in Alberta had burned more than 150 times more area in that province than in the last five years combined by the same point in the year.  In Nebraska, ""Canadian wildfire smoke is going to move through the area today through tomorrow morning, resulting in potentially dangerous air quality and poor visibility across eastern Nebraska and Iowa. Limit outdoor activities if possible when the air quality is poor!"" the National Weather Service in Omaha tweeted Thursday.  Wildfire smoke ""is beginning to move into the Lincoln and Omaha metro areas,"" the service's Omaha office said Thursday afternoon. ""Visibility should drop to 1-2 miles within the next couple of hours and air quality will go into the unhealthy range for sensitive groups.""  In eastern Nebraska's Douglas County – which includes Omaha – the health department warned smoke could remain through Saturday.

In the Montecito Ennisbrook open space, about 200 sheep have arrived off of Highway 192.  Montecito Fire Wildland Specialist Nic Elmquist said, ""what the sheep are doing are targeting that dry grasses which would be the most ignitable to embers.""  Bite by bite, the area becomes less of a fire threat. This program is run by the Cuyama Lamb company which has a protective dog on site to scare away other animals.  A low power electric fence is set up to keep the sheep in check. Cuyama Lamb says multiple sites in several fire prone locations are full of sheep now.  Company foreman Cristian Arambula said, ""so we have a thousand sheep total so we are bouncing throughout the areas throughout the day."" They are also at Elings Park and recently worked in an area by the Santa Barbara Bowl.  And this is a lot quieter than the sound of several weed wackers doing the same work.  Funds have been allocated specifically for these types of projects to reduce the threat of a fire another day.  Elmquist said, ""the Santa Barbara County Fire Safe council was awarded a grant for about $2 million. That's about 25 projects. This is the first one we are implementing. It will be about 3000 acres over the course of three years."" Funding comes from the Cal Climate Investment and it is managed by Cal Fire.  Wildland fire specialists say a key part of fire protection is early prevention.  Elmquist said, ""what we try to do is get ahead of it, get ahead of the problem and try to do fuels reduction.""  The work is along a popular hiking trail and those who come through on foot are impressed with the early fire season efforts.  Hiker Rachel Fiero said, ""keep it from getting into neighborhoods. This is a great idea. This is where we should be putting our efforts.""  There's plenty to eat and this group of sheep is expected to go through the grass and low lying vegetation at a rate of about an acre a day.  Elmquist said, ""we are thinking three weeks to a month in this particular area, the plan is just about an acre they call them paddocks, and starting up here and then move them south.""  Already in just a couple of days, there's been a big change, even with the additional grasses after the heavy winter rains.  Arambula said, ""that extends it to one and a half acres a day with all this volume that you are seeing. It's really good timing that we are here now.""

Smokeless fire pits like the Solo Stove are hot, so to speak. But how smokeless are they, really? Consumer Reports put some of the best-sellers to the test to find out which ones will make building, tending and cleaning up a backyard fire easier and safer.  Where there's smoke, there's fire - or is there?  Popular backyard fire pits like the Solo Stove - often called smokeless fire pits -conjure up a roaring outdoor fire, sans smoke.  Consumer Reports just tested seven of these types of fire pits. The quick takeaway:  ""It's a misnomer to call them smokeless. They are less smoky, but they're not smokeless … you will always have some smoke,"" said Bernie Deitrick with Consumer Reports.  That's the nature of burning wood but the way these fire pits are designed, there is less smoke once the fire really gets going -especially when compared to a traditional campfire.  In its tests, CR's Bernie Deitrick started lots of fires noting how fast each fire lit, and how effectively it burned.  ""The ones that did well in our ratings, you can have a small fire in them or a large fire in them, they start quickly, so that they are out of the smoky phase sooner and they burn the wood completely so that there's not a lot of clean up afterwards,"" Deitrick said.  Consumer Reports found the Solo Stove left behind lots of wood, and cleaning it up wasn't as easy as some of the other fire pits.  The top performer -- a Cuisinart -- yes, the kitchen appliance brand, Cuisinart! It's fast to light and it burns the wood more thoroughly than any other model, so there's less waste and less mess.  If you want to skip chopping and lugging around firewood, this Inno Fire Pit burns wood pellets instead.  And while it's not as easy to clean as the other two fire pits, this Blue Sky can burn pellets or logs.  And remember, no matter what type of fire you're enjoying, keep it safe!  Place your pit on an uncovered, hard flat surface -- at least twenty feet away from anything flammable.  CR says to avoid placing any fire pit on your deck. The heat could cause wood to catch fire or melt composite decking materials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb25zdW1lci1yZXBvcnRzL3RpcHMtYW5kLXRyaWNrcy1mb3ItYS1zbW9rZWxlc3MtZmlyZS1waXQvMzI2MTY5NC_SAWRodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNkZncuY29tL25ld3MvY29uc3VtZXItcmVwb3J0cy90aXBzLWFuZC10cmlja3MtZm9yLWEtc21va2VsZXNzLWZpcmUtcGl0LzMyNjE2OTQvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Portland"", ""Oregon"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T01:57:00","Nick Wolf lost everything, including photos and jewelry belonging to his late mother, in a fire that destroyed The May apartments near downtown Portland on Tuesday, leaving the building unsavable and partially collapsed.  For the second time in a decade, the 34-year-old is now starting over.  “Ten years ago, when I was in my early 20s, I struggled with addiction and homelessness,” he told The Oregonian/OregonLive. “I’m certainly fearful that this catastrophe might wipe away all the positive progress I’ve made since.”  Firefighters evacuated more than a dozen people and at least two dogs after the blaze started around 10 a.m. Tuesday. Its cause is unknown at this time, but the blaze appears to have started on the third floor of the Goose Hollow apartment building and jumped to the fourth, fire officials said. There were multiple explosions throughout the 42-unit building. Fire investigators said they were aware of rumors floating around about the cause of the fire, including that it could be arson, but said they “can’t confirm anything right now.”  Wolf isn’t the only resident who was living at The May, located at 1410 S.W. Taylor Street, who was formerly unhoused.  Julie Showers, spokesperson for homelessness nonprofit Blanchet House, said there were at least two prior Blanchet House shelter residents living at the apartment on the day of the fire. Two others had also resided there but “luckily” moved out recently, she said. It is not clear how many other residents were formerly homeless. Wolf wasn’t one of the Blanchet House residents.  “Over the years we’ve had many residents move to The May because it was lower barrier, meaning they were accepting of low credit scores and imperfect background checks,” Showers said. Blanchet House does not partner with The May; it just so happened to be one of the buildings some of their former shelter residents could afford on their own, Showers said. Wolf said he paid $890 monthly for a studio.  Wolf said the building served an important function in the community, “offering housing for people that couldn’t afford the more expensive apartments in the area.” He said many people worked “very, very hard” to live there. The building was home to formerly houseless individuals, disabled residents and seniors on fixed incomes, he said.  “This is just about the worst thing that could have happened to most of them, and we now essentially have additional people who are homeless in our community,” said Wolf, who is currently staying at the temporary Red Cross shelter erected for fire victims. He said several dozen other former May residents are there too.  One of the former Blanchet House residents, John Judge, filed a lawsuit against The May Friday. Attorney Michael Fuller filed the suit in Multnomah County Circuit Court seeking $125,000 from The May’s owner for the loss of Judge’s possessions, emotional distress and the head injury Judge said he suffered after he tripped on a firehose on his way out. Valerie King, the wife of The May’s owner, said they had no comment on the litigation.  Judge lost items that once belong to his late mother and father, who both died during the pandemic. He lost his mother’s family Bible and wedding ring, a watch worn by his father while serving in Vietnam and family photographs dating back to the 1800s. While he expects to enter veterans housing offered by Portland homelessness nonprofit Transition Projects on Monday, it will likely take Judge much longer to move on from the trauma.  “It was the most horrible experience in my life,” he said. “All I have is the clothes on my back.”  Blanchet House director Scott Kerman worries about the psychological toll on residents. After doing the painstaking work to achieve housing only to lose it again, Kerman hopes that residents from The May don’t lose hope. And he hopes in addition to housing services, that there will be mental health resources made available to help residents cope with the trauma.  13 1 / 13 Southwest Portland apartment building partially collapses after fire  Wolf doesn’t yet know where he will live next, though the Blanchet House men’s shelter could be an option. He was told housing workers would visit the Red Cross shelter to help people navigate next steps, but he hasn’t seen them yet.  The fire highlights the challenges that low-income residents face in maintaining housing, Kerman said. A catastrophe such as a fire can more easily destroy someone living on fixed income and the psychological toll is likely to hit harder than for those who have a financial cushion to fall back on, he said.  The owner of The May had numerous hazardous condition code violations that he recently fixed, according to city inspectors who reviewed the repairs a day before flames devoured the building. The May is one of a dozen buildings owned by Larry D. Kelley, 72, through his company, SkyNat Property Management, business records show.  City staff found 10 code violations during a Dec. 15 inspection. The building didn’t have functioning emergency lights on the second and third floors and a series of “daisy-chained” extension cords were found in the main lobby, the case files show. The review also found damage to fire-resistant ceiling covers in the basement laundry room and a fire door that had been propped open on the fourth floor.  Fire inspectors visited the building the day before the fire and found that most of the violations had been rectified, though investigators noted that a different fire door was wedged open, an expired fire extinguisher in the basement hadn’t yet been replaced and another fire extinguisher on the fourth floor was missing a tool to break its glass enclosure.  Wolf, who lived on the fourth floor, said more could have been done to protect residents in the building.  “I really feel like the management company tremendously neglected us,” Wolf said. “We certainly know the fire department had red flagged us in December, but we also didn’t have any management on site for the past month.”  Kelley and building managers did not respond to requests for comment.  Wolf said someone began repeatedly pulling the fire alarm at The May in December. He estimated it happened at least 20 times since then, at times going off at 4 a.m. or around 2 p.m. when he was on virtual meetings working from home. Other residents also said the fire alarm was repeatedly pulled. Portland Fire & Rescue responded to 24 fire alarms at the building from November through mid-May, according to Lt. Laurent Picard.  “It got to the point where the fire department would take a little longer each time to show up with a truck to shut off the alarm and people stopped leaving the building when the alarm would go off and wouldn’t respond since they just assumed it was a false alarm,” he said. “Pulling the fire alarm is illegal and it was happening for five months, and they didn’t do anything about the issue.”  Initiating a false alarm that is transmitted to a fire department is a misdemeanor in Oregon.  — Nicole Hayden reports on homelessness for The Oregonian/OregonLive.

Fire marshals will continue to work the scene to try to determine the origin and cause of the fire, State Fire Marshal Richard McCarthy said Thursday. His office, which is leading the investigation, did not release any new information Friday about those efforts.  McCarthy has not said if the fire is considered suspicious but did say there is no investigation of the hotel owner.  The fire ripped through the Days Inn on the Route 1 Bypass on Wednesday afternoon. It took hours and crews from 16 departments in Maine and New Hampshire to contain and put it out, and more than 24 hours for investigators to locate the victim.  The state medical examiner is trying to identify the victim, whose body was found around 2:15 p.m. Thursday. McCarthy did not know if the victim was male or female and no one has contacted authorities to report a missing person.  Related One person found dead in rubble of Kittery hotel fire  Investigators initially said two people might have been unaccounted for, but the second person was found safe and away from the scene. They now believe everyone who had been staying or working at the hotel has been accounted for, including four out-of-state workers who were living there while working at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.  Advertisement  It was a challenge to determine how many people were in the building and who they were because the hotel owner did not keep a required guest log, Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien said Thursday. The hotel office was destroyed, as were any records not stored online.  Hotel Owner Kamlesh Patel has been very cooperative, O’Brien said.  In 2018 and 2019, the hotel was closed for a lengthy period of time after local officials put the building under a closure order until multiple code violations were fixed. Those violations included problems with the installation of propane-fired heating systems, alarm systems that weren’t functioning, fire doors that didn’t close and issues with access and egress, O’Brien said.  Those violations were all corrected and the hotel was issued a certificate of occupancy in 2019. The hotel had not been inspected in the last couple of years, O’Brien said.  The hotel, which was valued at $1.7 million by the town, did not have a fire suppression or sprinkler system. There were working smoke alarms in the building.  It was built in 1956, according to town records, and was not required to have a sprinkler system, which state law requires for all hotels built since 1992. Older hotels are required to have approved smoke, heat and fire detection systems.  Advertisement  The fire was the largest in town in decades and the first fatal fire there in about three years.  Fighting the fire was a challenge because the wood frame building was full of furniture and “lots of material to burn,” O’Brien said. Heavy winds fanned the flames, giving the fire a big start, he said.  “It is a firefighter’s nightmare with individual rooms and hallways and everything else,” he said. “Trust me when I say I was extremely hesitant when I sent my firefighters into the building to go make that initial primary search.”  During the first three or four minutes on scene, firefighters rushed into the building without a water line to try to get to a room that may have been occupied. They were almost there when the fire became too intense and they had to pull out, O’Brien said. He learned later no one was inside the room.  That part of the building is not where the victim was found, O’Brien said.  Now that the department’s work at the scene is over, attention will turn to helping the Kittery firefighters themselves. This was the first fatal fire for several young firefighters, O’Brien said Thursday.  “We will sit down, discuss it and have them understand that things like this happen and they did everything they could,” he said. Everyone will be offered counseling.  As investigators searched through the fire scene, firefighters were already busy dealing with other calls in town, including brush fires and car crashes, O’Brien said.  “We wake up in the morning, we move on and we continue,” he said.

The latest fire was Tuesday.  ""I'm tracking the origins of these fires and trying to come up with what kind of batteries they are, what condition they're in when they burn,"" Mackinac Island Fire Chief Jason St. Onge told the Free Press on Thursday. ""As of now, we can't find any direct correlation.""  So far, he said four known e-bike battery fires have occurred under different circumstances on the island:  In late July, a battery charging in a kitchen caught fire and put the homeowner and two firefighters in the hospital.  In the fall, an e-bike battery caught fire at a residence but it was contained without firefighter assistance.  On May 6, a bike that was not plugged in or charging ""burned up overnight in the yard"" of a resident, St. Onge said.  On Tuesday, a battery in a box, not plugged in, caught fire at a home. The smoke detector alarm went off at 6 a.m. and the occupants were alerted in time to remove the battery before the fire spread.  The fire chief met with island business owners in late April to warn them about the potential threat of electric bike battery fires, urging them to take action to reduce the threat to iconic buildings.  ""These are all lithium-ion batteries,"" St. Onge said Thursday, still mystified that people aren't more concerned about fire safety and battery risk near wooden structures on the historic island. ""It's like you're trying to convince me that it's OK to store gasoline in your house.""  When lithium-ion batteries and other high energy density batteries are charged too long, overused, damaged in any way, improperly stored, poorly made or incorrectly refurbished, they may cause fast-spreading fires, according to Consumer Reports and the city of New York websites.  It is essential people exercise extreme care with these batteries, St. Onge said. ""Let's be clear: You don't have four fires in 10 months and then just stop. You hope they do but it's not responsible to take that position. I can't run the fire department on hope.""  After a Free Press article published May 2, he said he received calls and emails and Facebook messages from fire chiefs around Michigan applauding his proactive approach to concerns fire officials have expressed privately.  ""The article raised awareness, in general, around the state,"" St. Onge said.  In a three-page letter dated May 8, and obtained by the Free Press, State Fire Marshal Kevin Sehlmeyer notified St. Onge of specific procedures for tracking and reporting lithium-ion battery fires that include property damage and injuries, whether or not the battery was charged, estimated percentage of battery charge at the time of the incident and whether the battery was portable or charging. Reporting protocols also include whether the batteries do not start a fire but create hazardous conditions such as arcing or shorted electrical equipment.  The email sent to fire officials, originated from the Michigan Department of Licensing & Regulatory Affairs, Bureau of Fire Services, noted that the data is being aggregated by the National Fire Incident Reporting System. Specific codes are required to assist with risk analysis.  Public officials are working to determine the breadth of the problem as micro-mobility devices such as e-bikes and scooters continue to grow in popularity.  Tim Hygh, executive director of the Mackinac Island Tourism Bureau, told the Free Press, ""The nature of these fires and the growth of e-bikes sales makes it an absolute necessity that information is tracked and shared. We couldn't be more thankful for the attention our firefighters are paying to it.""  Mackinac Island, an international vacation destination which attracts hundreds of thousands during its main season of May through October, is known for its bicycles and horse and buggy carriage rides. Cars have been banned on the island for more than a century. But not motorized bicycles. And island bike rental shops continue to see a growing appetite for e-bikes, according to St. Onge.  Steve Brisson, director of Mackinac State Historic Parks, told the Free Press in early May that pedal-assist brings the island into compliance with laws protecting people with disabilities as interpreted by the courts.  On Tuesday, Consumer Reports endorsed the Setting Consumer Standards for Lithium-Ion Batteries Act, legislation in Congress to protect consumers from the risk of fire tied to lithium-ion batteries used in micro-mobility devices such as e-bikes and e-scooters. The bipartisan proposal sponsored by House members from New York would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to put into effect a consumer product safety standard for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in micro-mobility devices, and for other purposes.  In New York City, which has seen a spike in e-bike use since the start of the pandemic in 2020, there have been five fire-related deaths involving e-bike fires out of 59 total e-bike related fires this year, NPR reported April 11. That doesn't include lithium ion battery fires involving scooters.

"fire","2019-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Ohio"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:16:05","WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Ohio -- Warm weather is upon us, and residents of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base may be looking forward to enjoying outdoor activities like grilling and backyard campfires. While these can create lasting memories with family and friends, it is essential to prioritize fire safety. Let’s review key fire safety tips and base regulations to so that you enjoy these summer activities.  According to the National Fire Protection Association, grilling-related fires peak in July (18%), followed by June (15%), May (13%), and August (12%). Gas grills were involved in an average of 8,900 home fires per year, with leaks or breaks being the primary issue. Charcoal or other solid-fueled grills were involved in 1,300 home fires per year. From 2014 to 2018, an average of 19,700 patients per year went to emergency rooms because of injuries involving grills. Nearly half (9,500 or 48%) of these injuries were thermal burns, with children under five accounting for an average of 2,000 or 39% of the contact-type burns per year.  Location:  - Ensure the area is clear of any flammable materials, such as dry grass, leaves, or overhanging tree branches.  - Position the barbecue or campfire at least 10 feet away from any structures, including your home, shed, or garage.  - Charcoal and gas grills, deep pot fryers, gas heat lamps, must not be used under overhangs or awnings.  Equipment:  - Inspect your barbecue grill for any damage, such as rust or cracks, before using it.  - Make sure your propane tank is in good condition and that all connections are secure. Check for gas leaks by applying a light soap and water solution to the hose and connections. If bubbles appear, this indicates a leak that needs to be addressed.  - For charcoal grills, use a charcoal chimney starter or an electric charcoal starter instead of lighter fluid, which can be dangerous.  - When using a fire pit or building a campfire, ensure it is surrounded by a non-flammable border, such as a ring of rocks or a metal fire ring.  Ohio EPA regulations for backyard campfires:  - Must be fueled with clean seasoned firewood, natural gas, or other clean burning fuel.  - Must not be used for waste disposal.  - Must have a total fuel area of no more than three feet in diameter, and no higher than two feet.  Grilling safety:  - Never leave your barbecue or campfire unattended.  - Keep a fire extinguisher or a bucket of water nearby in case of emergencies.  - Don't use gasoline or other flammable liquids to ignite or re-ignite the fire.  - Use long-handled grilling tools to keep a safe distance from the heat.  Backyard campfire safety:  - When you're finished using a propane grill, turn off the burners and the propane tank.  - For charcoal grills, close the vents and let the coals cool down completely before disposing of them in a metal container.  - For campfires and backyard fires, let the fire die down, then pour water or shovel dirt onto the embers until the hissing sound stops. Stir the ashes and continue adding water or dirt until the fire is completely out.  Educate:  - Discuss fire safety rules with your family and any guests who will be participating in your outdoor activities.  - Supervise children and pets at all times to ensure they maintain a safe distance from the fire.  As you enjoy the warm weather and outdoor activities, remember to prioritize fire safety. By following these tips and adhering to WPAFB regulations, you can help protect yourself, your loved ones, and your property from the dangers of fire.  For more information on outdoor fire safety or if you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Wright-Patterson AFB Fire Prevention office at 937-257-4075.  Enjoy your grilling, backyard fires, and campfires responsibly!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwYWZiLmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0FydGljbGUtRGlzcGxheS9BcnRpY2xlLzM0MDE1MTUvc3VtbWVyLWZpcmUtc2FmZXR5LXRpcHMtZ3JpbGxpbmctYW5kLWJhY2t5YXJkLWNhbXBmaXJlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  MANCHESTER, Conn — Fire marshals have determined the cause of a fire that engulfed a multi-family home in Manchester early Friday morning, leaving 14 people without a place to live. The cause of the fire was determined to be the ""improper disposal of smoking material outside the structure.""  The home on West Street went up in flames around 4 a.m. Friday, all while those who lived there stood across the street, watching in shock. Roy Barlow said he just barely got out in time.  “I felt the heat; it was pretty immense. I went away from the building even further because the heat was so intense,” Barlow said.  Manchester Fire Chief Daniel French said it’s possible the fire started in a bush outside and then quickly spread to the rest of the house.  “You wind up with an intense need for manpower early on; this was an older structure. It had cedar siding under vinyl,” French said. “It had a lot of fire in the attic and outside and extended into the attic, through the whole building. A lot of people coming in early with access to water made a difference.”  One of the people in the home and a firefighter were taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.  Barlow was sleeping when he woke up to screaming, telling him to get out because his apartment was on fire.  “Grabbed the fastest shoes I could find and got out – but the fire was just on the other side of the wall where my room is,” Barlow said.  He said he still couldn't believe what happened, saying the past few years haven’t always been easy, but he has learned to manage difficulty.  “Even though I’m only four years sober, I’m wondering what it will be like being in a situation where you are all by yourself at your own devices,” Barlow said.  Barlow tells us his sobriety journey is what’s kept him motivated, and today he is not only grateful to be alive but is thankful for everything that’s happened in his life so far.  “I’m very lucky; I have a lot to live for. God put me in this world for something, and I’m doing very well with my life,” Barlow said. “There is a turnaround in all of this. I feel there will be a positive.”  The Red Cross is helping the fourteen residents find a place to stay while the fire and smoke damage is evaluated. The fire chief said the damage is extensive in spots, but some of the home may be saved.  Firefighters remind residents that Connecticut is in a Red Flag Warning, which is activated in dry conditions.  Jennifer Glatz is a digital content producer at FOX61 News.

Police publicly named the man, Charles James Perrin, 25, after he was booked into the Vanderburgh County jail Thursday on preliminary charges of arson and criminal mischief causing at least $50,000 in damages.  The Evansville Police Department and Evansville Fire Department worked alongside the Indiana Department of Homeland Security to investigate the Pearl Cleaners fire, which began sometime after 1 a.m. Wednesday.  More:Fire destroys former Pearl Cleaners site in Downtown Evansville  When Evansville fire crews arrived at 1:48 a.m., the building was almost engulfed, according to a probable cause affidavit authored by IDHS investigator Levi Sims. It eventually escalated into a two-alarm blaze.  ""The fire department was able to extinguish the fire; however, the building is a total loss,"" Levi wrote. ""The assessed value of the building is approximately $445,000.""  The Pearl Laundry Center, located at 428 N.W. 3rd Street, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 when it was known as the ""Pearl Steam Laundry"" building. Two years prior, the state added Pearl Steam Laundry to its registry of historical places.  Pearl Cleaners closed the location in 2018 and was the subject of a lawsuit one year prior, which alleged the laundry's decades-long use of cleaning solvents contaminated groundwater.  Investigators quickly zeroed in on Perrin as a potential suspect and, at a Thursday afternoon news conference, EPD Officer Mario Reid said Perrin voluntarily agreed to answer questions at EPD headquarters.  More:Evansville man arrested and accused of intentionally setting Pearl Cleaners fire  Perrin, who police believe was homeless at the time, reportedly admitted he ""knowingly and intentionally"" started the fire with a portable hand torch.

""Mr. Perrin stated that he set the fire for self-gratification, as he got an adrenaline rush,"" Levi wrote. ""Mr. Perrin stated that he left and soon came back to admire his work.""  Perrin is scheduled to appear in Vanderburgh County Circuit Court at 1 p.m. for a probable cause hearing. A judge will review the probable cause affidavit and set a date by which prosecutors must file formal charges.  As of Friday morning, Perrin was still listed as an inmate in Vanderburgh County jail records.  From the Sports Desk:Girls can play baseball, too.

He said that the building is not serving anyone, but the people need it,” according to the charges.  Murekezi also allegedly said that it was good he was caught, otherwise he would “torch another one,” or “a church.”  Investigators said that when police arrested Murekezi, officers found that he was carrying a substance that later tested positive for methamphetamine.  Police apprehended Murekezi after ATF agents requested help from a Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office unit that has access to facial recognition technology. Investigators matched stills from the surveillance video to other images of Murekezi, including a photo of him leaving the Hennepin County jail Monday evening, about 36 hours before the mosque fire.  Court and jail records show that Minneapolis-St.Paul International Airport Police arrested Murekezi on April 28 at the Terminal 1 light rail platform after spotting him walking inside a train tunnel, allegedly with a meth pipe.  Hennepin County prosecutors charged Murekezi with gross misdemeanor trespass on a critical public service facility and possession of drug paraphernalia, a petty misdemeanor. He was jailed for about two weeks before a judge ordered him released without bond on the condition that he stay away from the airport.  Other court records show that Murekezi has struggled with drug abuse, mental illness and homelessness. He pleaded guilty to arson last year for setting fire to a pile of clothing in his room at Mary Hall in St. Paul, a Catholic Charities facility that provides private rooms to unhoused adults.  The heat caused a fire sprinkler to be activated. Authorities say Murekezi initially denied firefighters access to his room and threatened to jump from a fourth-floor window. After serving a brief jail term, Murekezi was placed on a year of supervised probation, which began in November.  In restraining orders that she filed in recent years, Murekezi’s former partner alleged that he had threatened her and their teenage son. She said Murekezi texted her a photo of himself pointing a gun, and other family members had expressed concern that Murekezi had not been taking prescriptions to treat his mental illness.  Murekezi made his initial appearance in Ramsey County Court on Friday, where a judge set bond at $200,000 and ordered a mental competency evaluation. Murekezi remains jailed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wcm5ld3Mub3JnL3N0b3J5LzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvYmlhcy1tb3RpdmUtbm90LXN1c3BlY3RlZC1pbi1zdC1wYXVsLW1vc3F1ZS1maXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Scott Higgins died in a fire when a seal on a pump, near where he was performing maintenance at Marathon's Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, ruptured and created a blaze that engulfed him in flames.  ""He was burned to death at the plant,"" said attorney Tony Buzbee at a media briefing on Friday where he alleged safety conditions at the second-largest U.S. oil refining complex have not improved in a decade.  Higgins' family plans to file a gross negligence lawsuit against the oil refiner and other firms involved in the plant's maintenance, he said. Buzbee is seeking documents on the plant and maintenance, according to court filings.  ""Marathon, due to negligence and disregard for the well-being of everything but their bottom line has devastated me and my family,"" said Alyssa Higgins, a daughter of the deceased worker.  A Marathon spokesperson said the company is committed to determining the cause of the incident and has invested more than $1 billion on safety and regulatory upgrades since acquiring the facility.  ""Our OSHA recordable incident rate (ORIR) is better than the industry average. We remain committed to continuous improvement in all aspects of safety, and our goal is to eliminate injuries at our site,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""The safety of our workers and the community remain paramount.""  The company said this week it launched an investigation into the blaze but has not released any findings.  ""Scott always thought he might die at that plant,"" Buzbee said. ""He had talked to his daughters about it and his family many times. And the reason he talked to them about it is because that plant is very dangerous,"" Buzbee said.  ""This wasn't an unfortunate catastrophe,"" Buzbee said.  The facility has had a history of accidents under Marathon's ownership since 2013 and under its previous owner, BP Plc (BP.L), records show. A worker at the same plant was killed after he was electrocuted earlier this year, and in 2005, a vapor cloud released from an overflowing processing unit exploded, killing 15 contract workers and injuring 180 others.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Flagstaff"", ""Arizona"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T02:01:13","Officials kept watch on a storm system making its way across northern Arizona this week, just about a month before the monsoon traditionally starts for the area.  The storms, so far, have primarily impacted communities across Yavapai County stretching down across the central and eastern portions of the Mogollon Rim.  ""So far, we've mainly seen just your curb-to-curb flooding in certain parts of northern Arizona,"" which will likely continue through Friday, National Weather Service meteorologist Lamont Bain, in Flagstaff, said.  Rainfall at Flagstaff Pulliam Airport on Friday had already set a new daily record by 1 p.m., the weather service tweeted. The old record was 0.50 inch, set in 1957, while the new benchmark reached 0.57 inch on the day.  The potential for showers and thunderstorms will start winding down through the middle of the week, Bain said.  City officials in Flagstaff hosted two meetings this month to prepare residents for the potential for more flooding this summer after the community faced dozens of flood events last year. While officials emphasized the importance of readying properties and paying attention to emergency alerts, there is no clear way to predict what lies ahead.  Thinking ahead:After last year's floods, Flagstaff begins preparing residents for monsoon  ""I do think that we have to be a little careful about drawing comparisons between what we're seeing now and if that's going to necessarily be a preview of the monsoon,"" Bain said.  The monsoon is unpredictable by nature, Bain said, which is why meteorologists often hesitate to make firm predictions this far ahead of time.  ""Unfortunately, it's one of those things that we just kind of have to wait and see how it goes,"" he said.  While the current storm system might have no bearing on the monsoon, it could impact the traditional wildfire season. Because the rain rolled in during what is usually the area's peak fire season, the extra moisture will also likely delay the onset of the season, Bain said.  ""It will certainly keep the fire potential on the lower end of the spectrum,"" he said.  Bain also warned that this early rain could spark a green-up of the surrounding areas. If the traditional monsoon, which usually starts around the end of June, is also delayed, the vegetation could then dry out quickly and add to dangerous fire conditions.

The fire broke out Thursday morning at an apartment complex that was under construction. Charlotte Fire’s investigation determined it began accidentally and started in a spray insulation foam trailer on the ground floor, Johnson said. Workers had shared that same information with Channel 9 on Thursday.  Construction worker Demonte Sherrill, 30, died in the fire, family members confirmed.  PREVIOUS STORIES:  Keith Suggs, the manager of Atlanta-based Prestige Windows and Doors, confirmed to Channel 9 that a second worker was killed in the fire. He said said both Sherrill and the other victim worked for him. Channel 9 is not naming the second victim at this time out of respect for the family.  Suggs said Sherrill was only on his third day of work at the site -- he started working for Suggs on Tuesday. Sherrill and the other man were the only two workers Suggs said he had at the site on Thursday when the fire broke out. The two were working to install doors.  Suggs told Channel 9 he was actually at the construction site Thursday but left before the fire started. He said both Sherrill and the other victim were on the sixth floor with their harnesses on.  The five-alarm blaze happened on Liberty Row Drive near Fairview Road. The fifth alarm was struck just before 10 a.m.  Charlotte Fire Chief Reginald Johnson said firefighters rescued 15 workers from the building, including one who was on a crane. Paramedics said he was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. They said two more people were evaluated but were not transported.  The fire moved rapidly because of the amount of exposed wood at the site, the chief said.  This is a developing story. Check back for updates.

Two construction workers were killed in a massive fire at a Charlotte construction site Thursday, which fire officials said was accidental.  Reginald Johnson, the fire chief for the Charlotte Fire Department, told reporters Friday that the bodies of the two construction workers who were unaccounted for in the five-alarm blaze on Liberty Row Drive were discovered in the wreckage earlier in the morning.  Their identities weren't publicly released.  Firefighters work on the scene of a building fire in Charlotte, N.C., on May 18, 2023.

Demonte Sherrill's parents said he was a good man who worked hard to provide for his four children.  ""He got that job, and he was doing real good at it, so I was very, very proud of him,"" Sherrill's father, Terry Campbell, told WSOC.  Over 90 firefighters responded to the residential construction site on Liberty Road around 9 a.m. and within 10 minutes, the blaze grew to five alarms, told reporters Thursday.  ""It was a very fast-moving fire [with] high heat conditions well over 2000 degrees. And as a construction site is open, a lot of wood is exposed the fire moved very rapidly,"" Johnson said.  Firefighters rescued 15 construction workers from the fire, including one person who was stuck on top of a crane.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""May"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:01:01","Here's a rapid-fire update on all 34 stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, the portfolio we use for the CNBC Investing Club. Jim ran through each one of them Wednesday during the May edition of our ""Monthly Meeting."" Apple (AAPL): With the iPhone maker's business in emerging markets like Brazil, Indonesia and India beginning to show momentum, our longtime ""own it, don't trade it"" mantra continues to look great. Financial features like Apple Pay should help with services revenue growth in the years ahead, too. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): Jim said he's worried about overstaying his welcome in AMD, a company he's liked for many years under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su. That's a high-quality problem to have, though. The stock, up 60% this year, is nearing a 52-week high. Amazon (AMZN): The e-commerce and cloud giant is leaning into generative artificial intelligence (AI) to reignite its advertising business, which generated $9.5 billion in revenues in the first quarter. It's a promising plan. However, Jim suggested the Club may need to trim its Amazon position soon, strictly from a portfolio-management perspective. AMZN is nearing a 3% weighting in the Trust. Bausch Health (BHC): After the ""Monthly Meeting"" concluded, shares of the troubled pharmaceutical maker soared on a favorable ruling in the company's Xifaxan patent litigation. BHC stock jumped more than 41% at one stage to a session of $8.56. We're still trying to figure out the full extent of the court ruling, but it's news that could eliminate the possibility of a default, which brought the stock to $6. Xifaxan, which represents 80% of sales at BHC's Salix Pharmaceuticals unit, is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and overt hepatic encephalopathy. Bausch Health disappointed investors with first-quarter earnings and revenue when it reported earlier this month. However, the company at the time offered better-than-expected forward guidance. Caterpillar (CAT): Our focus is on the deluge of infrastructure spending coming in the U.S. over the coming years, and less on where dealer inventory levels sit in the next quarter, something Wall Street analysts talk a lot about. This allows us to be patient and see through short-term noise. Costco (COST): Costco continues to keep its prices low and its quality high, and traders who sell its stock on, say, weak monthly sales are usually proven wrong over time. Salesforce (CRM): CEO Marc Benioff has successfully fended off an unusual amount of activist pressure in the stock. Following the stock's big year-to-date run, we sold 100 shares on May 4. We're curious to see whether Salesforce can jumpstart Slack, the workplace-messaging app it acquired nearly two years ago for almost $28 billion. Coterra Energy (CTRA): Coterra's first-quarter results were downright impressive , given the steep decline in natural prices in recent months. Jim said he'd like to buy more if the stock fell below $24 per share, but suggested the oil-and-gas firm's robust buyback program may be putting in a floor. Danaher (DHR): Danaher is in a rough patch, but our long-term faith in management to execute and deliver efficiencies across its life-sciences businesses hasn't been shaken. To sell here would suggest management has lost a step. We don't believe that's the case, and Jim said he'd like to buy some additional shares. Disney (DIS): We're sticking with Disney, although our entry into the entertainment giant was a bit early. Simply put, the company's current market value is significantly lower than its franchise value, rooted in its vast intellectual property library. The odds favor that mismatch correcting over time. Estee Lauder (EL): The prestige cosmetics firm is dealing with a more volatile recovery in its Asia travel retail business than expected, leading to very disappointing guidance that's crushed the stock. But now it's priced in, and we want to use the weakness to buy more, betting on CEO Fabrizio Freda to deliver. Jim said buy EL and we added more shares to the Trust . Emerson Electric (EMR): The automation-focused industrial needs another quality quarter to shake off the overhang created by its initially hostile takeover of National Instruments (NATI). In the absence of that, Jim said we may bid adieu to Emerson. Ford (F): CEO Jim Farley did a fantastic job delivering in the automaker's latest quarter, and we like his decision to scale back Ford's business in China . The impact of Tesla's price wars on the overall electric-vehicle market remains to be seen, but it's a wrinkle we didn't see coming. Foot Locker (FL): We have low expectations for the sneaker retailer's earnings report Friday. It's still early into CEO Mary Dillon's tenure, though, and we maintain our optimism in her turnaround strategy. We'll look to add to our position, currently just a 1.5% weighting, on future weakness in the stock. GE Healthcare (GEHC): The medical imaging and diagnostics company joined our portfolio Wednesday . Jim said it was coming on the Monthly Meeting. Recently spun-out from General Electric (GE), we see an industry leader that's now better positioned to accelerate growth. Alphabet (GOOGL): We pared back our exposure in Google's parent company in early May, locking in big profits in the portfolio-management move. But Jim said he's optimistic about Alphabet's ability to serve as an AI-focused consulting firm of sorts for other companies, like it recently did with fast-food chain Wendy's (WEN). Halliburton (HAL): A steep drop in oil prices recently has dragged Halliburton down, too, prompting some investors to question whether a multiyear cycle of increased drilling investments is still in the cards. But the Biden administration refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and more visibility around economic growth would help oil prices pick back up. Honeywell (HON): The upcoming CEO transition, with the retiring Darius Adamczyk set to be replaced by COO Vimal Kapur on June 1, has seemingly kept a lid on the stock recently. However, that gave us a chance to upgrade the stock to a buy-it-here 1 rating Monday. Its exposure to aerospace and clean energy allow us to be patient. Humana (HUM): The health insurer Medicare Advantage offering is much-improved, leading the company to revise its membership estimates higher multiple times since the fall. It's also the kind of defensive stock that should be relatively resilient in any bad-news scenarios with the debt-ceiling fight in Washington. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Separating its consumer products division from its pharmaceutical and medical technology units was a good move for shareholders . But the ongoing talc lawsuit fight has been bad. A favorable resolution to the latest proposed settlement would bring the focus back to the fundamentals and unlock the stock. Linde (LIN): The well-run industrial gas giant is off its all-time highs, reached earlier in May, but the multiyear outlook for Linde remains very strong. Linde benefits from green hydrogen trends, as well as expanding semiconductor manufacturing. Eli Lilly (LLY): Eli Lilly's drug pipeline in diabetes and weight loss, as well as Alzheimer's is stellar, and why we believe it's the best large-cap pharmaceutical company out there. We're letting the stock ride for now, up 33% over the past three months, but acknowledge that we may have to book profits. Meta Platforms (META): The Facebook and Instagram parent has wisely used artificial intelligence to improve advertising efficiency on its platforms, and to boost engagement with short-form video feature Reels. Meta's ""year of efficiency"" is working, and Jim said the metaverse thankfully looks like an after-thought right now. Morgan Stanley (MS): It's been a turbulent time for financial stocks since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March and some others, but we continue to like Morgan Stanley's asset and wealth management pivot. If the sector comes back in favor, Jim said he expects the stock to climb to $90 per share from its current levels around $83 each. Microsoft (MSFT): Microsoft has been riding the artificial intelligence boom that began late last year after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The tech titan, a key investor and partner with OpenAI, has rolled out a number of encouraging new AI-enabled features to its software. Nvidia (NVDA): Nvidia has become another ""own it, don't trade it"" stock. Its graphics chips are at the heart of the AI cycle. Jim said it's admittedly hard to know when Nvidia shares, up 105% year to date, may take a breather. Palo Alto Networks (PANW): CEO Nikesh Arora has done a great job turning Palo Alto Networks into a profitable, diversified cybersecurity company with scale as the industry consolidates. Despite the stock's recent weakness, it remains above our cost basis of $177.68, and we are hesitant to violate that. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD): Jim said he wants to buy more Pioneer, which will hand the reins to current President and COO Rich Dealy after year-end. Higher oil prices would certainly be a boon for Pioneer's stock price, but the company's high-quality assets in the Permian Basin are attractive on their own. Procter & Gamble (PG): Jim said P & G is primed for another strong move higher, similar to its advance that took it from the mid $130s per share to around $155 on Wednesday. If it slips back to around $150, Jim said he thinks P & G would be a buy. Starbucks (SBUX): Laxman Narasimhan, who took over as CEO in March, deserves time to settle into the job, especially given the difficult Covid reopening environment in China. Middle-class consumers in China may be pulling back on some spending, but we think the coffee chain's bet on the country, already its second-largest sales market, is the right one over time. Constellation Brands (STZ): The situation at Constellation has become a bit of a mixed bag, Jim said, with Modelo's growth remaining impressive while Corona has cooled a bit. However, we like owning the company, particularly due to its cash flow prowess. TJX Companies (TJX): The off-price retailer, which reported solid earnings Wednesday morning, is a buy here, Jim stressed. We expect solid results in the second half of the year. Wells Fargo (WFC): Wells Fargo is a buy, after it agreed to a settlement Tuesday to resolve another legal matter from it scandal-ridden past under previous managers. Its future looks brighter each time another regulatory hurdle is put in the rearview mirror, even though the Federal Reserve-mandated asset cap is still in place. Wynn Resorts (WYNN): Shares of the casino operator jumped 7% to roughly $110 each Wednesday after Barclays upgraded the stock to the equivalent of buy, from hold, with a $135 price target. With Wynn's properties in both the U.S. and Macao humming, Jim said he'd consider using weakness in the stock to add to our small position.

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:24:00","The last few days the sunrises and sunsets here in Michigan have been fabulous. It looks like these dawn and dusk delights are going to continue off and on for quite some time.  The reason for the orange and red sunrises and sunsets is a lot of smoke in the sky drifting across North America. Western Canada has numerous wildfires going right now. These fires are actually producing a lot of smoke. You might think smoke in western Canada can’t make it to the skies over Michigan. The smoke easily makes it into our sky in just a couple of days. The fires are a few thousand miles away. The upper-air flow averages 100 mph. In 24 hours, the air can move 2400 miles. Western Canadian air can be over Michigan in just a day or two depending on the upper-level winds.  Smoke in British Columbia and Alberta shows up as faint, wispy white on the latest satellite images.  Why are the sunrises and sunsets orange and red? Sunlight is made up of all of the light colors. Remember a rainbow’s colors are the sunlight colors separated for us. The colors of a rainbow can be remembered by the name ROY G. BIV - Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet. Notice how the colors of a rainbow are grouped. The red, orange and yellow have long wavelengths. The green, blue, indigo and violet have shorter wavelengths.  The smoke particles are blocking some of the light coming from the sun. The colors that are blocked more easily are the short wavelength light colors of the blues and purples. This leaves us with a sunrise or sunset with red, orange and yellow colors.  Satellite shows the fires and smoke in western Canada on May 16, 2023  So will smoke be in our sky everyday? No. The smoke will come at us in waves. Storm systems and rainfall will do a good job of dragging the smoke down to the ground. After a storm system we may have a day or two of blue skies. The smoke will then build up again since westerly winds are the most common upper-air flow.  Until the fires go out, we will continue to have beautiful smoky sunrises and sunsets. There will also be some downsides to smoky skies. The daily forecast could be a little tougher. When a blob of this smoke moves over Michigan we almost get a cloudy sky. The smoke can actually lower the afternoon temperature by five degrees. Of course the smoke is pollution and can give us poor air quality more often.  Find a couple of lawn chairs and be ready for sunrise and sunset watching.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1saXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvb24tZmlyZS1zdW5yaXNlcy1hbmQtc3Vuc2V0cy1hcmUtaGVyZS5odG1s0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9vbi1maXJlLXN1bnJpc2VzLWFuZC1zdW5zZXRzLWFyZS1oZXJlLmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Montgomery"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:01:00","MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - After a long 22 weeks, 17 new firefighters graduated from what Montgomery city officials call the toughest fire training in the country.  “Firefighting is a demanding profession that requires a lot of sacrifices,” said Fire Chief Miford Jordan.  “You are not just becoming a part of something. You are becoming a part of the thing,” said Chief of Staff Chip Hill.  For 22 weeks, strenuous training prepared them for what can often become unthinkable.  “Sunday night, and Monday morning, what hit me and what I hope will hit you is how fast life could change,” said Hill.  The fire at a home on Gilmer Avenue was a tragic real-world lesson for the new firefighters. Two people were killed, and five firefighters were injured.  Keynote speaker Christian Dealba says the house fire was something firefighters see all the time.  “Firefighter Hartman has six years on the job here and was dragged out of the house fire unconscious and lifeless,” said Dealba.  “Captain Crenshaw also has been here for 22 years and has 3rd-degree burns from his shoulders to his hands he was also transported to UAB. His firefighter gloves were burned completely to his hands,” said Deabla.  Dealba says these firefighters will make a full recovery because of the extensive training they have received, having the best equipment possible thanks to city leadership, and with the help of the Montgomery police Department who also responded that night.  Graduates say they are now officially part of a new team, but they all rely on the teams that they have at home.  “The academy is physically and mentally challenging during the day, but at night time, you have many of the tasks you have to accomplish and couldn’t do it without the support of my family, my kids, and my wife,” said graduate Evan Quaco.

Ann Arbor fire crews were called to the 1200 block of Heather Way around 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, for a fire in an exterior wall of a home. When officers arrived, they found smoke in the residence and an active fire in an outside wall.  Crews were able to quickly extinguish the fire. There were no injuries.  Although crews were initially confused at the placement of the fire, the department said on social media, video from a neighbor’s exterior camera showed contractors using a blowtorch to kill weeds along the house.  “It should go without saying that using a blow-torch to kill weeds next to a structure is an incredibly poor decision,” wrote the fire department on social media. “It was very fortunate the residence did not suffer greater damage, and there were no injuries.”  The Ann Arbor Fire Department was assisted by crews from Dexter Area Fire Department and Pittsfield, Scio and Ann Arbor townships.

The Massachusetts Fire Marshal had been investigating after a fire destroyed the property’s clubhouse on May 7.  “Investigators believe this fire was intentionally set,” said Department of Fire Services Spokesperson Jake Wark in an email to The Light on Thursday.  Related  Wark added that it’s their policy not to release details on how suspicious fires begin, so he wasn’t able to provide more information about the country club fire. “This is to ensure that statements from witnesses and others aren’t influenced by facts or evidence they obtained from media coverage,” he said.  The agency is still seeking tips from witnesses. They can contact investigators directly at 978-567-3310 or through the Arson Watch Reward Program’s tip line, which offers rewards of up to $5,000 for information that helps detect or prevent arson crimes, at 1-800-682-9229.  No criminal charges have been brought as of Thursday afternoon, Wark said.  The country club at 970 Tucker Road in Dartmouth had been vacant since it closed in 2016. Recently, the family of fishing mogul Carlos Rafael acquired the property and entered an agreement to sell it to Toll Brothers, a national luxury home builder, for $3 million. But the deal hadn’t closed yet when the fire happened, and it’s not clear if the fire has had any effect on the agreement. Toll Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.  Rafael has served time in federal custody for mislabeling fish and falsifying records. His son-in-law, realtor and contractor Jeff Hathaway, spoke to news outlets about Toll Brothers’ plans to turn the property into condos for seniors after the deal was first announced last month. Hathaway did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  When investigators try to determine the cause of a fire, they look for the point of origin — usually the area with the most damage, Wark said. From there, investigators look for evidence of potential causes.  “Depending on the extent of damage, this may be easy, arduous, or impossible — and it can sometimes be ascertained only with heavy equipment and careful delayering,” Wark, the fire marshal spokesperson, said in an email.  The fire marshal has a dozen K-9s that can detect accelerants, and investigators may test samples from places where the dogs think they found something. Investigators also use witness accounts and video.  Wark did not provide any information on what specific evidence led investigators to rule the country club fire as a possible arson, but he said investigators hope to hear from anyone who has information on the fire.

Bloomington was released from the scene around 10:30 p.m., and fire investigators finished their work just after midnight.  The affected apartment sustained fire damage to the kitchen and moderate smoke and water damage throughout the unit.  Matt Swaney, spokesperson for the NFD, said in an email that fire investigators determined the fire was accidental in nature and was caused by cooking.  “Normal Fire Department reminds you to make sure your smoke alarms work, and if there is a fire, close the doors on your way out to limit the fire and smoke from spreading,” Swaney said.

TEXAS CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Officials have determined the cause of death of a worker in Monday's fire at the Marathon petroleum facility in Texas City.  The medical examiner's office said Scott Higgins died from burns and smoke inhalation, ruling his death as accidental.  ""We are deeply saddened to report that a Marathon employee has passed away as a result of the fire today at Marathon Petroleum's Galveston Bay refinery,"" a company statement sent on Monday read. ""We extend our deepest sympathies to our employee's family, friends and co-workers, and our thoughts are with them as we all mourn his passing. The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident.""  The family's attorney shared an image of Higgins.  The statement came hours after Texas City police had said the fire was under control and contained.  According to Marathon, the fire started at approximately 9:30 a.m., though what sparked the flames is unclear.  ORIGINAL REPORT: 1 Marathon Petroleum employee dies in Texas City refinery fire, company says  Texas City police added that no shelter in place was needed and there was no threat to the community, but air monitoring was conducted as a precaution.  Residents who live within a mile of the plant voiced frustrations Monday with the city's lack of communication about the incident, with one woman saying she found out through ABC13's website.  The Texas City Emergency Management Department has a free text alert system that is advertised on its website as being able to provide those who sign up with ""critical information quickly in a variety of situations."" However, some say they didn't receive any notification despite signing up for emergency alert texts.  ABC13 reached out to several people in Texas City's Emergency Management Department to find out why a text was not sent out through the alert system. Texas City officials said since the public did not need to shelter in place or evacuate, they did not use the emergency notification system.  ""Although the emergency notification system was not used in this incident because no public action was needed, moving forward, to ensure the comfort level of our community, we will push out messages through the system to let the public know they are safe and that no action is needed,"" the department's statement read, in part.  The city did, however, post about it on social media.  A report revealed that a pump leak may have caused the deadly fire. Officials said ""Naphtha"" was burning in the fire -- which is used to make cleaning solutions or varnishes. Experts ABC13 spoke to said a shelter-in-place should have been issued.

"fire","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Porto"", ""Norte"", ""Portugal""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:31:58","PORTO, Portugal – The opening morning of the Eighth International Wildland Fire Conference featured a range of civil leaders, fire managers, and scientific experts who helped circle the delegates around the dilemma of wildland fire: it is the problem and also (sometimes, but not always) the problem’s solution.  How a problem can be its own solution – the fire conundrum – is part of what drew some 1600 delegates from 90 countries to Porto, Portugal in mid-May.  The week-long conference included technical field trips on May 15 and the official opening May 16, followed by a keynote session labeled simply “The Problem.”  The opening included a videotaped welcome from António Guterres, the United Nations secretary-general, who cautioned that “We must keep global warming below 1.5 C” and if we’re to do so, he said, we must energize fire management that includes all voices, including indigenous leaders and communities. (And even though we must act to limit climate change, a UN World Meteorological Organization report this week has forecast a 66 percent chance we’ll reach the 1.5°C increase for a year during the next five years.)  The conference chair, Tiago Oliveira, board chairman of Portugal’s wildfire service Agency for Integrated Rural Fire Management (AGIF), opened with guidance: “We need to take out the emotional side of fire and replace it with the rational management of fire.” Yet he also reminded attendees of the emotional reality of wildland fire. “I am a survivor as many of you are and we are here to build a better future. To ask for help as I did in 2017” – when Portugal endured a storm of fires that killed 120 citizens and firefighters. An article in Scientific Reports suggests that the extreme fire season of 2017 may have been a prelude to future conditions and likewise events that are triggered by climate change effects. The immensity and challenge of these fires also led to the creation of AGIF.  “Every day that we are managing fires we are learning,” Oliveira continued. “We come here to build friendships in fire. The more friends we have in the world of forest fires the more successful we will be. And the world needs our contributions. The world needs less bad fire and more good fire.”  Gordy Sachs, chief of All Hazard and International Fire Support for the U.S. Forest Service and chair of the International Liaison Committee that planned the conference, reiterated the conference’s value globally. Statements from prior conferences [held every four years] influenced Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Agreement on climate, and the 2023 Conference will launch a key transition tool for international cooperation – the Landscape Fire Governance Framework – and will, like prior conferences, make each country and the world safer and more resilient.  Most of the opening, as is typical of international gatherings, offered the sort of civil and governance support that is key to implementing new frameworks. So it was heartening (if also disheartening) to learn from Antonia Cunha, president of Portugal’s North Regional Coordination and Development Commission, that he’s aware and concerned that 26 percent of carbon emissions in 2022 in the region was from forest fires.  Likewise, a commitment from Juan Cabandié, Environment Minister of Argentina, highlighted that his country needs to be more directed at planning and prevention. “We’re the eighth largest country in the world and 70 percent of our land at risk of wildfires,” he said. And to support its goals, Argentina has started its first monitoring system for entire country.  Duarte Cordeira, with Portugal’s Ministry of Environment, also returned the delegates to community. “We know that the best fire management is by the community members. If we want a more resistant forest that can provide economic and sustainable benefits, we cannot have a monoculture. We are increasing our defense with the creation of a protection ring of native forest.” He said already 200 of these native fuel breaks have been planted, with another 470 in the works and a goal of 800 villages. And Cordeira noted the challenge. “Yet 97 percent of rural properties are private,” he said, “so we need to increase subsidy for land consolidation.”  A conference opening offers a frame, and after a break for coffee and Pastéis de Nata, the conference jumped into “The Problem.” More on that soon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2lsZGZpcmV0b2RheS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLW1lZXRpbmctb3BlbnMtd2l0aC1maXJlLXByb2JsZW0tY29tbXVuaXR5LXNvbHV0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Christian Thomas Dahm, 45, faces one felony count of starting negligent fire that caused great bodily harm. He remained jailed Thursday.  The fire broke out at the fourplex about 11:30 p.m. Sunday in the 2600 block of Aspen Court off Glen Oaks Avenue and County Road D.  According to the criminal complaint, when responders got on scene, a townhome unit was fully engulfed in flames, which were spreading to adjoining units. Dahm’s father pointed at Dahm, who was on the back patio, and said, “He started the fire.”  Firefighters located Dahm’s mother inside her townhome unit. She had a pulse, but was struggling to breathe, and had slight burns. She was transported to Regions Hospital in critical condition.  Dahm told police he was in the garage working on his fishing pole over a car hood before the fire started. He said he was using an oil pan and lit a cigarette with a torch and then “all of a sudden, there was a fire,” the complaint states.  Meanwhile, Dahm’s father said he and his wife decided to check on their son before going to bed because they were concerned because they believed he was high on methamphetamine.  He said when he opened the service door to the garage, it appeared as though “everything exploded.” He saw his son run out of the garage.  A neighbor told police that she saw Dahm and his father pull into their driveway before the fire and that Dahm was “cursing and swearing” and making loud noises in the garage.  The fire spread from one townhome to another, where KARE 11 anchor Rena Sarigianopoulos’ parents live, and she wrote on GoFundMe that their home was destroyed.  Dahm’s mother remained in the burn unit at Regions Hospital on Tuesday, the complaint said. She was on a ventilator.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4td2hpdGUtYmVhci1sYWtlLXRvd25ob21lLWZpcmUtdGhhdC1jcml0aWNhbGx5LWluanVyZWQtbW90aGVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","1998-11-17","Not Discerned","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:14:16","Frank Klopas is Chicago soccer.  His teammates from the Fire’s Double-winning inaugural year of 1998 know it better than anyone. “We used to call Frankie ‘the Mayor,’” said Jesse Marsch, back then a young journeyman midfielder with a serious competitive streak. “We’d see the actual Mayor [Daley] in the airport and his whole entourage would come over and make sure they said hello to him [Klopas].  Born in Prosymna in Greece in 1966, Klopas made his mark on the city’s soccer scene long before MLS came to town. He emigrated to Chicago, won a championship with Mather High School, and signed straight up for the Chicago Sting’s final outdoor season before the original NASL folded – and then played several seasons for the Sting’s indoor team (MISL).    When the Fire launched as an expansion team in 1998, it was a no-brainer to bring Klopas – then in his early 30s – back home to help lead the city’s team in the emergent new professional top flight (MLS).  “It was near the end of my career,” said Klopas, who played in Greece with AEK and in the U.S. National Team in the lean years of American professional soccer between the old NASL folding (1984) and MLS emerging in 1996. “I was so grateful for the chance to go back and finish my career where it all started.  “It was so special to be able to play my last few years in front of my family and in my hometown – and also to have soccer back in the city.” he said about his return after two years with the Kansas City Wiz (now Sporting Kansas City).  Made for the Big Moments  Klopas was built for the big occasions. He was an eager striker with a near-liquid stride and a keen eye for goal before injuries took their toll. His Chicago homecoming, in what were his autumn years, could have ended as a sentimental swansong – a simple and empty gesture. Instead, he etched his name again into the lore of the city’s soccer by scoring the golden goal, deep in extra-time against the Columbus Crew, that saw the Fire finish that first season with a rare League and Cup Double.    In addition to the unforgettable winner at Soldier Field, he also scored the first goal of that 1998 Cup run. It came at a very different venue in the city, Forest View Park in Arlington Heights, and against the semi-pro Chicago Stingers. “Those games are tough. Not easy at all. Those guys [the Stingers] were ready to go and they were hungry,” Klopas remembered of the game the Fire won 3-1 after trailing in the 85th minute and facing early elimination.  “It came down to little details,” he said of the comeback that began with him sneaking in at the near post and nabbing the equalizer. “In the end it’s down to us making a couple plays. And the rest is history.”  Klopas is quick to deflect attention away from himself and point out the true secret behind that famous 1998 team. “Some of our training sessions were harder than the games,” he said of the spirit a then-young Bob Bradley fostered in a squad that had a core of young Americans like Marsch and Josh Wolff – and a raft of eastern-europeans led by captain Piotr Nowak, Lubos Kubik and Jerzy Podbrozny.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzc29jY2VyLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMvMDUvYS1oZXJvcy1yZXR1cm4tZm9yLWN1cC13aW5uZXIta2xvcGFzLXRoZS1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mahoning Valley fire Chief Mark Ebbert said the fire broke out at 10:25 a.m. at a detached garage at 44 Boyko Drive.  “The garage was fully involved when the first units arrived,” Ebbert said.  Ebbert said the garage was a total loss.  He said firefighters were on scene for a little more than two hours because there was extensive overhaul and mop up.  “There was exposure to the house, which did sustain some damage,” Ebbert said. “And there was a small brush fire in the woods area that it also started.”  Ebbert said there were occupants at home at the time, but everyone got out safe.  No injuries were reported, he said.  Ebbert said the fire is under investigation.

"fire","2023-05-01","20:00:00","{""Gatineau"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:41:15","HULL − The state has said it will not count nearly 100 ballots cast between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday and has called into question the validity of the entire town election after a large house fire prevented potential voters from accessing the polls.  The six-alarm fire blocked traffic to Hull High School, the town's only polling place, for an hour and a half. The road reopened at 7 p.m. Monday, an hour before polls were initially set to close.  Hull officials made the last-minute decision to extend voting by two hours to accommodate those who wished to vote, and retroactively asked Plymouth County Superior Court to authorize the extension and permit the counting of ballots cast during that time.  On Wednesday night, the town was told the votes would not be counted and ""the court's decision also calls into question the validity of the election due to the unfortunate disruption of the voting,"" the clerk's website reads. ""The town is reviewing the decision and determining the next steps.""  The last frontier?Weymouth, Quincy struggle with slow redevelopment on Route 3A  More:The tide finally might be turning for one of Hull's last undeveloped waterfront lots  According to Hull Town Clerk Lori West's petition to the court, she and town attorney James Lampke consulted with the elections division at the secretary of state's office before they decided to keep the polls open for two hours beyond the scheduled closing time. Efforts to reach a judge for an emergency order afterhours on Monday were unsuccessful, the petition says.  The town told residents about the extension using an emergency phone system some residents were signed up for, as well as robocalls, social media and Hull Community Cable. West said the candidates, most of whom were at the polls throughout the day, were notified of the decision and were “receptive and understanding.”  ""Everyone involved in the process stepped up to the plate to do the right thing and make the best of an unusual situation,"" Lampke said.  West's petition says “80 or so votes” were cast between 8 and 10 p.m., enough to swing at least one race on the ballot.  ""Until the election results are finalized and certified by the town clerk, she cannot administer the oath of office to some of the candidates where the race was too close to call,” the petition reads.  Court calls for new election to count votes of 'disenfranchised' residents  The court decision by Judge Brian Glenny cites several reasons for calling the town election invalid.  He said there was no way to ensure that the town's efforts to broadcast the information reached every citizen who intended to vote. He also said police officers managing traffic around the fire did not know immediately that the polling hours were being extended. Those officers told people they were not be able to vote, and there is no way to know if those people found out later they could return to the polls.  ""There exists a very real likelihood that citizens were disenfranchised during the May 15, 2023, town election,"" Glenny wrote. ""In the view of the court, a new election is the only just remedy for the unfortunate circumstances.""  Rollins accused of leaking Quincy bridge inquiry: 'Don't say I never gave you anything'  Winter Street: Nonprofit proposes 34-unit building for 'extremely low-income' residents in Quincy  Fewer than 100 votes could swing Hull election  Candidates sought 18 seats on 13 different Hull boards and committees in Monday's election, but it appears only one was close enough to be swung by a difference of 80 to 100 votes.  In a race for a seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority board, Patrick Finn holds a 15-vote lead over Daniel Kernan. Another seat on the Hull Redevelopment Authority was won handily by Adrienne Paquinn.  Tied closely to the results of the race is the fate of a 12.5-acre parcel of undeveloped land between a Weir River Estuary bay and the Atlantic Ocean. The land is one of the last parcels of open beachfront in Hull and has been the subject of several failed ideas over the years.  There is agreement among residents and the redevelopment authority that the land has untapped potential, but reaching consensus on exactly what and what not to do with it has proved more challenging.  The Hull Redevelopment Authority has most recently solicited input from residents on its plan to built 117 residential units, a 65-room hotel and retail space that adds up to 181,700 square feet of new buildings. Under the current draft, 68% of the property would remain open space.  Finn has expressed stronger support for the commercial development of the property than his opponent. Kernan supports an alternative plan that would emphasize developed open space, as does Paquinn.  This is a developing story. Please check PatriotLedger.com for the latest updates.

Zoraida Diaz, who's Afro-Latina, started the position last month after serving nearly two decades in the Oakland Fire Department.  Only about 6% of fire chiefs are women across the country. Diaz says when she started out it was never her goal to become a Fire Chief, but her passion for helping people led her to her purpose in fire service.  ""This is my dad. I have to acknowledge him because my dad, when I was going through the academy, he was with me for six and a half months. He would prepare meals for me to make sure that I was healthy the whole time that I was in the academy,"" said Diaz.  It’s been 19 years since Zoraida Diaz joined Oakland’s Fire Dept. On April 28th, she was publicly recognized as Chief of the Fremont Fire Dept. becoming its first woman and Afro-Latina to serve as Chief.  ""For me, I’ve always been driven. So, no one is going to stop me from being successful, is how I looked at it. Really, I was able to get the respect because I had the credibility of working every position but also who I was when I started in the academy, is who I’ve always been,"" Diaz said.  Fifty-five-year-old Diaz was born and raised in Harlem, NY with her siblings to Puerto Rican parents. After earning a master's degree, she worked as a social worker for over a decade and left New York to eventually settle in Hayward. Soon after, a friend from Oakland’s Fire Dept. introduced her to fire service.  ""Being a former athlete, I just looked at the teamwork and the camaraderie in that exercise, and I was like wow this looks like something I can do,"" Diaz said.  Diaz served as Deputy Chief for two years in Fremont before becoming Fire Chief. She now manages over 150 people and plans to hire a 14th company or fire crew, to expand the Dept.  ""We’re all engaged in doing research or identifying best practices on how we can better serve the community of Fremont,"" Diaz said.  After nearly two decades of service, Diaz says she’ll retire in three to four years to spend time with her family and travel with her fiancée Paula.  ""I weighed 115 lbs. I knew nothing about mechanical aptitude. I knew about the fire service. I was a social worker for 15 years, and I was 36-years old. So, I say to anyone who’s interested in pursuing a career in the fire service, that if I can do it, so can you,"" Diaz said.  Right now, there are six women serving as firefighters here in Fremont. Diaz says she also plans to hire three Division Chiefs and a Fire Marshall in the next 18 months.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eS1vZi1mcmVtb250LWFwcG9pbnRzLTFzdC13b21hbi1hbmQtYWZyby1sYXRpbmEtZmlyZS1jaGllZtIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0dnUuY29tL25ld3MvY2l0eS1vZi1mcmVtb250LWFwcG9pbnRzLTFzdC13b21hbi1hbmQtYWZyby1sYXRpbmEtZmlyZS1jaGllZi5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Fires that broke out in Lynn on May 12, May 13 and May 17 are being looked at by investigators with the Lynn Fire Department and the Massachusetts State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the state fire marshal’s office as “suspicious,” according to a joint statement from Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation and Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey.  Celino noted that red flag conditions – high winds, low humidity and very dry vegetation – leave the possibility for wildfires to happen.  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” Celino said in the statement. “Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  With the help of mutual aid partners, these fires were taken care of without any serious injuries or property damage to the area, Sullivan added.  Read more: GoFundMe set up for family businesses destroyed in fire in Worcester  Investigators now ask the public to share any information they may have about these fires. They ask that anyone “who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods on these dates or has other information on the fires” to call the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or call the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225.  The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association, which offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters have the option to remain anonymous.  One of these fires burned from the Lynn Woods Reservation, hopped over Route 1 and began to burn through the Breakheart Reservation in Saugus, WCVB reported.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” Ostroskey said in the statement. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

There’s too many people building,” said resident Ruth. “The traffic here is incredible there’s accidents all the time.”  “They put up a huge amount of apartments just recently right off Treeline,” said nearby neighbor Mike. “I’m afraid it’s going to get so populated that it’s going to take away from the beauty of it.”  As the city gets working on the next fiscal year, Fort Myers Fire wants to bring a new fire station along Treeline Ave, closer to Daniels Pkwy.  The department is teaming with Park and Rec to also bring a park and art space on this piece of land.  “We’re just trying to do things a little smarter,” said Fire Chief Tracy McMillion. “So it’d be a fire station, having a park there and also being a cultural hub of artwork and coolness all in one particular space.”  It’s not just about the green space, as more are built in the southeast part of the city – Chief McMillion tells NBC2 Fort Myers fire is trying to keep up with quick response times.  There are eight fire stations spread throughout the city; Most can get to a home or incident within 11 minutes.  For this part of Ward 6, response times jump to 12-15 minutes in neighborhoods like Marina Bay, Plantation Gardens, Arborwood, Legacy at Gateway, and others.  “We’re seeing a lot more call volume in certain areas that used to not have that,” said McMillion. “And that’s what we’re doing we’re trying to look for a fire, an emergency saturation, and so basically if one station goes out, we want to have the ability for another station to back them up with just a little greater time.”  The city would still need to purchase the land for more than a million dollars, which already sits in front of Fort Myers’ East Water Tank.  If approved, the project would be part of 2024’s budget, there’s no timetable for how long this idea could take.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmJjLTIuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9wcm9wb3NlZC1maXJlLXN0YXRpb24taW4tZm9ydC1teWVycy1haW1zLXRvLWltcHJvdmUtcmVzcG9uc2UtdGltZXMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9uYmMtMi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3Byb3Bvc2VkLWZpcmUtc3RhdGlvbi1pbi1mb3J0LW15ZXJzLWFpbXMtdG8taW1wcm92ZS1yZXNwb25zZS10aW1lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Regulators had originally sought to fine the utility $155 million for two regulatory violations blamed in the fire that left four dead and destroyed more than 200 homes in Shasta and Tehama counties. The deal, as approved, will impose a $10 million fine and then specify that the $140 million balance be paid by shareholders to bolster record keeping and vegetation management in high fire risk areas.

CPUC Regulators alleged the tree that leaned onto the line, triggering the fire, had been earmarked for removal but wasn’t removed due to PG&E’s poor recordkeeping.  PG&E disputed that interpretation and challenged the regulatory findings. The settlement does not resolve the dispute, but does require PG&E to better track trees to ensure those marked for removal are identified by a signed and dated record that includes precise geographic data. The $140 million settlement will also pay for more training, improved data management and investments in local fire safety councils and other fire education efforts.  In a statement, PG&E says it’s “a different company today” under CEO Patti Poppe, and outlined various initiatives during her tenure, including reconfiguring its equipment and a ten year plan to underground 10,000 miles of its power lines. The company says it is “working tirelessly to make our system safer every day.”  As for the specifics surrounding the fire, PG&E says it has accepted Cal Fire’s finding that a tree which fell onto its power line was the cause of the Zogg fire, and has resolved many of the civil claims.  “This settlement agreement allows us to continue focusing our time, resources and efforts to continue to make our system safer now, rather than on a hearing related to events several years ago,” the utility said. “Our objective is to focus on continuing to make things better for our communities.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxL9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2JheWFyZWEuY29tL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL3BncGUtcGF5LTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLXpvZ2ctZmlyZS8zMjMyODIxLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The webinar series is expected to bring visibility to the research community in fire safety engineering and to promote much needed interactions between fire safety engineers, fire ecologists, atmospheric scientists, geographical scientists and beyond. Comprised of 31 videos, the series offers a 15-week, 3-hours-per-week format, and provides a basis for an educational course on wildland fires in an academic engineering program. The webinars address such topics as fire behavior, fire ecology, weather and atmospheric science, fuel ignition, flame spread, fire emissions, mitigation measures, and other topics.  The new wildland webinar series represents a community-level effort, featuring a diverse group of leading experts on wildland and wildland-urban-interface fires. The webinar videos feature 29 instructors, mostly from the U.S., Australia, and Europe.  “The problems posed by wildland fires and wildland-urban-interface (WUI) fires are at the interface between separate scientific communities, [including] fire safety engineers, fire ecologists and atmospheric scientists, and there is a need to share information and knowledge between these communities so that we can better coordinate efforts and collectively develop solutions to mitigate the negative impact of wildland/WUI fires on the human, ecological and climate systems,” said Arnaud Trouvé, Chair of the IFSC and Professor of Fire Protection Engineering at the University of Maryland.  The videos are hosted on FSRI’s Fire Safety Academy online learning platform and are accessible at FSRI.org.

"fire","2023-05-04","Not Discerned","{""Fayetteville"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:16:43","[Episcopal News Service] A lightning strike – that actuarial “act of God,” as junior warden Mark Hamilton puts it – brought together the congregation of Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Southern Pines, North Carolina, in a most unexpected way this year.  The storm damage wasn’t as remarkable as what it required of parishioners: When the lightning knocked out the church’s fire alarm system on Jan. 4, leaders at Emmanuel and the school on church grounds quickly mobilized a human fire watch, a rotation of more than 50 volunteers. They maintained 24-hour-a-day protection of the facilities from fire, a human alternative to the automated alarm system, while the old system was replaced.  “You never realize how thankful you are for what you take for granted until you lose it,” Hamilton told Episcopal News Service.  “We thought that might be a couple weeks, maybe three weeks,” Jill Connett, head of school at Episcopal Day School, said. Instead, repairs dragged on, and the human fire watch lasted nearly four months. “When this hit, I will tell you, it brought the church and school community together a little more.”  Now, the church and school are celebrating the end of the fire watch. Fire marshals certified that the newly installed replacement fire protection system was operational on May 4. A party for fire watch volunteers is planned for later this month, with matching T-shirts in the works.  “Some people said they’re going to kind of miss it, the form of exercise, the form of fellowship,” Hamilton said. But he made sure to add an obvious caveat: “I don’t think we’d want to do it forever.”  A fire watch works exactly like you might imagine. For each hourlong shift, at least one volunteer had to stroll the entire church campus and its six buildings. They span more than four acres across one city block in this central North Carolina community, about a 40-mile drive west of Fayetteville. It usually took volunteers about a half hour to complete one circuit, so twice an hour they would look in every room of each building, checking for signs of smoke or fire. And “if you did detect fire, your job is to call the fire department,” Hamilton said.  The initial emergency happened around 6 a.m. Jan. 4, when the lightning struck somewhere on the church campus. “I happened to be at the church when it hit, and it sounded like a bomb went off,” Hamilton said.  The power stayed on, but Connett reported that internet service in the school was down and the fire alarm system was beeping. The church founded the now-independent school in 1963, and the church and the school still share an interconnected fire alarm system.  Within a day or two of investigating the problem, the church’s fire security firm informed leaders that the old system couldn’t be fixed and had to be replaced. The fire marshal further informed them that, without an automated system, the church would have to form a fire watch to rely on human eyes, or else face closure because of the exposure to potential harm and property damage.  Under the emergency plan developed by Connett and the church’s wardens, the fire watch began on Jan. 6, with a logbook for each shift proving that volunteers were doing the checks required by the fire marshal. The school took responsibility for overnight coverage, largely with hired contractors, while the church recruited the volunteers who would walk the grounds during the day. Some school board members also took some shifts, and Connett covered nights when no one else was available.  “It almost became like a second job,” Connett said, describing how she and Hamilton coordinated shifts on a spreadsheet. “It’s been quite an ordeal.”  Because of the fire watch, no church services were cancelled, and no days of school were missed. The upgrades to the fire protection system cost more than $100,000, including hiring people to take overnight fire watch shifts, though all of that is expected to be covered by the church’s insurance policy.  Frank Holt, a vestry member who volunteered for fire watch shifts, told ENS he and others took the fire watch responsibility in stride. “It’s good exercise,” he said. “You can put in some miles.”  A few others brought their dogs with them. “We had some really great volunteer folks who really stepped up,” Hamilton said. And when the fire marshals came May 4 and said they could end the fire watch, it “was a great day.”  Connett agreed. “If you had seen my face,” she said, “it was like a huge weight was lifted.”  “What we kind of developed was a bit of a new community,” Hamilton said, a community of fire watch volunteers. “I think that was one of the benefits, one of the silver linings to this.”  After the fire system was restored, Connett spoke during the congregation’s annual day school Sunday service on May 7. Her message: “There are blessings that can come out of any circumstance.”  And the logbook? It got pretty thick after 17 weeks of fire watch shifts, but Hamilton sees no sentimental value in keeping it. He’s thinking of having it unceremoniously – and safely – burned.  – David Paulsen is a senior reporter and editor for Episcopal News Service.

The fire got out of hand in the remote area between the Whistle Stop Trail in West Farmington and the Irving Big Stop on Wilton Road, also known as U.S. Route 2 and state Route 4.  Forest rangers, with the help of the Farmington Police Department, found the person responsible. The transient who was not identified was issued a court summons on Wednesday for a civil violation of having a fire on the land of another without permission, Nelson said.  The summons has not yet been filed in the District Court. It will go to the District Attorney’s Office first. Without a name, which Nelson declined to reveal, it is difficult to know who the transient is. The person’s court date in a Franklin County court will be in August.  “We think it is important that (the community) know there is not a wildfire arsonist, as far as we know,” Nelson said.  It was made clear to the person not to set any more fires, he said. If more are set, the alleged firestarter could face criminal charges.  Advertisement  The state is in a precarious position for wildfires until more rain falls, Nelson said. Maine has had about 300 fires statewide, which is about half of the annual average, and it is only May.  “We will continue to patrol the area to check for illegal fires,” Nelson said.  The fire drew 45 firefighters from several departments. Tim “T.D.” Hardy, Farmington Fire Rescue chief, spotted smoke rising from the woods while he was at Aubuchon Hardware store on Wilton Road.  Firefighters had to make their own trail to get to the fire because there was no way in. They couldn’t get trucks to the scene and used utility terrain vehicles, hand tools and backpacks with water and pumps to put the fire out. Farmington and Kingfield Fire Rescue utility task vehicles, known as UTVs, are equipped with tanks and pumps.  As of Thursday, there had been at least six woods or brush fires this week in Franklin County.

The fire started in the garage early on Mother’s Day.  A heat lamp being used to keep some chicks warm likely caused the fire.  “Opened up our back bedroom door and it was glowing orange,” Stephanie Oswald said.  She and her husband Ryan say you become grateful for what you do have – for the lives saved.  Stephanie’s mother was staying with them for Mother’s Day.  “She was in this back bedroom that went first, so she was about six inches from this back wall,” Stephanie said.  By the time everyone got out, the fire was raging – fueled by strong winds.  “There was already about ten-foot flames over the garage,” she said.  “Just the heat from that blowing wind, it was like a blow furnace,” Ryann explained.  The said nearby flood zones also slowed down the response from firefighters. Two of the three roads that lead to their home remain closed, but most of what they lost can be replaced.  “After we got family and pets out, we moved our vehicles out of the way and then we just literally watched it burn,” Stephanie said.  Now they, along with their two kids and five pets, are all staying in an area hotel. It’s tough but they said people are making it more bearable.  “You really find out who your friends are and we have got so many friends that we, we had no idea how cared for we could be,” Ryan said  After losing so much they’re seeing just how many people have their backs and it’s giving them some new perspective.  Stephanie said, “It absolutely does. I find my whole demeanor different. It’s a very humbling experience.”  The Oswalds say firefighters worked hard to keep the flames from reaching their next-door neighbor’s home.  They’re still working through insurance to see what will be covered. A family member has set up a fundraising page for them.  The Oswalds lost everything in the fire so family and friends set up a GoFundMe* account to help them rebuild their lives.  *KSL TV does not assure that the money deposited to the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

Firefighters, aided by support group members, will simulate the staging and set up of the airfield evacuation site.  In case of an actual emergency the airfield site is a holdout position where community members will gather if the region’s two main access roads — Rock Creek Road and Mosquito Road — are blocked during a fire. Residents are encouraged to participate in the drill; in addition to an evacuation site for people, there will also be a simulated evac site for large animals and RVs.  Mosquito’s unique geography with limited routes in and out poses a specific challenge if a fire were to come through. Though the limited means of egress has long been known, the King Fire in 2014 made it clear to the community that preparation for a worst-case scenario was vital, according to one of the drill’s organizers, Taffy Warner.  “Prior to the King Fire we’d had discussions about fire drills but after how we were affected we knew we had to act,” Warner explained. “Rock Creek Road was suddenly exclusively for the use of fire personnel and that was a big eye opener for us.”  Mosquito Fire Chief Jack Rosevear shared he thinks the drills are particularly important for fire response as they keep residents and first responders aware of what to do and plan around.  “The biggest priority is bringing information to the community,” Rosevear said. “Information (such as) always having at least two escape routes; we as people often stick to a routine and a certain way, but in an emergency those may suddenly not be an option. Knowing that the airfield is a temporary resource while roads out are blocked, giving MFPD time to help with initial preparation and firefighting before the higher authorities come in, managing that chaos, it’s important. We’re planning ahead for the worst-case scenarios, like if the fire would impact the area directly near the airport itself.”  The Community Emergency Response Team will aid in the drill, setting up road signs and directing the pretend-evacuees. Last year’s drill saw around 50 households participating, not counting the many volunteers, according to Warner, and it is hoped with the weather being cooler this time around more residents will get involved.  Efforts like this fire drill show why Mosquito has the distinction of being designated a Fire Wise USA community. The Fire Wise designation stems from the collective work by MFPD, Sawnsboro Country Property Owners Association, Mosquito Fire Safe Council and residents to reduce fuel loads and keep the area prepared.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm10ZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL25ld3MvZmlyZS1kcmlsbC1oZWxwcy1tb3NxdWl0by1yZXNpZGVudHMtcHJlcGFyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  HARTFORD, Conn. — Ten adults and five children are displaced in Hartford's South End after police said a man intentionally started a fire inside a third-floor unit. Police have a suspect they're preparing a warrant for but have not identified the man they say started the fire.  Mother of two, Tamarra Ricketts, was doing her best to mask overwhelm Thursday after her first-floor unit was damaged by water and smoke. She was lying in bed with her family when her partner opened the door to find fire.  “It was a fight upstairs so they were fighting upstairs before all of this happened,” she said. “It was still a bunch of commotion, so he opened the door and that’s when he said the building’s on fire—get the kids.”  Most of her belongings inside this first-floor apartment on Wethersfield Avenue were damaged by smoke and water. All of it happened on her daughter Hinata’s 11th birthday.  “I was ok with the accident. But to know that somebody did this intentionally—not thinking about the other lives that lived in this building. It pisses me off.”  The family was gearing up for a backyard birthday celebration but is instead being assisted by the Red Cross, which is providing temporary housing for displaced families. Ricketts doesn’t know what she’ll do after that but says she’s going to celebrate her daughter’s birthday despite losing her home.  “I’m not going to let anything get us down. You know? We have God on our side so that’s all that matters.”  Authorities say the fire originated in a closet and was intentionally started by a man on the third floor.  “It seems like it was an attempt to harm himself or having a mental episode,” said LT Aaron Boisvert.  That man is being treated at the hospital for smoke inhalation.  “The good news is that some of these arsons go unsolved this one will not,"" added Boisvert.  But not all was lost. Twelve hours after families ran to the parking lot in terror, Ricketts found the stray kitten they rescued months ago wheezing under her daughter’s bed.  “Everybody was out alive and safe that was the most important thing. Material things can be replaced.”  Police have not charged the suspect at this time but said an arrest warrant is forthcoming.  The investigation remains active and ongoing.

New Zealand police started removing bodies from the Wellington hostel where multiple people were killed in Tuesday's fire. (George Heard/New Zealand Herald via AP)  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police on Friday lowered the confirmed death toll from a Wellington hostel fire from six people to five, although they said they still haven’t finished searching the dangerous four-story building.  And in another development, a man charged with two counts of arson in connection with the fire made his first court appearance. He was not required to enter a plea and was ordered held in jail until his next court appearance on June 19.  If found guilty, the man faces a maximum 14 years in prison on the charges. Police said they’re treating the case as a homicide investigation and could add more serious charges later.  Police Inspector Dion Bennett did not offer an explanation for why authorities had downgraded the death toll after they had put it at six since Tuesday, hours after the fire ripped through Loafers Lodge.  But he did say police have still not been able to search all areas of the building after parts of a roof and a floor collapsed in the fire and created piles of debris.  “The scene examination in itself, and in the third floor in particular, is quite dangerous,” Bennett told reporters. “And there are still parts we can’t cross.”  He said that urban search and rescue teams had been working with police to prop up sections of the floor as police inched forward with their examination. He said police have removed four bodies and hoped to remove the fifth soon.  The 48-year-old man charged with setting fire to a couch and to the lodge wore a black hoodie in court, waved his arms about and tried to fire his lawyer, local media reported.  Lawyer Douglas Ewen later told The Associated Press that the man remained his client. The judge granted the man temporary name suppression, a routine practice in the New Zealand legal system.  Police had earlier said there was a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The deadly fire ripped through the building at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or jumped from windows.  Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers, which are not required in older buildings that would need to be retrofitted.  New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said he’d asked his housing minister to investigate current building regulations to see if they need changing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLXdlbGxpbmd0b24taG9zdGVsLWZpcmUtYXJzb24tNjU3ODgxY2U1Mzc5MTlmZWI3OGI2MDllNGUxZTI1MGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Maine Fire Marshal Rich McCarthy and Kittery Fire Chief David O’Brien announced the news of the fatality. The person was found on the site around 2:15 p.m. The person's identity was not immediately announced pending the state medical examiner's determination. Federal investigators and York police investigated along with Kittery police, officials said.  “The investigation into the origin and cause of this fire is still under investigation, but at this time we believe all persons involved are accounted for,” McCarthy said.  All of the employees at the Days Inn were accounted for, O’Brien said.  The fire marshal said investigators said they did not know the gender of the deceased person.  O’Brien noted the fire attack on Wednesday was set up on the south side of the Days Inn, a 200-foot-long strip dubbed the “A side” of the building. The body was recovered about halfway down the A side of the building, he said.  “It was definitely in the area of the biggest burn in the building,"" O'Brien said. ""It was the area my firefighters were trying to make an attempt to get to the first three or four minutes of the fire.”  The owners of the building are not being investigated, the fire marshal said. He added that at the time of Thursday’s press conference at the Gorges Road fire station, the Days Inn's owners had yet to be notified of the death.  Fire crews were working Thursday at the site of the 85 Route 1 Bypass structure, which burned to the ground in a blaze that was reported at mid-day Wednesday and not reported under control until just after 6 p.m.  Chief describes Days Inn blaze as 'firefighter's nightmare'  Fire crews attempted to access one room within the Days Inn after receiving a report someone might be trapped inside it. Despite making entry to the building, O’Brien said responders could not make it any closer than two or three rooms near that point, forcing them to retreat and O’Brien making the call for responders to take up a defensive mode.  When firefighters entered the building, they did so without any hand lines to put out the fire.  “The building is wood frame with furniture, lots of material that burned inside that building. It is a firefighter’s nightmare with individual rooms and hallways and everything else,” O’Brien stated. “Trust me when I say that I was extremely hesitant when I sent my firefighters into that building to go make that initial primary search, they went into that building with no protection.”  While there have been past code violations against the Days Inn, the fire chief noted they had been corrected in recent years. The hotel, however, has likely not been inspected in a few years, O’Brien said.  Never miss a story: Follow local news on the Seacoastonline mobile app or the Fosters.com mobile app  Sprinkler system was not required in 1956 building  Mutual aid crews from local city and town fire departments within a 20-mile radius of Kittery, from both Maine and New Hampshire, responded to the hotel built in 1956. It did not have a sprinkler system.  According to Kittery Town Manager Kendra Amaral, the hotel was built before state building code required sprinkler systems, though all fire alarms in the Days Inn operated soundly at the time of the fire, she said.  “If this was to be reconstructed today, it would have to have sprinklers,” she continued.  Since 1994, the Days Inn property, which town officials noted was last assessed at $1,512,959, has been owned by Kittery Motor Inn Inc. State records list Rohit Patel as the owner.  A proposal to redevelop the property and construct a new hotel had been filed with the town on May 5, less than two weeks ago. The plans, submitted by Kamlesh Patel, called for a new four-story, 107-room hotel to replace the Days Inn, which would have been demolished.  A member of the Patel family declined to speak Wednesday as the Days Inn burned.  Though town officials gave consideration to the idea of demolishing the remainder of the Days Inn, Amaral said that won't happen Thursday. An excavator was brought to the 85 Route 1 Bypass site to move some of the debris, which was smoldering in areas among the rubble, in order to help officials continue their investigation.  While the property will be altered by the excavator, Amaral said, it won’t be a full demolition process.  “That will give the property owner and their insurer their opportunity to investigate the site,” she said.  Kittery manager thanks firefighters  “Firefighters were working throughout the night on the site,"" Amaral said on Thursday. “They have worked tirelessly and safely throughout this entire emergency and we are grateful for the work that they do, for our public safety dispatchers, from the police department and from responding communities.”  In the wake of the death, the Kittery Fire Department will undergo a critical incident stress debriefing.  The death at the Days Inn marks the first fatal fire in Kittery since a mobile home burned about three years ago, O'Brien said.  “I have several young firefighters ... this would be their first fatal fire,” O’Brien said. “We will bring them in. We have a chaplain. We will sit down and go through the debrief and discuss it, and have them understand that things like this happen. They did everything they could. We’ll deal with that. We offer counseling. We have to wake up every morning and do our job.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYWNvYXN0b25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvb25lLWZvdW5kLWRlYWQtZGF5cy1pbm4tZmlyZS1raXR0ZXJ5LW1lLXJvdXRlLTEtYnlwYXNzLzcwMjMxNDg5MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

[Previous Story: Old Pearl Cleaners building destroyed by fire]  The Evansville Fire Department confirmed a person of interest had been detained. After interviewing the man identified as Charles Perrin, Evansville police say he knowingly and intentionally set a fire in the building.  “Some of the statements he made did affirm that he did purposely set the fire,” said EPD Officer Mario Reid.  According to an affidavit, Perrin told investigators he set the fire for self-gratification, as he got an adrenaline rush. EPD officials say Perrin also told investigators that he left and soon came back to admire his work.  “The difference with this investigation is that we had three different agencies working very closely together,” Officer Reid said. “But not only were we working with the other agencies including the Evansville Fire Department, but we were also making contact with people in the community.”  Investigators brought Perrin back to the scene of the crime after interrogating him. Police say Perrin agreed to walk through the timeline and location of where everything happened.  “They [firefighters] were able to dig into the area a little bit and just verify what he said,” EFD Division Chief Mike Larson said.  Perrin now faces charges of arson and criminal mischief.  “Just all we ask is if you see something, say something,” Larson said. “So that helps tremendously for pretty much all investigations.”  25-year-old Charles Perrin (Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office)  That fire happened Wednesday around 2 a.m.  Evansville Division Chief Mike Larson says the fire was considered “out” around 8 a.m. Wednesday.

Charles James Perrin, 25, was booked into the Vanderburgh County jail on charges of arson and criminal mischief causing at least $50,000 in damages.  Perrin is accused of setting the blaze that gutted the former Pearl Cleaners building at 428 N.W. 3rd St. Once known as “Pearl Steam Laundry,” the structure had stood at the northern edge of Downtown Evansville for more than 100 years and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Evansville Fire Department spokesman and District Chief Mike Larson announced the arrest during a Thursday afternoon news conference alongside EPD Officer Mario Reid.  Reid claimed that after officers made contact with Perrin, he voluntarily came to EPD headquarters and reportedly admitted to setting the blaze. Police believe he was homeless at the time of his arrest.  At least one other media organization had obtained a probable cause affidavit in Perrin's arrest, but neither Evansville police nor the fire department made that affidavit available at the news conference.  According to Reid, the Indiana State Fire Marshal, which was investigating the cause of the blaze, ""presented"" the affidavit to the Vanderburgh County Prosecutor's office and the jail.  In addition, the Courier & Press requested detailed logs showing law enforcement and fire crews’ response to the blaze from Evansville-Vanderburgh Central Dispatch. The agency refused to release the records citing “an ongoing investigation.”  “Evansville Fire Department has not given us clearance to release anything pertaining to the incident as of yet,” operations supervisor Chase Collins wrote at 3:30 p.m.  More:Fire destroys former Pearl Cleaners site in Downtown Evansville  Who owns the building?  Like many large properties in Evansville, the Pearl Cleaners site is officially owned by a limited liability company.  According to the Indiana Secretary of State’s office, the building is owned through The Pearl Development LLC. Its registered agent is listed as Ryan Schulz: an attorney with Kahn, Dees, Donovan & Kahn.  After the Courier & Press reached out to Schulz on Thursday, Pearl Development LLC sent a news release. It was unsigned.  “Almost exactly one year ago we bought this historical landmark with the hopes of restoring it to usable commercial space,” the release states. “Our dream of revitalizing this iconic building and returning it to her former glory, (sic) is now ash.”  According to the Vanderburgh Assessor’s site, the LLC bought the property from the Korb family last June.  Reid confirmed during Thursday's news conference that police have talked to the current owner.  State documents and assessor’s records tie the property to Dr. Bachar Malek. When the Courier & Press reached out to him via an email address in state records, Malek said he was no longer associated with the property and that the current owners have been “trying to sell it for a while with no potential buyer.”  “The Pearl building last time I was there was completely empty only outside bricks and window left so you need to ask yourself, what got caught on fire?” he said.

That department’s website says property taxes were last paid in spring of 2022. As of Thursday, the owners owed more than $22,000.  There was no official word as of Thursday whether the building was insured.  The property was the target of a lawsuit  Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before. It was filed by WNIN – its former neighbor at the historic Carpenter House – stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  Pearl applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.  A plan filed in that lawsuit documented a 250-foot wide plume of groundwater contaminated with the solvent PCE on the Pearl Cleaners site.  'Pearl Steam Laundry' was on the National Register of Historic Places  According to a sign posted on the charred building, “Pearl Steam Laundry” was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 6, 1984 alongside several other Downtown buildings. It went on the state registry two years before that.  Now it’s gone.  What happens next?  Reid said the next step will be for code enforcement from the Evansville Building Commission to complete a inspection.  That report will then be turned over to the fire department to determine what needs to happen next.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVycHJlc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9oZXJlcy13aGF0LXdlLWtub3ctYWJvdXQtdGhlLXBlYXJsLWNsZWFuZXItZmlyZS1pbi1ldmFuc3ZpbGxlLzcwMjI5ODI2MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WWLP) – Controversy Wednesday night involving the budget for the District 1 South Hadley Fire Department, after a small group of taxpayers voted to reject funding salaries.  Wednesday night that budget was approved to fund District 1, but before that vote, we heard concerns from both sides of this issue, “I’ve been doing this for 32 years and I have never heard of the fire department being unfunded,” South Hadley Fire Chief, Robert Authier told 22News.  The majority of District 1 residents voted to approve appropriating a total of $2.7 million to fund the personnel services account for the fire department. But before that vote, concerns were raised about transparency when it comes to numbers within the budget, as well as a proposed amendment changing the districts health insurance.  Back in April, residents in District 1 originally voted no on the budget during their annual meeting, which ultimately stripped funding for wages for firefighters and paramedics. Top fire officials also at the meeting, urging voters of what would be at stake to not pass this funding.  Richard MacKinnon, President of Professional Firefighters of Massachusetts told 22News, “It’s a disaster for public safety here in South Hadley, what’s at stake is whether they are going to have fire, ems protection, and other emergency response for incidents that they respond to every day and every night.”  Again, the budget was approved Wednesday night, and ways to avoid something like this from happening again was also discussed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd3bHAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9oYW1wc2hpcmUtY291bnR5LzItN20tYnVkZ2V0LWFwcHJvdmVkLWZvci1zb3V0aC1oYWRsZXktZGlzdHJpY3QtMS1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQv0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3dscC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2hhbXBzaGlyZS1jb3VudHkvMi03bS1idWRnZXQtYXBwcm92ZWQtZm9yLXNvdXRoLWhhZGxleS1kaXN0cmljdC0xLWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Jefferson County Sheriff Peter Barnett says that a deputy and state trooper responded to 23378 County Route 59 in the town of Brownville around 6 p.m. to check on the welfare of someone who lived there.  The resident, later identified as 45-year-old Nathan Krump, allegedly brandished a weapon and fired one round toward the deputy.  Court papers say Krump yelled to police, “You’re going to get killed. Get off my property.” (See more about what police said in statements here.)  More shots followed.  “It was very chaotic to begin with. Shots fired in all different directions...going door to door, and getting the neighbors in the close proximity out of the area. And then when the gunshots started, moving more people farther distance away...We’re very, very lucky that everyone came out of this alive”  Krump allegedly went back into the home and the officers retreated to a safe spot to wait for backup.  The police officers’ statements say, “We began hearing gunshots and could hear the bullets whizzing past us.”  They called for backup. More officers arrived and brought in an armored vehicle and involved Watertown police, sheriff’s deputies, and state troopers. Police later realized there was a bullet hole in the windshield of a state trooper’s car.  While police were fired upon, no officer fired back.  Sheriff Barnett says officers didn’t get a clear shot and he would have had to give the command, which he was never asked to give. Barnett says he’s very proud of officers’ restraint.  Police blocked off the road and the neighborhood was evacuated.  “Each step is methodical. Let’s make sure that when we move, it’s right and we don’t make any mistakes,” said Barnett.  Word quickly spread around Pillar Point about what was happening.  “All of a sudden you go from a resting posture to a defensive one. Your senses are sharpened and you just try to be ready for whatever,” said neighbor Richard Dodge.  Authorities set up a perimeter and members of the sheriff’s office and the Watertown Police Department tried to communicate with Krump.  A fire started and the house was quickly engulfed. Police said Krump tried to get away by riding a tractor. He was tased and taken into custody at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.  Krump was charged with first-degree attempted murder. He was jailed without bail following his arraignment in Watertown city court Wednesday morning.  Four members of the sheriff’s office were taken to Samaritan Medical Center for evaluation.  We know one deputy was hit by the tractor Krump allegedly used to allegedly flee the scene.  Another sprained his ankle while running under gunfire to evacuate a neighboring home.  The investigation by the sheriff’s office, state police, and country district attorney’s office is ongoing. Police say more charges are pending.  Also assisting were the Watertown Police Department, county Fire and Emergency Management, the 911 dispatch center, county fire investigators, Samaritan Medical Center, and fire departments from Brownville, Sackets Harbor, Glen Park, Chaumont, town of Watertown, Three Mile Bay, Black River, and Northpole.

(NEWS10) – Nearly a week with no rain and with winds expected to gust up to 35 mph, fire dangers throughout the Capital Region are still a concern. NEWS10 has more on the dangerous conditions.  There are three ingredients to make a fire. You need fuel, heat and oxygen. Officials say the current conditions are the perfect recipe to cook up a dangerous fire.  Art Hunsinger, former Clifton Park Fire Chief, says these ingredients are easy to spot.  “All the dry stuff that’s still on the ground, the leaves that were under the snow that are still sitting on the ground now blowing around, the pine needles that are left over that would be dry from last summer that are on the roadway. People are changing out to new mulch now that spring is here. Old mulch is so dry that a good heat on that mulch is just going to travel right down the mulch, and if it’s back to a building, it’s going to burn a building if we’re not careful,” said Hunsinger.  Stephen DiRenzio, Warning Coordination meteorologist with the U.S. National Weather Service in Albany, says the conditions are perfect for out-of-control fires.  “Winds and the dry conditions are the two biggest problems. The winds keep things dry. And we’ve had no rain. And then yes, they can definitely push the fire along,” said DiRenzio.  DEC commissioner, Basil Seggos, says the entire state of New York is under a fire danger risk and released the following statement on Twitter:  “Fire danger is now high in all of New York State due to lack of precipitation. Please exercise extreme caution with campfires, any back yard burns, and discarded cigarette.”  “Driving around I still see people throwing cigarette butts out their car windows and this is probably not the time to do that,” said DiRenzio.  “It’s enough to start something like here on fire. A lit cigarette thrown out of the window in an area like this. If it’s hot enough it’s gonna start this stuff on fire and the wind is gonna take it,” said Hunsinger.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxMC5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXcteW9yay11bmRlci1pbmNyZWFzZWQtcmlzay1mb3ItZmlyZS1kYW5nZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to the Benewah County Sheriff's Office, the fire destroyed the home, spread to a neighboring house and damaged at least two nearby vehicles.  First responders discovered a fully engulfed residence along with two cars at South Fifth Street and West Jefferson Avenue after receiving a report of a fire at about 11:20 p.m. First responders were notified of a person still trapped inside of the home, a sheriff's office release said.  Additional law enforcement and backup fire crews were called to the scene as the growing number of people outside of the burning home started to interfere with first responders, the sheriff's office said. Tribal police were also called in to assist with crowd control, the sheriff's office said.  One man was arrested on suspicion of obstruction after he tried to take firefighting equipment from a fire truck and pushed a police officer and firefighter, the sheriff's office said.  Electricity in the neighborhood was cut as the fire reached power lines at about 12:40 a.m.  Fire crews knocked down the fire in the early morning hours on Monday and recovered the body of a 14-year-old girl. Officials in Benewah County said they are not releasing the girl's name out of respect for the family.  The fire was caused by a damaged electrical cord to a chest freezer, according to a statement from Idaho State Fire Marshal's Office investigators.

Aberdeen and Hoquiam firefighters initially responded to the call, with the first personnel to respond seeing smoke and flames from a bedroom on the second floor rear of the apartment building, according to the news release. A second alarm was sent out, with Grays Harbor Fire District 2 and off-duty firefighters requested to assist.  An initial report that there was someone in the fire was countered by Aberdeen police officers, who were able to confirm the building was clear.

We've had *** fire at the day's end. The building is roughly 240 ft by about 100 ft. It was heavily involved on arrival. The call came in at 123. We were on scene within the first four minutes. The second alarm was struck within two minutes after that. And the third alarm was struck about 15 minutes after that. We have now gone to *** five alarm fire which encompasses most of the Sea Coast community. It's *** good thing. We have mutual aid in this case and that's what it's for. The building is valued at $1.649 million by the con assessor. It is *** total loss. There is nothing left of the building. I'm sure you've been down there and had videos taken of it. All right. At this time, we have, we are still looking, we do not have all persons accountable. The fire marshal was called instantly into this and fire marshal and ATF are on scene starting the investigation and doing the interviews at this time. They, like I said, we don't know how many at this point in time we are possibly, we have one, possibly two that's unaccounted for the water supply was the fire outgrew our water supply instantly within the first five minutes of this fire. Hence, we had to bring extra tank trucks in from around the area. And I know at this point in time, we have, I believe I just talked to the water supply officer that we had 11 different communities with tank trucks here. So that helped us be able to get the water up. The building is *** non fire suppressed building. It is alarm panel. So everybody, the alarms were going off on arrival. Any questions you need to speak up because that's pumping. It's interesting. The wind is coming, the wind is coming from the northwest. The building fire actually started on the southeast side but just as soon as the start of the evacuation doors were left open underneath and the wind blew right through and blew that right up. One of our major concerns on arrival is *** 500 gallon propane tank that was was in impingement and it was at 70%. So most of our water and the initial stock was worried about that propane tank and *** situation of having that gas off. So we actually protect our firefighters that way. And I will, if I will, we made an interior search on this building. When we found out *** room number of *** possibility of an occupant, we made the interior search with no hand lines, no water lines to make an entrance into this, to see if we could make *** rescue and do *** search. They got to that the second floor, basically the first floor from roadside, they got to the second floor and got within two rooms of that and could not go any further. That was way, way, way too much fire. And *** point at that time, and they had to turn around at that point in time when they said that they could not make entrance into that room or anything close to that room. We went to *** strictly defensive mode to protect the firefighters. I have one firefighter with *** laceration and the other injury we have is from *** passer by that came to watch the fire. She went down and they're working with her. Now, not at this time when we got there, police were doing *** very good job of opening doors and getting and getting them out. We got there. There were actually people who had been out, were running back in to get shoes and things like that. So the police did an incredible job. The kid police needed *** pat on the back because I'm busy trying to figure out how I'm going to fight this fire and they're in there trying to get the people out before we got there. So have no idea how many people is there anything about this particular fire that made this especially challenging for your department. The wind, lack of water, wind size of the fire, the size of the building, lack of *** fire suppressed building. All those add up. Not yet. At this time it's under investigation. That's something that my town manager will deal with. She's *** public relations on this fire. That's something she can handle very well. I have heard the same things. Yes. The fire extended next door. I understand it's coming winds coming from the northwest. We have *** building that sits dead south to it. We have its York Hospital, physical therapy and also health club. There's *** gazebo out there that I think the roof kind of came off that much fire that quick, that much heat and that much Amber. We also had fires across the street that was said several woods, fires and brush fires extended, almost got into one side of the house and was quickly knocked down and we have had brand patrol all the way out to route one on state road and they've been knocking down fires out there in the woods and things like that. When will, you know, if this fire is clear of any casualties? When will we know? Not for *** while? Probably that that much destruction will be *** while before we get, figuring out where we're going, the investigation into this? Look like once you finally do put the fire out, I mean, what would be the next steps will be determining where we start to look. We have an idea. We will start to work with the fire marshals office. I have two marshals investigators on scene now and I understand the sergeant is on his way down at that point in time, we will direct efforts with the firefighters into those areas that have major concern for where we think there could be *** possibility of that issue. When was the last time your department's dealt with *** buyer of this size? Oh, that's *** good question. I mean, we deal with fires all the time. We've had *** very busy winter with structure fires. This one, this one is *** big one. I mean, years ago that burnt, I was *** firefighter when that whole place burned. But I guess we had *** major one down the village. It was maybe 15 years ago that went to *** third alarm, but most of our stuff is handled with *** single alarm, maybe two alarm fires, residential type buildings *** long time since I was at 1/5 alarm. Within *** half hour. Yeah. And this, we haven't had *** five alarm fire here in *** long time. Any idea how long the roads are going to be blocked for? I'm sorry, how long the roads are going to be blocked until we're done? You said 11 communities have tankers here. How many agencies? Well, I think if you go 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way and 20 miles that way you can grab everybody's name *** town. I'll tell you they're here. How many 16, approximately 16 communities, things like that? Any other questions? We will, we will have another briefing probably later tonight after we know more about what's happening up there. I would probably schedule that. Maybe. What time is it now? I know I'm not going to help your six o'clock news, so it will probably be closer to maybe eight, which will help your 11 o'clock news. So I'll let, let's plan another one for eight o'clock to figure out that person right there. My boss. He any other questions? Thanks for being so patient and I have to get back to work.

In a news release, Deputy Fire Chief Steve Shay said an apartment fire was reported around 5:30 p.m. at a Cedar Street housing facility with two buildings containing 48 apartments in total and a shared common interior hallway. The fire began in one of the first floor apartments and quickly spread to the hallway siding, which caused heavy smoke to spread to all the apartments on the first and second floors, Shay said.  According to Shay, many elderly residents needed to be rescued from their apartments, approximately seven of which were removed from second floor windows on ladders. Others were rescued using interior stairways. As firefighters extinguished the blaze, crews quickly searched each apartment and removed residents from the building. They also rescued several pets, Shay said.  Police also banged on doors in the building to alert residents of the fire. Two residents were taken to a hospital while other residents were treated at the scene by emergency medical service officers and released, Shay said. The building was declared unfit for occupancy and the number of displaced residents is still being counted, according to Shay.

The Police Department’s proposed budget totals $6.7 million, an 8.61% increase over the previous year’s budget, while the Fire Department’s proposed budget comes in at $4.8 million, a 4.89% increase.  The police department is looking to add three squad cars, including one undercover vehicle, according to a briefing by outgoing Chief Doug Overman.  Also included in next year’s additions is a Labrador retriever K-9 unit, which is expected to join the force in June.  The total proposed budget for the city comes in at just under $139 million. Last year’s budget totaled $115.4 million.  The budget includes some funds from opioid settlements, the reception of which was described as a surprise by City Manager Doug Russell. He anticipates the city to get around $16,000 per year for up to around 20 years, which he is hoping will be pooled with the portion received by the county to continue their joint co-responder mental health stabilization program.  The program is currently funded by a state grant, but local leaders have been looking for a revenue source to keep it going.  The fire department is looking to upgrade its radio systems and upgrade the chassis on a fire truck, according to Chief Dan Pearce.  The ambulance service is funded almost entirely by Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, according to Pearce, although low rates and unpaid bills mean that expenses are passed on to city taxpayers.  Mayor Mark Johnson described the roughly $800,000 funding gap for ambulance services that result as a “bitter pill to swallow,” but said that he thought it was a critical local service and preferred taxpayers footing the bill to a privatized ambulance service outside of the city’s control. He also pointed out that the projected number is less than the over $1 million that taxpayers paid only a few years ago.  The parks department's $4 million budget looks much the same as in previous years, with a previously ratified uptick in certain recreation and permitting fees boosting the department’s revenues.  New expenses for the department this year include higher prices on vehicle fuel and natural gas for pool heating, a new garage to maintain their fleet of vehicles, and roughly $20,000 to implement a new online reservation and registration system, according to department head Chad Fincher.  Fincher said the new program would minimize phone calls and printouts, as well as allow the community to sign up for department programs outside of regular business hours.  The city won’t adopt the final budget until property valuations come in from the state. Those numbers typically arrive in mid-August.  COUNCIL ALSO approved the final plat for the third phase of the Bloomstone development, which is located at 1070 Treeline Road on the north side of town. The project is slated to include 47 single-family homes on approximately 10 acres.  The council meets again on Monday, June 5.

Dan Krauth has the story.  The city of New York has seen an explosion in battery fires sparked by e-bikes and e-scooters. There have been 80 e-battery fires so far this year, including 60 injuries and nine deaths.  The city leads the nation in e-battery fires. Cities like Los Angeles and Seattle have reported about a dozen in the same time period. Other cities like Houston don't track them.  7 On Your Side Investigates had to look across the pond, to London, to find a major city that's experiencing a similar deadly rise in fires.  The British city has a similar number of electronic devices and fires reported this year.  ""It's our fastest growing fire trend,"" said Charlie Pugsley, the Asst. Commissioner of the London Fire Brigade. ""We're up to around one fire every two days from e-bikes or e-scooters,"" he said.  They've launched a media campaign called Charge Safe and they took action in the transit system. The city banned all e-bikes and scooters from the Tube where the flames and smoke could be especially dangerous, and people have no way to escape.  ""When you consider a metro subway system, if you have a fire there with open carriages, you have nowhere to go and so we fully understand and support Transport for London's decision there,"" said Pugsley.  There's a similar fire concern in New York City. The MTA took action recently. They didn't ban e-devices from trains. Instead, they banned people from charging them on board and the new policy states they have to be powered off.  ""In the news, every kind of incident that we heard of these things going on fire is when somebody's charging it so we can't have that happen on the train,"" said Gerard Bringmann, an MTA Board Member and part of the Long Island Rail Road Commuter Council.  The city's fire marshal said fires are not only limited to devices that are charging. The e-battery fire in a fatal Queens blaze last month was charging at the time it went up in flames. But the e-battery fire that leveled a Bronx supermarket was not.  ""It was not charging at the time, so it doesn't really fit the narrative that these things are always from delivery workers and they're charging all the time, it's not always the case,"" said NYC Chief Fire Marshal Daniel Flynn.  With limited space, city leaders have been promoting the use of the devices as an alternative way of getting around. They've also expressed concerned they don't want to affect the livelihood of the more than 60,000 delivery workers who use the devices.  When asked who's going to police the new policy, Bringmann said it'll primarily be up to transit workers.  ""The first line of defense would be the conductors, if it's a problem and they get some push back they could at least get on the phone and have MTA police meet them at the next station,"" he said. ""There's certain risks that you take everywhere so we want to mitigate those risks as much as possible.""  City leaders have also been taking action. They passed a series of 5 new laws that include banning the sale of uncertified and unregulated batteries. Even though people can still purchase them online which is a problem for cities across the world.  ""Maybe we need to have something else down the line but this is a good start,"" said Bringmann. ""The MTA is not beyond tweaking this policy down the line.""  ----------  DO YOU NEED A STORY INVESTIGATED?

"fire","2021-09-21","Not Discerned","{""Georgetown"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:13:28","AUSTIN (KXAN) — A bill filed in response to a fire that took the lives of 75 dogs at a Georgetown pet resort in 2021 passed both chambers of the Texas Legislature this week.  House Bill 2063 is aimed at increasing safety requirements in Texas kennels. It now heads to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, where it could be signed into law.  In September 2021, a fire broke out at the Ponderosa Pet Resort, killing 75 dogs belonging to 59 families. None of the facility’s staff members were on-site at the time, and there wasn’t a sprinkler system.  The City of Georgetown told KXAN after it happened that its fire code, as well as federal and state standards, did not require sprinkler systems for a facility of this type and size.  According to State Rep. James Talarico, after the fire, dog lovers and community advocates organized a petition that garnered more than 17,000 signatures from across the country calling for legislative solutions to keep dogs in kennels safe.  In response, Talarico filed House Bill 2063, which requires kennels to disclose to pet owners if a dog or cat will be left unattended or left in a facility that does not have a fire sprinkler system, according to the representative.  “The fire in Georgetown was absolutely gut-wrenching. My heart goes out to the families that lost their loving companions,” Talarico said. “After the fire, our community rallied together and called for action. Our legislation will ensure accidents like this never happen again in Texas.”  The bill awaits a signature from Abbott.  Owner turns grief into action  Leikyn Huckins boarded her two dogs, Gizmo and Drexel, at the Ponderosa Pet Resort before the fire broke out. She says she was heartbroken by the loss and shocked to learn about the standard for pet boarding facilities in the state.  “The problem is there just really isn’t any oversight. There are not really any regulations besides sanitation. So, you know, you really have to be your own pets advocate,” Huckins said.  Huckins since has led families that lost pets in the blaze to call for changes at the local and state level to improve pet safety at these facilities.  She has written and met with local leaders to call for city pet safety ordinances. She cites that Georgetown, Liberty Hill, Cedar Park, and Round Rock have all put measures protecting pets from similar dangers on their books.  Huckins said she is excited the bill has reached the governor’s desk and hopes it is the first of many that will secure pet safety in Texas.  “It’s all been a positive response. And I look forward to just continuing until I can get something passed on a state level that will include fire protection for these buildings,” Huckins said.  In the meantime, Huckins has taken to social media to highlight legislative changes and share photos and videos of the pets lost in the fire.  She also uses the account to educate owners on what they should consider asking a boarding house before trusting them with their pets.  “There’s no requirements for fire sprinklers, there’s no requirements for somebody to be there overnight. There’s not even requirements for climate control. So you need to ask everything that you assume will be provided,” Huckins said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4YW4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwva2VubmVsLXNhZmV0eS1iaWxsLWZpbGVkLWFmdGVyLXBvbmRlcm9zYS1wZXQtcmVzb3J0LWZpcmUtcGFzc2VzLWhlYWRzLXRvLWdvdmVybm9yLWFiYm90dHMtZGVzay_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3hhbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9rZW5uZWwtc2FmZXR5LWJpbGwtZmlsZWQtYWZ0ZXItcG9uZGVyb3NhLXBldC1yZXNvcnQtZmlyZS1wYXNzZXMtaGVhZHMtdG8tZ292ZXJub3ItYWJib3R0cy1kZXNrL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-25","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:58:57","Fire service leaders took to Capitol Hill last week to urge Congress to approve federal funding for the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) and essential fire grant programs that fire departments count on to keep their communities safe.  The IAFF, among other organizations, asked the U.S. House of Representatives to approve the reauthorization of funding for the USFA, and the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Grant and Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) programs. Congress, as part of the annual budgeting process, must approve funding levels for the federal government’s investment in fire safety.  Funding for the SAFER and AFG programs is slated to sunset at the end of the fiscal year. The House Subcommittee on Research and Technology held a hearing on future funding of the USFA and its grant programs, where top fire service officials called on lawmakers to step up and fully invest in the nation’s public safety.  “Every fire fighter takes an oath to protect their communities to the best of their abilities, and we hold that oath sacred. We ask the U.S. Congress to have our backs and not make our jobs even more dangerous by failing to invest in the staffing, training, and equipment we need. Our safety rests in your hands,” Kevin O’Connor, Assistant to the General President For Governmental Affairs and Political Action, said at the hearing.  AFG grants provide critical funding for essential equipment, protective gear, emergency vehicles, training, and other resources to help fire fighters and other first responders protect the public and themselves from fire and related hazards.  Grants from the SAFER program are used to help local fire departments hire fire fighters to meet the staffing, response, and operational standards set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).  The International and its affiliates, working with supportive elected officials, have secured these grants to ensure that hundreds of fire departments across the nation stay safely staffed and properly equipped, even through economic downturns.  In April, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act, with a vote of 95 to 2. The Senate bill would reauthorize AFG and SAFER programs through 2030, while also authorizing $95 million for the USFA, an increase of $20 million from current levels.  The IAFF also supports providing the USFA with an additional $12.5 million to ensure the successful completion of their data management and IT upgrades.  Congress has consistently ensured the reauthorization of the SAFER/AFG program and the USFA by never allowing these fire service programs to lapse, despite any haggling over funding levels.  “Supporting our fire fighters and first responders has never been more essential than it is today. During COVID lockdowns, fire fighters, and other frontline workers carried the weight of a nation in crisis. Emergency services never stopped during lockdowns thanks to the brave men and women who showed up every day to put their lives on the line,” said Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Research and Technology.  Collins said the COVID-19 pandemic led thousands of fire fighters, both career and volunteer, to exit the service, leaving many fire departments understaffed with fewer new recruits signing up for training.  Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell, U.S. Fire Administrator, addressed the hearing to provide lawmakers with an update on federal efforts to bolster the USFA and meet emerging challenges in the fire service, such as recruitment and retention, preparing fire fighters to handle the climate-driven increase in fires within the Wildland Urban Interface, establishing a comprehensive fire fighter cancer registry, and providing behavioral health assistance and suicide prevention initiatives for fire fighters.  Dr. Moore-Merrell also discussed the USFA’s mission to enhance its ability to collect, analyze, and report data from emergency calls to help improve public safety. This effort consists of redesigning the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) with a more modern, cloud-based data capture system, which will be referred to as the National Emergency Response Information System (NERIS).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlhZmYub3JnL25ld3MvaWFmZi11cmdlcy1ob3VzZS1sYXdtYWtlcnMtdG8tYXBwcm92ZS1mZWRlcmFsLWZpcmUtc2VydmljZS1mdW5kaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-03-29","Not Discerned","{""Blue"", ""Oklahoma"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 09:17:03","WASHINGTON — United Launch Alliance expects to conduct a static-fire test of its Vulcan Centaur rocket in several days, but the timing of the vehicle’s first launch will depend on the outcome of an ongoing investigation of a test anomaly.  ULA rolled the Vulcan rocket from the pad at Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral, Florida, back to its Vertical Integration Facility (VIF) building on May 15. The vehicle had been on the pad for several days to conduct a tanking test and practice countdown.  Tory Bruno, president and chief executive of ULA, said in a May 15 tweet that the company needed to “adjust a handful of parameters and set points” for the vehicle before performing what the company calls the Flight Readiness Firing (FRF), a static-fire test of the booster’s BE-4 engines on the pad. That work would be done while the rocket is back in the VIF.  In a May 16 interview after a speech at the Humans to Mars Summit here, Bruno said that work involved a combination of minor adjustments to both pad infrastructure and the vehicle. The former includes adjusting set points in a hydraulics system and changing the rate of liquid oxygen flowing into the rocket to top off tanks after recycling the countdown. Those adjustments, he said, could be done in software.  On the booster, he said there was an issue during the pad tests with flowing gas through spark torch igniters used to ignite the BE-4 engines. The gas is intended to make sure that the igniters are dry and can light, but the timing was off. That could involve some combination of adjustments on the rocket and ground infrastructure.  “There’s nothing wrong with the engines,” he added. “We’ve lit the engines a zillion times on the test stand at Blue,” a reference to test stands by engine manufacturer Blue Origin.  That work is done more easily inside the VIF, he said, where there is protection from the weather and where work can continue when other range operations might cause a halt to work on the pad.  Once those fixes are complete, Bruno said the vehicle will roll back out to the pad for the FRF. “It’ll be a few days,” he said of the timing of the test, which will depend on both when the work is complete and getting approval from the range for test, which is required since it is considered an “energetic” event.  Assuming there are no problems with that firing, the last major obstacle before launch is completing an investigation into a March 29 incident during testing of the Centaur upper stage. Hydrogen leaked from the structural test article and ignited, creating a fireball.  Bruno said the investigation was delayed because it took time to remove equipment on top of the Centaur, such as a payload adapter and mass simulators for the payload and payload fairing. Only in the last week and a half was ULA able to get access to the dome section of the Centaur where the leak was located.  Engineers have isolated a small region on that dome where they believe the leak came from, as well as the likely ignition source. “I’m pretty confident that we’re going to find the leak, and once we find the leak we’ll know if we have to take corrective action or not on the flight vehicle,” he said.  If ULA doesn’t need to modify the Centaur, that would allow the Cert-1 launch to take place in early summer, he said. “If we do, it could take longer, but I don’t expect it to get out of the year.”  Complicating launch scheduling is the requirement for the primary payload, the Peregrine lunar lander from Astrobotic, which has a launch window that is open only for about four to five days per month. Before the Centaur test anomaly, ULA had been working towards a May 4 launch, which Bruno said in February was the start of a window about four days long.  “In the big picture, it’s a steel pressure vessel and it had a leak,” he said. “We’re going to understand it and we’re going to fix it. It’s not like other things that go wrong on rockets like engines that blow up. It’s just a piece of structure. We’ll fix it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91bGEtcHJlcGFyaW5nLWZvci12dWxjYW4tY2VudGF1ci1zdGF0aWMtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  TONOPAH, Ariz. — A popular Tonopah watering hole is no more after it was the victim of another early morning fire on Wednesday, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said.  Tin Top Bar & Grill appears to be a ""total loss"" after it was fully engulfed in flames near the intersection of Wintersburg Road and Salome Highway, deputies said. No one was injured and officials are investigating what started the fire.  Many in the community heard about the fire in the early morning hours as it was still in flames, including Michelle Davis who got a call from her friend around 12:30 a.m.  ""I could actually see the flames from my backyard,"" Davis said.  Joe Berg, who's worked at the Tin Top Bar & Grill for years, and lives down the street, was there as the restaurant burned.  ""It was engulfed pretty bad,"" Berg said.  The signs on the side of the Tin Top with white background and red and black letters are now burned, the roof collapsed and chairs from the patio are left charred.  ""Just kind of devastating,"" Berg said. ""All those signs – I freehand painted all those signs myself.""  It's a place that community members say was more than just a restaurant or a place to grab drinks.  Berg talks about Halloween parties, big haunted houses, Christmas light displays and much more as part of the joyful moments that the Tin Top was the backdrop for.  ""I live right down the road and I hear karaoke out here – some of them were great, I give them all props. Some of them sound like they’re getting squeezed by a duck,"" Berg said with a laugh. ""But it’s great, we all have fun, we have a blast. We had so much fun here.""  Davis called the Tin Top the ""Tonopah Cheers.""  ""Everybody knew everybody,"" Davis said.  She started going to the Tin Top when she moved out to Tonopah almost four years ago.  ""We have a women's group out there and we would use the upstairs area and do crochet nights every other Tuesday night and they do paint nights and just all kinds of stuff,"" Davis said.  But the restaurant was also a place holding difficult moments too.  ""I lost my wife in the parking lot three years ago,"" Berg said. ""This place means a whole lot to us, a whole lot.""  The difficult moments are now coming for the more than two dozen staff members who worked at the restaurant. Davis started a GoFundMe for them.  ""Just knowing that they can't just go down the street tomorrow to Applebee's or somewhere else – if they chose to stay in that line of work,"" Davis said. ""It's going to be a rough patch for everybody.""  The current owner told 12News off camera he's owned the restaurant for 17 years and isn't sure what the next steps are for the Tin Top.  But the community is hoping the fire won't mean the end for the bar and grill.  ""Hopefully we can bring it back again,"" Berg said.  It's not the first time the restaurant property has faced fire. In its more than 30 years of operation, Tin Top has seen at least two other fires on the property, according to its website.  ""The Tin Top Bar & Grill has been many things through time,"" the restaurant's website said. ""Buildings on this property have burned to the ground at least twice.""

"fire","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Northampton"", ""Northamptonshire"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:41:13","The Bombyx Center in Florence remains the home of the Florence Congregational Church, a Jewish Reform congregation and a preschool, while also hosting live music and offering space for multiple community groups and activities. Gazette file photo  Cassandra Holden, executive director of the Bombyx Center in Florence, speaks last fall to a group from the Mass Cultural Council and MassDevelopment during their visit to the region. Gazette file photo  NORTHAMPTON — Staff and board members from the Bombyx Center for Arts & Equity are meeting this morning with city officials to try to get answers for what Bombyx says is a bewildering turn of events: a sudden shutdown of live indoor music ordered by a city fire inspector.  The shutdown order, issued May 11 by Capt. Mark Curtin, fire prevention officer for the Northampton Fire Department, forced Bombyx to cancel a weekend festival May 12-13 called Collider! Fest that featured multiple musicians, music workshops, a record fair, and some catered food service.  Cassandra Holden, Bombyx’s executive director, and Elizabeth Dunaway, president of the nonprofit group’s board of directors, estimate this sudden cancellation has cost the Florence center and its partners for Collider! Fest about $15,000 in out-of-pocket expenses. (The musicians were all paid and tickets were refunded; some of the musicians were able to play at Hawks & Reed Performing Arts Center in Greenfield the evening of May 12.)  It’s also not clear when live indoor music may resume at Bombyx; shows are currently scheduled for both Saturday and Sunday. A show on Tuesday night by one of the center’s resident community music groups, the Bombyx Brass Collective, was moved to the lawn outside the center.  More concerning, Holden and Dunaway say, is the fact that the shutdown order, apparently made because of Curtin’s concerns about inadequate fire prevention measures at the venue, comes after months of regular interaction with city officials about the center’s ongoing renovation efforts — during which those same officials have consistently approved their plans, Holden said.  “This whole situation is very confusing,” Holden said during an interview Tuesday at Bombyx. The shutdown order “seemed very random, and we don’t understand where it came from.”  “We’re really hoping to get some clarity at the [Thursday] meeting,” Holden said.  That meeting has been organized by Alan Wolf, chief of staff for Mayor Gina-Louise Sciarra, and is expected to include members of the city’s Fire and Building departments and other officials including city councilors.  “We want to work with Bombyx to be sure they can be open and operate in a safe manner, in compliance with all state and local codes,” Wolf said in a phone call this week. “We all want them to succeed.”  But Bombyx staff believe the center has been operating in a safe manner since opening in the fall of 2021, and they say both the city’s building inspector, Jonathan Flagg, and city planner Carolyn Misch have reviewed and approved all their plans so far. Nor has the Fire Department expressed any previous concerns to them about a lack of fire prevention measures, they say.  In a letter they sent to Curtin and several other city officials earlier this week, Holden and Dunaway wrote that part of the issue seems to be a difference in how Bombyx staff regard the center and how Curtin viewed it when he came by last week. Staff view Bombyx as a community arts center that also hosts live music, while Curtin appeared to view the space as a nightclub during his inspection.  The Bombyx Center is located in Florence’s historic Congregational Church, whose parishioners continue to use the sanctuary. The center is also home to the Beit Ahavah Reform Synagogue and the Cloverdale Preschool,while numerous other local groups, such as the Young@Heart Chorus, use the facility on a regular basis.  Art exhibits, public talks, educational workshops and other events are also a big part of the mix. This evening, for instance, Northampton’s International Language Institute is holding an annual event there, Giving Voice, that recognizes its immigrant students.  “We’re really like 33 Hawley,” said Dunaway, referring to the space downtown operated by the Northampton Community Arts Trust. “We’re a community arts and cultural center that also hosts live music. We’re not a nightclub. We don’t sell alcohol.”  According to a pie chart the Bombyx Center prepared as part of their letter to city officials, live music represented 4.4% of the center’s activities during the past six weeks of facility use.  The ‘shutdown’  Yet when Curtin came unannounced to Bombyx on May 11, Holden and Dunaway say, he referred to it as a “nightclub.” Curtin said he had come in response to a complaint, the two women say, though he did not say what the complaint was about or who made it.  After making what Holden says was a brief examination of the Bombyx sanctuary, where both live music and religious services take place, Curtin cited a lack of a sprinkler system and told Holden the center would have to reduce its capacity to 100 people (the center can accommodate a little over 300).  Then, Holden says, Curtin said the capacity would have to be reduced to 50 people, before “leaving abruptly saying that Bombyx was ‘shut down’ immediately,” as she and Dunaway outlined in their letter to Curtin and other city officials.  It was not clear at that time whether that meant the center was shut for all activities, Holden said. She noted that the the Rev. Marisa Egerstrom, the Congregational Church minister, and Rabbi Raquel Shira Kosovske of Beit Ahavah had to call the Fire Department separately to determine that they were, in fact, still permitted to host services in the sanctuary.  Curtin did not respond to a phone message from the Gazette. Flagg also did not respond to a phone message.  For his part, Wolf, who’s serving as the point person for the city’s overall response to the issue, said Bombyx falls into something of a gray area in defining exactly what it is. “Is it a nightclub? If it is, it needs a sprinkler system.”  He added that there’s been concern in New England about club safety ever since the notorious fire in 2003 at the Station Nightclub in Rhode Island, in which a pyrotechnic display at a rock concert touched off a fast-moving blaze that killed 100 people and injured another 230.  “Ultimately the city’s goal is to keep everyone safe, and it’s up to businesses to be in compliance with all building codes and requirements,” Wolf said. “The city does its best to keep up with all of this.”  He added, “We want [visitors] to Bombyx to be safe, and we want Cassandra to be able to keep doing what she’s been doing.”  In their letter to city officials, Bombyx detailed a long list of renovations and improvements they’ve made to the property since beginning its management there in the fall of 2021, including electrical upgrades, repairing the sanctuary floor, and (currently) installing air conditioning. The letter says they’ve also received a $79,000 grant to install fire suppression and ventilation systems, as well as plumbing upgrades, in the center’s kitchen.  All told, the center has received almost $350,000 in grants so far to improve its facilities, Bombyx says.  In addition, Holden said it’s Bombyx’s understanding with the city that a full sprinkler system in the sanctuary is not required until they fully complete their purchase of the building from the Congregational Church — the agreement calls for this to be done by 2028 — or if they construct any major additions to the existing buildings.  “We are making steady improvements, but we can’t do them all at once,” she said.  Holden and Dunaway acknowledge the center has fielded some complaints about noise and parking during live music events. But they say they’re working to address those issues and don’t believe they’re connected to the current shutdown order.  In the end, Holden says she hopes the city looks favorably on their effort to help the local economy by bringing people to the area for live music, and to serve as a community resource for all the different groups that use the center.  Bombyx, Dunaway noted, has also been buoyed by wishes of support from residents and elected officials — and also “inundated” by questions of what happened last week, which is why the center has now spoken publicly about the issue.  “I think we all want to make this work,” Holden said. “Hopefully [the meeting] will show us a path forward.”  Steve Pfarrer can be reached at spfarrer@gazettenet.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYXpldHRlbmV0LmNvbS9Cb21ieXgtQ2VudGVyLXN0YWZmLXNlZWstYW5zd2Vycy1hZnRlci1Ob3J0aGFtcHRvbi1maXJlLW9mZmljaWFsLWFicnVwdGx5LWNsb3Nlcy10aGUtRmxvcmVuY2UtYXJ0cy1hbmQtY29tbXVuaXR5LXNwYWNlLTUxMDA3OTMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At the moment, the owners are working to assess the cost of repair. Kustura saw significant damage including debris, busted windows, and loose, hanging wires.  This fire is not only disappointing to the owners, but their faithful customers who refer to the restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood.  “It really livens up the neighborhood to see so many people coming back and forth,” customer Junius Sicard said.  The restaurant was opened by Johnson and his cousin, Anglee Brown, seven years ago after having a successful food truck, which they may return to during rebuilding to continue serving the community.  “Just gotta stay in good spirits ya know, things happen,” Johnson said, “We just gotta keep your head up and keep moving, that’s the Cuzzo’s way.”  (WATCH BELOW: Red Cross helps 20 displaced residents after southwest Charlotte apartment fire)  Red Cross helps 20 displaced residents after southwest Charlotte apartment fire  ©2023 Cox Media Group","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c29jdHYuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZWFybHktbW9ybmluZy1zdHJ1Y3R1cmUtZmlyZS13ZXN0LWNoYXJsb3R0ZS1jbG9zZXMtdHVja2FzZWVnZWUtcm9hZC9ZWTRPU0RMUjZWQ1FER1pBMk5WUkFGSTJOTS_SAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3NvY3R2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Vhcmx5LW1vcm5pbmctc3RydWN0dXJlLWZpcmUtd2VzdC1jaGFybG90dGUtY2xvc2VzLXR1Y2thc2VlZ2VlLXJvYWQvWVk0T1NETFI2VkNRREdaQTJOVlJBRkkyTk0vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The deal must be approved by Durango City Council and the DFPD board of directors. A special meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. May 30 at the fire district's Station 1 at 142 Sheppard Drive.  If approved by both boards, the two entities would trade ownership of the buildings and the city would additionally pay $3,586,275 to the fire district, a city news release says.  The city and DFPD hired Bob Allen, of the appraisal group Allen & Associates, to determine fair market values of the properties. In the news release, he said the city’s offer of $3.6 million is fair based on several factors.  The Colorado Department of Transportation’s appraised value of River City Hall is $3.9 million. The fire district paid $6.9 million for the 9-R Administration Building and the attached Big Picture High School facility in December 2021, he said. And parkland on the River City Hall property will be maintained by the city.  Hal Doughty, DFPD fire chief, said the city will need to subdivide the property because a portion of the Animas River Trail and a small park, Veterans Park, are not included in the trade and will remain city property.  Although DFPD’s Station 2 currently resides at River City Hall, for years Doughty has said the facility is in poor shape and needs major upgrades. The fire district purchased the 9-R administration building with the intent of moving its downtown facility there, but plans changed after determining that the facility is too large to house a fire station alone.  A joint police and fire station was considered, but in January Doughty said River City Hall is the best place for a new and improved station, and also noted bringing Durango Police Department to River City Hall wouldn’t be possible without major disruptions to nearby businesses.  Meanwhile, the city was eyeing the 9-R Administration Building as the potential home for a new civic center.  “Oh, man, I'm excited,” Doughty said about the deal. “But I'm also, you know, cautiously optimistic.”  If city and fire officials approve the proposed trade, the fire district will be able to finally replace its downtown fire station and improve working and living conditions for firefighters. And the city will be able to upgrade into a bigger facility at the 9-R Administration Building, he said.  “Which they're desperately in need of because they're out of room at the current City Hall,” he said. “Their police station is in such bad shape.”  ×  He added the deal will be a “huge benefit” to the community, which is the main point of exploring options to begin with.  José Madrigal, city manager, said he is also excited with the deal and the opportunity to preserve the 9-R Administration Building for historical purposes and its continued use. But, there is a long way to go.  If City Council and the fire board approve the trade, public input hearings about design features of the 9-R Administration Building will be needed, he said. But the initial deal is a nice and necessary first step.  Doughty said the fire district and the city likely would have preferred to get more money or value for their respective properties, but the proposed building swap and payment by the city are signs of a fair negotiation.  “Each one of us absolutely believes that we can improve our service to the community by moving in the direction of acquiring these new properties,” he said. “And I think that we have the opportunity to be absolutely transparent with the public on exactly how that looks now that the negotiations (are finished).”  In something resembling a big game of musical chairs, the city, fire district and school district are trying to rotate offices and staff into buildings occupied or owned by one another.  The fire district plans to stay at River City Hall, but the city wants to move out of City Hall and relocate offices from the Carnegie Building across the street from the 9-R Administration building at 201 East 12th St. 9-R administrative staff was originally scheduled to vacate in July, but that didn’t happen, and the school district currently leases the building from DFPD for about $120,000 per year. It hasn’t yet identified a new facility, Doughty said.  But the school district is considering at least one option. Madrigal said the school district has expressed interest in moving into the Carnegie Building across the street.  “There’s a lot of moving pieces with this,” he said. “The second step is the long-discussed, if possible, Buckley Park and Carnegie Building (swap).”  cburney@durangoherald.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1cmFuZ29oZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2R1cmFuZ28tYW5kLWZpcmUtZGlzdHJpY3QtcmVhY2gtZGVhbC10by1zd2FwLTktci1hZG1pbi1idWlsZGluZy1hbmQtcml2ZXItY2l0eS1oYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Flames were shooting through the roof of the dentist office which was under renovation  Around 50 firefighters battled this fire from the inside and from above. Then, crews spent several hours putting out hot spots and making sure it didn’t reignite.  That fire was already raging when firefighters got the call around 9:30 p.m. They called in extra help and Medic was on standby.  Once they got the fire under control, Huntersville Fire spokesperson Bill Southard talked about some of the challenges they faced.  The fire started late Wednesday night.  “We were way behind as soon as we arrived. Crews worked extremely hard; we had some water supply issues initially due to traffic in the area,” Southard said. “I can’t tell you how amazing our part-time volunteer firefighters did today. A lot of people showed up - close to 50 firefighters, some from off duty - and they aggressively fought this fire.”  According to the Huntersville Fire Department, one of the problems crews encountered was people kept driving over their hoses which slowed the water supply.

In just one year, those same people are rebuilding and looking forward to the future and one of those people affected by the fire was Stephanie Munshower.  She lost both her and her grandmother’s home during that wildfire, but despite all the destruction and devastation that the flames caused, she told us that she has kept up hope that everything will be okay, “It was such a huge process of grieving but also recognizing that we had to move forward, because you can’t stay stagnant in that place of grief and sadness. You have to move forward, and I knew from the first time that I saw that the house was gone that we’re going to come back because this is home.”  If you drive down Hwy 277 South, you’ll see barren lands and trees still black from being scorched from huge flames, that firefighters from across the country battled for over a week, serving as a reminder of the huge wildfire that covered the area.  However, in between those charred remains you can see a few new structures sitting there with people inside, getting ready to start again people like Munshower and her family.  “Our house was built a week ahead of schedule, so we moved in a week early. Consequently, we didn’t have anything up until the day I moved in. I didn’t even have a bed. So, putting that all together, we had people that gave us furniture so most of the furniture that we have right now is something that people gave us and graciously provided for us. So, that has been just overwhelmingly wonderful to realize that it’s going to be a house.”        ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8va3R4cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9tZXNxdWl0ZS1oZWF0LWZpcmUtb25lLXllYXItbGF0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Klamath County Fire District No. 1 and Mid-Columbia Fire and Rescue will each receive $1.5 million dollars. OSFM says these two agencies were selected to receive funding due to the increased risk of wildfire near their communities.    Over the last few decades, these regions have experienced more wildfires that have increased the demand for firefighters. This investment will help to lessen that need and provide highly-trained personnel to stop fires before they have a chance to grow and impact communities.  OSFM says there has been a decrease in the number of career and volunteer firefighters entering the field. With this investment, the hope is to create an accessible pathway into a fire career and increase diversity and inclusion.  “The fire service recognizes that our greatest asset is our people, and we are committed to building, developing, and nurturing the skills of these new apprentices while unlocking their full potential and preparing them for long and healthy careers,” Klamath County Fire District No. 1 Chief Greg Davis said. “Through targeted training initiatives, mentorship programs, coaching, and career progression opportunities, we aim to create a dynamic and engaged workforce that is equipped and capable to tackle any challenge the fire service is faced with.”    The apprenticeship program provides participants with 4,000 hours of training over two years. Apprentices learn the skills of basic emergency medical technician (EMT), applicable college-level math and writing coursework, and on-the-job training. During the program, apprentices also increase staffing at local fire agencies.  Funding for this program was made possible through Senate Bill 762, which was signed into law in 2021. This investment is part of a multi-pronged approach Oregon is taking to strategically invest in responding to and preventing wildfires. Learn more about the OSFM’s wildfire investments .    OSFM has also allocated $6-million in funding for the 2023 Wildfire Season, where local fire agencies can apply for up to $35,000 to hire additional firefighters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8va3BpYy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9vcmVnb24tc3RhdGUtZmlyZS1tYXJzaGFsLWFubm91bmNlcy0zbS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWludG8tZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXItYXBwcmVudGljZXNoaXAtcHJvZ3JhbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The store was evacuated and staff gathered in the parking lot, while a barrier of shopping carts was placed in a row across the parking lot entrance.  Fire Capt. Taylor Fogle of the Martins Ferry Volunteer Fire Department Ladder Company said the fire was doused quickly.  “We were dispatched on report of a possible structure fire, multiple calls,” he said. Dispatchers then clarified the fire was on the outside of the store.  “The fire here was typically on the outside. There was nothing involved in the structure itself. The structure is completely safe and sound. With the outside here, we’re not sure what caused it as of this point. We’ll be doing an investigation,” he said.  Fogle said the flames caused soot to form on one side of the building, but the fire itself did not damage the store. He said no injuries resulted, and they were able to extinguish the fire shortly after arriving.  He did not speculate about what was burning but said it was not a dumpster fire, although the dumpster was nearby.  “The garbage compactor was not involved. There was something here that was on the ground, we’re not sure what that is. We spoke with the manager. They’re going to be doing their own investigation to figure out what was there and what could have caused it,” he said.  Fogle pointed out a nearby exterior store camera, which would have recorded anyone who might have deliberately set a fire.  Kroger staff at the site made no comment, but the store was soon able to reopen. Responding police officers said the store was cleared as a safety precaution.  The Kroger corporate office did not respond to a request for comment.  The smoke was visible to residents, patrons of nearby businesses and motorists on Interstate 70 and Ohio 7.  Neighborhood resident Debbie Chesnick saw the early stages of the blaze.  “It was just a bunch of billowing black smoke that came out in puffs, and it kept getting blacker and blacker,” she said. “It was pretty scary for a minute there. We didn’t know if it was on the roof or where it was. .. .To have that much smoke and stuff, it blows my mind.”  Mikala Lee, another resident, watched the firefighters contain the incident.  “My dogs started barking and I looked out my window and saw the black cloud,” she said. “They got it out really fast.”  City water department employee Jeff Jackson was also observing. He said first responders had to prepare for the worst.  “We seen smoke, then flames. It was going from black smoke to white smoke. Because of the smoke, you couldn’t really see. I thought it was rolling out the (delivery bays), I really did.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbGVhZGVyb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbW11bml0eS8yMDIzLzA1L2V4dGVyaW9yLWZpcmUtYXQtZmVycnkta3JvZ2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2018-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:24:00","Victims say they barely escaped the 2018 wildfire after the U.S. Forest Service decided to let the fire burn and failed to tell them to evacuate.  DENVER (CN) — Victims of the 2018 Roosevelt Fire on Wednesday asked the 10th Circuit to revive their lawsuit claiming the U.S. Forest Service considered resource benefits as a factor when it decided to let the manmade fire burn.  Starting on Sept. 15, 2018 in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, the manmade Roosevelt Fire burned Lincoln and Sublette counties of Wyoming, consuming 25,000 acres and destroying nearby property.  Steven Knezovich and his son were hunting in the area when the fire broke out, but forest rangers failed to adequately warn them to evacuate. When the fire rapidly grew, the men suffered burns and barely made it out alive. Several local property owners joined the Knezovich family in suing the federal government on Sept. 23, 2021.  A federal judge dismissed the case on Oct. 11, 2022. Knezovich appealed.  In its reply brief, the Forest Service argued it did not immediately tend to the Roosevelt Fire because the area was not easily accessible and therefore unsafe for firefighters. In addition, the Forest Service’s helicopter, needed to observe the area before entering, had been committed to another fire.  But Knezovich's attorney, Quentin Rhoades, contends the Forest Service wrongly factored in the resource benefits of letting the fire burn. Rhoades practices with the the Missoula firm Rhoades and Erickson.  “The problem is that it’s part of an overall bigger picture and that’s discretionary,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Nancy Moritz, appointed by Barack Obama. “You’re not suggesting that that initial decision was made based only on that factor.”  Rhoades maintained the federal government is prohibited from considering resource benefits at all when managing a manmade fire.  “What you can’t do as a firefighter in this case is say 'the fire might do the forest a lot of good if we just let it burn' — your judgment does not apply in this context,” Rhoades argued. “That’s not an abuse of discretion, it’s not a mistake, it's flatly prohibited.”  Department of Justice Attorney Levi Martin asked the court to follow the lead set by the 2016 Hardscrabble Ranch case and affirm. But the Hardscrabble case hinged on the Forest Service following a decision checklist, not avoiding a certain factor.  “When you’re directed to not consider something, that removes it, and that seems different from Hardscrabble to me,” observed U.S. Circuit Judge Veronica Rossman, appointed by Joe Biden.  Martin countered that any differences were minimal.  “It’s too fine a point to make a difference,” Martin said. “It’s the flipside of the same coin.” He added: “The fire was in a dangerous location, they couldn’t access it and they didn’t have the resources to address it,” Martin reminded the court.  But the panel wondered whether the question was best answered by a jury.  “Might they have fought this fire the exact same way, isn’t that a jury question,” prodded U.S. Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich, appointed by George W. Bush.  Knezovich requested the case be revived for further discovery.  Asked for comment, Forest Service press officer John Winn said in an email, “We respect the court's decision and we encourage all visitors to remember to check for current fire risk, weather events and be well prepared. The safety of visitors and adjacent communities to national forests is one of our top priorities.”  The court did not indicate when or how it will decide the case.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9yb29zZXZlbHQtZmlyZS12aWN0aW1zLWFzay0xMHRoLWNpcmN1aXQtdG8tcmV2aXZlLWNsYWltcy1hZ2FpbnN0LWZvcmVzdC1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The youngest is a newborn.  Example video title will go here for this video  TACOMA, Wash. — A Tacoma family of 11 sifted through what’s left of their belongings after the home they lived in was destroyed in a fire nearly one week ago.  “We put pieces of what we can together but even anything we are able to pull out is so smokey and damaged and charred,” said Destany Droge, who escaped from the burning home.  Sentimental pieces like Destany’s late grandmother’s Bible were destroyed. But on May 12, what matters most barely made it out.  “Live every day like it's your last because you never know. We were two seconds away from not making it out of there,” Doge said.  Around 4:30 a.m. on May 12, while everyone was asleep, Kaihla Koroshes woke up to flames.  “I saw some light and it took me a minute to realize it wasn’t the sunrise. I realized it was a fire and I ran out of my room and up the stairs and screamed for all of them to get up and the house was on fire,” said Koroshes.  Eleven people were inside the home including seven kids, the youngest is a newborn. Koroshes went back multiple times to get everyone out, including 15-year-old Kayli, but the home was engulfed.  Kayli was able to get the window open and her mother Destany told her to jump.  “I just kept screaming and no one could hear me. I laid there and I couldn't breathe so I opened the window and jumped out,” said Kaylianna Bezk.  Kayli made what would be a life-saving jump from the second-story window, but now has a long road to recovery. She is still suffering from lung issues and was on life support for nearly three days.  The fire is believed to have started on the back porch but the cause remains unknown.  The family’s dog made it out, but the cat is still missing. The biggest concern for the family is where they will stay next. The family of 11 is staying in an Airbnb, but needs to find a new house by Friday.  “Don’t take anything for granted because you could have everything one day and wake up the next with nothing,” Droge said.  The family set up a GoFundMe to help with expenses and to find permanent housing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvdGFjb21hLWZhbWlseS1kaXNwbGFjZWQtaG9tZS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtZmlyZS8yODEtMTU4MWU3MDMtODdlNi00ZWU0LWE0ZmQtMGRmZmE5MDFiMGU50gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtpbmc1LmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3RhY29tYS1mYW1pbHktZGlzcGxhY2VkLWhvbWUtZGVzdHJveWVkLWZpcmUvMjgxLTE1ODFlNzAzLTg3ZTYtNGVlNC1hNGZkLTBkZmZhOTAxYjBlOQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-05","14:00:00","{""Akron"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 10:11:29","A new No. 12 fire station will serve Akron's west side neighborhoods next year, replacing a building that functioned for decades along West Market Street near the rail crossing through the city's Wallhaven neighborhood.  City officials gathered Tuesday morning to break ground on the new fire station, which will be constructed just south of Wallhaven's central crossroads.  “Today was an exciting day for the entire Akron community and especially for the residents here in Ward 4,” Mayor Dan Horrigan said. “In 2018, we broke ground on Fire Station 2 in Middlebury, which was the first new fire station in Akron in 22 years. Now, just a few short years later, we’re happy to break ground on yet another new fire station — making it the third one in five years and marking our latest investment into Akron Fire.”  Station 12 will join Station 2 and Station 4 among the latest to be replaced. The city already has begun discussions to evaluate which station will be up next for replacement, the mayor's office said.  Here is what we know so far about the new No. 12 fire station:  Where will the new fire station be built?  The new No. 12 fire station will be at 112 S. Hawkins, close to the busy intersection of Market Street, Hawkins Avenue and Exchange Street. It will be just to the south of Westgate Circle and the Swensons Drive-In.  The city will install a new signal light directly in front of the fire station on South Hawkins Ave to alert drivers when emergency vehicles are exiting the property.  When will the fire station be ready?  Officials believe the new station will be fully operational in the summer of 2024.  It will be 14,959 square feet and cost approximately $9.5 million. The current fire station on West Market Street is 7,066 square feet.  The station will have nine beds and, at a minimum, will have a crew of six firefighter/medics, an engine, and a med unit.  It will feature three full apparatus bays as well as equipment decontamination facilities and an air-drying hose tower.  How is the city of Akron paying for the new fire station?  The funds paying for new fire station are generated from a ballot measure approved by Akron voters in 2017; the charter amendment known as Issue 4 created a .25% income tax to pay for roads and emergency services.  Fire Chief Joseph Natko said the new station is an investment in the city's safety that ""will serve this area for many years to come.”  “Station 12 has been serving the Akron community for 72 years, averaging almost 3,000 calls in 2022,” Natko said. “This new building will help our firefighter/medics better serve Akron and will keep our firefighters safer as they answer the call to protect our residents.""

"fire","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:38:48","PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh’s aging fire trucks are in such bad shape that the city has now been forced to buy used trucks from local volunteer fire departments.  It’s a potentially critical problem that could impact your safety.  Rick Earle discovered that a controversial decision to cancel a fire truck order last year is now having an impact on the failing fleet.  Earle: Have you seen this?  Anthony Coghill, Pittsburgh City Council: What is that, the old truck that we just bought?  Earle: Yes.  Coghill: How many years old is it?  Earle: 25.  Earle showed Coghill a Facebook post from the Emsworth Volunteer Fire Company that contains a picture of the 1998 American LaFrance engine that served the Borough of Emsworth for over 20 years.  The Facebook post indicates that the truck is now “onto its next life with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire.”  Earle: I’m assuming this truck is going into the Pittsburgh Fire History Museum?  Coghill: Yea, it’s going down to the Carnegie Science Center. No, it’s a serious problem.  The problem is so serious that the city has had to resort to buying used engines from volunteer departments. So far, they’ve purchased two. The city doesn’t have enough working fire trucks, so when one goes down, there’s no backup.  It’s a difficult predicament for a 630-member paid fire department.  Earle: Is this a little bit embarrassing?  Ralph Sicuro, Pittsburgh Fire Fighter Union President: Well, I wouldn’t say embarrassing. It’s a necessity when you have this lack of following a good plan of action to be able to replace our apparatus.  But the previous administration said they did have a plan.  Former Mayor Bill Peduto approved the purchase of three engines, with plans to buy two more trucks, but the Union balked at the purchase, claiming that the trucks didn’t meet the specifications needed to survive the hilly Pittsburgh terrain and the rugged winter weather.  The Peduto administration disagreed, saying that while not the top of the line, they would do just fine.  Peduto authorized the purchases, and the city ordered the trucks. But when Peduto lost the election, the new administration canceled the entire order.  Earle: If you had ordered them, you’d have them?  Sicuro: First of all, that would have absolutely had brought things in today, but they would not have lasted. They would not have been able to allow us to complete our mission. These were subpar apparatus.  After canceling the order last year, the city placed a new order for four new pumpers and two ladder trucks. But City Controller Michael Lamb said the city waited too long to place the new order.  “I’m not sure the cancellation was the problem, the problem was when they canceled, they didn’t order. They should have, they should have stepped up right at that moment and ordered new equipment,” said Lamb.  And now those ladder trucks won’t be in until July and Pumper trucks until next April, nearly a year away.  At times during the past couple of months, there have been no spare pumpers.  So when one goes down, firefighters have had to respond to calls in an SUV and wait for a pumper from a nearby station.  Earle: Is this a public safety crisis?  Sicuro: It is a crisis and the fact that if we don’t act, and we don’t develop a purchasing plan, remember, this is two years plus before we are going to get new apparatus in, so. Every day we allow this to go by without figuring out a plan and funding it, we’re going to be in a bigger problem.  Sicuro is now urging the city of Pittsburgh to implement an annual purchasing plan so this doesn’t ever happen again.  “We have to take action soon by getting an order in place, getting it paid for, and moving on to the next one to the next one, year after year, in order to replace the fleet, we currently have and have enough proper spare apparatus for when things go down,” said Sicuro.  “We need the administration to step up, pull the trigger. Let’s get a plan to renew this equipment because I said the next two years is going to be difficult. We’re going to be seeing more purchases like this,” said Lamb.  Councilman Coghill, who sits on the Equipment Leasing Authority that’s responsible for purchasing fire trucks and all other city vehicles, said he hears the message, loud and clear.  “We see the need. The administration sees the need as well. It’s a matter of finding the right monies in order to up the fleet. It’s going to be costly. It’s going to be tough decisions to be made by council, but to me, nothing’s more important than getting our public safety from point A to point B,” said Coghill.  Even with the addition of the two used fire trucks, Sicuro called it a band-aid solution.  Controller Lamb said the city will likely be forced to buy more used fire trucks just to get by until the new trucks come in.  Download the FREE WPXI News app for breaking news alerts.

"fire","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""LauderdaleByTheSea"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:14:08","LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. – Judson Hopping is the chief of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea’s volunteer fire department, where firefighters are paid for calls they respond to.  Hopping recently had a hunch that something was not right.  He noticed Deputy Chief John Louvaris was paid for a call he didn’t respond to.  “I knew that people were signing up for calls that were not present for the calls,” said Hopping. “I was on shift and he was not there, but she gave him credit for it.”  He is talking about the department’s secretary, one of only two full-time employees, who kept track of the call sheets.  She is Cheryl Louvaris, the deputy chief’s wife.  “I had a suspicion that she was taking sheets home and having her husband sign for them,” Hopping said.  There were other irregularities, including missing supplies and equipment, so Hopping set up some cameras.  “I have her on camera talking to her husband, who was sitting in the office with her,” he said. “She kept telling him, ‘you were on this call, sign this’ and she went to hand him the sheet, and someone came in the office and she pulls it back.”  Hopping said he also caught John Louvaris stealing gas.  “That’s fuel we use for the ATV’s and Jet Skis, and what do we see him doing there? He’s putting gas into his personal truck,” said Hopping. “Walking from behind one of the apparatus with a five gallon gas can and walking over to his personal vehicle and dispensing the gasoline in his personal vehicle.”  Local 10 News’ Christina Vazquez asked Hopping if he thinks this is the first time Louvaris has done this, or if it’s the first time he was caught on camera.  “I believe that was the first time he was caught on camera,” Hopping replied.  Court records show that in 2009, John Louvaris faced a misdemeanor charge related to stealing gas. He plead no contest and agreed to pay just over $500 in restitution to an Oakland Park BP gas station. The restitution order can be seen at the bottom of this story.  Hopping said at the time, Louvaris was suspended, but he was allowed to come back to work when the matter was resolved.  He said last week the majority of department membership voted to fire John Louvaris, and the chief fired Cheryl Louvaris for this, and he says for showing a firefighters his, and another firefighter’s, personal and confidential information, to include financial data about their pensions.  “It puts a black eye on our department, for the actions of two people,” said Hopping. “I did catch it, I acted on my suspicions and I caught them.”  The video footage has been shared with the Broward Sheriff’s Office, which told Local 10 News they are looking into it.  Hopping said John Louvaris had been with the department since 2005 while Cheryl Louvaris was employed there beginning in 2008.  Local 10 News has confirmed with the mayor of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea and Pompano Beach Fire Rescue that the two municipalities are in final negotiations for Pompano Beach to provide fire services to Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, a change that could happen by late summer.  When asked if he thinks equipment, materials and supplies are disappearing from the station because of the upcoming change, Hopping responded, “I believe some of it does. I really think it has been going on for a while.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2NhbDEwLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbGF1ZGVyZGFsZS1ieS10aGUtc2VhLXZvbHVudGVlci1maXJlLWNoaWVmLW5vdGljZWQtZGVwdXR5LWNoaWVmLXNlY3JldGFyeS13ZXJlLWFsbGVnZWRseS1zdGVhbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Currently, Okandogs looks after 74 dogs and rescues more than 625 dogs a year.  Short asks people who want to adopt their dogs to have a fully fenced yard appropriate to the size of the dog. They will also need a daily plan that supports potty training, socializing and bonding time.  Information and Okandogs' adoption application can be found here.  As for the homeowner who lost his home and 25 dogs to the fire, Short says he didn't ask for the surviving dogs back.  ""He's disabled.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WOLO)— It’s been 100 years since a deadly fire killed 77 people who were unable to escape a Camden Schoolhouse in 1923.  Governor Henry McMaster and other local officials honored the lives lost at the site where the Cleveland School and Theatre once stood.  According to Chief John Bowers with the Camden Fire Department, the fire was started by an oil lamp that burst on the school’s stage during a play.  Bowers says the fire is considered the deadliest fire in South Carolina history and the National Fire Protection Association reports it as the fourth deadliest fire in U.S. history.  As people scrambled to exit the building, others rushed in to help — making it harder for everyone to escape.  Bowers says the coroner was also killed in the fire, making it even harder to identify those who died.  Sisters Phyllis Wainscott and Pamela Morris say their grandmother survived the fire. Their great uncle however, did not.  “To see the things that my grandmother talked about and to hear the facts that I had no idea it was so.. um… Some of the horrendous things that they actually went through, and the stairwell being so tight and packed. And people being thrown out the windows. Children, many children being saved that I’ve met today…their descendants…who were saved because they were thrown out of a window by an adult,” recalls Phyllis Wainscott along with her sister Pamela Morris.  Ann Seegars lost five family members to the fire.  “My mother in law’s mother, and brother and sister, and sister-in-law and child were all burned at one time. Plus there was other family members too,” says Seegars.  She recalls that her family didn’t speak about that night very often, saying, “I think it was such a tragedy until you would just get some facts, but not the horror of it.”  According to Chief Bowers, the Cleveland School Fire helped change fire codes and laws across the state and the nation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiY2NvbHVtYmlhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3LzEwMC15ZWFyLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LW9mLWNsZXZlbGFuZC1zY2hvb2wtZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chief Shawn Esler of the Waterville Fire-Rescue Department said Wednesday the blaze was first reported at about 9:40 p.m. as a tree on fire, but firefighters then learned a building was on fire at 100 Silver St., the same address as an apartment building.  Firefighters found flames at the rear of the 1 1/2-story, two-bay garage used for storage, according to Esler. Firefighters were able to extinguish the fire quickly, he said.  “The fire appears to have originated in a designated smoking area and extended into the garage,” Esler wrote in an email. “Vegetation and leaves surrounding the garage contributed to the fire spread. The fire was contained to the building of origin.”  He said the fire is not considered suspicious and investigators are gathering more information.  “We will consider the fire undetermined until we speak with a few more people in the area,” Esler said.  He said the garage contained items for the apartment building, including furniture and building materials.  Winslow firefighters assisted city firefighters at the scene, and Oakland firefighters covered the city station, according to Esler.  No one was injured due to the fire, he said.

DEP Deputy Commissioner David Madore said the fire might have damaged some gas infrastructure at the landfill, which is being evaluated.  But the department is not monitoring the air quality around the site after the Monday fire, which burned for four hours before being contained. He said no more emissions are coming from the site since the fire was put out.  Madore also said responders prevented any water runoff used to fight the fire from entering local rivers. He said DEP staff will return to the site on Thursday.  Environmental activists have criticized Casella Waste Systems' management of the site and how it handles toxic sludge in recent years. Its proposed expansion and acceptance of out-of-state trash has also faced criticism from locals who worry about the landfill's environmental impact on their area.  Don't Waste ME's Ed Spencer, who lives in West Old Town, said both the state and Casella need to be more forthcoming about how such incidents happen and when they happen.  ""We want to know what happened and... exactly what is going on in as real time as possible,"" he said.  Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis said he is still looking for answers after tribal members complained about burning eyes and sore throats in the wake of the fire. He said it's an especially pressing issue as the region is right in the middle of the fiddlehead harvesting season.  ""So yeah, we had, we had a lot of concerns, and we still do,"" he said.  Francis says he is working with the tribe's local U.S. Environmental Protection Agency trustee to get information about the fire.  The tribe has raised concerns about the landfill's close proximity to the Penobscot River for years. Its Indian Island reservation is about four miles away.

Now it was the Marshall Fire Department’s turn to go inside.  On Tuesday evening the building’s interior was getting smoky, with the help of burning straw bales. In a back room, a pair of firefighters crouched down and aimed a hose like they would at a real fire scene.  “You want to get the ceiling,” said Fire Chief Quentin Brunsvold as he helped lead the training exercise.  As firefighters pointed the hose upward, the water knocked down ceiling tiles and insulation. Meanwhile, different groups of firefighters were preparing to do search and rescue training at the front of the building, and on the upper floor.  Getting to hold training at the former C&N Game Room Outlet on Tuesday was a good opportunity for the fire department, Brunsvold said.  “We don’t typically get a lot of commercial buildings available for this kind of work,” Brunsvold said.  The C&N building was eventually headed for demolition, but first Lockwood Motors had made it available for emergency responder training.  Brunsvold said the fire department had a variety of training exercises planned that night. The design of the building gave them a chance to use different tactics than they would use at a house fire.  “We don’t get a lot of practice cutting flat roofs,” he said. The fact that the building had a second story also opened up opportunities for aerial training.  The fire training did attract some attention from people in the neighborhood around East College Drive and Sunrise Lane. A few local residents gathered near the property to watch the fire trucks and the training exercises.  Brunsvold said the fire department had put the word out on social media about the training earlier in the day.  “We wanted everyone to know it’s just training,” he said.

The Valley Air District encourages residents to be prepared and plan for potential poor air quality due to wildfire smoke that might reach the Valley as we head into the hotter, drier time of the year. Predicting the severity of the fire season is always challenging, particularly with ever-changing conditions and weather patterns.  The District reminds residents to change out air filters in their home and set up a Clean Air Room for when smoke impacts become severe. A Clean Air Room is a room in your home or apartment where you and your family can escape the worst of the smoke impacts from wildfires.  Residents can follow a few easy steps to create a Clean Air Room.  Choose a room where your entire family can relax and spend the majority of their time; prevent smoke from entering the room by tightly closing doors and windows. Stay cool. Run fans, window air conditioners or central air conditioning; filter the air in the room with a store-bought air purifier or create a DIY air purifier.  Also, avoid creating smoke or other particles indoors (no candles, no open flame cooking, no smoking); spend as much time as possible in the clean air room to get the most benefits; and remember cloth masks don’t work for wildfire smoke, choose N95 masks instead.  Hot and dry conditions throughout the San Joaquin Valley can create the potential for wildfires and lead to smoke impacts in the region. Due to historic rain and snow this past winter, there is the risk of an increased build-up of undergrowth and potential for significant dry vegetation during the summer months. This will present a higher risk for hotter, faster-moving fires in mountain communities surrounding the Valley, often sending smoke into the San Joaquin Valley.  Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter (PM), which can trigger asthma attacks, aggravate chronic bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Those with existing respiratory conditions are especially susceptible to the adverse health effects of this form of pollution. Anyone experiencing poor air quality due to wildfire smoke should move indoors to a filtered, air-conditioned environment with windows closed and contact their primary care provider for more information.  The public can check the District’s wildfire page at www.valleyair.org/wildfires for information about any wildfires affecting the Valley. In addition, anyone can follow air quality conditions by downloading the free “Valley Air” app on their mobile device.  For more information, visit www.valleyair.org or call the District office in Modesto at 209-557-6400.

Marathon said the cause of the Monday morning fire was under investigation. Aerial footage from Houston television stations showed crews trying to put out flames at the Galveston Bay refinery, which is along a stretch of Texas coast that is heavily populated by petrochemical facilities.  Neither the company nor authorities immediately said whether anyone else was injured.  “The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident,” Marathon said in a statement.  Fires at refineries in the area are not uncommon. Earlier this month, a fire at a Shell facility in nearby Deer Park sent nine workers to the hospital and caused massive plumes of smoke.  In March, an explosion and fire at a facility owned by INEOS Phenol in nearby Pasadena, Texas, left one injured.  The fire comes after a 2005 explosion – one of the worst refinery explosions in U.S. history – left 15 dead and 180 others injured at this same facility, which was then owned by BP. It was sold to Marathon in 2013, renamed the Galveston Bay refinery and in 2018 merged with another Marathon facility to become what it is today, according to previous statements by BP and Marathon.

The fire at 118 White House School Road was reported at about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, according to Chief Don French of the Madison Fire Department.  The family of five, which includes three young children, was dining out at the time, leaving five dogs at home.  None of the pets was hurt because a passerby happened to spot the fire and let the dogs out of the single-story house before calling firefighters, French said.  The house was engulfed in flames when firefighters arrived, he said. A nearby pickup truck also sustained minor damage.  The blaze drew firefighters from Madison, Anson, Norridgewock, Skowhegan and Starks. French said firefighters were at the scene until about 10 p.m.  The Office of State Fire Marshal has conducted an investigation, French said, and believes one of the family’s dogs inadvertently turned on one of the burners. It is not clear if the dog was trying to reach food on the stove.  “The stove wasn’t on when the homeowner left. They checked it,” French said. “We believe that the dog turned one of the valves on the stove, and there was something on top of the stove that probably caught fire. They said macaroni and cheese, or something like that.”  The family was with a relative Wednesday, French said, while the American Red Cross was trying to find a place for the family to stay.

(WBTV) - A huge fire destroyed a dental office in Huntersville on Wednesday night.  It happened at the Riccobene Family Dentistry on busy Gilead Road just about two blocks east of Interstate 77 and it kept firefighters busy for hours. Flames were shooting through the roof of the dentist office which was under renovation  Around 50 firefighters battled this fire from the inside and from above. Then, crews spent several hours putting out hot spots and making sure it didn’t reignite.  That fire was already raging when firefighters got the call around 9:30 p.m. They called in extra help and Medic was on standby.  Once they got the fire under control, Huntersville Fire spokesperson Bill Southard talked about some of the challenges they faced.  The fire started late Wednesday night.  “We were way behind as soon as we arrived. Crews worked extremely hard; we had some water supply issues initially due to traffic in the area,” Southard said. “I can’t tell you how amazing our part-time volunteer firefighters did today. A lot of people showed up - close to 50 firefighters, some from off duty - and they aggressively fought this fire.”  According to the Huntersville Fire Department, one of the problems crews encountered was people kept driving over their hoses which slowed the water supply. One of those hoses was even ruined.  *PLEASE READ* One thing we encountered this evening. TWICE this evening, vehicles drove over our large diameter hose. One hose was ruined & had to be replaced mid-fire.

Luckily, the fire didn't spread and was contained to the building where it started, he said.  There were no injuries.  He didn't say what could have been in the building. Pearl, which closed the site in 2018, was the subject of a lawsuit the year before stemming from contamination of groundwater and vapor stemming from cleaning solvents used at the business for decades.  The incident is being classified as a two-alarm at this time. The Indiana State fire marshal was on scene as of at least 5:30 a.m. to assist with the use of a drone.  Multiple roadways around the blaze had been closed, but by 7 a.m. the main closure was Northwest Fourth Street heading into downtown.  Larson said it's too early to talk about a cause, but firefighters will be on scene likely into the afternoon tamping down hot spots.  Contamination from the property was the subject of a lawsuit filed in August 2017 by public nonprofit broadcaster WNIN. At that time, WNIN’s studios were at the adjacent Historic Carpenter Home.  Pearl Cleaners applied to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's Voluntary Remediation Program in 2015 to cleanup soil, groundwater and vapor contamination.  A plan filed in that lawsuit documented a 250-foot wide plume of groundwater contaminated with the solvent PCE on the Pearl Cleaners site.  According to Indiana Secretary of State's Office records, the now-vacant building is owned by a limited liability company: The Pearl Development LLC.

Police Inspector Dion Bennett said they were aiming to remove the first two bodies from Loafers Lodge on Thursday and the next two on Friday. Bennett said it's possible they could find more victims as officers continue their scene examination.  “The damage on the third floor is significant,” Bennett told reporters. “The debris is piled high, and there is much for them to move and search underneath.”  Police say the believe the fire was arson and have launched a homicide investigation.  Bennett said they haven't yet arrested anybody but they have a list of people they want to speak to and hope to quickly identify any suspects. He declined to say if they had found accelerant or other evidence of criminal behavior at the scene.  Police said there had been a couch fire at the Loafers Lodge hostel about two hours before the large, fatal fire on Tuesday. They said the couch fire was not reported to emergency services at the time, and they were investigating to see if there was any link between the two fires.  The homicide investigation represents a change in outlook by police, who initially said they didn't believe the fire was deliberately lit.  Bennett said police had accounted for 92 people who were in the hostel and had a list of others who remained unaccounted for, although were not necessarily missing. Police had earlier said they expected that the final death toll would be fewer than 10 people.  News outlet RNZ identified Liam Hockings, a journalist, as one of the hostel's residents who was missing. Hockings is the brother of the BBC presenter Lucy Hockings.  The fire ripped through the building early Tuesday, forcing some people to flee in their pajamas. Others were rescued by firefighters from the roof or dived from windows.  The Loafers Lodge offered 92 basic, affordable rooms with shared lounges, kitchens and laundry facilities to people of a wide range of ages. Some people were placed there by government agencies. Others worked at a nearby hospital.  Emergency officials said the building had no fire sprinklers.

After that month of unanswered questions from residents about the state of their local fire department, a unanimous vote by the Fire Territory Advisory Board will have the Lakeville Volunteer Fire Department back up and running under a new administrative fire chief.  “The firemen themselves have one person to go to for paperwork, us as a fire territory board have one sole person we can go to, the administrative chief, to oversee that,” explains Patrick Howard, the Town of Lakeville Representative on the Fire Territory Board.  The administrative chief will act as a liaison between the volunteer firefighters and the board, which will help prevent logistic issues that caused the sudden shutdown in the first place.  Just last month, the department stopped fire service because paperwork issues caused issues with its insurance.  Volunteer firefighters will now need to be hired on as employees of Union Township in order to be properly insured.  “Until the non-for-profit can come back, the best course of action to get these men back out there and serving the community was to take them on as employees of Union Township, and at that point they can have insurance coverage again,” Howard says.  Once the administrative chief and the 14 volunteers who've applied are officially hired, Southwest Fire Territory won’t have to keep covering Lakeville calls.  “It will be directed to them that we do have our firemen in place, and we can respond to emergency calls,” Howard explains.  Southwest Fire Territory will still assist with mutual aid if needed.  The board expects to officially hire the chief and volunteer firefighters Friday, then the department can get back up and running.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzU3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xha2V2aWxsZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtdXBkYXRlLXB1YmxpYy1vbi1sb2NhbC1maXJlLWRlcGFydG1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, they want to share their story as a warning to others to protect their home after a fire.""I was sitting in the living room watching TV, and I noticed the light just flickered, so I just kept watching TV and then about five seconds later, I heard banging on the door and it was my neighbor saying, 'Lee, get out of there. Your house is on fire,'"" said Lee Morris, describing the moments on Thursday, May 4, when he learned the duplex on South Land Park Drive and 40th Avenue had caught on fire.He got out safely and watched as the garage and his car burned. Lee and his wife, Mary Morris, were grateful the fire did not spread into their home.""So, we were feeling quite blessed that we had our things inside,"" Mary said.Unfortunately, that feeling did not last long. They found out a few days later, while they were staying with family nearby, that thieves burglarized their home.""At that point, you're feeling like what the fire didn't get, the break-in now has taken,"" Mary said. She explained that there were a few things left untouched, like her purses and her husband's sports memorabilia but not much else.""They just had a field day,"" Mary said. ""Then, to add injury to all of that, after we were already insulted, then we had another break-in just a couple of days ago.""Two break-ins in one week. The Sacramento Fire Department said this is one of two cases it has seen in the last month of thieves targeting homes after a fire.The other happened after a fire on Saturday, April 22, in the Pocket area.""Try to get everything out that’s valuable you can. We know that it’s a very devastating situation you’re in, but try to get all your valuables out because if you leave them there, the house is not as secure as it would be if someone was actually living there,"" said Sacramento Fire Capt. Justin Sylvia.It is a worry that the Morris family never imagined they would be faced with.""At 75, it's a little old to start over and, pretty much, that's where we are,"" Mary said.Still, the family is hoping their story serves as a warning so that others do not have to go through a similar struggle.""Everything that you have worked for, you've been living for, is just gone in the blink of an eye,"" Mary said.

The fire erupted late Sunday night from a garage within a townhome complex on Aspen Court in White Bear Lake. A criminal complaint states 911 callers reported hearing “things blowing up.”  When police arrived, a man pointed officers in the direction of his son, 45-year-old Christian Thomas Dahm.  “He’s over there. He started the fire,” the man said.  Dahm was found naked except for a pair of pants around his ankles, and he fell limp when police handcuffed him and had to be carried away.  Christian Thomas Dahm (Courtesy of Ramsey County Sheriff’s Office)  The wife of Dahm’s father was rescued from the residence, though she had trouble breathing and had suffered some burn injuries. She was brought to Regions Hospital in critical condition and remained on a ventilator as of Tuesday, the complaint states.  While in custody, Dahm told an investigator that he was working on a fishing pole over a pan of motor oil when he lit a cigarette with a torch.  “All of a sudden, there was a fire,” Dahm told investigators.  Accounts from Dahm’s father and a neighbor indicate Dahm was yelling, throwing things around and making banging noises in the garage in the moments leading up to the fire.  Dahm’s father and his wife were allegedly concerned Dahm was high on methamphetamine and went to check on him. When they opened the door to the garage, Dahm’s father said it was “like everything exploded,” charging documents state.  A witness recalled seeing “flames hurling out of the garage.”  Dahm is charged with one count of negligent fires resulting in great bodily harm, but the complaint notes more charges could be added as the investigation unfolds. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.  At Dahm’s initial court appearance Wednesday morning, a judge set his bail at $50,000. He remains in custody, jail records show. His next hearing is scheduled for June 9.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8va3N0cC5jb20va3N0cC1uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvbWFuLWNoYXJnZWQtaW4tY29ubmVjdGlvbi13aXRoLXdoaXRlLWJlYXItbGFrZS1mb3VycGxleC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

RELATED: Firefighters respond after fire breaks out at home just north of downtown  When fire crews arrived at the two-story home, located in the 800 block of W. Poplar Street, they found flames coming from the second floor.  “They did a search of the structure, and the search came back that nobody was actually inside at the time,” said Battalion Chief David Prado with SAFD.  Firefighters quickly began attacking the fire, which made its way into the attic.  Firefighters can be seen in the second floor window, trying to attack the flames which had burned into the attic. (KSAT 12 News)  Although they found the ground-floor doors and windows boarded up, they also found evidence that someone had found a way inside the house.  “Clothes, there’s food items,” Prado said. “So we do believe that people were squatting in this structure.”  Victor Villarreal, who lives across the street, says he knows for a fact that has been happening.  “Every day you see people going in and out,” Villarreal said. “They crawl up that drainpipe, go into the second story window and come back down and open the back door for everyone else.”  West Poplar house fire image. (KSAT)  Villarreal said he has called San Antonio police dozens of times during the five years he has lived in the neighborhood.  However, he says, the intruders are able to conceal themselves from officers.  According to SAPD records, officers have been called to the home for suspicious activity five times since the beginning of this year. It is unclear whether any of those calls resulted in arrests.  As of late Wednesday morning, police had not provided that information.  Villarreal said while the owners moved out a few years ago, the home has been a neighborhood fixture for generations.  Real estate records online show it was built in 1929.  “It’s sad because, like I said, it’s one of the oldest houses in the neighborhood,” Villarreal said. “I hate to see it go like that.”  Investigators, so far, have not determined the exact cause of the fire, nor have they made any arrests.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzYXQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9maXJlLWludmVzdGlnYXRvcnMtbG9va2luZy1pbnRvLXJlcG9ydHMtb2Ytc3F1YXR0ZXJzLXNlZW4taW5zaWRlLWhvbWUtdGhhdC1idXJuZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This time, 21-year-old Brandon Cambridge was the star man, scoring a match-winning brace in just his 3 rd career MLS appearance.  First Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey, Malanda, Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram  Charlotte FC dominated the early stages of the match with the lion’s share of possession. This dominance resulted in two big penalty shouts, both involving Enzo Copetti but neither of which was awarded by referee Tori Penso.  Ten minutes into the match, a passage of good play resulted in Brandt Bronico slipping Copetti in behind. His aggressive first touch got him on the wrong side of the defender, and it appeared he was barged over from behind. Penso and VAR didn’t share the opinion of the CLTFC players or home crowd, though, and no penalty was given.  It only took fifteen minutes for Copetti to be involved in yet another contentious decision. This time, Ashley Westwood played a well-weighted long ball over the top for Copetti, who took his first touch beyond the Chicago defender. The Argentine went down from a last-ditch sliding challenge, but again was not rewarded with a penalty.  Chicago got themselves back in the game following the first 25 minutes of CLTFC dominance. Kristijan Kahlina made an excellent point blank save in the 27th minute, but Kacper Przybylko was able to slot one past him two minutes later on a breakaway. Kahlina had initially made a high caliber 1v1 stop, but the unlucky rebound fell directly back to the Polish striker to pass into an empty net.  From there, the half wound down with a few half chances for both sides. The Crown dominated possession and the Fire mainly looked to play on the break, but neither could find a clear chance before halftime.  Second Half  Lineup: Kahlina, Lindsey (59’), Malanda (84’), Sobocinski, Byrne, Jones, Bronico, Westwood, Swiderski, Copetti, Meram (90’)  Substitutions: Cambridge (59’), Tuiloma (84’), Hegardt (90’)  Charlotte FC came out of the gates hot again to start the second half, resulting in a similar narrative to the first. Copetti had two more potential penalties waved off – one a handball on the Chicago defender, one a pull-back on Copetti’s shirt – and the Crown couldn’t get on the board.  Head Coach Christian Lattanzio quickly made a tactical shift by bringing in winger Brandon Cambridge for defender Jaylin Lindsey at the 60th minute. Adilson Malanda shifted to right back and Derrick Jones to center back, which enabled Swiderski to play as the central attacking midfielder and Cambridge as the right winger.  The change paid immediate dividends when Justin Meram played a clever pass to Cambridge across the top of the box. Cambridge coolly side footed the ball into the far post with his weaker left foot for the equalizer and his first career MLS goal.  From there the Crown began pouring on the pressure. Cambridge played in an inch perfect cross that barely evaded Swiderski on the far post. Then, Swiderski whipped in a deep free kick for Jan Sobocinski, whose glancing header was well saved by Fire goalkeeper Chris Brady.  Eventually CLTFC got their reward for the sustained pressure, and it was again Cambridge in just his third MLS appearance who found the winner. Nathan Byrne curled in a good cross for the winger on the back post. He settled the ball down, took a good prep touch out of his feet, and passed into the far post with his left foot again to put Charlotte FC in the lead.  Down the stretch, Lattanzio made substitutions to secure the result, with Bill Tuiloma featuring for the first time in a few weeks following his recovery from a muscle injury and Chris Hegardt providing extra energy on the wing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJsb3R0ZWZvb3RiYWxsY2x1Yi5jb20vbmV3cy9mdWxsLXRpbWUtY2hhcmxvdHRlLWZjLXNob3ctcmVzaWxpZW5jZS1pbi13aW4tb3Zlci1jaGljYWdvLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lynn Fire Chief Daniel Sullivan, Department of Conservation & Recreation Chief Fire Warden David Celino, and State Fire Marshal Peter Ostroskey said that about 400 acres of land had burned as a result of suspicious fires set over a period of several days.  “Any fire can present a hazard, but we saw rapid fire growth threatening numerous homes in our community as a result of these fires,” said Chief Sullivan. “Firefighters from Lynn and our mutual aid partners worked extraordinarily hard to bring them under control, and we’re extremely fortunate that we had no serious injuries or property damage.”  “Fires like these put people, property, and wildlife at risk,” said Chief Fire Warden Celino. “We’re experiencing Red Flag conditions across Massachusetts right now, with high winds, low humidity, and very dry fuel. Outdoor fires will burn rapidly, spread quickly, and produce dangerous fire behavior under these conditions. That puts an enormous strain on firefighters, their departments, and the communities they serve.”  Based on ongoing efforts by fire investigators from the Lynn Fire Department and the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, officials believe that eight separate fires were intentionally set on May 12, May 13, and May 17. They are asking anyone with information on these incidents to share it with investigators.  Anyone who made observations in the area of the Lynn Woods Reservation on these dates or has other information on the fires can contact the State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit at 978-567-3310 or the Arson Watch Reward Program at 1-800-682-9225. The Arson Watch Reward Program is overseen by the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriters Association and offers rewards of up to $5,000. Tipsters may remain anonymous if they wish.  “About 40% of Massachusetts home are in or near wildland areas,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Setting a fire in this environment is a particularly dangerous act, especially under the current weather conditions.

Spanknebel and the Hadley Fire Department hosted Massachusetts State Fire Marshal Peter J. Ostroskey and a side-by-side prop that demonstrated the power of fire sprinklers to save lives and property.  The Department of Fire Services’ side-by-side sprinkler trailer set up at American Legion Post 271 on May 16, the third day of Home Fire Sprinkler Week. The trailer contains two rooms with identical furnishings. On room was protected by a single sprinkler head, and the other was not. Before a crowd of residents and municipal officials, DFS personnel ignited a small fire in the wastebasket of each room. The fire in the first room was completely extinguished within seconds, causing minimal damage. The fire in the second room grew unchecked, consuming everything inside and presenting unsurvivable conditions in about two minutes. Hadley firefighters extinguished it before it grew even further.  “Firefighters know that sprinklers protect people, pets, and property,” said Chief Spanknebel. “This demonstration lets residents see that fact for themselves. By containing or even extinguishing a fire while it’s still small, a single sprinkler head can give you time to use your home escape plan and get out safely. Firefighters are much less likely to be injured in a fire where sprinklers are in use, and the damage is much less likely to displace residents for an extended period of time.”  “Fire is fast, but sprinklers are faster,” said State Fire Marshal Ostroskey. “Today’s demonstration made the safety benefits as clear as day. It also showed that a single sprinkler head uses much less water to suppress a small fire than firefighters have to use when they extinguish a big one. The products of combustion, from greenhouse gas emissions to burned synthetic materials in water runoff, are much lower when sprinklers are in play. If you’re building or buying a home, remember that sprinklers aren’t just safety tools – they’re green technology.”  Local fire departments can request the side-by-side sprinkler trailer for their own demonstrations through the Department of Fire Services’ web page.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) joins in cautioning Michiganders about the danger of fires under current weather conditions. In particular, EGLE notes that it is illegal to burn plastic, hazardous materials, foam or other household trash. This can release dangerous chemicals into the air.  For more details, check EGLE’s open burning webpage.  Warm temperatures, winds and winter buildup of dry grasses and leaves have pushed fire danger to very high levels across the Lower Peninsula.  Map showing where fire danger currently exists in Michigan.  “People need to be careful when doing any outdoor activity that could spark a wildfire,” said Don Klingler, Michigan Department of Natural Resources resource manager for the southern Lower Peninsula. “These fuels can ignite very easily.”  Nine out of 10 wildfires are caused by people, and yard debris burning is the top cause of wildfires in Michigan.  Burn permits will not be issued for the next few days, Klingler said. It’s always critical to check Michigan.gov/BurnPermit before you start your fire to make sure weather conditions allow for safe burning. In southern Lower Peninsula communities, consult local fire authorities.  Fire danger goes up when weather is hot and dry and increases even more when it’s windy. Windborne embers can travel far and fast, turning a small fire into a large one. Lightning strikes are also an issue if stormy weather is predicted.  Due to the increased fire danger, the DNR has suspended most prescribed burns over the next few days.  Snow is still present in parts of the Upper Peninsula, but people should exercise caution in areas without snow.  Safety tips to keep fires under control  When you’re working with fire or equipment outdoors, keep in mind that fires can take off very fast and that the remains of a fire smolder for some time. Here are some tips to keep it safe out there:  Contain your campfire or bonfire in a pit or ring and make sure you put it out thoroughly before leaving for the night. Douse the fire with water, stir the ashes and douse again.  Never leave any fire — including hot coals — unattended.  Keep a hose or other water source nearby when burning.  Prevent sparks. Keep trailer chains from dragging when you’re on the road; don’t park hot equipment on dry grass.  Never shoot fireworks into the woods, dry grass or shrubs.

Naperville 911(PSAP) dispatched a general alarm assignment consisting of 11 pieces of fire apparatus and 25 personnel including an incident commander and incident safety officer to the reported address. Two occupants were home at the time, and both had safely evacuated the building prior to the fire department’s arrival.  At 12:31 p.m., the first vehicle arrived on scene and encountered heavy smoke coming from the basement. Fire crews stretched hose lines and began a search for the fire. As companies were advancing through the building they discovered a fire in the basement that had burned through the subfloor and was extending to the floors above. Additional handlines were deployed to contain the secondary fires, and at 12:54 p.m., the fire was deemed under control. Fire companies remained on the scene for another 60 minutes to ensure that all hot spots were extinguished.  The Naperville Fire Department was assisted on the scene by the Naperville Police, Naperville Electric and Nicor. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. There were no injuries to any occupants or firefighters while operating on scene. The building was deemed to be uninhabitable by the Naperville Transportation, Engineering and Development Team. The blaze, which displaced four residents, is estimated to have caused $150,000 in damage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hcGVydmlsbGUuaWwudXMvMjAyMy1uZXdzLWFydGljbGVzL3N0cnVjdHVyZS1maXJlLWluLXRoZS0zNDAwLWJsb2NrLW9mLWNhaW5lLWRyaXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rick Graves with Portland Fire & Rescue points out some of the fire damage to the May apartment building on May 17, 2023, in Portland, Ore. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said the third and fourth stories of The May apartments were gutted.  “And the first and second floors are going to have significant water damage,” he said. “If it’s deemed unsafe, people may not be able to enter and get their items.”  The fire started at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city. More than a half-dozen large hoses and several smaller hoses were trained on the building for hours as residents scrambled to safety.  Graves said the basement has been essentially turned into a swimming pool. Oil tanks used for the building’s furnace system are leaking. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services is looking into possible runoff into the stormwater system.  During a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Portland Fire & Rescue officials said they were considering sending an investigator through one of the building’s windows where they believe the fire may have started. The May apartments had a number of known electrical issues and code violations that appear to have gone unaddressed.  Structural engineers from the city are also on-site to review the safety of the building and neighboring structures. Fire officials on Wednesday said they are “very concerned” the building may collapse. Residents of two nearby apartment complexes have been allowed to briefly enter their apartment units, one by one, for up to five minutes to collect personal documents.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  The city said the owner of the damaged apartment building will need to hire an engineer to complete a full structural review and decide whether it should be repaired or demolished.  The Red Cross has organized a shelter at the University of Portland for the scores of displaced residents. An aid group called Team Farmer arrived on the scene Tuesday and provided 45 pizzas.  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Now that the smoke has cleared, it’s evident the unreinforced brick walls of the complex are bulging slightly.  “If the city engineer deems this a structure that is a danger, there will be an accelerated course put on it,” Graves said. “It’s usually fast-tracked on the demolition permit.”  The building’s fire alarm system was working during the fire, but many residents had grown weary of frequent false alarms and were ignoring it. So fire crews had to go floor by floor, alerting residents to exit the building immediately.  The fire spread aggressively, with explosive flashovers blowing windows out and sending shards of glass to the other side of a four-lane street. Graves said one firefighter was cut on his forehead.  “He lightly rubbed his forehead, looked at it, grunted, put his helmet back on, grabbed three saws at once and walked away,” Graves said. “He’s a monster.”  Another firefighter was sent to the hospital with an elevated blood pressure and is expected to be OK.  Portland Fire Chief Sara Boone said more than 80 firefighters responded to the scene, with help from dozens of others providing mutual emergency aid.  “I want to recognize and acknowledge the efforts and heroism displayed by the men and women of Portland Fire under the most hazardous of conditions,” Boone said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2FwYXJ0bWVudC1maXJlLWRvd250b3duLXBvcnRsYW5kLW9yZWdvbi_SAV5odHRwczovL3d3dy5vcGIub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9hcGFydG1lbnQtZmlyZS1kb3dudG93bi1wb3J0bGFuZC1vcmVnb24vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Both Bostian Heights and China Grove had fire trucks hit in the incident, according to reports.  On its Facebook page, Bostian Heights fire department stated, “When you are approaching emergency vehicles, you must reduce your speed and move over on interstates and highways with multiple lanes, please reduce your speed even if traffic is moving in the other lanes.”  According to reports, both fire departments and a towing company were working to clear a crash that involved a tractor-trailer and a passenger car near mile marker 65. “A tanker (Bostian Heights FD) and two engines (Bostian Heights FD/China Grove FD) were stationary in lanes 1 and 2 with all emergency lights activated when a passenger car struck the tanker and came to rest next to one of the engines.” It appears the driver of the car may have tried to stop, from skid marks on the roadway, but ended up sliding sideways into the Bostian Heights truck, then bumping the China Grove truck.  Initial reviews of damage to the Bostian Heights truck appeared extensive but further review is needed.  “Fortunately, all personnel were in the safety zone in front of the trucks and our old girl (Tanker 414) saved our lives,” the fire department posted. “All fire personnel along with the driver of the passenger car escaped injuries and were able to return home to their loved ones.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbGlzYnVyeXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvY2FyLWhpdHMtdHdvLWZpcmUtdHJ1Y2tzLWF0LWNyYXNoLXNjZW5lLW9uLWktODUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

While the rest of the family of 11 made it to safety, Kayli couldn’t make it out from upstairs.  “I was like ‘baby, jump out the window. Jump out the window!” says her mother, Destany Droge. “She was like, ‘I can’t. I can’t.’  “I thought I was going to die in that moment,” says Kayli.  But she jumped, with Droge rushing to break the fall. Droge tore her rotator cuff in the process.  “I’d do it again in a heartbeat,” says Droge.  Kayli was rushed to Harborview Medical Center and released on Tuesday. Her mom calls it a day of joy for the family.  “What matters to me is that we’re here. We can look at each other, we can see each other. Everything else will come,” says Droge.  She tells KIRO 7 that the home is a total loss and that at the end of this week, the family doesn’t know where they’ll live. Right now they’re staying in a donated Air-BnB.

What You Need To Know Hadley Fire Department hosted a fire sprinkler demonstration to highlight the benefits of having them in homes    The department said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage because of the flammability of the items inside In Massachusetts, usually a building's size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system    The department said a sprinkler will only go off if a fire is in that room, as opposed to some movies where they all go off at once  They said many properties are more susceptible to severe fire damage today because of the flammability of items inside.  ""Fire growth is exponentially faster than what it used to be,"" said Fire Chief Michael Spanknebel. ""So we would have 12-15 minutes before we would start seeing really heavy fire conditions. In today, you saw it was 2-3 minutes where we were at flashover at the room because of all those, the foams and the plastics and everything that are in modern construction and modern homes for furniture.""  In Massachusetts, typically a building’s size dictates if its required to have a sprinkler system. On Tuesday, the fire department demonstrated what a home with a sprinkler would look like during a fire vs. one without.  Spanknebel said there are many myths about sprinklers which prevent people from using them, so he hopes the visual aid can offer a different perspective.  ""I just think because they see the commercial side of it where you have galvanized piping and extensive installs for a Walmart or Home Depot, where you see huge heads and piping all over the place,"" he said. ""This is basically a rated PVC piping, looks like a plumbing that you put in your walls. It's all done basically like plumbing.""  Spanknebel said another myth they hope to address is one around the amount of water that goes off during a home fire.  ""If one sprinkler head goes off, all of them don't off go off like you see in the movies,"" he said. ""That single head that's tripped by the heat is the only unit that will go off and it will control that fire, low amounts of water, so you can how much it saved the furniture, saved the room.""  Spanknebel said a sprinkler system can also buy people more time in the event of an emergency.  ""So that you have the time to get your family out of the house,"" Spanknebel said. ""And it's also saving the firefighters that are coming to your home to try and extinguish the fire. So if that sprinkler head can control that, that's gonna allow us the time to get there if needed, if the head doesn't take care of itself, it's gonna allow the time to extinguish it completely.""  Spanknebel encouraged everyone who may be considering building a new home to have a sprinkler system installed. He said it not only protects those living in the home but the firefighters as well.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3NwZWN0cnVtbmV3czEuY29tL21hL3dvcmNlc3Rlci9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvaGFkbGV5LWZpcmUtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1ob3N0cy1zcHJpbmtsZXItZGVtb25zdHJhdGlvbi10by1lbmNvdXJhZ2UtaG9tZW93bmVycy10by1oYXZlLXRoZW0taW5zdGFsbGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire was called in just before 7 a.m. in the 9000 block of Wurzbach Road, not far from Datapoint Drive and Interstate 10.  Mark Trevino, a battalion chief with the San Antonio Fire Department, said they were able to do a partial search of the building and found nobody inside.  “As soon as we saw fire through the roof, we did what we could to do a search, as it has been known to have some people coming in and out,” Trevino said.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.  The area, along with Wurzbach Road, was closed off to drivers as firefighters worked to put out hot spots.  “There’s hot spots right now since this is an older building and it’s a lot of wood structure. It’s got heavy wood floors and it’s built on different areas. There’s layer on top of layers so we have to get in there and tear into the building in order to get to the hot spots,” Trevino said.

Tuesday’s fire is the third time the fire department was called to the structure, as they responded back on Jan. 27 and previously on March 6, 2022.  “The structure is unstable.

The location was off Turner Creek Road.  Bergstrom said fewer than 20 acres on private property were impacted. There were multiple burn piles, and the blaze initially started when one got out of control.  “Looking at the fuel models — types of ground material that could potentially ignite — the remoteness of the area, the terrain, lack of access, I called for a third alarm,” Bergstrom said. “This was not flat ground. This was steep timber terrain.”  Bergstrom said the “wildland model” for firefighting was activated for increased fire activity in this case. Different types of hoses came into play, for example, according to the chief.  “This doubled in size in less than 20 minutes,” Bergstrom said. “Structures were being threatened. Opting to go to a third alarm called in more resources, not just our immediate neighbors.”  In addition to Yamhill, agencies that responded to the callout were from Amity, Gaston, Grand Ronde Tribal, Lafayette, McMinnville and Tualatin Valley (Newberg).  There were 13 pieces of equipment and 35 firefighters on scene.  “This came extremely early in the year,” Bergstrom said of the fire.

"fire","2023-07-01","18:00:00","{""Quincy"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:33:57","QUINCY — Michele Talley said she got interested in firefighting right out of high school and has stayed interested ever since.  “I started as a volunteer firefighter in Southern California when I was 18,” she said. “When I got married and started a family, l left the fire service – and I missed it.”  So when she had the chance she started learning more about it.  “I went back to college, just to give myself something to do, and I started taking fire prevention, fire investigation classes, those kinds of things,” she said.  Talley has been a volunteer or on the paid staff in fire departments in three states. Currently, she is a lieutenant with Grant County Fire District 3 in Quincy, and earned certification as a fire marshal in April.  Her college instructor was part of the fire department in Apple Valley, California, a town that was big enough to have a paid staff.  “I got hired on there. It was mostly as an inspector, where you do fire and life safety inspections, public education kind of stuff, which I really enjoyed. I got my first taste of it then, back in my 20s,” she said.  Talley said she and husband Dave wanted a change and moved to the small Eastern Oregon town of Helix.  “I started volunteering at my local department and went up through the ranks, (became a) training officer, and became a district chief there,” she said.  The family came to Quincy when her husband accepted a job at Quincy High School.  “So I started all over as a volunteer here,” she said. “I got to recreate myself with each state.”  She joined GCFD 3 as a volunteer in 2009 and eventually was hired for a paid position as the firefighter retention coordinator. She’s been on the district’s paid staff for 10 years, she said.  “This is my 29th year,” she said, as a volunteer or on a department’s paid staff.  But as a veteran, Talley said she started thinking of the future.  “So I started thinking, ‘Okay, what are some things I can do, that if I can physically do this job, (will) still make a difference?’ Now this department still requires you to be a line firefighter. We’re just not big enough to have you stand alone in an (administration) role,” she said.  But she still wanted more skills, she said, and started thinking about the fire prevention and inspection work she had done in her 20s. Jim Kling, the district’s previous fire marshal, had announced his plans to retire. Talley started taking fire inspector certification classes and working with Kling to learn from his experience and expertise.  “It’s one thing to get the certification - okay yeah, I know where to find everything in this red binder, this fire code book - but another thing to actually apply it,” she said.  While there were classes, the certification process required a lot of studying on her own too, she said. Kling was fire marshal for more than 25 years, and was generous with his time and knowledge.  “It’s a lot of ongoing training. It really was a lot of shadowing Chief Kling prior to this and learning it in the field,” she said.  Kling still answers her questions, even after retirement.  “He’s still on speed dial,” Talley said.  A fire marshal does investigate the origin of a fire, but there’s a lot more to it than that. The fire marshal is involved in the entire construction or remodeling process, especially commercial buildings.  “I do everything from plan reviews for all new construction that comes in, with fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, things like that - the planning version of it too, what we call pre-construction systems - all the way through the testing of all those systems,” she said.  The fire marshal inspects fire hydrants during construction. If there’s a fuel tank in the project, she tests that. She conducts fire and life safety inspections.  “If you have a new business that comes in, before they open their doors I’m supposed to go through and do my walkthrough,” she said.  Existing businesses also are subject to inspections, and Talley said she likes to work with business owners to change anything that might need changing.  “I come from the education background, and I like working with people to teach them,” she said. “It’s like, ‘You want the safest building for your customers and your employees. And I want the same thing.’  “I don’t want to be the scary person. Yes, I have to enforce code, that’s part of my job, but I’m also here to educate them,” she said.  Talley is still learning herself, she said, and has found that contractors and building owners usually are willing to answer her questions about their systems and work with her. She cited the data centers currently under construction in Quincy as an example.  “Those are the cream of the crop contractors, and they’re excited about telling you about their projects. And they’re gracious. They know that I’m new and they’re not trying to pull a fast one. They want you to know how their systems work.”  It’s a great job, though, she said.  “It’s never the same day twice, that’s what I love about my job,” she said.  The fire service attracted her because it allows her to help her community, she said, and that’s what’s still attractive about it.  “I really enjoy what I do. I really feel like I’m making a difference,” she said, “and that’s what brings a lot of joy to my job.”  Cheryl Schweizer may be reached at cschweizer@columbiabasinherald.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29sdW1iaWFiYXNpbmhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi9taWNoZWxlLXRhbGxleS1maW5kcy1yZXdhcmRzLWZpcmUtc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Because of the dry conditions today, BE VERY CAREFUL handling any ignition sources outdoors, such as matches and cigarettes,"" read the announcement.  The trails north of Walden Pond have been closed to the public as a large brush fire continues to burn in Lynn Woods.

Tuesday's red flag warning, which affects most of Massachusetts and southern New England, is scheduled to change to a ""fire weather watch"" on Wednesday in anticipation of brush fire risk later this week.

TEXAS CITY, Texas (KTRK) -- Marathon Petroleum officials say they are still monitoring the air quality in the Texas City area after Monday's fire, in which we now know what was burning. According to Marathon Petroleum officials, hydrocarbon Naphtha is what was burning.  ""It's component that has a lot of waxes or paraffin's and benzene's or benzene that we know are carcinogens, so it's like a combination of what they're using to refine down and create several products,"" Tox Doc, Dr. Noreen Khan-Mayberry said.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says those smoke particles can be dangerous. But in a Facebook post on Monday, the Texas City Police Department announced a shelter-in-place for the surrounding community wasn't necessary. Normally, that decision comes from the Office of Emergency Management. They make the decision based on information they get from the company and also what they may see or experience when they have reps on site of the fire.  Dr. Khan-Mayberry says this is reminiscent of the March 2019 ITC plant fire, in which our partners at the Texas Tribune uncovered high benzene levels lingered in the air for two weeks after public health measures and shelter-in-place warnings were lifted.  When it comes to Monday's Marathon plant fire, the experts we spoke to say if the company knew Naphtha was burning, a shelter-in-place should have been issued.  ""It's always easier to figure out after, even though, when they know which unit blows up or ignites, they know exactly what's in that unit and what's burning in those units. So they know that quickly. It's not like these are unlabeled and take them a long time to find out,"" Dr. Khan-Mayberry said. ""So, yes, I definitely think that precautions should've been put in place, in terms of 'Hey, there's a fire, there's been an explosion in the unit,' and there should be a shelter in place, at least for a few hours until you can get TCEQ out there and start doing some real air monitoring.""

"fire","2023-04-14","Not Discerned","{""Stephens"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:05:40","By Jessica Waters  A weekend structure fire in the 1600 block of Carnes Creek Road, across from Carnes Creek Baptist Church, resulted in no injuries or fatalities to the two occupants of the home, but did take the lives of several pets, according to Carnes Creek Volunteer Fire Department Assistant Chief Corey Bennett.  Neither resident was home at the time of the fire, he said.  A call reporting the fire came into Stephens County 911 Dispatch just before 8 p.m. on Sunday, April 14, Bennett told WNEG.  He said, “The call came into our dispatch about 5 minutes before 8 p.m., and Carnes Creek, New Hope and Eastanollee volunteer fire departments were paged out. Carnes Creek put the first truck on scene within seven minutes of the call coming in.”  When the initial crew arrived on scene, there was heavy fire and smoke throughout the house, with the heaviest flames concentrated in the right, rear corner of the home.  Bennett said the decision was made to send a crew into the structure for an interior attack on the fire. Fire crews were able suppress the fire with the majority of the damage occurring in the rear quarter of the building, and much of the front portion of the home and belongings were saved from fire damage. Smoke damage was more widespread, Bennett said.  Firefighters battled the blaze for approximately 35 to 40 minutes before the home was secured and the fire crews could begin clean-up operations.  Bennett said there was no clear indication of how the fire started, and explained that the homeowner’s insurance company will decide the cause of the fire following its investigation.  Sunday’s fire was the third fire in a fairly small section of the county, and Bennett said that this year has seen an unusually-high number of fires throughout the county.  Bennett said, “This year, Stephens County Fire Services, and the City of Toccoa, have seen an unheard of amount of structure fires. I talked with some other captains and lieutenants in other counties, and told them how many (fire calls) we run, and they were amazed. For some reason, this year we’ve had a lot more than normal.”  Bennett said that arson does not appear to play a role in the large number of fires this year, but carelessness and inattention is definitely a factor.  He said, “A lot of it is just carelessness, or unintentional type things. We typically don’t see a lot of arson around here.”  Bennett added that the fires are not limited to a certain demographic.  He said, “It’s not just the elderly, not just young people.”  Bennett strongly urges citizens to make sure there are working fire alarms throughout their home, and to make a habit of checking for potential fire hazards prior to leaving the home, even for a short period of time.  The number one tip to prevent fires is smoke alarms, Bennett said, urging citizens to check and test their fire alarms on a regular basis. He also urged residents to be observant and make an extra effort to look for fire hazards.  He said, “Don’t leave the house without making one last lap through the house to make sure nothing is left on like hair dryers, the stove, ovens, or curling irons. That extra 30 seconds can save your home, your belongings, your pets.”  Bennett said that even items that may not have open flames, or may not seem hot enough to start a fire, can be dangerous if left unattended.  He said, “That curling iron you leave on, if it is next to a can of hairspray or something, that kind of thing is where problems start.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd25lZ3JhZGlvLmNvbS9jYXJuZXMtY3JlZWstZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXJlc3BvbmRzLXRvLWhvdXNlLWZpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

No one was hurt.Fire Chief Laurent McDonald said crews responded to an alarm at 11:38 a.m. at 30 Old Charlton Road. Firefighters were there until 4 p.m.  McDonald said there was a partial building and stored lumber at the site, which used to be the home of Stone's Saw Mill.  In addition, the property owner has been using the area to place old items there including a filled 53-foot box trailer, tires and plastic water tanks, as well as old televisions and computers.  “We’ve been working with DEP with the property to clean up some of the stuff,” McDonald said. “One of the property owners were there earlier in the morning, still continuing his cleanup efforts to basically, clean up the property and dispose stuff. About an hour after he left is when the fire was discovered.”  Despite being nothing of major value destroyed at the site, it was in the best interest to contain it and put it out, rather than just let it burn, McDonald said. The footprint of the fire was 100-feet-by-100-feet, he said.  “You wouldn’t let it burn because you have plastics,” McDonald said. “Fortunately, the owner started cleaning up the old tires and moved a bunch of them. There were still some there but they weren’t in the area that (was) involved.”  McDonald said they do not have a cause for the fire but they don’t think it’s suspicious. The investigation is ongoing, he said.  “It appears for all intent and purposes it’s accidental in nature,” McDonald said. “Because there were TV items and glass and bottles and whatnot, there’s different speculations you can go on. It may have been sunlight amplified through glass. We can’t really put a finger on the cause but we believe it to be accidental. But, where it started, it did get some of the heavy timbers and grass on the fire which spread to the remnants of the building.”  Aug. 31, 1992, the sawmill was destroyed by fire. The fire was discovered fully involved at 11:10 p.m., shooting flames 20 to 30 feet into the air. It smoldered all night and broke out again the next morning. The pile of slab wood that burned would have been ground into landscaping woodchips and sawdust for farms, while a stack of 30 15-foot logs, which would have been cut into 2,000 linear feet of planking, also burned. Firefighters from Oxford, Charlton, Webster, Leicester and Sutton responded to the late-night blaze as Auburn firefighters waited at the Oxford firehouse.  McDonald said the fire presents greater problems for cleanup.  “Fire is not a good way to dispose of anything because it causes great problems, plus what it does to the air,” McDonald said.  Monday, Oxford fire received mutual aid from Charlton, Dudley and Webster.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnYXJkbmVybmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3JlbW5hbnRzLW9mLW9sZC1zYXdtaWxsLXJhdmFnZWQtYnktZmlyZS1tb25kYXktb24tb2xkLWNoYXJsdG9uLXJvYWQvNzAyMTk0MDAwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At 1:53 p.m. fire companies were dispatched to MLK/Southard St for a fire in an abandoned commercial building. Once on site, a call for all hands on deck was made.  The fire would eventually reach five alarms, but there were no reported injuries from anyone within the building. A firefighter had to be transported to the hospital for vomiting, but nothing fire or injury related.  According to Trenton Fire Director Kenneth Douglas, five other city fire departments came to assist in extinguishing the flames.  “Pretty much went to defensive operations almost immediately due to the collapsing of the gym area,” Director Douglas said. “They tried to make an advance inside, but because of the heavy fire load, they were actually backed out and got out just before the collapse.”  Although the school has been closed since 2007, there were plans for the redevelopment of the property. Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora who arrived about 45 minutes after the first alarm, said a potential $50 million grant from HUD could turn the abandoned school into a spectacular senior housing residence.  “It’s an implementation grant that our housing authority is a finalist. No guarantees but if we make it, that would be one of the projects,” Gusciora explained.  Gusciora said any redevelopment had hoped to save many of the historic parts of the building, “especially all the wood floors,” Gusciora explained.  It is also reported that three additional small fires occurred at neighboring homes that were put out immediately by tenants or firefighters in the area.  The fire has since been deemed under control and a perimeter has been put around the building to keep people from entering.  Earlier this year, residents complained that students were entering the school and spending entire days inside. Police allegedly made attempts to prevent a constant flow of trespassers.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

Both children suffered burns over 70% of their bodies, said Destiny Davis, a granddaughter of homeowner Sharon Davis. Medical personnel at VCU Medical Center in Richmond continue to stabilize the kids, ages one and two.  “They’re going to be here for a couple of months,” Destiny Davis estimated. “They're going to have to learn to walk again.”  Her 72-year-old grandmother, who also was taken to VCU Medical Center for smoke inhalation, has been given a tube to help her breathe.  “She was able to squeeze my hand,” Destiny Davis said. “She’s going to be OK.”  All three, however, were still listed in critical condition at the hospital.  Sharon Davis and three of her great-grandchildren were in the home in the 1100 block of Covington Road when the fire broke out around 3:50 p.m. One of the children was able to get out, but fire officials said the other two were trapped upstairs and had to be rescued.  Sharon Davis had been helped by a neighbor and was standing in her yard when the authorities arrived.

(WPRI) — All of Southern New England is under a Red Flag Warning and Fire Weather Watch due to the warm and dry conditions.  The R.I. Department of Emergency Management (DEM) is urging the public to be cautious and avoid outdoor burning since the conditions increase the chance of fires spreading more quickly. This means no campfires, charcoal or cooking fires, and using any devices that emit flames or embers.  Fire officials also believe many recent brush fires may have been started by improperly disposed cigarettes.  Crews are currently battling a brush fire in the woods off Fisher Street in Attleboro.  (Story continues below video.)  Rhode Island has seen its fair share of brush fires in the past month, including one that burned as many as 600 acres of land in Exeter.  “The last time we had the Red Flag Warnings is when we had that large fire in Exeter, so it’s definitely a ‘watch out’ situation for the fire community right now,” DEM Forest Fire Program Manager Pat MacMeekin said.  “Being so recently that we just had large fires, having this Red Flag Warning again is putting us on a high alert absolutely,” he continued.  The DEM says if you see a brush fire to remain calm and call 911.

"fire","2018-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Montclair"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:04:40","Montclair, NJ – John Fierro, president of Montclair Firefighters Mutual Benevolent Association Local 20, refutes claims made about the Montclair Fire Department equipment and conditions at Fire House #3.  “The Viking stove at headquarters was part of a $5 million dollar RFP Specification for a new building. It is 19 years old. Would you put a Home Depot stove in a commercial building? The Viking stove at Station 2 cost the town $6,300.00 in 2001,” says Fierro. “MFD has never prioritized Viking stoves and Nautilus equipment over safety. The silly conversation about Viking stoves holds no merit; they are 20 years or older and have and continue to serve the town well.”  Regarding Nautilus Gym equipment, Fierro says it was acquired by a grant awarded in the 2001-2002 years that was written by Battalion Chief Durning.  “Most of our other equipment is donated by residents that are moving away, and they offer it to the Fire Department,” he says.  Fierro also states that the radios at Station 3 “do work and always work. If a repair is made or there is an issue, every Officer and Firefighter is issued a personal radio and a radio in the Engine; the backup plan has a backup plan. Our radios are not substandard; they still do the job, just not supportive, and challenging to get parts for they have timed out.”  Regarding the request for more firefighters, Fierro says hiring more firefighters is to replace retired members and keep everyone safe.  “To state we are not a serious department on what basis, I stand behind all our members and have a diverse team of Professional Firefighters that other departments admire; our training level is above and beyond,” he adds.  Fierro responded to comments made in the lawsuit about Fire House #3 conditions and also by resident Eileen Birmingham.  “Station 3 is not a “gulag,” I was stationed there for 11 years and enjoyed every minute of it. The people in the neighborhood I met and the flowers we planted all represent that we were happy and proud to be there. Hypothetically in my opinion, if you wanted to punish someone, you would move them to the busiest rig in town, Engine 1 or Truck 1, located at headquarters,” he said.  Fierro says the stove at Station 3 is approximately six years old.  “I remember it being delivered and installed, and it functions 100%. The Sunday gravy we cook on all three stoves tastes the same; i will verify that I’ve personally been at all three Firehouses over my career.”  Fierro writes that there are four paid studies stating that Station 3 is needed.  “Dismissing the studies because they do not fit one narrative is, at best, disappointing,” says Fierro. “Eileen [Birmingham] was given these studies and is quoted ‘I choose not to accept 20-year-old data,’ even though all reports say we are understaffed at 90 Firefighters.”  Fierro says no one has mentioned that the Firefighters 100% renovated Station 2 kitchen and two bathrooms and a Station 3 Bathroom, with the town only paying for material and firefighters doing all labor.  Fierro also writes that MFD staff is full of Montclair residents. He says that information about these buildings has become false and mentions “pop-in visits from the CFO to inspect the buildings, take photos, and interview members.”  “Traditionally, this request is made to the Chief’s office, and a guided tour is scheduled. We do not let people wander around restricted areas and living quarters with personal items left about. It would be irresponsible to our members. Yes, the building is public; however, some areas are not, similar to areas of Town Hall where the public is not allowed to enter at will or sit in on meetings and ask questions. I have had multiple members call and feel uncomfortable and are exploring formal complaints.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmFyaXN0YW5ldC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9tZmQtdW5pb24tcmVmdXRlcy1jbGFpbXMtcmVnYXJkaW5nLWZpcmUtaG91c2UtMy1hbmQtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Crandell, 43, of 42 Stewart St., was found in his second floor apartment by responding fire crews. He had succumbed to the fire.  An autopsy was expected to be performed at Albany Medical Center on Tuesday to positively determine the cause of death, Amsterdam Fire Chief Anthony Agresta said.  Another 51-year-old male resident of the second floor apartment was able to exit the building on his own and alerted police at the scene that his roommate was still inside.  Four individuals living in the first floor apartment were able to leave the building on their own and have been displaced by the fire. Five dogs and two cats were killed.  Multiple callers reported the fire around 6:48 p.m. on Monday. The second floor porch was fully involved when Amsterdam fire crews and police arrived on the scene.  The fire spread through the second floor apartment and entered the attic area of the two-family home. The first floor apartment sustained water damage.  Agresta confirmed the surviving roommate received medical attention following the fire, but declined to provide further details regarding the man’s condition or his identity.  “Unfortunately, I’m not able to confirm his identity,” Agresta said.  The cause of the fire is under investigation by the Amsterdam Fire Department and state Office of Fire Prevention and Control.  The fire is believed to have started in the area of the second floor porch. The cause of the fire does not appear to be suspicious.  Agresta declined to comment further on the cause pending the results of the investigation, which are expected within the next week.

A fast response by firefighters confined the fire to the exterior balcony.  Columbus firefighters were sent to the apartment complex at 9:43 p.m. Monday on a report of an apartment fire at 3586 Nicholas Lane after a fire was reported on a second story balcony, said Capt. Mike Wilson, Columbus Fire Department spokesman.  Firefighters arrived on the scene in less than five minutes of the dispatch and reported a working fire with flames showing. Columbus police, also on the scene, assisted firefighters by notifying neighboring apartment occupants of the fire and aiding in the evacuation of the building, Wilson said. With an evacuation underway and additional firefighters enroute to the scene, the first arriving engine company charged a hose line and advanced into the second floor apartment. As crews entered the apartment, they found the interior of the apartment was clear of fire. Crews pushed to the balcony where they found fire burning up a vinyl sided wall. Firefighters extinguished the flames within seconds of their arrival on the balcony, Wilson said.  Firefighters removed a section of the balcony ceiling and confirmed that that fire was confined to the exterior balcony and did not extend into the apartment’s attic space or apartment’s interior living space.  Fire department investigators learned from the tenant that a family member had been smoking a cigarette on the balcony earlier in the evening and discarded it in a cardboard box that was being used to collect cigarette butts, Wilson said. Investigators said that the cardboard box had completely burned away but a large amount of cigarette butts were located in that location. Investigators ruled the fire accidental as a result of improper cigarette disposal.  Captain Troy Todd, Columbus Fire Department fire investigator, said that the department sees fires similar to this incident each year. “We have seen a number of significant-damage fires occur in the city from improper cigarette disposal. This type of fire is easily preventable if proper disposal takes place,” he said.  Damage from the fire is estimated at approximately $5,000.  Agencies that assisted at the scene include the Columbus Police Department and Columbus Regional Health Emergency Medical Services. No injuries were reported at the scene.  The Columbus Fire Department recommends that all smoking material be disposed of in a noncombustible container. The container should also be periodically emptied to prevent a collection of material within the container. Materials may be doused with water to confirm that the smoking materials are completely extinguished.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlcHVibGljLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2NmZC1pbXByb3Blcmx5LWRpc2NhcmRlZC1jaWdhcmV0dGUtbGVhZHMtdG8tYXBhcnRtZW50LWJhbGNvbnktZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-07-03","Not Discerned","{""Worcester"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:59:19","It’s rare for very high fire danger classification in New England, especially over a large area, but Tuesday brings exactly that – from central Vermont and New Hampshire to just south of the Massachusetts Turnpike, including Worcester and Boston. The threat for brush fire development and growth is very high, owing to recent dry conditions, dry brush and dry air with warming temperatures.  Additionally, a gusty westerly wind to 30 mph for many and up to 40 mph on Cape Cod, becoming southwest late in the day, will contribute to fire spread and this can apply to both brush fires and building fires, as any type of fire thrives on wind to grow and spread. Though Tuesday morning clouds have been thinning for strengthening sun, wildfire smoke from distant fires in western Canada will thicken in our New England sky Tuesday, carried thousands of feet above our heads by the jet stream winds aloft, contributing to a colorful Tuesday evening sunset and Wednesday morning sunrise.  Though that smoke doesn’t directly make it to the ground, there’s just enough pollution in southern New England air for moderate air quality – noticed only by those with respiratory problems – and pollen continues to fill the air. A cold front dropping south from Canada will carry scattered showers from north to south Tuesday late evening and overnight, not arriving to southeastern New England until predawn Wednesday, dropping only hundredths of an inch of rain for communities that see them, and perhaps not surviving the trip at all for the southwest quarter of New England.  Get Boston local news, weather forecasts, lifestyle and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC Boston’s newsletters.  So, fire danger and pollen continues Wednesday, though a drop of about 20 degrees in daytime high temperature owing to the new, cooler air from Canada should mean the relative humidity of the air isn’t quite as dry. The busy, northerly breeze Wednesday will gust to 30 mph at times and will ensure high temperatures near 60 feel like the 50s even at the warmest time of day – a big drop from one day prior! As dry and fair weather continues, temperatures climb incrementally to the mid 60s, then around 70 degrees, respectively, on Thursday and Friday. A sluggish cold front will approach New England this weekend, though timing has been somewhat variable in the forecast. 24 hours ago, it looked like the front may arrive with scattered rain showers on Sunday. That timing has since sped up to later Saturday into early Sunday morning, so we clearly still have some work to do firming this up.  That said, whatever showers arrive shouldn’t stay more than about 12 to 15 hours, which means the entire weekend isn’t expected to be marred by them. We could use some meaningful rain, but our First Alert Team isn’t sold on just how much these showers will deliver, with current estimates from our exclusive NBC Forecast System having dropped to around half an inch due to the increasing forecast speed of the system.  For now, we continue to carry highs in the 60s and 70s next week in our exclusive 10-day forecast, just as long as a northeast wind off the cool ocean doesn’t set up, which we’ll be keeping an eye out for signals of.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Jvc3Rvbi5jb20vd2VhdGhlci9yYXJlLXZlcnktaGlnaC1icnVzaC1maXJlLWRhbmdlci1wcm9tcHRzLXdhcm5pbmdzLWluLW5ldy1lbmdsYW5kLzMwNDYxMzgv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjYm9zdG9uLmNvbS93ZWF0aGVyL3JhcmUtdmVyeS1oaWdoLWJydXNoLWZpcmUtZGFuZ2VyLXByb21wdHMtd2FybmluZ3MtaW4tbmV3LWVuZ2xhbmQvMzA0NjEzOC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The fire has since been determined arson by the Maine Forest Service, Farmington Fire Chief Timothy Hardy reported.  The Farmington Fire Department received the call around 6:30 p.m. on Monday evening, but it took time before they arrived at the scene due to the difficult location. Chief Hardy stated that the challenge was accessing the fire in order to put it out due to a lack of roads or trails in the area. It was impossible to get firetrucks directly to the fire, and Red Schoolhouse Road was blocked off for over two hours to allow firetrucks to reach as close to the scene as possible. Even so, the responding departments had to cut a trail through the trees to the fire.  There was also difficulty with water access. Firefighters used backpack pumps and hand tools to bring water to the remote site. ATVs with water tanks and pumps from the Farmington, Kingfield, and Jay Fire Departments were used to shuttle equipment and water back and forth.  Leaf litter and small trees were burned, although nothing large was reached by the fire, which was completely doused by around 9:30 p.m. when the responders left the site.  The Farmington Fire Department returned to the scene early Tuesday morning and saw that the fire was still out. The Maine Forest Service also returned on Tuesday to conduct investigations into the origins of the fire, which are still on-going. It has been officially determined that the fire was caused by arson.  Mutual aid partners from several surrounding towns were on the scene to assist Farmington, including the Jay Fire Department, Wilton Fire Department, Industry Volunteer Fire and Rescue, Temple Fire Department, New Sharon Fire Department and Kingfield Fire Department, as well as the Maine Forest Service.

Immediate entry was made into the home where firefighters located the 2-year-old child. The child was transported to ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital where she succumbed to injuries suffered in the fire.  Members of the Monroe County Fire Investigation Team were called in to conduct an investigation and process the scene.  A GoFundMe page has been set up at www.gofundme.com/f/the-mcnair-family-fund.

"fire","2023-11-01","00:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 00:45:00","By Debbie Rogers  [email protected]  MILLBURY — Lake Township voters will most likely decide on funding a full-time fire department in November.  At Tuesday’s meeting, the trustees continued discussion on a possible 4.2-mill levy.  “If we’re going to put a levy on the ballot, we’ve got to start taking action pretty rapidly,” said Trustee Richard Welling.  According to the Wood County Auditor’s Office, an additional 4.2-mill levy would raise $1.2 million and cost the owner of a $100,000 home $147 per year.  Fire Chief Barrett Dorner said that the current personnel situation in the township is dire. The community needs to decide the direction for the future, he said.  “We’re willing to provide whatever service the community is willing to pay for,” he said, adding that more community question-and-answer sessions will be held.  “It’s not a scare tactic,” Dorner added. “We just need to be honest with you about what we can do now.”  Request for fire and EMS service is up 70% in the last eight years, he said.  “If that keeps going, our 1,600 runs a year right now will be almost 3,000 runs in 2031,” Dorner said. “We are going to continue our rapid growth, and hopefully it stays consistent and we don’t see a big spike.”  He said he wants to be up front about the department’s current capabilities.  There are two people on staff, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  They rely heavily on backup from neighboring departments.  The department has four levies, which total 4.8 mills, for financial support. The 2022 operating budget was $1.5 million.  Total annual payroll is $795,000, Dorner said  The department relies on administrative staff to respond to calls, when needed. That pulls people away from other responsibilities, such as grant writing, Dorner said.  Volunteers still work for the department, but they are mainly available at night and weekends.  “Those are our slowest time periods. Our busiest is 8 a.m.-8 p.m.,” Dorner said. “They’re available when we need them the least. I wish that wasn’t the case.”  Finding paramedics, especially ones to work part time, is incredibly difficult, right now, he added.  “One of the inspiring things that I’ve heard through all this … if we had full-time (positions open) we would have a line out the door of our people who want to work in Lake Township,” Dorner said. “That’s not everywhere.”  Another levy — or an addition to the proposed levy — is also being discussed.  “I want to bring dispatch back,” said Trustee Lorie Davis on Tuesday.  The township last operated dispatch in 2015. When costs became too high, the township contracted with the Wood County Sheriff’s Office.  Since then, the service has continued to improve, Dorner said on Tuesday.  “We are really reshaping fire dispatch in Wood County,” he said. “They’ve done an outstanding job of working with us.  Dorner said dispatch would cost at least another $500,000 and he requested more time to review the request.  Fiscal Officer Buddy Ritson said that if the trustees want to bring back dispatch and need a levy for it, there should be two separate requests.  “The fire fund is not healthy at this time,” Ritson said.  Building something from scratch right now will be expensive and take time, Dorner said.  After the meeting, Ritson said the township is paying $10,051 per month to the sheriff’s office for dispatch.  Davis said she strongly believes Lake Township should have its own emergency dispatch.  “I feel that dispatch is an important thing here in our own township,” Davis said.  The township, Northwood and Rossford commissioned a study last year to look into combining fire and EMS operations.  According to the study, which was released earlier this year, Lake Township has 54 personnel, with some full-time positions and mostly paid-on-call workers.  After the meeting, Dorner said the idea of combining the three departments is not dead. It’s just going to take too much time to come to fruition and Lake needs action now, he said.  Also at the meeting, the trustees:  • Approved $35,000 to Bowers Asphalt and Paving, Inc., Walbridge, to repair roads.  • Authorized $4,295 to Kaylor Plumbing, Wiring and Heating Inc., Genoa, for electrical repairs to the shelter house and kitchen in Friendship Park.  • Voted to buy firefighting foam from Advanced Eco Systems Inc., Tallmadge, for $1,478.  • Approved paying $1,437 to Speck Sales Inc. for two rear tires for the 2107 New Holland road mower.  • Voted to authorize the purchase and installation of new chain guards on the HI-WAY machine for $1,291. Gledhill Machinery Co., Galion, will do the work.  • Hired Mark Halliday and William Cook as firefighters for $10.10 an hour.  • Accepted resignations from Dakota Crabtree, Hunter Hayes, Tyler Clark and Amy Perry, who are EMTs and firefighters.  • Appointed Zachary Jenkins to the zoning commission for a five-year term.  • Reappointed Donald Nichols and John Sigurdson to the zoning board of appeals for a five-year term.  • Heard April department reports. Zoning issued five permits and collected $900. Police made three arrests and issued 15 citations. Fire and EMS had 92 calls. There were seven burials and three cremations at the cemetery.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnQtdHJpYi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9mdWxsLXRpbWUtZmlyZS1hbmQtZW1zLWZvci1sYWtlLW1heS1iZS1vbi1ub3ZlbWJlci1iYWxsb3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fire, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:    Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).

Jasmine R. Miller was taken into custody last Thursday and charged with one count of arson — knowingly damaging by fire the dwelling of another without consent, a level-four felony, court records reviewed by Law&Crime show.  According to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the Daily Journal, firefighters in Johnson County at about 2:09 a.m. on March 30, 2023, responded to a house fire at a residence located in the 200 block of Restin Road, approximately 120 miles south of Indianapolis. Detectives with the county sheriff’s office arrived about an hour after the fire started and began the search for Miller, who allegedly started the fire before taking her daughter and fleeing the scene on foot. The home reportedly belonged to her then-boyfriend, whose name was not included in the report.  Investigators said that Miller started the fire over an argument with her boyfriend that began on the evening of March 29 about her being at a casino, the Journal reported. During the argument, Miller reportedly sent a text to her boyfriend saying she was going to “drive his f—— truck through [his house].”  The boyfriend was afraid Miller might be serious and filed a report with the sheriff’s office. As a direct result of his report, deputies reportedly arrested Miller when she left the casino and charged her with operating a vehicle without a license.  Miller’s boyfriend picked her up from jail in the early morning hours of March 30 and the two reportedly continued to fight, with Miller blaming him for her arrest. Before they arrived back at the house, Miller reportedly declared that she would be packing her things and moving to her mother’s house.  Miller then proceeded to pack some of her belongings into garbage bags and began loading them into her boyfriend’s truck, per the Journal. While loading the truck, Miller’s boyfriend said he smelled smoke and when he went inside to investigate he saw that all of the clothing in his closet had been set aflame.  “He observed his clothes [that were] hanging from racks on the north wall were on fire,” the affidavit reportedly states.  According to the Journal, the boyfriend briefly confronted Miller before making sure the house was clear of kids and pets. While he was checking the house, Miller reportedly fled the area on foot with her young daughter in tow.  In an interview with detectives, Miller’s boyfriend reportedly said she kept butane torch lighters in the house which she used for smoking meth and likely used to light the fire. In a backyard a few houses away from the boyfriend’s home, investigators reportedly found a purse containing two butane torch lighters and casino player cards in Miller’s name.  An investigator with the White River Township Fire Department determined that the cause of the fire was “incendiary” and the source of ignition was “an open flame being introduced to clothing,” Indianapolis Fox affiliate WXIN reported.  Following her arrest, Miller was booked at the Johnson County Jail where she is currently being held on $100,000 cash-only bond, jail records show.  Have a tip we should know?

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.

Crews said the fire was stopped at half an acre, but if gone unnoticed could have grown much larger.  “We were able to see smoke from a portion of the state that previously wouldn’t have that early detection and we were able to get it at a half-acre rather than potentially having to wait overnight to have people return then see the smoke,” said ODF Public Affairs, Jessica Prakke.

Download the app.  On October 23, 2022, Jim Henterly sat on the passenger bench of a National Park Service AStar helicopter, peering out at the craggy expanse of North Cascades National Park. Next to him was a firefighter from the NOCA (North Cascades) wildland crew, and directly in front of them stood 6,102-foot Desolation Peak. It was an unorthodox move for the parks system to allow the helicopter into the backcountry, but a moderately active fire that had broken out late in the season near Ross Lake, less than 2 miles downhill from Desolation Peak, had closed the trails. On the summit, a cabin covered in silver tinfoil glimmered in the sun like a wrapped Christmas present in a sea of craggy peaks. The first dusting of snow that patched the ground and frosted the roof added to the impression.  It had been a month since Henterly, the resident fire lookout on Desolation, left for the season, unable to properly close the lookout cabin for the winter because of the ongoing wildfire activity. After his lookout season ended in September and he went home to Whatcom county, Henterly didn’t know if he’d return before the following June. But the Desolation Fire, as it became known, climbed halfway uphill toward the lookout cabin, threatening to burn it down. In an effort to preserve it, fire crews had wrapped the 14 ½ by 14 ½-foot wooden structure in a foil blanket. And now, with the threat of the fire passed, Jim returned to remove the foil, inspect the structure, and prepare it for the heavy snows of a North Cascades winter.  To his relief, Henterly, who has spent seven seasons scanning for smoke atop Desolation, found no damage to the lookout cabin or any of its equipment. The structure itself has stood atop Desolation for almost a century, but this latest fire isn’t the only thing that threatens its continued existence as the last staffed fire lookout in North Cascades National Park.

(Photo: Alex Depue)  The summer before, I spent some time with Henterly at Desolation, which is also one of the few remaining staffed lookouts in the entire state of Washington. After corresponding by email for months, I met him at the tail end of the season. After a rigorous 5-mile hike with nearly 5,000 feet of elevation gain, I made it to the ridgeline and got my first glimpse of the cabin. With the shutters propped up, the structure gave me the impression of a single-story pagoda, symbolism that added to my reverence of this place. A man with deeply kind eyes and the svelte body of a lifelong hiker in his sixties, Henterly was cleaning the cabin and readying it for winter when I arrived. A big storm was forecast to sweep into the region within days and the shutters of the mostly glass structure would need to be fastened.  The Desolation Peak fire lookout stands about a foot off the ground on cinder blocks, in the foreground of the twin-fanged peaks of Mt. Hozomeen. The box-like building is painted a light shade called “lookout gray,” and its shutters are raised during fire season to reveal windows on all sides. The interior of the small cabin is a calming green called “Irish meadows,” which, like the exterior color, the Forest Service used regularly for lookouts and the National Park Service maintains for historical continuity. Against the four walls are a lone cot, a desk with an ancient hand-crank coffee grinder, and a bookshelf. In the center of the room sits the Osborne Fire Finder, a device that resembles a high circular table with sights and a map, and can give ranges and bearings from any location within view. Its purpose is to pinpoint smoke and flames so that the operator can dispatch wildland firefighting crews to the blaze’s exact location.  Henterly trained for decades to earn his spot as a lookout at Desolation. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  As he went about stowing objects under the cabin, Henterly told me how he trained as a wildland firefighter and fire lookout for over 20 years to get this post. Some years standing watch as a lookout can be slow with very little fire activity, but these last few years have mirrored the amplified wildfire season that the rest of the West has experienced. Henterly told me about a fire a few years back that holds special significance to him, and he showed me how he used the Osborne Fire Finder to acquire the location by lining up the sights of two apertures that rotate around the map. That fire was classified a monitor-only situation because it was in the remote wilderness of the Arctic Creek drainage north of Mt. Prophet. On his small desk was the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio he used to call in the coordinates and updates to headquarters. Henterly’s job was to observe, document, and relay the life of the flame. Because he found it, the Fire Management Office designated it the Arctic Jim Fire.  Built in 1932, this lookout tower near the border of Washington and British Columbia has long stood as a symbol of firefighting in the West. A century atop a mountain has given this structure a character all its own, with remnants from previous tenants ranging from books and cups to maps and memorabilia. From the outside, it’s the only man-made object in sight, aside from an outhouse a few yards beyond. It’s not surprising that it has captured the imaginations of backpackers, writers, and historians for decades.  Jack Kerouac was the first to introduce me to fire lookouts through his novels Dharma Bums and Desolation Angels, both of which chronicled his experience as a fire lookout on Desolation in the summer of 1956. Notable nature writers Gary Snyder, Norman Maclean, Edward Abbey, and Phillip Connors have also written about the monk-like experience of living in a glass house on a mountaintop. These stories drew me to visit the historic Desolation Peak Lookout 13 years ago, and I’ve revisited the site a handful of times since, along with countless other lookouts across the region.  According to the Forest Fire Lookout Association (FFLA), fire lookouts proliferated between 1930 and 1950, when the Forest Service maintained more than 5,000 towers around the country, mostly concentrated in the forests of the western United States. During this era, Washington alone built 660 alpine lookouts. Since the 1950s, government agencies have torn down many of these lookouts due to disrepair or destruction in forest fires. A number of nonprofit preservation groups like the FFLA maintain some of the remaining structures for public enjoyment.  In a 2019 survey, the FFLA estimated that only around 300 lookout towers were still staffed in the United States, mostly by volunteers, and those small numbers continue to dwindle due to advances in technology. With the use of drones, satellites, aircraft, and even fixed camera systems, the role of fire lookout is quickly becoming obsolete. In Washington, only 93 lookout towers remain, and only a third of those ever host an actual person. Of these few, only a handful are paid, part-time positions within the National Park or National Forest services during any given fire season, which is usually between June and September. The heightened fire activity in the West has not led to higher staffing levels of fire lookouts. Not yet.  Henterly tells me a pivotal role of the lookout at Desolation is to relay radio messages from field crews to headquarters in the park. These radio dispatches, pertaining to ongoing wildfires, trail work, and even rescues, are too far away for headquarters to pick up. Jim constantly monitors every word that comes out of his handheld. It could be a firefighter Mayday, or a mishap that needs to be passed on. Every evening he relays his own report to HQ.  During the 2022 lookout season, Jim proved the importance of his work and the value of fire lookouts in general. During the height of the fire season, he monitored and reported on approximately 20 different wildfires, not only within North Cascades National Park, but also in the neighboring Pasayten Wilderness and in Canada. His dispatches provided critical information to fire crews and a low-cost alternative to the exorbitant financial costs of reconnaissance flights. Those flights are intermittent, and Jim’s constant attention, coupled with regular radio reports, provides vital information with little overhead. The work that Jim does, and the necessity of Desolation Lookout, is so vital that fire crews hiked to the peak last fall to wrap it in protective foil, so that its mission may continue in the future. With the growing fire seasons created by climate change, it seems that lookouts are more important than ever. Perhaps Jim and Desolation Lookout will inspire government agencies to invest, one more time, in the tried and true method of fighting fire by posting fire watchers to stand guard against our burning world.  (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  Meanwhile, the few remaining towers are garnering huge interest from outdoor enthusiasts, perhaps due to the fact that the role of the fire lookout is slowly fading into history. Backpackers can rent many of these structures overnight. Some are open to the public on a first-come, first-serve basis and are often crammed full of campers during the height of summer. These communal barracks are especially sought-after for Pacific Northwest hikers, who ascend steep mountain terrain in droves for a chance to sleep protected amongst the high peaks. Regional blogs keep track of what lookouts are available to rent, which ones are free to stay in, and log the currently staffed locations, so visitors can hike to the cabins themselves and hear first-hand what it’s like to be a fire lookout.  The lives of lookout personnel require patience uncommon in our time, distilled with enduring focus. Every minute or so during my visit, Henterly returned his gaze to 360-degree scans of the surrounding landscape, stalling our conversation and creating stretches of silence that punctuated his stories. Much of the fire season has no sign of smoke, so his vigil can become endlessly repetitive. Luckily for Henterly, his view is inspiring. There are mountains on all sides, spreading out in ripples of ridgelines and glaciated peaks that comprise the northern expanse of the Cascade mountains.  It’s useful for lookouts to have personal interests to fill the quiet moments. For Henterly, drawing is a way to while away the daylight. With a pencil, he sketches finely detailed pictures that can fit into the palm of your hand. He’s drawn portraits of nature writers and mythical creatures, such as J.R.R. Tolkien’s ents, which are enormous walking and talking trees. The sketches merge with his lookout tasks, as the contrast of light smoke on a dark landscape parallel the lead on white paper. Over the seasons, he’s turned his sketches into stickers that he’s posted around the cabin with quotes from his favorite authors.  On the doorpost, I noticed a sticker Henterly drew with John Muir’s quote, “One can make a day of any size.” It’s a fitting adage for a fire lookout. Because Henterly’s been lucky to staff this lookout for consecutive seasons, he’s grown familiar with this corner of the backcountry. He’s watched a black bear become a mother, guiding her cub through the blueberry bushes until it was finally big enough to venture out on its own. There are also two large ravens that perch on the rooftop of his cabin, and they too welcomed offspring to their avian family. Last year their chick went missing. Henterly recalled the peregrine falcon and Cooper’s hawk that preyed upon the ravens in previous seasons. He hoped the young raven went off on its own, like the young bear.  While the animals have become Henterly’s closest community, there are regular pilgrims, like me, that come to visit the lookout. After so much time alone, Henterly welcomes the opportunity to talk with other humans face-to-face. In these dwindling days of staffed lookouts, Henterly has become a storyteller, sharing the deep history of this place with people who have traveled from all over the world. He told me how Native Americans quarried stones for tools from this ridge for at least 9,000 years. In 1859, a Swiss topographer named Henry Custer explored the area with Native guides and created maps from their journeys. Early U.S. Forest rangers and firefighters, like Ed Pulaski, fought and sometimes gave their lives to protect the land. Trail crews, volunteering their time, maintain the trail and the lookout. Fire crews treasure it as an icon. A long line of lookouts has staffed this peak, including Jack Kerouac, with his vision of a coming generation of backpackers heading into the wilderness.  The lookout on a smoky evening. (Photo: Zach Goldberg/@FrozenFoto1)  I noticed a quote by Barry Lopez on the cabin wall: “One of the great dreams of man must be to find some place between the extremes of nature and civilization where it is possible to live without regret.” That ignited a conversation with Henterly about the important work of environmental authors, Lopez and Gary Snyder, Thoreau and Emerson. Talking to Henterly, I felt blissfully lost. I had dreamt of this place for so long, and now I had experienced it personally, making it a small part of my own story. But I didn’t want to outstay my welcome, so I thanked Henterly for his hospitality and slowly began the trek to my campsite at the southern tip of Starvation Ridge. Henterly walked with me along the alpine meadow. We stopped to scan for the young black bear, and he invited me to return in the morning for a cup of black coffee and more talk of our shared interests.  Back at my camp, more than 15 miles in any direction from the nearest road, I watched the dark of the night unfurl like a blanket over Starvation Ridge as pinpricks of stars poked through the sky. My eyelids grew heavy. There on that primeval post, one of the last of the fire watchers stood guard against the elements. Though I couldn’t see the lookout from my campsite, I imagined the lone light of the tower burning like a lantern in a sea of darkened peaks. It’s been burning in my mind these past years, a beacon of inspiration that draws backpacking pilgrims like me to this vast wilderness. Its light will burn longer still: In June 2023, Jim Henterly will begin his eighth consecutive season as Desolation Peak’s fire lookout.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhY2twYWNrZXIuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvbGFzdC1maXJlLWxvb2tvdXQtbm9ydGgtY2FzY2FkZXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtcGFyay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 02:51:05","A voluntary safety recall announced Tuesday highlights a problem some Jeep Grand Cherokee owners have been dealing with for years.  Michigan-based automaker Chrysler announced on Tuesday the voluntary safety recall of Jeep Cherokees, model years 2014 to 2016, that the automaker says are at-risk of catching fire, even when their engines are turned off.  The recall centers around the “power liftgate module” system, which is a motor system that opens and closes the rear hatch or cargo compartment of the vehicles.  Chrysler told federal regulators that water can seep into these liftgate module systems, potentially sparking a fire.  Feeling out of the loop? We'll catch you up on the Chicago news you need to know. Sign up for the weekly Chicago Catch-Up newsletter here.  “An electrical short in the power liftgate module may lead to a vehicle fire with the ignition on or off,” Chrysler said in its formal recall notice filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  Photo of where a ""power liftgate module"" is located in a Jeep Cherokee's rear hatch, according to an NHTSA filing by Chrysler in 2015.  The recall applies to at least 132,000 Jeep Cherokee models, the automaker told regulators, but some media reports have estimated more than 200,000 models could be at risk.  There is no repair or remedy at this time to fix the problem, so Chrysler is advising all owners of these vehicles to park them outside until further notice.  “Owners are advised to park outside and away from structures until the recall repair is complete,” the automaker told regulators. “The remedy is currently under development.”  Consumer advocates say the “park outside” part of the recall announcement could be especially hard for some Chicago owners, who rely on indoor parking garages.  “In some of the recent recalls where there’s a park outside warning, we’re seeing vehicles turned away from parking garages, even folks who have a monthly contract are told they can’t park in the garage until the recall repair has been performed,” said Michael Brooks, the Executive Director of the Center for Auto Safety.  Brooks said owners need to take the recall notice seriously.  “NHTSA doesn’t issue a lot of ‘park outside’ warnings, so when they do, it’s important that owners heed that,” Brooks said.  In its formal filings with regulators, Chrysler said it began investigating concerns over “cargo compartment fires” in these vehicles in 2022, but customer reports to the company about the problem date back to 2017.  The filings indicate Chrysler may have received dozens of reports of fires taking place, but as of April 27, the automaker said it is “not aware of any accidents or injuries potentially related to this issue.”  A 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Jeep Cherokee owners may feel a sense of deja vu over the liftgate problem.  Back in October 2015, Chrysler announced a safety recall regarding the same liftgate fire issue in 2014 and 2015 models of the Jeep Cherokee, according to prior NHTSA filings reviewed by NBC 5 Responds.  At that time, Chrysler said it would install water shields to prevent moisture from corroding the liftgate module, in order to prevent the risk of fire.  But now, Chrysler said “Vehicles repaired under the prior recalls will still need to have the new remedy performed,” once it’s developed.  “This exact same defect is still occurring,” Brooks said. “And it looks like between the time that first fix was implemented to today, there have been between 50-100 fires, it’s a little unclear from their filings. That’s a large number of vehicle fires.”  No timeline was shared by Chrysler for when a new remedy to the problem will be developed.  For more information, Jeep Cherokee owners can call Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) at 1-800-853-1403, or contact the NHTSA Safety Hotline at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153), or visit www.nhtsa.gov.

"fire","2023-05-01","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:06:47","Fire can be a force for either good or bad. For instance, the words “all fired up!” usually connotes positive feelings whereas the phrase “you’re fired!” can mean that you have been involuntarily deselected from the workforce.  Fire can destroy or renew. A little of both took place at our farm recently.  A year ago last May an unpredicted and unpredictable derecho struck our region. Our farmstead, like many others, lost dozens of trees. The number of trees in our shelterbelt that were busted off or uprooted could officially be classified as “more than you can shake a stick at.”  Like many homeowners in our region, I quickly formed a close personal relationship with my chainsaw. We are eternally grateful for all the help we received from neighbors and friends who pitched in with the cleanup. The downed trees were pitched into a brush pile that grew to approximately the same size and tonnage as a house.  Last week I decided that it was time to burn the brush pile. It seemed fitting that it was almost a year to the day after the derecho.  One cannot simply conduct a major burn on a whim nowadays. One must alert the authorities so that they can be prepared in case things get out of hand. Another factor is that people who live hereabouts become nervous whenever they see a large plume of smoke rising into the sky. Such a thing is likely to be reported to the authorities, causing enormous amounts of undue consternation and perhaps a visit from your local fire department.  I watched the weather forecast closely and chose a day that promised light winds. Early on the morning of the burn I strolled down to the brush pile accompanied by our faithful farm dog, Bella.  “Don’t play with fire!” is an admonishment that’s often issued to little boys. This only serves to make fire seem all the more fascinating to the boy. Our family incinerated our household refuse when I was a kid and I frequently volunteered to tend the burn barrel. I thus acquired a deep respect for the way fire can behave. Liquid accelerants cost me more than one set of eyebrows.  A few well-placed wadded-up newspapers were all that was needed to ignite the brush pile. Within seconds the fire had leaped from twig to branch, roaring greedily as it gobbled the desiccated wood.  The heat quickly became surprisingly intense. Even at 50 feet away, Bella and I were beginning to feel quite toasty. We probably could have roasted weenies right where we stood.  Bella sat at my feet and peered up at me with an anxious expression that seemed to say, “Dad? Don’t you see what’s happening? Are you sure that everything is OK?”  I assured her that things were going exactly as planned. “But maybe we should back up a few yards,” I told her. “If we stand this close much longer, we’ll both soon be hot dogs.”  It was one of those rare mornings here on the prairie when the wind was virtually nonexistent. This happens about as often as a visit from Halley’s Comet.  Some of the trees in the brush pile were absolutely huge. One of them had a trunk that appeared to be the same diameter as a rear tractor tire. There could be no doubt that this tree was more than 100 years old. This meant there could also be no doubt that it had been planted by my great-grandfather Charlie Sveen, who homesteaded our farm.  Glancing at the garden hose at my feet, I thought about how Charlie had probably carried buckets of water to that tree to nurse it through long, hot summers. The tree had returned the favor by providing shelter from our relentless winds for multiple generations of my family.  And now it was going back to the atmosphere from whence it came via the rapacious flames of an ignoble brush pile fire.  Like a passionate new romance, a brush pile fire throws off tremendous amounts of heat and drama at the start. And like a romance, things eventually settle down to a slow smolder. That is when the real work begins.  I used a long-handled shovel to push wayward deadwood onto the glowing heap of coals as a fickle breeze pushed the lazy smoke in random directions. By the end of the day, I had absorbed more smoke than a side of bacon.  “Phew!” exclaimed my wife when I walked into the house, “You smell like you’re on fire!”  It’s gratifying to know that the spark is still there after more than 40 years.  — Jerry’s book, Dear County Agent Guy, is available at http://Workman.com and in bookstores nationwide","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcnNoYWxsaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL29waW5pb24vbG9jYWwtY29sdW1ucy8yMDIzLzA1L3BsYXlpbmctd2l0aC1maXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ohio has eight cities on highest home fire risk index.  Canton and Akron have made Hartford insurance company's index of ""top 150 U.S. cities with highest home fire risk.""  The insurer ranked Canton as No. 41 and Akron as No. 40 on its list.  The city it considered with the highest home fire risk was Modesto, California. Ohio had six other cities among the 150. Cincinnati was ranked No. 8 in the index. Youngstown was No. 16. Columbus was No. 39. Cleveland was No. 98, Dayton No. 113 and Toledo No. 122.  The Hartford said it each of the cities on its list of 150 will get $10,000 each to fund fire safety education for children.  More:Deadly rash of house fires in Ohio: 'We know that so many of these fires are preventable.'  Jeff Welch, an assistant director of media and public relations for the Hartford, says the company releases its index of 150 cities with the highest home fire risk once every three years as part of its Junior Fire Marshal Program to educate kids about fire risks. The first was in 2017 and the second in 2020.  Welch said the index covers all residential structures, including single-family homes, duplexes and multi-family units like apartment complexes. It doesn't include vehicle fires or fires at businesses.  Data crunched over three years  In the 2017 index, Welch said, Akron ranked 54th and Canton was not on the list. In the 2020 index, Canton was No. 72 and Akron was No. 33.  Messages seeking comment were left with the Canton and Akron fire departments.  Welch stressed that the index only indicates home fire risk for a particular city in relation to the others on the index.  “The ranking itself is all relative. You could be a safe city but (the) 109 cities below you are a little safer (in terms of home fire risk). It’s not saying (a city on the list) is a dangerous city. I wouldn't frame it that way and that's not how we frame it.”  Welch said, “It’s not an indication of anything to do with the fire department or response times ... or training."" He said the purpose of the index was to generate interest and support for fire safety education and to help educate people on what to do in the event of a fire.  Welch said the Hartford's data analysts come up with the rankings looking at the number of home fires in zip codes for a particular city per a certain number of people who live there according to Census data. They then contract with a polling firm to reach people around the country online and poll them on their behavior that may increase or reduce the risk of a fire. Welch said at least 100 people in each of the 150 cities on the list were surveyed.  Questions on the survey asked people if they engaged in behaviors that raised the risk of fires or mitigated the risk or impact of fires. Had they left something cooking on the stove for too long? Did they have a working fire extinguisher? Did they regularly replace the batteries of their smoke detectors? Did members of the household have an emergency escape plan?  Welch said the goal of the program was to identity the cities where children best need fire education that the Hartford's Junior Fire Marshal program could target with the $10,000 grants.  ""We’re trying to identify where the fire safety gaps are through this index,"" he said, adding that the Junior Fire Marshal program has educated 112 million children the past 76 years. ”Really the goal is to educate these kids so they become fire safe adults.""

The house at 556 Northwest Drive off DuPont Road caught fire Saturday evening and was so badly damaged firefighters were unable to enter it to completely extinguish the blaze.  Smoke was seen at the site Sunday and Monday as well.  The cause of the fire is undetermined due to the extent of the damage but it remains under investigation, said Jason Baltic, deputy state fire marshal and chief investigator for the Fire Marshal’s office.  Washington Bottom Volunteer Fire Chief Garry Freed said Monday the fire appeared suspicious because there were no utilities on at the house.  It’s one of two structures owned by the DNR at the site, after it was transferred to the state by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the late ’60s or early ’70s.  Westfall said the DNR used to allow people to stay there in exchange for maintaining the property but it has moved away from that model. Both buildings were dilapidated before Saturday’s fire, he said.  “The agency has wanted to demolish the buildings for quite some time,” Westfall said.  The sticking point has been the demolition of the larger lockhouse along the river as well.  “It’s likely to be expensive,” he said.

Fuels are going to dry out very quickly and we're going to continue to have fires.""Wilbourn said that includes fires that begin at homeless encampments, which he said have been increasing in Sacramento County.""Year over year, we've seen an 111% increase in unhoused-related fires, so that means people that are out in the fields, maybe they're cooking for themselves. They have an open flame. The fire gets away and runs and potentially causes a larger fire,"" Wilbourn said.Firefighters from the Sacramento Fire Department and the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District responded to a homeless encampment fire Tuesday afternoon. A spokesperson with the Sacramento Fire Department told KCRA 3 that trees started to catch fire just after 4 p.m. on 14th Avenue near Power Inn Road in Sacramento. Fire crews arrived within minutes and quickly put out the flames.Cellphone video sent to KCRA 3 shows the moments the flames jumped into the higher branches of the trees. Amalia Valencia, who works nearby, said the fire started when she was finishing up some paperwork at the office.""I heard a loud bang — a loud explosion,"" Valencia said. ""It's very scary. I mean, our shop is just right across.""Valencia said she figured the fire had started at the homeless encampment, which she said has caused issues in the area before. Debris and trash can be seen all across that section of land. Valencia said she is grateful the fire did not spread too far, but she added that she is concerned about the summer months.""I had walked through here before and I saw that there were several gas tanks and a barbecue grill on this section area, and I had told my brother, 'Oh, that’s eventually going to end up happening,'"" Valencia said.Sacramento fire officials said firefighters are currently going through wildfire refresher training so that everyone can be prepared to battle fires this summer. Experts are also reminding people who live in areas near dry brush to create some defensible space around their homes.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjcmEuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc2FjcmFtZW50by1jcmV3cy1wcmVwYXJlLXdpbGRsYW5kLWVuY2FtcG1lbnQtZmlyZXMvNDM5MTIyNDnSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5rY3JhLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9zYWNyYW1lbnRvLWNyZXdzLXByZXBhcmUtd2lsZGxhbmQtZW5jYW1wbWVudC1maXJlcy80MzkxMjI0OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"fire","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","{""SantaRosa"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:14:00","SANTA ROSA -- Fire departments across the Bay Area say the record-setting wet weather at the beginning of the year is not a reason to take it easy this fire season.  In some ways, all that rain will create more work for residents to protect their homes from fire danger later this year.  ""The main thing, my understanding with fire, is the embers, it's not necessarily the flames,"" said Jake Lehrer, a Santa Rosa resident who designed his home to be hardened against fire risk almost 20 years ago. ""If nobody is here, overtime...it will start to grow and burn the house down.""  Lehrer knew he was living in a fire-prone area, so he asked the city for help adding features around his property, including a stucco house and a special deck. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, he added more layers of protection including new vents at the base of the house and a metal roof.  ""It's all protecting the house from embers flying,"" he explained.  The metal roof can block embers from getting under that surface. The home also has a non-venting attic. His deck is sealed in a way to keep embers from spreading so close to his house. While those long-term amenities to his home help, he still clears his property each year, not just trimming grass and weeds but removing dead trees.  The wet start to 2023 does not give him any comfort about the steps he will need to take this spring.  ""I would say the main thing is to keep fuel away from your house -- at 30 feet, 50 feet, any fuel,"" Lehrer said.  Santa Rosa Fire Department Fire Inspector Will Powers says residents need grass and weeds on their property knocked down under four inches ahead of fire season.  ""The first thing we're looking at is what's closest to the home,"" he told KPIX while visiting Lehrer's home. ""We're looking at the roof line. This resident here has trimmed this stuff away from the roof line. That is very crucial in creating that defensible safe.""  Late-season rain and the large amount of rainfall the region received will contribute to vegetation growth. Clearing fuels and cutting grass to create defensible space will require that vegetation get cut at least twice this year, compared to when drought conditions allow for the grass to only be cut once.  ""This is the time when we want residents thinking about the plans they need to make for what could potentially be a long, long summer,"" said Santa Rosa Fire Division Chief Fire Marshall Paul Lowenthal. ""Our community has been through some pretty significant events and are taking things a lot more seriously and it's preventing damage here locally.""  Lowenthal said they will likely declare the start of fire season in the beginning of June. Warmer weather happening this week will factor into that decision. Inspections of properties will begin the first and second week of June.  ""We definitely were caught off guard in 2017. In 2020, we saw the effects of what measures like the resident here has taken,"" Lowenthal told KPIX. ""It's great to see efforts like this. We still see a lot of homes that still need work done. But for every resident that does work like this, it's one less home that could potentially be damaged or destroyed.""  In 2020, there were 1,152 properties impacted by fire in Santa Rosa, but only 30 were destroyed, according to Lowenthal. He says that better prepared residents helped make the difference that fire season. That's why he wants to encourage the public to take important steps now to help them through the summer and fall.  Leaders at Con Fire add that they anticipate a more dangerous fire season will return sooner rather than later after a relative break in recent years. The abundance of vegetation and all the rain during the winter is part of why they are preparing for the worst.  The agency says there will likely be a greater crop of fuel this year and it will eventually dry out, that could lead to a busy and potentially dangerous fire season.  ""To me, the rain allows us to have drinking water. It doesn't help with fire,"" Lehrer said.

Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  Crews battled a large fire in a five-story apartment building in downtown Portland on Tuesday.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  According to Portland Fire & Rescue, the fire started at about 10:30 a.m. at The May apartments near Southwest 14th Avenue and Taylor Street. Smoke from the four-alarm blaze in the Goose Hollow area was visible across the Willamette River and much of the city.  Smoke from an apartment fire in downtown Portland, Ore., May 16, 2023, is seen from the Wells Fargo Center in this provided photo. Courtesy of Arnold Benson  Several people were rescued from the building, and shortly afterward crews were ordered to withdraw from the building due to the fire’s growth.  Barbett Grace sat on the pavement and watched the building burn Tuesday. She lived on the third floor and said she didn’t notice the fire alarm at first because they’ve had several false alarms. Then she heard the fire trucks outside.  “So, I opened the door and it was dark and full of smoke,” Grace said. “I just went to the window and climbed out.”  Grace, 67, has arthritis, but she managed to get down the three stories using the building’s fire escape. She had been scheduled to move this week because her doctor worried she wouldn’t be able to use the fire escape. Now, she’s moving six blocks away, but will turn up empty-handed because all her possessions were destroyed in the fire.  Barbett Grace, 67, pictured here on May 16, 2023, lived on the third floor of The May apartments. She said she managed to escape the building using a fire escape after the apartments erupted in flames. Fire officials closed streets around the roughly 113-year-old building out of fear it may collapse from the fire. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  ”It’s mostly just stuff. The paperwork, my veterans paperwork, my drivers license, Social Security card — all of those are going to have to be replaced. And that’s going to be the biggest thing,” she said.  Portland Fire & Rescue spokesperson Rick Graves said many people and animals had to scramble from the building as the fire quickly spread.  “Upon arrival some of the first arriving crews were actually just aggressively running the hallways, slamming doors saying, ‘This is not a false alarm. Get out, get out, get out!’” he said.  Two firefighters suffered minor medical issues, but no other injuries were reported.  Graves added that emergency vehicles moved away from the roughly 113-year-old building in case of a structural collapse. The streets around the building were also closed.  THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor  Most of Interstate 405 closed starting around noon Tuesday as smoke from the fire limited visibility on the freeway. The closure resulted in significantly snarled traffic throughout the city in the afternoon, even after the highway reopened.  Portland General Electric also cut power to the area as a precaution.  Firefighters monitored the building overnight into Wednesday morning. Portland’s city engineer will evaluate its stability on Wednesday.  Known issues  The May apartment building was constructed in 1910, according to property records.  Graves called it a “non-sprinkled building” that did have “sprinkled exits.” He said firefighters did not know if the sprinklers worked or whether they went off. An agreement from Aug. 8, 1974, notes The May had some sprinklers along the corridors, stairs and the basement, according to Ken Ray, a spokesperson with the city’s Bureau of Development Services. It also had hardwired smoke detectors, alarms and fire extinguishers, according to that same 1974 agreement.  The fire remains under investigation, though Graves said it appears it began on the third floor.  Records show the building had some documented issues in recent months. On Dec. 1, 2022, the city received a complaint stating the building had “severe leaks, mold, mildew” that there was “exposed electrical wiring” and that there were “no smoke, gas or carbon monoxide detectors.”  The May apartment building, in the Goose Hollow area of Portland, was consumed in a four-alarm blaze on May 16, 2023. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB  On Dec. 15, a Bureau of Development inspector went to the building and documented 10 violations that were sent in a letter to SkyNat Limited Partnership, the property’s owner. The violations included repairing emergency lighting on several floors, replacing an expired fire extinguisher, and addressing electrical extension cords in the lobby “daisy chained with other power strips or extension cords” that created a potential safety or fire hazard.  The city gave SkyNat two months to correct the violations.  ”Due to limited staffing, the Bureau of Development Services does not have the resources to re-inspect most buildings on the deadlines set in violation letters,” Ray said in a statement. “It is the property owner’s responsibility to fix the concerns and notify BDS for a re-inspection. That did not happen, and fines began accruing for the uncorrected violations.”  SkyNat paid fines in February and March and, as of April 27, still owes the city $1,723.  The Bureau of Development Services inquired last month about the 10 documented violations, and SkyNat told the city it was still fixing the violations. City inspectors returned to the property Monday and found most, but not all of the violations had been fixed.  According to its website, SkyNat is a family business with more than 500 residential units in Portland, Gresham, Vancouver and Tigard. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  When reached by OPB, a maintenance contractor for the company referred a request for comment to company officials.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3BvcnRsYW5kLWZpcmUtYXBhcnRtZW50LWRvd25vd24tcmVzY3VlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2018-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 18:16:30","WASHINGTON -- In partnership with Meta, FEMA’s Ready Campaign, the Ad Council and the U.S. Fire Administration co-launched a new virtual reality experience promoting fire safety awareness.  In “The Escape Plan,” users must work through various obstacles to make a timely escape from an apartment building fire. The free virtual reality experience lets users practice their fire escape skills on their own time and in a safe, controlled environment and can be used with virtual reality equipment. At the end of the experience, users can create their own fire escape plan and visit Ready.gov and Listo.gov in Spanish language to further prepare for home fires and other hazards.  While virtual reality equipment is recommended, but not required, a desktop version of “ The Escape Plan ” allows users to participate in the experience and practice fire safety anywhere there is internet connectivity.  “From our user-friendly FEMA App that provides real-time weather alerts and helps people prepare for common hazards, to the use of geospatial tools to identify the hardest hit communities following a disaster, FEMA continues to use every tool at our disposal to help people before, during and after disaster,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. “We are excited to partner with Meta and the Ad Council on this new virtual reality tool and we are eager to further leverage technology to protect people and save lives.”  “You don’t have much time to act in the event of a fire,” said Michelle Hillman, Ad Council Chief Campaign Development Officer. “Being able to practice a fire safety and evacuation plan before the emergency arises will reduce the chance of panic and ultimately save lives.”  “At Meta we are building for the next generation of the internet, which is why our partnership with FEMA and the Ad Council to develop immersive experiences in Virtual and Augmented Reality like the Escape Plan is so important,” said Caitlin Ryan, VP Creative Shop EMEA – Meta. “In VR, mistakes can be made without real-world consequences, ensuring individuals can safely learn and are better prepared, ready to act quickly in a real emergency. The VR version of this product creates the sensation of being present in a virtual three-dimensional environment, allowing you to experience and learn what you need to do to escape a home fire. While the Escape Plan is a virtual experience, the impact will be real.”  Virtual reality is emerging as an effective way to augment professional and personal emergency training and can have advantages over large-scale training programs that take extensive time and resources. Experiences can be developed to simulate an environment, whether the setting be in an office, emergency room or in your own home, rather than placing the trainee in the potential path of harm.  “Proven technology like automatic fire sprinklers, smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors save the lives of civilians every day, and the U.S. Fire Administration has long advocated for the use of immersive learning tools to protect our nation’s fire fighters and increase public safety education,” said U.S. Administrator Moore-Merrell. “It is our hope that ‘The Escape Plan’ and other technological advancements will protect even more people and help us to further address America’s persistent fire problem.”  “The Escape Plan” joins a suite of digital tools leveraged by FEMA to help people before, during and after disasters. Last year, the Ready Campaign launched an easy-to-use digital form to help individuals and families create an emergency plan on their phone or laptop. The form can be saved onto any device and emailed to other members of their family and is available in both English and Spanish languages. And just last year, FEMA updated its mobile app to give users increased personalization options and help them take charge of disasters. The new app is more accessible, with increased functionality and innovative features to help people prepare for, protect against and recover from disasters.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlbWEuZ292L3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMzA1MTYvbmV3LXZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS1leHBlcmllbmNlLXRlc3RzLXVzZXJzLWZpcmUtc2FmZXR5LXNraWxsc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"fire","2023-05-02","14:00:00","{""MillHall"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:21:57","MILL HALL — Mill Hall Fire Company will temporarily stop conducting lift assists.  Announced during Bald Eagle Township’s supervisor meeting Monday, the fire company will temporarily stop responding to lift assists.  According to Mill Hall Fire Chief Tony Walker, the company voted to discontinue them for the time being during their May’s meeting. He added the issue is due to a lack of help as well as other issues he would not publicly address.  The fire company previously discontinued lift assists about six years ago. At that time they stopped due to lack of training and issues of liability, according to Walker.  “That was a big issue and that is part of this other one — why we quit doing them. I did leave that up to the company, so they voted,” he said.  Lift assists are involved when an individual is assisted up to a mobile position from the ground by emergency service officials. They are not treated or brought to a hospital for medical attention. An ambulance is dispatched for emergency specific incidents.  Since lift assists fall under a non-emergency, it falls back onto fire companies, according to Flemington Goodwill Hose Ambulance Chief Kim Shainline, who was in attendance during the meeting.  “If there is any form of question on if it is a medical issue, then an ambulance is dispatched,” she said.  Other municipalities have either stopped doing assists or have partnered with local ambulance stations, according to Walker. They signed up to be quick response services (QRS).  Firefighters are meant to be well rounded for such incidents, according to Walker. There are currently only two medically trained EMTs at Mill Hall Fire Company, he added.  Shainline was in attendance with other members of Goodwill Ambulance in order to set up Goodwill Hose as the next responding department. Currently, after the Mill Hall Fire Company, Goodwill EMS is the next to call for lift assists through dispatchers.  Goodwill Hose Fire Chief Gary Mellot is offering to take up the assists with Mill Hall being unable to, according to Shainline.  “Gary said they (Goodwill Hose) would still be interested in helping fulfill that need because now it is an unmet need for your community. Which could mean that person ends up sitting on the floor for a half hour to an hour or longer, and now it does become a medical emergency. What if there is no ambulance available for that patient?” she said.  More of a burden is being placed onto ambulance services who are taking care of emergencies with injured people, according to Shainline. Ambulances from Williamsport or State College are forced to pick up lift assists when Clinton County services are busy.  “That doesn’t make any sense to me, especially when there are firefighters around who are still doing the lift assists,” Shainline said.  The caller is indicated if they are in an emergency with a dispatcher. The dispatcher then has a list of questions signifying if it is an emergency or not. A patient is billed after three lift assists, according to Shainline. The first two have no charge.  With the lack of manpower for lifting assisting, Walker said the fire company partnered with Goodwill Hose as they were doing nine-tenths of the lift assists.  “They were doing most of them for us because we didn’t have anyone,” Walker said.  Supervisors had an issue of what is considered an emergency, since they have a year-long contract with Mill Hall Fire Company. Supervisor Stephen Tasselli said that Mill Hall is in a contract with them and should stick by it until it expires in December.  “A contract is a contract. I don’t want to hold a gun to your head because of one thing but it is what it is,” he said.  Bald Eagle Township tries to give every emergency service department in the area a stipend, according to Chairman Tuff Rine. Mill Hall Fire Company gets a major share due to the number of calls they receive in Bald Eagle Township.  “I can’t really tell you Bald Eagle Township can do anything other than ask that our communications center follows the call procedure that has been set up — somebody is calling to get lifted versus somebody who has fallen and broken their head open — I think it becomes a question of the communications center on who they should call,” Rine said. “If Mill Hall has decided that they are not going to do lift assists anymore, then I would think the communications center should flip to the other page and have Goodwill take care of it.”  The Mill Hall Fire Company has been dealing with issues regarding lift assists for almost a year and a half.  “Because of some issues that some monkey dug up which caused a lot of chaos within all the emergency services here in the county. That is why a lot of them quit doing them (lift assists),” Walker explained.  He added the fire departments and supervisors should meet and “hash something out.”  Tasselli urged that they are trying to support everybody with the issue. He added he hopes they can work together to come to a resolution.  “We are kind of in a catch 22 listening to everybody and trying to help out and communicate with you all to keep this service,” he said. “We also tried on a couple of occasions with services to try to go to Lock Haven… to get a back door for you guys besides Flemington and we were told ‘hey we can’t do that, you’re not allowed to do that’ from the city manager. We are kind of in the same boat you are but I think you guys are doing a good job communicating with what’s happening right now.”  Shainline asked for the supervisors’ approval for Goodwill Hose to be the next due for lift assists.  Colten Mellott, the deputy fire chief for Goodwill Hose, was also in attendance during the meeting Monday, representing the fire company. He explained how their officers have the minimum training requirements for lift assists. There are about three EMT trained members of the company, so far.  “We are here to help the community whether it’s Flemington Borough, Bald Eagle Township, Mill Hall, Lock Haven. We ran 81 calls this year and so far, we have not dropped a single one. Our department’s ever expanding, we run an engine tanker, a traffic unit… and we have a rescue. We put medical equipment on board and we are working to get into QRS certification. All of our line officers, whether it’s from the fire chief down to the sergeant, all of them we require a minimum, you have to have first aid/CPR and most of our guys that are going are officers, so they have the minimum training requirements,” he explained.  They will ask the patient if they are hurt, and if they are, Goodwill Hose will contact an ambulance service for assessment. Mellott offered supervisors their service whenever they needed.  In other business:  There has been no progress with the Cottage Lane water line project.  At April’s supervisors meeting, Steve Gibson, the director of planning/county engineer attended to discuss the project. During that meeting, it was discussed that the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will pay for engineering of the water lines once there is a project sponsor. A sponsor must be the entity that applies for the necessary loans. They will take on all financial responsibility if grant funding is not received. It is an issue that supervisors fear to take on currently.  As of Monday’s meeting, there is nothing new from Gibson or Suburban Water, according to supervisors.  “I thought Steve Gibson was supposed to get back to us with more details and present some options,” Tasselli said.  The only cost for the township would be legal fees according to supervisor Kenny McGhee’s summation of what Gibson stated.  “I am in favor of signing the application to get it started,” McGhee said. “The engineering is going to be paid for by DEP.

The Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR) is reminding the public to exercise caution and follow all state laws and local ordinances regarding open burning. The National Weather Service has issued Special Weather Statements for elevated fire weather and additional Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings are anticipated.  Open burning requires a permit from your town forest fire warden, and Vermonters should always check with their town forest fire warden before burning. When conditions are dry, town fire wardens can institute a burn ban in their respective town.  Find your town forest fire warden.  Most areas in Vermont have been 1” below normal rainfall for the last two weeks, with the last measurable rain on May 3. The weather forecast over the next few weeks does not indicate any signs of relief, with little to no precipitation forecasted.  The dry conditions call for extra attention when open burning—particularly with campfires—to reduce the risk of wildland fires.  FPR issues a daily Fire Danger Forecast for Vermont. Today’s forecast is high or very high. Get the most recent update:  Increased awareness can go a long way to limit the occurrence of wildland fires. Please help prevent wildfires by following these simple guidelines:  Be aware of the current weather conditions before igniting a fire.  Understand open burning laws.  Obtain a permit from your Town Forest Fire Warden.  Never leave an open fire unattended.  Never build a campfire on top of duff.  Use a camp stove to prevent escaped fires.  Extinguish fires completely before leaving. This can be done by dousing the fire in water, including all embers. Use a live, green branch to mix and stir the embers. If water is not available, use soil or sand to mix into the embers to cool them down. Continue to mix water and soil with the embers until the material is cool. Before leaving, use the back of your hand to check for heat in the campfire.    Find more Wildland Fire information from FPR online.  Source: May 15, 2023.

"fire","2023-05-15","00:15:00","{""Champaign"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 03:11:47","CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (WCIA) – What started as a final hurrah for newly graduated U of I students could follow some of them to court.  “There was one couch put in the middle of the street. Then all of a sudden there [were] 20 couches and it was kind-of the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” U of I senior Jared Kurland said.  Then, that pile of furniture was set on fire as hundreds of people watched. Students say the crowd started gathering just before midnight. By 12:15, the fire ignited at the intersection of S Oak and E Chalmers Streets in Champaign. By 1 a.m. Monday, multiple citations for open alcohol violations were issued.  “I mean, I probably inhaled half a couch just being in the vicinity because everything was going up in the air,” U of I senior Spencer Gallagher said.  That’s a sentence you don’t hear every day.  “Someone wanted to start a fire and that’s exactly what happened,” Kurland said.  300 people crowded around a residential intersection – some with alcohol, old furniture and lighter fluid in hand.  “It was terrifying. We were all texting each other being like, ‘does everybody have renters’ insurance?'” U of I senior Regan Sauer said.  That’s because it happened just a few feet from Sauer’s front lawn, in a pocket of Campustown known as “Seniorland.”  “We’ve had people over before but it’s never been this severe,” Sauer said. “We’re kind-of upset that this happened.”  And no one really knows why, except that it may have been part of a farewell tradition among new graduates.  “It’s kind-of the last thing all the seniors do. Then after this we all walked to the quad, have a good time there, and say our goodbyes to each other,” U of I senior Sahil Yemul said.  “There was a similar instance of this last year, though maybe not quite as large,” University of Illinois Police Department Communications Director Patrick Wade said in a statement.  “It wasn’t a good thing. I mean, it was cool to watch at least,” Gallagher said.  UIPD says the gathering is currently under investigation and could bring serious legal consequences. So far, six students have been given notices to appear in court.  “Luckily I didn’t get one but I was here when they were passing them out,” Kurland said.  Plus, they’re all feeling lucky no one was hurt. Students said it was a way to spend their last moments in Champaign together…  “It was probably not the safest thing to do but you can’t really do this anywhere else so everyone was just having a good time,” Yemul said.  …And simply, to dispose of items they don’t need anymore.  “There are all these old couches that people have and they want to get rid of them somehow. So they just brought them out there and set them on fire,” Kurland said.  It was eventually extinguished by the fire department, and Champaign Public Works crews cleared the road of debris. But that didn’t stop the house on that corner from receiving a notice for excessive trash, and partial responsibility for a mess created largely by strangers.  “That’s why we’re out here now trying to pick it up because we obviously don’t want to get in trouble with the city. We’re not troublemaker girls we just want to be on everybody’s good side,” Sauer said.  UIPD declined an interview because the investigation is ongoing.

The blaze occurred in the kitchen area of The Thai on North Mission Street just before 1 a.m.  Wenatchee Police Department Capt. Edgar Reinfeld says officers had to rescue both men as the fire raged, including the need to physically carry one of them from the building.  ""Officers arrived and immediately found one male just inside the building. Then, they discovered there was a second man in the structure and got them both out safely. Through an investigation it was learned that these two were cooking inside the restaurant after hours and that both were intoxicated while doing so.""  Police say the restaurant's owners told officers the pair were not authorized to be inside the restaurant, which was closed at the time of the fire.  Reinfeld says the employee's actions caused the fire but its exact source is still under investigation and that charges against the men are unlikely, but possible.  ""Most fire-related charges such as Reckless Burning or Arson - and in this case it would be considered a potential arson because it was an occupied building even though it was just the two of them inside the building - require an element of recklessness at the least, like someone saying 'this is a really bad idea but let's do it anyway', or the intent to actually cause a structure fire. And I'm not sure we're going to get to either one of those based on the evidence that we currently have on the fire, but if something else were to come to light, we would possibly file charges.""  No one was injured in the fire but the restaurant has been rendered unable to operate as a result of the fire and will be closed indefinitely while necessary repairs are made.

Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.

Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:  Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).

Just before 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, May 14, 2023, the Carencro Fire Department responded to a report of a commercial fire at Pelican Park, located at 110 Softball Drive.  Arriving units reported flames and heavy smoke coming from the first floor of the three-story facility.  Carencro Fire Department, with the help of fire departments from Lafayette, Scott, and Duson, were able to bring the fire under control in approximately 30 minutes.  The fire was contained to the concession stand area, causing severe damage. The bar and offices on the upper floors only received minor smoke damage.  However, the extreme heat from the fire on the first floor has compromised the structural integrity of the second floor.  Investigators from the Lafayette Fire Department determined the fire originated in a storage room and was deemed accidental. Fire fighters remained on scene for several hours putting out hotspots.  Carencro Fire Chief, David Mouton, said there were no players or spectators at the park when the fire started and no injuries were reported.  A staff member preparing the park for a softball tournament discovered the fire and attempted to put it out with a fire extinguisher, but was repelled by the intense heat and flames.  Pelican Park will remain closed, and all scheduled tournaments have been canceled until further notice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthdGMuY29tL25ld3MvbGFmYXlldHRlLXBhcmlzaC9jYXJlbmNyby1sYW5kbWFyay1idXJucy1pbi1lYXJseS1tb3JuaW5nLWZpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The cause of the fire is under investigation.  BREAKING: Firefighters battling a blaze at this single-family home on Forest St. in Malden.

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXNpZGVudHMtdm9pY2UtY29uY2VybnMtYWZ0ZXItcGFybWEtYXBhcnRtZW50LWJ1aWxkaW5nLWZpcmUv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g4LmNvbS9uZXdzL3Jlc2lkZW50cy12b2ljZS1jb25jZXJucy1hZnRlci1wYXJtYS1hcGFydG1lbnQtYnVpbGRpbmctZmlyZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3Bvc3RzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2FjY2lkZW50LWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC9mb3JtZXItc291dGgtZ2xlbnMtZmFsbHMtbWNkb25hbGRzLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1lYXJseS1tb3JuaW5nLWZpcmUvYXJ0aWNsZV9lNzNiMTA2YS1mMjY3LTExZWQtOWVhZS1iZjNiYmYxNjIyODQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
