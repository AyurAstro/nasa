"game","2016-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Madison"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T12:00:00","MADISON, Wis. — People of all ages struggle with mental health, but sometimes, it can be hard to know how to manage life stressors.  Through the help of virtual reality, a group of University of Wisconsin researchers in the school’s department of psychiatry has teamed up with the Dane County Juvenile Detention Center. They’re helping children deal with their emotions in a more productive way.  Dr. Justin Russell, research scientist in the Building Resilience to Adversity and Violent Experiences (BRAVE) Research Center, leads the team.  Russell and his team of research specialists bring children to an entirely different three-dimensional world where they are required to use breathing techniques to survive and progress.  “Taking a deep breath can actually just help you calm down,” said Russell. “It seems so obvious to some of us but by training these kids who can be so dysregulated and have so many emotional problems, we believe we can really help them and that’s kind of what we are trying to monitor here.”  The game is called VERA, or Virtual Emotion Regulation in Adolescents, and it transports users to a vibrant underwater world.  Collin Schmit, UW research specialist, works directly with patients, studying their physiological systems like heart rate and respiration. He said so far, the VR experience has been beneficial for many of their patients.  “Over the course of about 15 minutes, they get into a nice rhythm, find themselves really calm,” said Schmit. “They talk about feeling really relaxed when they come out of the headset, and they didn’t know that their body could feel that way.”  According to the Wisconsin Office of Children’s Mental Health, 80% of violent youth offenders had an incarcerated household member.  On top of that, 64% of households living below the poverty line in Wisconsin are single-parent households.  These environments may cause trauma to children. That’s where the VR breathing training comes in.  Russell said biofeedback (electronic monitoring of bodily functions) is not a new concept and, ultimately, he said the idea of it is very boring.  But what is new is combining biofeedback with a video gaming experience.  “Something like 90% of kids play video games at least once a month and if we can meet them where they are, with treatments that we know work, I think it is going to be a huge advantage in mental health,” said Russell.  Russell said his team’s work is just beginning and the hope in the future is to monitor kids for longer periods of time to find out if their work is having any lasting impacts on Dane County’s youth.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vd2kvbWlsd2F1a2VlL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yMC92aXJ0dWFsLXJlYWxpdHktZ2FtZS1oZWxwcy1qdXZlbmlsZXMtZGVhbC13aXRoLWVtb3Rpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-03-06","18:00:00","{""Mentor"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T22:00:32","Ohio Virtual Academy teacher Aaron Lyman describes Programming and Software Development student Ian Munoz of Mentor as an extremely dedicated and bright student, always willing to share his knowledge with his peers when they have questions and constantly researching to expand his own knowledge.  It also just so happens Ian is a fan of participating in escape rooms.  Ian’s natural intelligence and creativity, his willingness to work with others and passion for escape rooms has helped spawn a new interactive video game called “Sealed Whispers.”  Ian is part of a group working on the game in a course called Game Design in the Programming and Software Development program. Ian is the 3D artist, Jordan Bruce is the programmer and level designer, Duncan Burleson is responsible for story and audio development and Caleb Ferronniere is involved in story development.  “In terms of his contribution to the ‘Sealed Whispers’ game, Ian has consistently displayed his ability to work effectively with a team and has remained passionate about the project since the beginning,” Lyman said. “Ian is extremely dedicated to his work, a gifted problem solver and a wonderful student to work with.  “He explores multiple solutions and is willing to take steps to make any necessary adjustments for the project to be executed as expected,” Lyman added. “He regularly performs beyond expectations and is always willing to dedicate maximum effort when completing projects.”  The game synopsis for “Sealed Whispers” is as follows: Players take on the role of Frank Foley — an “average Joe” news reporter working a typical 9 to 5 … until he is mysteriously kidnapped and disappears without a trace.  “Frank wakes to find himself trapped in an unfamiliar basement with no signs of how he got there. He is then greeted over a speaker system by his kidnapper, explaining that he is the most valuable subject to complete his puzzles. On top of an already dreary situation, Frank discovers that he is hearing ghostly voices. Will these voices be able to lead Frank to a daring escape?”  Lyman said the group of students who have worked on this game were a dedicated group usually staying after the live Game Design class sessions to share personal projects they were working on or inquire about specific topics covered in the course curriculum.

Following one of the later class sessions, a couple of the students presented the idea of developing a game.  “The interesting part is though the students had discussed some ideas, the escape room concept did not come until later in the planning phase. The students really wanted to create a unique gaming experience,” Lyman said. “After some online research and discussions, Ian had shared his interest in completing in-person escape rooms which caught the attention of the group. Soon the group had a title, story concept, a list of potential game mechanics, and concept art leading to developing the project in Unity (a free game engine).”  For Ian, the project isn’t about the technical world of writing computer codes or such tasks, it is more about being part of a group where the whole is more impactful than the individuals.  “I have learned from this experience, along with other CTE experiences, that it is important to work as a team, to have regular meetings and good communication with each other,” he said. “A large part of any project is coming together and planning everything with one another and updating each other on progress and other situations.  “I think being understanding of one another and learning when to compromise are also important aspects of teamwork that are used just as much as everything else,” he continued. “In order to work cohesively and efficiently together, you need to be able to understand each other and your differences.  “We were very lucky to have a group that connected very well with each other and knew each other very well. Sometimes, compromises need to be made where there are disagreements, and it’s important to know when those cases come and in what way you need to compromise for the betterment of the project.” — Student Ian Munoz  “We were very lucky to have a group that connected very well with each other and knew each other very well,” he added. “Sometimes, compromises need to be made where there are disagreements, and it’s important to know when those cases come and in what way you need to compromise for the betterment of the project.”  OHVA is Ohio’s online public school serving students grades K-12. Part of its curriculum includes career tech education, such as supporting those students who have an interest in the gaming industry.

Students also have the chance to communicate with industry professionals during guest speaker sessions to gain more insight on what a typical “day-in-the-life” might look like when working in their field of interest.  The main goal of the program is to prepare students for future opportunities.  Ian has been enrolled in the CTE program for two years in the Programming and Software Development pathway.  Lyman said the students will not receive grades for this project since it is more of an extracurricular activity. However, the CTE students are required to document a specific number of work-based learning hours during their time in the program. These hours can be logged for working at a job, attending guest speaker sessions and events or even working on personal projects that align with their pathway content — such as the “Sealed Whispers” game.  Lyman thinks the fact students can take steps toward a potential college major or full-time career while still in high school is an important benefit.  “In my opinion, this is one of the more interesting components of our CTE program — especially being in a 100 percent online classroom environment,” he said. “Our program gives students the opportunity to explore career fields that may interest them during their time in high school to prepare for what they may pursue at a college level.  “We do our best to tailor our program to every individual student’s needs, interests and goals by sharing a wide range of potential opportunities that might be available after a student completes their pathway courses,” he added. “Some students are interested in obtaining their degree while others are ready to enter the workforce immediately after graduation.  “We’ve recently been focusing on a large push for internships, apprenticeships and mentorships to give students an opportunity to gain work experience before fully entering the work force.”  The students aim to have the game completed by the end of the semester and are hoping to enter it in gaming competitions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI1L21lbnRvci1zdHVkZW50LWhlbHBzLWNyZWF0ZS12aXJ0dWFsLWVzY2FwZS1yb29tLWdhbWXSAWBodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9tZW50b3Itc3R1ZGVudC1oZWxwcy1jcmVhdGUtdmlydHVhbC1lc2NhcGUtcm9vbS1nYW1lL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2015-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Montreal"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-26T00:02:40","“With all of the remakes going on today, you can never be sure what you’ll get at the end.”  It was with this cautious scepticism that veteran game designer, Frédérick Raynal, initially greeted the news of his most famous creation, Alone in the Dark, getting another do-over.  Which is an understandable reaction, given that this franchise has a singularly bad track-record when it comes to being fumbled by outsiders. And that’s putting it lightly, as anybody who has ever played 2015’s risible Illumination will attest.  You see, while other survival horror classics like Resident Evil and (to a lesser extent) Silent Hill have managed to evolve with the times and cling to their relevancy, Alone in the Dark has suffered quite a spectacular fall from grace.  Very few players under the age of 30 will remember the series with all that much fondness, given that its entries have been so few-and-far-between and that the quality of them has been even spottier. Honestly, the Uwe Boll movies are probably what the IP is best known for these days, and that’s a pretty damning indictment if you’ve ever tried to watch those fucking atrocities. Yet despite this troubled history, Raynal seems quite optimistic about the latest reboot from Pieces Interactive. Extolling the project in a new spotlight video, he claimed that the franchise is “in good hands now.” With a very telling emphasis on the word “now.”  And based on what we saw at a recent press conference — where the video in question first debuted — we’re inclined to agree with him. A truly auspicious preview, it confirmed that Alone in the Dark is finally returning to its roots, with plenty of mystery, exploration and atmospheric scares. Not to mention a pair of hot celebrity leads.  Going Back To The Source  Much of Raynal’s confidence seems to be entrusted in writer-director Mikael Hedberg, whom he credits with rekindling the essence of Alone in the Dark.  Incidentally, if Hedberg’s name sounds at all familiar to you, it might be because he helped craft the stories for many of Frictional Games’ iconic horror titles, including Amnesia: The Dark Descent and SOMA. So he definitely has an encouraging batting average.  Praising his successor, Raynal continued: “When we made the first Alone in the Dark, we were basically doing something that nobody had done before. It was the first time that you could explore a big mansion, fight monsters and solve difficult puzzles. All in real-time 3D! I think that Mikael and the team at Pieces did a great job of preserving the core feeling of that [original] game. They went further than I could have expected.”  For his part, Hedberg claims that it was deeply “flattering” to receive Raynal’s blessing in this way. Reciprocating the compliment, he added: “It’s really an honour to be part of the franchise, because it cannot be overstated how much of a novel experience it was [back in the day].  “As a fan, I wanted to bring as much of that as I could to our version […] If you know the old games, then you will find a ton of references here. It feels like we’ve been cultivating a seed that was planted 30 years ago and it has grown into something darker and even more sinister.”  Scrappy Combat and Bewildering Puzzles  Staying true to that vintage Alone in the Dark seems to have been a top priority for Hedberg and his team, because everything about their new remake feels like a deliberate throwback to the heyday of survival horror.  While the last two instalments in the franchise tried to clumsily up the ante and pivot to an ill-fitting, more action-heavy style, this one promises to mark a return to old-school sensibilities. Among other things, it’s got a claustrophobic setting, a gauntlet of obtuse puzzles, and civilian protagonists who aren’t exactly suited for the violent encounters that await them.  Focussing on the latter, Hedberg told us: “Our combat is intense and tough. You will need to use every bullet that you can find and, if you run out, you might need to get in close and hit the [enemies] with a melee weapon. Or if you are lucky, you might find something to throw.”  Accompanying gameplay footage then illustrated precisely what he meant here, depicting a player caught in the throes of a deadly ambush. Cornered by a horde of grotesque, eldritch abominations (some of which look like the oversized bugs from The Mist, while others are more humanoid in appearance), they unload a meekly-powered pistol into their adversaries, before then going in for the swing with a metal pipe and finally lobbing a bottle at them as an absolute last resort.  Although the monsters were eventually defeated, it was still a frenzied, panic-inducing struggle; just as it should be. After all, this isn’t the type of horror game where you are going to be lugging around a vast armoury or gunning down every single creature that you bump into, ala Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. Instead, you’ll need to play it smart and use your resources more judiciously; choosing when is the right time to fight and when you ought to just flee.  The approach is totally in keeping with those earlier Alone in the Dark outings which, lest we forget, were hardly action-packed experiences. If anything, they were more focused on puzzles and exploration.  Fortunately, both of those aspects will be making a welcome return here as well, with our preview offering a tantalizing glimpse at some devious conundrums. All of the usual suspects were present and accounted for (you’ll be hunting for keys, slotting items into stone reliefs, deciphering symbols etc.), but it sounds like the developers also have a few more challenging riddles up their sleeves.  On that note, you will be able to customise the difficulty of these puzzles — should they prove too arduous — by tailoring how much the game holds your hand. Clarifying how the system will work over email, a spokesperson for publisher THQ Nordic told Bloody Disgusting:  “Going into the puzzles without any aid will require some patience, as well as a willingness to do non-linear thinking and finding your own path through the mansion. Many players will enjoy this; however, we don’t want it to be [an obstacle] for players who enjoy going through the game a bit faster.  “This is why we are offering additional help with puzzles and navigation. [It] will affect how much information you will find on your map, how many hints you get for a puzzle, and how easy it will be to find interaction points.”  Interbellum Horror  From a narrative perspective, Alone in the Dark (2023) will also have a great deal in common with its 1992 forebear.  At the press conference, Hedberg summarised: “We start our story much like the original. In the 1920s, a man called Jeremy Hartwood believes himself to be cursed and haunted by [a malevolent presence] known as “The Dark Man.” He is then admitted into a countryside hospital, in Louisiana, which goes by the name of Derceto.”  His mental state growing increasingly unhinged, Jeremy eventually sends a concerning letter to his niece, Emily, as a desperate cry for help. Plagued by terrible visions herself, Emily is spooked enough by this communiqué that she decides to venture into the Deep South to see what’s going on.  For support with her investigation, she also ropes in private detective — and series icon — Edward Carnby. Together, they’ll soon discover that maybe there is more to Jeremy’s ramblings than first meets the eye, and that a supernatural entity might actually be tormenting the Hartwood clan after all.  Those who are familiar with the OG Alone in the Dark will recognise that the basic skeleton of its story has been kept pretty much intact (a young woman heads to Louisiana in search of her uncle, accompanied by a hired gumshoe). Yet many of the specifics have changed.  Most notably, Derceto has been converted from a quintessential haunted mansion into a private mental hospital. As such, you are slightly less isolated within its walls, sharing the space with a bunch of eccentric patients and furtive staff members.  The fact that you will be interacting with all of these persons-of-interest feeds into the remake’s other major difference. This version of Alone in the Dark is much closer to a noir mystery than your traditional ghost story. The characters each fit into archetypes of the genre, there’s a moody doom jazz score, the dialogue is terse and snappy, and there’s no telling how far down the rabbit hole your investigation will lead you.  According to Executive Producer, Michael Peck, some in the development team have taken to calling this style “Interbellum Horror,” in reference to its unique period setting. Sandwiched between WW1 and WW2, it’s an era that we rarely explore in video games and, when combined with the humid Louisiana backdrop, should give the remake a unique flavour.  Elaborating upon this at the virtual press conference, Hedberg said: “When I first wrote the dialogue […] it was sort of a 1940s thing. They were kind of being a bit catty and a bit funny. With Carnby, we also played on the trope of the detective, which was a lot of fun. It just makes it feel a bit different.”  A Top-Notch Cast  Of course, to embody these pulpy characters, you need to enlist performers who are capable of delivering the lines without making them sound too silly.  Enter David Harbour and Jodie Comer.  Portraying Edward Carnby and Emily Hartwood respectively, these Hollywood A-listers have both had their likeness translated into the game, alongside their facial capture and vocal performances. As the two playable leads (they each have their own separate campaigns that crossover from time to time) they’re obviously going to have a lot of juicy material to work with.  Visibly delighted by how he managed to attract such high-profile talent, Hedberg said: “We knew early on that we needed to find some really good actors to make the characters come to life [because] it’s not like we just used the voices. We can also see their likenesses.  “David seemed to slot on in perfectly as Edward Carnby. [He] has a really strong presence as an actor and he’s able to make the funny moments really funny, but also the dramatic parts really intense.  “Meanwhile, the character of Emily has a closer connection to the plot. She’s Jeremy’s niece, and therefore also suffers from the strange affliction known as the Hartwood curse.  “I felt it was important then that we get somebody who could hold their own against David, and not just come off as some sort of pathetic side character. Jodie is a fantastic actress, and she brings a lot of nuances to Emily. It really makes us sympathise with her.”  The feeling of admiration is clearly mutual, as both cast members had nothing but praise for the script. Making a fleeting appearance in the spotlight video, David Harbour was particularly effusive about the game’s writing.  Describing his relationship with Alone in the Dark, the Stranger Things star gushed: “I knew of past iterations of the game. I mean the video game world is something that I’m very interested in in general. The horror genre specifically.  “[This new version] maintained some of that weirdness of the old games, but it had an updated slickness to it that I liked as well. [Carnby] is kind of a gruff detective and [he’s] hardboiled but he’s got some humour to him and stuff like that. He’s a bit of a trope. And I liked that. And I like the world and how he’s exploring this insanity, amidst all of this horror.”  Echoing these sentiments, Jodie Comer (who is less au fait with the gaming world) enthused: “I love the mystery […] There was so much about it that I was curious of.”  Once again disguising her Liverpudlian dialect — as she did in Free Guy and The Last Duel — the Killing Eve actor seamlessly disappeared into the role of Emily in the footage that we were shown, sporting a very convincing American accent.  About her character, said added: “There’s a lot of fear within her and a lot of speculation, curiosity, dread and intrigue. There’s a lot about her that’s on edge. Yet there’s still […] time to breathe and have a funny moment or a sarcastic moment.”  In the opinion of Hedberg, Comer’s “earnestness” perfectly offsets Harbour’s more jagged edges. It’s like they’re ideal foils for one another.  He hopes that this chalk-and-cheese dynamic will compel you to replay the story at least a couple of times, so that you can see it from both perspectives. About this he said: “It makes the two campaigns that we have more interesting. Depending on who you play, you will get a different take on the same narrative. The people at Derceto will react differently to you […] even the story will be slightly different, so you should definitely make sure to play the game twice.”  If what we saw here is anything to go by, however, then you won’t need that extra incentive to dive back into the world of Alone in the Dark. Indeed, this is shaping up a damn fine horror title and a textbook example of how you go about remaking an older property, with a healthy reverence for what came before and an equal willingness to shake things up.  To paraphrase the franchise’s original creator, it looks like we’re in very safe hands.  Alone in the Dark (2023) will be released on the 25th of October for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. The game will be priced at $59.99.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2Jsb29keS1kaXNndXN0aW5nLmNvbS92aWRlby1nYW1lcy8zNzYzNTQ2L2Fsb25lLWluLXRoZS1kYXJrLXByZXZpZXctaG93LXRoZS12aWRlby1nYW1lLWZyYW5jaGlzZS1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWl0cy1yb290cy10aGlzLWhhbGxvd2Vlbi1zZWFzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After trailing 4-0 through four innings in the District 3 Class 4A semifinals, the No. 6-seed Nighthawks rallied for three runs in the bottom of the fifth and three more in the sixth to pull off a stunning 6-5 victory over No. 7-seed Northern Lebanon.  Hanover (16-6) will battle East Pennsboro for the district title at 4 p.m. next Tuesday at Cumberland Valley. The visiting Vikings will take on Bermudian Springs for third place and a spot in the Class 4A state tournament.  Northern Lebanon (16-8) jumped ahead with a run in the first, two in the second and another in the fourth against Nighthawks pitcher Chase Roberts. But Hanover's offense broke through in the bottom of the fifth, cutting the deficit in half on Jaxon Dell's two-run triple before Roberts helped his own cause with an RBI single.  After the Vikings got a run back in the sixth, the Nighthawks responded once again. Daniel Corbin's RBI single made it a one-run game again, Tyler Hansford's single loaded the bases and Hanover tied it on Dell's grounder that went for a fielder's choice. Roberts gave the hosts a 6-5 lead with a ground-ball single to center, then went back to the mound and slammed the door.  The senior — who became the York-Adams League's all-time passing yards leader during football season — threw 99 pitches in seven innings, allowing five earned runs on eight hits while walking two and striking out three. He also finished 3 for 4 at the plate with two RBIs. Dell was 2 for 3 and drove in three, while Corbin went 2 for 3 with one RBI. The Nighthawks finished with 10 hits.  Hanover's victory came on a difficult day for York-Adams League baseball and softball teams, which went 1-7 in district playoff action. Five YAIAA softball squads — Dallastown, South Western, Littlestown, Delone Catholic and Fairfield — saw their seasons come to an end, while Bermudian Springs and Red Lion baseball took losses in their respective district semifinals.

"game","2023-04-13","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T04:16:52","The playoffs are complicated. Each series is its own story, and each game is its own chapter encompassing a dozen moments and plot points. But the playoffs can also be simple. Each of those moments, those plot points, falls into one of two buckets: the things we observe and the emotions they inspire within us. That’s what we’re here to talk about.  What We Saw  Joe Pavelski didn’t partake in the morning skate. He opted for a deserved maintenance day for a 38-year-old who continues to defy traditional aging curves. Many hours later, he repaid the morning off with the final shot of the night, blasting home a one-timer on the power play to give Dallas a 3-2 overtime win over vegas and extend the Stars’ season for at least one more game.  “Who else?” Jake Oettinger said after the game.  Who else, indeed?  Pavelski stepped up on a night when Dallas played without its captain. Jamie Benn will miss Game 5, too. It remains deeply improbable, then, that Dallas comes back from an 0-3 hole in this series. But at least for one night, a raucous AAC made anything feel possible.  That includes a return to form for Jason Robertson, who extended the Stars’ season as long as he could prior to Pavelski’s game-winner. Robertson scored twice, had 11 shots, and did everything within his power to will the Stars into a Game 5. If Dallas does pull off the improbable, Robertson’s Game 4 performance will become stuff of Stars legend.  But even if it doesn’t, this was a hell of a hockey game. Both teams had chances, both goalies played well, and it was just plain fun. Vegas goalie Adin Hill weathered a second-period storm from the Stars, turning away 18 of 19 shots in the middle frame. Jake Oettinger responded with a weathering of his own, turning away 14 third-period shots as Vegas pushed to end the series in regulation.  Oettinger’s third-period showing nearly set the stage for Dallas to win in regulation, but Hill made a breakaway pad save on Frederik Olofsson, who just missed out on being the surprise hero. Instead, that honor went to a man who had saved the Stars so many times before. And thanks to Joe Pavelski’s latest big goal, he and the Stars will have at least one more chance to make playoff magic.—Sean Shapiro  What It Felt Like  I wouldn’t call it relief. Relief implies something positive on the horizon, which isn’t likely. But perhaps it was just enough to make Dallas exhale. This win was delivered by a team with no pressure—everyone expects them to lose, whether in five, six, or seven—and Benn’s absence freed his teammates from the weight of Game 3’s skullduggery. It was nice, then, to see the Stars play a concerted effort for 60 minutes plus, at last, a few more in overtime.  It’s hard not to get into the negative emotions right away, though. Because this was the performance Dallas needed on Tuesday. Tuesday’s Stars needed Thursday’s Jake Oettinger. They needed Thursday’s Jason Robertson. They needed Thursday’s Max Domi.  But Dallas can’t turn back the clock, and Vegas won’t be dismayed by the outcome knowing it can close out the series at home. The William Karlsson line, which is outplaying the Roope Hintz trio, still has orders to shut their counterparts down as they’ve done all series. Jack Eichel has the mandate to keep punishing the Esa Lindell-Jani Hakanpaa pair. Vegas’ depth has been present at all times. Dallas’, on the other hand, has been absent and is nearly out of time to figure it out. Adin Hill has been excellent each game while Oettinger cycles between elite and subpar.  Thursday night was a good win, but there’s no escaping that nagging feeling about why this was necessary instead of consequential. That’s what prompts the proverbial mound of what-ifs. If Ryan Suter never turns that pack over, or if Benn never loses his mind, maybe Thursday is a great win. Perhaps even a series-tying one.  But you know the joke: ifs, buts, candies, nuts, etc. So if nothing else, it’s nice to feel a lot less negativity. Losing can be its own misery, and Game 3 took that to another level. Game 4, however, was a much more pleasant viewing experience. If those feelings of relief are the only victory Dallas has left to give us, hopefully, we get a few more of them before the season is over.—David Castillo  Get the ItList Newsletter Be the first to know about Dallas' best events, contests, giveaways, and happenings each month.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzLzIwMjMvMDUvd2hhdC13ZS1zYXctd2hhdC1pdC1mZWx0LWxpa2Utc3RhcnMtZ29sZGVuLWtuaWdodHMtZ2FtZS00L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-20","17:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T04:07:05","STILLWATER — After Oregon’s Alyssa Daniell rolled a run-scoring single through the right side of the infield, Oklahoma State pitcher Lexi Kilfoyl decided there would be no more.  Quite literally. No runs, no hits, no baserunners of any kind.  The senior right-hander retired the final 17 batters and the sixth-seeded Cowgirls’ offense lit up en route to an 8-1 win over unseeded Oregon in the opening game of the Stillwater Super Regional on Thursday night at Cowgirl Stadium.  Oregon managed three early hits, but with spectacular defense behind the hard-throwing Kilfoyl, the Ducks failed to reach base over the final five innings.  “I didn’t know until someone said something,” Kilfoyl said of her perfect final 5 ⅔ innings. “I felt good from the start. I was sweating a bunch in that bullpen, but being a Florida girl, I’m used to that.  “I trusted my drop ball and they were putting it in play right to our players. They’re covering every single inch of that field, and they did tonight.”  More:Tallen Edwards left high school early to join Oklahoma State softball. 'It was worth it.'  Kilfoyl struck out just three batters, but induced 13 groundouts. Oregon only got the ball to the outfield a few times, including a couple of fly balls to the warning track, but both were run down by Cowgirl outfielders.  Freshman Tallen Edwards made a running catch, leaping just before she hit the wall to make a grab on a fly ball in the first inning, and she came charging in to make another catch in the fifth. Chyenne Factor tracked down a long flyout in the sixth inning. Middle infielders Kiley Naomi at shortstop and Rachel Becker at second base each made tough plays, including a diving stop and quick throw by Becker on a seventh-inning groundout.  “She was spotting the ball low,” Oregon second baseman Allee Bunker said. “She throws the ball hard and low. We were trying to get our pitch.”  The Cowgirls (45-14) trailed 1-0 until exploding for three runs in the bottom of the fourth and four more in the fifth, keyed by home runs from Naomi and Morgyn Wynne. That was plenty of offense to deal Oregon (38-16) its most lopsided loss of the season.  The second game of the best-of-three series is set for 5 p.m. Friday, with the third game, if needed, on Saturday at a time to be determined.  More:How did Oklahoma State softball find a 'calming perspective?' Meet pitching coach John Bargfeldt  OSU is one win away from its fourth straight Women’s College World Series appearance, and Gajewski is almost assuredly sending ace left-hander Kelly Maxwell to the pitching circle Friday.  The decision to go with Kilfoyl was made early in the week when pitching coach John Bargfeldt approached Gajewski with his thoughts.  “On Monday, we were the only two in the office, and I knew he was gonna want to talk,” Gajewski said of his conversation with Bargfeldt. “He’s a planner. I’m not. I kinda can do whatever. He said, ‘Hey, I think I wanna go this way,’ and I said, ‘We don’t have to make a decision here.’ And we never talked about it again.  “I think we feel like this because of the way she’s pitched here the whole year. She’s been as dominant as anybody that we have this year. We just have not played well behind her many times. I came to the ballpark here today and I felt like we’ve got a No. 1 going, and I’ll feel like that tomorrow as well.”  Offensively, the Cowgirls got the biggest boost from the home runs, but also took advantage of Oregon mistakes. In the fourth inning, one OSU run came in on a throwing error and another scored when shortstop Paige Sinicki couldn’t quite grab a high line drive by Edwards.  The Cowgirls were hitless in the fifth inning until Wynne’s homer, having reached base with two walks and an error on a sacrifice bunt, and scoring one run on a groundout before Wynne lined her three-run homer to left field.  More:How Oklahoma State softball rode into NCAA Super Regional with stick horse named 'Bullet'  The home run — Wynne’s 10th of the year — was a laser without much height. But the super-senior designated player never doubted it was gone.  “No, I knew it was over,” Wynne said with a laugh. “I swung and I was like, oh, that was great.”  The Cowgirls, of course, can’t relax with Oregon focused on keeping its season alive on Friday.  “This is best two out of three,” Oregon coach Melyssa Lombardi said. “We wanted to get the first game. We didn’t, but we’ve still got two more games to go. What I love about this team is that anytime something hasn’t gone our way, we’ve learned from it, grown from it and it’s made us better.  “I know some things that happened to us this game, we’ll take into our next game. I love this team. I love their fight. I think they’ll do a really good job of being able to let this go and be ready for tomorrow.”  More:How has former longtime OU assistant Melyssa Lombardi resurrected Oregon?

"game","2017-04-12","Not Discerned","{""Arland"", ""UnitedStates"", ""male""}","2023-05-25T17:08:56","Dragon’s Dogma was far ahead of its time when it was released in 2012. This wildly ambitious RPG bucked trends with innovative companion AI, climbing combat, and a twisty multiversal story. It’s a baffling, messy, and visionary game. That’s exactly what makes it so memorable 11 years on. With a first look at gameplay for Dragon’s Dogma II, however, it seems like the sequel could finally deliver on the lofty vision of its predecessor.  Anyone that’s played the first game will notice immediately that Dragon’s Dogma II looks remarkably similar, but in this case, that’s completely not a bad thing. That’s the best case anyone could ask for with this sequel, simply because the first Dragon’s Dogma suffered heavily from hard development and budget cuts.  In 2013, photos of an internal presentation at Capcom surfaced, showing the original outline and plan for Dragon’s Dogma. There was a wealth of cut content, with nearly half of the content included absent from the game. This included a variety of cut areas and even playable races, like a humanoid Lion race that we now see included in Dragon’s Dogma II.  One of the wildest pieces of cut content was an endgame dungeon where, apparently, players would travel to the Moon and quite literally slay a god. That’s fantastic within the context of the first game’s story. After all, this is a game that starts out with a dragon stealing your heart, and it can end with you stabbing yourself with a holy blade to transform into a god.  Seeing pieces of cut content in the trailer for Dragon’s Dogma II seemingly suggests that the development team is hoping to bring back what it couldn’t do before. The sequel also clearly has a bigger budget, which can be afforded by Capcom having some of the best financial successes in its history recently.  On top of that, Dragon’s Dogma II can refine a lot of the systems that felt experimental in the first game, combining them all into a more cohesive whole. A big part of this is the Pawn system, AI companions that accompany you on your journey. These companions can gain all of the classes and skills that players can, and in the original, you could even recruit Pawns that other players had created.  Dragon’s Dogma II still seems to put a heavy emphasis on both the Pawn system and climbing on monsters. Capcom  While the system felt revolutionary at the time, and the companions really held their own in battle, AI systems have grown by leaps and bounds since then. A good example of this is your Palico and Palamute companions in recent Monster Hunter titles, which have become integral pieces of combat.  In many ways, the Dragon’s Dogma open world also felt like a precursor to both Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring. At the time most open-world games tended to follow an Elder Scrolls or Ubisoft-style checklist open world where you’d have countless quests and points of interest. Dragon’s Dogma, on the other hand, really encourages freedom and exploration. It does not hold your hand with objectives and instead lets you discover interesting things on your own. Discoveries in Dragon’s Dogma always feel meaningful, be it epic boss battles, key pieces of equipment, or tantalizing lore.  Again, the key problem with Dragon’s Dogma was that all of these ambitious pieces felt like they simply didn’t have enough time in the oven. That’s the key factor with Dragon’s Dogma II — and 10 years of innovation to draw from. If Capcom is willing to take the time and care it needs, Dragon’s Dogma II could end up being one of the best RPGs ever made.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2dhbWluZy9kcmFnb25zLWRvZ21hLTItdHJhaWxlci1wczUtcGxheXN0YXRpb24tc2hvd2Nhc2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2022-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T13:44:23","nemke  Technological advancements have made video games a more fruitful experience for numerous users across various demographics. Looking forward, developments like the Metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) could revolutionize the video game space and make it a more attractive investment. Furthermore, esports have risen in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic. This industry could in the long-term become as prevalent as physical sports, as esports allow aspiring players to feel the rush of intense competition without worrying about bodily injuries and other health concerns.  As a more niche subcomponent of the broader communication sector, the video game market might come with inherent concentration risk that could serve it quite poorly as macroeconomic conditions decline. In the same regard, video game-focused securities likely don't have the same cushioning as those which focus on communication as a whole. For these reasons, I rate the Global X Video Games & Esports ETF (NASDAQ:HERO) a Hold.  The communication sector is quite prevalent in the video game industry, but video games are a relatively less significant part of the communication sector. The video game industry took quite a hit in 2022 as the bear market took over, causing the number of closed deals as well as these deals' value to decline. Video game sales also declined from 2021 to 2022, and I believe consumer spending in this space is due for additional disruption before the end of this year. As recession fears continue to loom, 2023 is likely to be another uphill battle for many digital gaming franchises. Video game revenues are still projected to grow steadily in the long-term, and this form of recreation could develop an even bigger fanbase than it already has. However, the short to medium-term path is looking quite bumpy.  Strategy  HERO tracks the Solactive Video Games & Esports NR USD Index and utilizes a full replication technique. The designated index consists of companies that are poised to benefit from increased consumption in the realms of video games and esports. Such companies identify mainly as video game developers and publishers, as well as content distributors and streaming services. Qualifying companies must derive at least half of their revenues from video games and esports activities. The same companies' market capitalization must also exceed $200mm and their average daily turnover for the last 6 months be at least $2mm. This ETF is re-weighted semi-annually.  Holdings Analysis  This ETF dabbles mainly in communication with also a small amount of technology and consumer cyclical.  Seeking Alpha  Companies held within HERO are located primarily in the United States as well as East Asia. East Asian countries represented in this ETF include Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Such regions all have relatively lucrative video game industries, hence their prevalence in this ETF.  etf.com  In this fund of just over 50 holdings, the top 10 stocks account just over half of the entire portfolio. The leading four stocks in HERO account for roughly a quarter of this ETF.  Seeking Alpha  Concentration risk may therefore be an outstanding concern within this ETF, and investors may want to assess their confidence in letting just a few stocks do the majority of the moving.  Strengths  The esports industry is well-positioned for long-term growth and is becoming a more popular scene for competitors and audiences alike. As depicted in the chart below, revenues in this industry could top $2.2B as soon as 2027.  Statista  Growth in the esports industry could catalyze the popularity of and demand for certain video games, which could ultimately boost the price of HERO.  As opposed to an all-encompassing communications fund, this ETF may be a unique alternative for those particularly interested in the videogame space. HERO could therefore offer more narrow exposure compared to certain broadly-focused alternatives, while also providing the benefits of diversification not held in individual video game stocks. This could become a more salient aspect of this ETF as the number of video game enthusiasts is also on the rise.  Weaknesses  HERO has underperformed several of its alternatives with broader focuses. This ETF's narrow focus may appeal to those with more specific interests, but might also get in the way of profits. Depicted below is HERO's performance in 2023 compared to ETFs which cover the general realm of communication services.  Data by YCharts  Evidently, HERO's momentum is significantly lagging behind some of its peers. This ETF may have a fundamental problem with momentum compared to funds that strategically grasp the more profitable areas of communication. A notable example of this is the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (XLC). In the long-term, investors might want to consider how profitable video games are compared to communications in general, and whether HERO's niche weighs against the opportunity cost associated with choosing this ETF over one of its peers.  This ETF is also quite volatile, which may stem from its more narrow focus on video games rather than other areas of communication like the internet, broadcasting, and social media that might have more room for lucrative innovation. I have covered the internet as an industry in my piece on the Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF (PNQI).  Seeking Alpha  Opportunities  Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are increasing in popularity as they may offer a more realistic, immersive experience to gamers. Furthermore, VR and AR have drawn ample amounts of momentum from developments in the Metaverse. I believe Meta (META) has the potential to revolutionize gaming with this project. Therefore, growth in the Metaverse as well as VR and AR could catalyze the demand for video games and boost the price of HERO at the same time.  Content creation as an occupation is also rising in popularity, especially among those in younger generations.  GrandView Research  Video games are a primary source of content for such creators. As a result, growth in this industry could laterally prompt growth in the market for video games. This could provide HERO with some much sought-after momentum in the coming periods.  Threats  Video game consoles as well as the games themselves are becoming more expensive and for many, might be more of a luxury than a necessity. As a result, the demand for video games could suffer during an economic downturn. Furthermore, microtransactions are becoming an increasingly integral part of video games. This component has already supplied video game companies with a generous cash boost. However, as prices continue to rise, microtransactions could deter consumers and stifle demand and enthusiasm for video games.  Online multiplayer is a core component of many game franchises and is beloved by many, for it allows players to meet new people and compete against real people rather than computer processing units (CPU). However, this same aspect could be a breeding ground for privacy and security concerns. Especially with increasingly proficient and accessible AI systems, quickly accessing large amounts of user data for exploitative purposes could become much easier and a more prominent threat sooner rather than later.  Conclusion  Video games are likely to become a more popular and fulfilling form of entertainment down the road, but this industry isn't the most recession-proof. Small-cap, niche funds could take off in the long-term just like video games themselves, but in the meantime, I believe the current economic forecast warrants great caution. Amid tighter economic conditions, investors may be better off with more broadly-focused communication funds. Therefore, I rate HERO a Hold.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3NlZWtpbmdhbHBoYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS80NjA3Mjk3LWhlcm8tdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXMtbWF5LWJlLWEtYmV0dGVyLXNvdXJjZS1vZi1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LXRoYW4tcHJvZml0P3NvdXJjZT1mZWVkX3RhZ19ldGZfcG9ydGZvbGlvX3N0cmF0ZWd50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T12:21:24","A mere three months after it finally hit Steam and (probably more importantly, I admit) nine days after it hit consoles, Ubisoft's live-service Trackmania has hit the 5 million player milestone. Ubisoft celebrated hitting the number in a tweet posted to the company's account yesterday.  5 million vroom 🏎 pic.twitter.com/7s9XmsQTeHMay 24, 2023 See more  Ubisoft didn't say explicitly that it's managed to acquire those players thanks to Trackmania's new presence on consoles and Steam, but it's not exactly a dastardly riddle to figure out. The game originally released as a Ubisoft and Epic Games Store exclusive back in 2020, before sneaking onto Steam last February. Finally, it hit consoles on May 15 (it was meant to hit Stadia too, but, well, we all know how that turned out)  Trackmania is a rare and special thing: It has no licensed cars and relies heavily on user-generated maps—many of which are designed according to a philosophy best described as 'unhinged'—so it's always been a bit of an odd duck in the racing game world. I'm glad to see it do well, though: It's the only racing game series I've ever gotten really attached to.  I spent most of 2012 in Trackmania 2: Canyon. I've never been a racing game die-hard in any sense of the word, except for a brief dalliance with Konami Krazy Racers on my Game Boy Advance SP when I was a child for reasons I don't really remember, but something about Trackmania grabbed me. It was probably the fact it was more of a puzzle game than a racer: Your task was to find the right route through its physics-defying, user-made tracks that let you tackle the whole thing without ever braking or taking your foot off the gas.  This live-service iteration of Trackmania never quite got its hooks in me the same way. For one thing, I'm chronically averse to paying a subscription for anything, but this version of the game also seemed, if anything, a bit too polished for my liking.  To me, Trackmania is about piecing together perfect runs for its many unparseable maps while listening to the awful/beautiful dubstep remix of Robyn's Call Your Girlfriend that was the keystone of my preferred Canyon server's custom soundtrack. I'm sure the wacky stuff is out there but in the time I've spent with Trackmania 2020 most of the maps have seemed fairly sane, and I'm not sure I've found a server that uses any custom soundtrack at all, let alone the heady mix of atrocious dubstep that is, for me, the crux of the Trackmania experience.  Nevertheless, it's good to see the series doing well. Perhaps one of those millions of players will set up a server that meets my very specific needs someday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wY2dhbWVyLmNvbS90aGUtb25seS1yYWNpbmctZ2FtZS1zZXJpZXMtaXZlLWV2ZXItY2FyZWQtYWJvdXQtaGFzLWhpdC10aGUtNS1taWxsaW9uLXBsYXllci1taWxlc3RvbmUtbm93LWJyaW5nLW9uLXRoZS1kdWJzdGVwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Haffey/Getty Images)  The next time an NBA player falls to the floor in pain, they better not be faking. The NBA's competition committee is reportedly considering an in-game penalty for flopping, according to Shams Charania of The Athletic.  Players who engage in flopping would reportedly be charged with a technical foul, per the report.  Sources: The NBA’s Competition Committee is discussing potential of in-game penalty for flops that would result in technical foul free throw. Trial is possible at Summer League in July. — Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) May 25, 2023  The proposal is not official yet, and there's no timetable on when it would be enacted if approved, though it sounds like things could move quickly. The league could reportedly test out the policy during Summer League games, which start in July.  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  Flopping continues to be a major source of debate around the league. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr summed up the issue well, charitably calling the practice ""gamesmanship"" in one sentence, before calling another play a ""blatant flop"" moments later. Kerr made those comments following the Warriors' Game 4 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semifinals.  The Lakers, and LeBron James, weren't pleased with that, saying the team does not practice flopping. James has been called out for flopping in the past, though he's far from the only superstar player who engages in the practice.  The NBA competition committee cleaned up a similar issue in 2021, cracking down on non-basketball move fouls. That change was made to prevent players like James Harden from drawing fouls while intentionally drawing contact during shots.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uYmEtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tY29tbWl0dGVlLXJlcG9ydGVkbHktY29uc2lkZXJpbmctaW4tZ2FtZS1wZW5hbHRpZXMtZm9yLWZsb3BwaW5nLTE2NTcwODIyNi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

How it Happened  The Pilots got the scoring started early, putting two runs on the board in the bottom the first inning with the game still scoreless. Portland plated two runs when Klemp left the yard with Scavotto aboard.  The Broncos then rallied to score eight runs between the third and fifth innings to take an 8-2 lead before the Pilots got back on the board in the fifth. Portland scored once on an RBI single off the bat of Knight, which tightened the Broncos lead to 8-3. The Pilots were unable to get any closer, as Santa Clara added seven runs to their tally, including six in the ninth, on their way to a 15-3 final.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Zach Eflin joined an special group with his lastest win  Eflin became major leagues’ third seven-game winner and Tampa Bay beat struggling Alek Manoah and Toronto 6-3 as the Rays took three of four from the Blue Jays.  Eflin (7-1) allowed one run and six hits in seven innings as the major league-leading Rays (37-15) stole seven bases for the second time this season and improved to 24-5 at home. He joined teammate Shane McClanahan (8-0) and Minnesota’s Joe Ryan (7-1) as the big leagues’ winningest pitchers.  “Elite pitch execution,” Rays manager Kevin Cash said. “To get them to swing early in the count and not drive the ball, it’s speaks to Zach’s stuff.”  Eflin didn't have a strikeout.  “I knew it was going to be a grinder day,” Eflin said. “Just wanted to go out there and attack guys, and they were swinging early and they were hitting it right at guys there for a while.”  Manoah (1-5), a 16-game winner last year, extended his winless streak to nine starts after giving up five runs, three hits and five walks over three innings with six strikeouts. He threw just 44 of 87 pitches for strikes and his ERA climbed from 5.15 to 5.53, The Rays stole five bases while he was on the mound.  Toronto (26-25) is 8-15 in May. The Blue Jays are 6-15 in division play after going 43-33 last year. They trail the Rays by 10 1/2 and the teams do not meet again until six games during the final 10 days of the season.  The Toronto players called a team meeting postgame,  “We're punched right in the face the last 10 days or so,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. “You've got to understand that and you've got to make adjustments. In talking to the guys and hearing them, it's got to happen tomorrow.”  “Yes it's tough a division, yes that's a good (Rays) team, and we're still a good team, too,” Schneider added.  After the Blue Jays loaded the bases with one out in the ninth against Jake Diekman, Colin Poche entered and walked Bo Bichette on four pitches and gave up a sacrifice fly to pinch-hitter Ernie Clement. Poche got his first save this season when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. grounded into a game-ending forceout.  Wander Franco tripled and scored on Randy Arozarena’s single during Tampa Bay’s two-run first. Arozarena stole second and took third as Brandon Lowe struck out and reached firston a wild pitch. Harold Ramírez then hit a potential inning-ending double-play that second baseman Cavan Biggio bobbled and could only get a forceout at second as Arozarena to come home.  Josh Lowe made it 3-1 on a run-scoring double in the second. Manoah, who threw 62 pitches through two innings, avoided further damage by striking out Brandon Lowe to stranded the bases loaded.  Taylor Walls stole third as part of a double steal and scored on an errant throw by catcher Alejandro Kirk in a two-run third as the Rays went up 5-1.  Franco stole his 16th and 17th bases and scored to put the Rays ahead on Arozarena’s seventh-inning single off Adam Cimber.  “It's a dangerous lineup, not only hitting-wise but just running the bases, keeping on the base paths,” Eflin said. “It's what we do when we're during well. It's fun to watch.”  Toronto’s Brandon Belt had a first-inning RBI single.  KEEPSAKE  Rays 1B Luke Raley sent the ball he struck out Gurrerro in the eighth inning Tuesday to the Blue Jays clubhouse for the slugger to sign. Guerrero hit a grand slam off Raley in the ninth,  SHORT STAY  Tampa Bay optioned RHP Ben Heller to Triple-A Durham one day after he was called up. He warmed up in the bullpen Wednesday but hasn’t gotten into a big league game since Sept. 4, 2020.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Blue Jays: C Danny Jansen (left groin tightness) underwent an MRI.

"game","2023-09-06","Not Discerned","{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T00:32:59","In anticipation of tonight’s game, I got out my broom and cleaned my apartment, because the Mariners are looking to sweep the A’s for the second time this year after winning the last three games and outscoring Oakland 20-5. While I personally believe that Thursday night games are for sickos, dooming us all to be extra tired on Friday, I am looking forward to this one for one particular reason:  Tonight’s Lineups:  That’s right, our very own first baseman Tythew Francebelton is back in action after sitting out yesterday from being hit by a pitch on his hand. He took infield and batting practice before the game, and is seemingly feeling good. Here’s hoping for a couple of knocks to get him his mojo back.  Meanwhile, LoGi is on the bump, but unfortunately Cal is not his battery mate, and is instead DHing tonight, allowing the lefty-mashing Tom Murphy to get a start against JP Sears. I’m also excited to see José Caballero in the starting lineup, who’s really putting on a performance since being called up.  Notes from Pregame:  It’s Bark in the Park night! So prepare to see some Very Good Doggos on your screen.  Injury update: Ty France returns to the lineup and the field, as he’s feeling much better after getting hit in the hand by a fastball the other night. Ty says he’s thankful he got hit in the “meaty” part of the outside of his palm, as an inch or two lower would have hit the wrist; as it was, he thought his wrist “exploded” in the initial burst of pain before the adrenaline wore off and he realized nothing was broken. Scary times, but very thankful it wasn’t worse!  Eugenio Suárez also returns to the lineup after getting an early breather last night; he took a foul ball off the foot and was feeling a little discomfort. AJ Pollock is someone the team is “keeping an eye on” after he got a little banged up the other night, and won’t be in the lineup tonight, even with the lefty Sears on the mound, but Servais says he thinks Pollock will be “okay.”  Cal Raleigh is also okay despite tripping near the dugout last night chasing after a foul pop-up, which he described as “probably not my most athletic moment.”  Servais was pleased with the improved plate discipline he saw last night against a very wild Waldichuk, although noted it took the offense a few looks at him to start really grinding out at-bats, but says he’s overall pleased with the trajectory of the offense as far as putting up better plate appearances.  However, Servais does acknowledge that Sears shut this lineup down the last time they saw him, striking out seven in six innings with his riding fastball. He says he wants the hitters to work hitter’s counts and be aggressive to the fastball tonight, as that’s where they’re at their best.  Tayler Saucedo likes to give players nicknames, which are, as you might expect from a lefty reliever, super weird! He’s christened Trevor Gott “Blood Clot” (I guess because he stops excessive bleeding?). Servais: “He’s straight left-handed” (derogatory).  How to watch:  It’s always a special day when Angie Mentink is on the call, and she is tonight on ROOT Sports NW, joining Aaron Goldsmith. Meanwhile on 710 Seattle Sports, Dave Sims and Rick Rizzs will be covering the game for radio listeners.

For months, Shaquille O'Neal managed to successfully dodge process servers hired to present him with papers saying he was being named as a defendant in the lawsuit against FTX, a now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange that he previously endorsed.  The chase ended Tuesday when the 7-foot-1 O'Neal had nowhere to hide while surrounded by 20,000 people at Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics.  O'Neal was served while on site as an analyst for TNT, broadcasting from a booth situated in the stands at Kaseya Center in Miami, which was formerly named FTX Center.

""He was personally provided the papers, so he cannot raise his absurd delay tactics,” the plaintiff's attorney, Adam Moskowitz, told NBC's Pro Football Talk.  “We watched the prior Heat-Celtics game, so we knew he would be in the outside broadcasting booth where fans were right next door.”  Prior attempts to serve O'Neal at his homes in Texas, Georgia and Florida and at TNT's studio in Atlanta were unsuccessful, according to The Washington Post. Some process servers, the Post reported, even attempted to throw the papers at O'Neal's moving vehicle.  O'Neal is one of 11 celebrity defendants - which includes former NFL quarterback Tom Brady and comedian and actor Larry David - in the case against FTX. O'Neal also was served Tuesday for a separate NFT/crypto lawsuit alleging he sold unregistered tokens with the Astrals Project that he helped launch and promote.  “The allegations in the new crypto complaint are very serious and detail how him, his son and his business partner all founded this NFT Metaverse and he made promises every week that he would be extremely involved, so the value of the NFTs would grow greatly,” Moskowitz said. “Once the FTX fraud was revealed, he ran away and has not been heard since.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nwb3J0cy9zaGFxdWlsbGUtb25lYWwtc2VydmVkLXBhcGVycy1pbi1mdHgtbGF3c3VpdC1kdXJpbmctbmJhLXBsYXlvZmYtZ2FtZS8zMDQxNzczL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY21pYW1pLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Nwb3J0cy9zaGFxdWlsbGUtb25lYWwtc2VydmVkLXBhcGVycy1pbi1mdHgtbGF3c3VpdC1kdXJpbmctbmJhLXBsYXlvZmYtZ2FtZS8zMDQxNzczLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For the Orioles, it’s the end of a six-game AL East road trip where they have gone 3-0 at Toronto and 1-1 in New York.  The Orioles lost two of their first three series this year but they have gone 10-1-1 in series play since, losing only to Atlanta and splitting four with the Los Angeles Angels. They are 3-0-1 in their past four series and 3-2 in AL East series, winning their last three.  The Birds are 10-7 on the year in AL East games and are 8-3 in their past 11 division games.  They are 4-3 this season in rubber match games, which breaks down this way:  * Lost 9-5 at Boston  * Lost 5-3 versus the Yankees  * Won 8-4 at Chicago White Sox  * Won 6-2 versus Boston  * Won 13-10 at Kansas City  * Lost 3-2 at Atlanta  * Won 2-1 versus Tampa Bay  So they are 4-1 in their last five rubber match games and they are 2-2 in road rubber match games in 2023.  The Orioles (32-17) reach the 50-game mark of their season tonight. Last night’s 9-6 win, behind that eight-run seventh inning at Yankee Stadium, was their fourth in the last five games and they have also won six of eight, 10 of 14, 15 of 23 and 23 of their last 33 games.  The Baltimore offense has produced 14 runs on 17 hits this series, going 6-for-15 with runners in scoring position. They have scored five runs or more in each game of the 4-1 road trip, scoring 34 runs in Toronto and New York. And they have scored 54 runs in the last nine games.  AL team leaders, runs per game  6.33 – Texas  5.96 – Tampa Bay  5.24 – Boston  5.18 – Orioles  The Yankees rank seventh at 4.67 runs per game.  The Birds have mashed some homers lately, hitting two more last night. They have hit two or more seven times in the last nine games, hitting 17 total in that span. The Yankees have hit a bunch of homers in recent games as well and have hit 24 in their last 11 games and 38 in the last 17.  New York (30-21) had a five-game win streak snapped Wednesday and is three games behind the second-place Orioles. But the Yankees have still won seven of nine and 15 of their last 21 games. They are 10-9 in AL East games.  Coming off a big outing at Toronto, right-hander Kyle Gibson (5-3, 4.27 ERA) will try to pitch the O’s to a series win tonight. Friday at Rogers Centre, he allowed five hits and one run over seven innings on 95 pitches. The Orioles are 6-4 in his 10 starts in 2023.  He has allowed two earned runs or less five times, throwing six innings or more six times with five quality starts. Gibson is 1-6 with a 6.75 ERA in 10 career games against New York.  Yankees right-hander Clarke Schmidt (2-4, 6.00 ERA) will make his 11th start. On the year over 45 innings he has allowed 57 hits with a 1.622 WHIP, a 3.2 walk rate and a 10.8 K rate.

"game","2024-10-06","Not Discerned","{""Tuscaloosa"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T19:46:21","A smirk went across the face of Georgia president Jere Morehead this week as he overheard a question: Will the SEC schedule be finalized next week at the conference’s spring meetings? It was the knowing smirk of a man who has been dealing with the subject for much longer than he ever expected.  “I am ready for it to be done,” Morehead said. “We’ve talked about it and talked about it. I’m not sure it will get completed (next week). We’ll see. There’s just a lot of dynamics still playing around on that issue.”  Advertisement  Or perhaps just one dynamic, as Morehead bluntly acknowledged: Whether the SEC gets more money from ESPN.  “I may be saying more than Commissioner (Greg) Sankey would want me to say, but obviously if you go to a nine-game schedule, you have to be compensated for going to a nine-game schedule,” Morehead said. “There’s still some dynamics that have to play out with our media partners.”  Georgia is among the schools that in the past has favored going to nine games, and those schools were long believed to be in the majority. But during the past few months, support has wavered, and there is now a real chance that keeping an eight-game format will win out. That could make next week’s meetings dramatic, with a vote that could go either way.  Georgia remains solidly in the pro-nine-game camp. (Dale Zanine / USA Today)  Or the vote could be punted, yet again. But time is running out.  If the SEC does adopt a nine-game schedule, schools have to cancel at least one nonconference game in the 2024 season, and many have their schedules full for seasons beyond that. That, and just being tired of debating the subject, may spur a decision next week.  Oklahoma and Texas officials will be in Destin next week and will have a voice in the decision. But they will not have an official vote until July 1, 2024. So the decision could come down to a simple vote. The best way to look at it: There are more schools hard in favor of going to nine games than there are those hard in favor of staying at eight. But there are enough schools close enough to the fence that staying at eight games could win out, especially if ESPN doesn’t increase its financial commitment to the league.  Right now the SEC is operating under the pre-expansion agreement that was set to bring the conference about $811 million annually, and per the standard pro rata clause in most contracts, that would go up to around $926 million by adding two schools. The SEC has hoped that because those two schools are Texas and Oklahoma and that a nine-game schedule would mean more marquee games, ESPN would offer more money.  GO DEEPER Grudges, politics and gentlemen’s agreements: The chaotic history of SEC scheduling  The nine-game format would include three annual opponents for each school, then rotate everyone else. The eight-game format would include only one annual opponent while rotating everyone else. The result being that some secondary rivalries — Auburn-Georgia, Alabama–Tennessee, Texas-Texas A&M, for example — would not be played annually. The SEC probably has made the case to ESPN that having those games every year, rather than twice every four years, is worth more money, as is having a total of eight more conference games every year.  Advertisement  ESPN has made no financial commitments yet. (Side note: This would seem to confirm that ESPN was not behind Oklahoma and Texas joining the conference.)  But there still could be something new to sway the vote in Destin, if there is a vote. ESPN could let the SEC people know that, for instance, it would be amenable to paying a certain amount more if the league went to a nine-game schedule. Or it could just be pointed out that since ESPN and the SEC share SEC Network revenues, more SEC games — and more quality games — will result in more revenue anyway.  Failing that help from ESPN, however, more than a few SEC schools are unwilling to give up the attendance money they get from extra home games. And yes, bowl eligibility is a factor too. So in essence it becomes a divide between the schools already scheduling 10 or more power conference games per year, and those that haven’t been.  Here’s the best guess at where things stand now:  The nine-game camp  Texas A&M athletic director Ross Bjork has been perhaps the most outspoken advocate, and Aggies officials actually helped craft the original plan for a nine-game format.  Georgia, Florida, Alabama and LSU are also in the category of major programs that have already been punching up their schedule with Power 5 teams. However, Alabama coach Nick Saban has been wavering on the nine-game model, not liking the three permanent opponents his team would draw (LSU in addition to Auburn and Tennessee). So Alabama may not be a hard yes, and Morehead makes it sound as though Georgia’s vote is fungible too.  Texas and Oklahoma had already scheduled SEC schools (Georgia in both cases, Alabama and Tennessee in others) before deciding to join the SEC. So they could use their voice and unofficial vote in favor of nine games.  Missouri, while not an elite football power, has also expressed support for the nine-game format, according to an SEC source.  The eight-game camp  Kentucky athletic director Mitch Barnhart has been outspoken in favor of staying at eight, saying last summer that it worked for his school, pointing to the annual rivalry game with Louisville as a ninth power conference game.  Advertisement  Mississippi State and Ole Miss are also believed to prefer having only eight conference games plus one mandated nonconference game against a Power 5 team. Bowl eligibility plus more home gate receipts are driving factors.  Mystery (five)  Tennessee, which wasn’t afraid to schedule Oklahoma for a nonconference series, would seem more likely to favor nine. Auburn also sees itself in the elite category. But both schools, along with Arkansas, also like having more home games and the gate receipts that come with it. Vanderbilt, meanwhile, has also been quiet on its preference.  South Carolina is one of those in a supports-either-option camp. The Gamecocks do already have the annual rivalry with Clemson, so a nine-game schedule would give them at least 10 power-conference games per year. But athletic director Ray Tanner, speaking with The Athletic in March, said he would do what’s in the best interests of the SEC.  What happens if there is a vote, and it’s 7-7? It’s not clear if Sankey or the SEC office would simply break the tie. The only thing that’s clear is Sankey is seeking a consensus, or something close to it. He learned under predecessor Mike Slive, who liked to say of the conference’s private deliberations: “The First Amendment is alive and well in the SEC.” And Slive could smile and say that because he knew eventually the league would settle it and not announce the actual vote.  Could there be some give-and-take on permanent opponents, as in could it be a trading chip to get wavering teams to support a nine-game schedule? Nothing can be ruled out, but all along the permanent opponent and the format have been on a separate track. Each team’s three permanent opponents in a nine-game format have been known to each school — though not publicly confirmed — since last year’s meetings and have not changed.  Could the commissioner put his weight on the scale for one of the options?Perhaps, but Sankey is more likely to stand back and let his presidents take the lead. That’s why next week could look like this: Coaches talk about it publicly Tuesday and Wednesday, athletic directors lay the groundwork for a final decision, then presidents come in Thursday, hash things out, and vote Friday.  But not voting is also an option. Not a desirable option. But an option.

"game","2022-04-12","Not Discerned","{""FlorhamPark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T21:45:00","Jets cornerback Brandin Echols was suspended for one game Thursday, with the reason reportedly involving a violation of the league’s personal conduct policy.  It could be linked to a Florham Park crash near the Jets facility in April 2022, according to an NFL Network report.  Earlier this year, the 25-year-old cornerback entered a three-year pretrial intervention program following a charge for fourth-degree assault by auto, in addition to summonses for reckless driving, speeding, failure to wear a seat belt, an unsafe lane change and improper passing, according to a story from the Daily Record in March.  The April 22, 2022 crash left Stephen Gilberg “partially paralyzed” when Echols’ Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, allegedly traveling at 84 mph five seconds before the crash, collided with Gilberg’s BMW X5, according to the Daily Record.  The impact allegedly caused Gilberg’s car to land in a marsh off the roadway, and the collision occurred two miles from the Jets facility in Florham Park, per the outlet.  It left Gilberg, who was driving his vehicle, with broken ribs and “no feeling or movement in both hands and his right leg that required spinal surgery,” according to the Daily Record, and during a hearing 10 months later in Morris County, Gilberg said that the crash and injuries will “forever haunt me.”  Brandin Echols served as a backup last season. Getty Images  He was taken to Morristown Medical Center following the collision and had allegedly compiled medical bills that neared $1 million by March 2023, according to the outlet.  “While I’ve made certain strides physically, such as learning to walk again albeit not in the same way I used to, it’s the nerve damage and the pain you don’t see,” Gilberg said in the hearing, according to the Daily Record. “The physical things I will never be able to do and the psychological trauma I am living with every single day that will continue to impact the rest of my life.”  Echols entered the pretrial intervention program “voluntarily,” his attorney Mitch Schuster told the Daily Record in March, and the assault by auto charge — along with the handful of driving summons — will reportedly be dismissed once he completes the three-year requirements.  Brandin Echols is suspended for one game. Bill Kostroun for the NY Post  Per The Daily Record, Echols will “undergo various programs for rehabilitation and will be monitored by the courts” throughout the duration of his pretrial intervention program, in addition to reportedly having to pay Gilbert $1,200 per month in “restitution” until $54,460 is reached.  “Mr. Echols is not alleged to have been driving under the influence of any substances and there are no claims that Mr. Echols intended to hurt anyone,” Schuster told the Daily Record in a March statement. “Mr. Echols is deeply saddened that Mr. Gilberg suffered injuries as a result of the accident and wishes Mr. Gilberg a full and speedy recovery.”  The NFL announced Echols’ suspension earlier Thursday, but a reason wasn’t provided.  Echols, who played at Kentucky, was a sixth-round pick in the 2021 draft and played 77 percent of the Jets’ defensive snaps his rookie season. Last year, he became one of the team’s special teams pieces — logging 62 percent of those snaps — when the Jets started Sauce Gardner and D.J. Reed at the corners. Echols started 14 games in 2021, but that number dipped to zero during his second season following the secondary additions.  During his rookie season, Echols became known as the cornerback who asked Tom Brady to autograph the ball Echols intercepted following the Jets’ January game against the Bucs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI1L2pldHMtYnJhbmRpbi1lY2hvbHMtc3VzcGVuZGVkLW9uZS1nYW1lLWZvci1teXN0ZXJ5LXJlYXNvbi_SAVxodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yNS9qZXRzLWJyYW5kaW4tZWNob2xzLXN1c3BlbmRlZC1vbmUtZ2FtZS1mb3ItbXlzdGVyeS1yZWFzb24vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, the sidelines out of bounds call with 56.7 seconds remaining when the possession was originally awarded to LAL, then switched to DEN leading to Nikola Jokic's game-winning bucket, was deemed an incorrect call. The ball went off Murray's hand, according to the L2M. — Dave McMenamin (@mcten) May 25, 2023  The Lakers lost 113-111 on a basket by Nikola Jokic after the Nuggets were awarded possession with 56.7 seconds remaining following a loose-ball scramble that went out of bounds.  The game was tied 111-111, and Nuggets guard Jamal Murray had the ball with 1:07 remaining. On the play, Murray, being guarded by Anthony Davis, drove from the right side into the lane before falling down while dribbling with his left hand. In the attempt to gain possession among six players, the ball was ruled to have gone out of bounds off Lakers guard Austin Reaves.  The NBA Last Two Minute Report deemed that the call was incorrect and the Lakers should have been given possession.  “Possession is awarded to Denver,” the report read. “However, the ball touches Murray’s (DEN) left hand last before going out of bounds. Reaves does not make contact with it. Possession should have been awarded to Los Angeles.”  Instead, Jokic drove off the inbounds pass from the left side and scored with a layup for the two-point lead with 51.7 seconds left.  The Lakers had multiple chances to retie the game, starting with LeBron James missing a fallaway from the baseline with 26.0 seconds left. After the Lakers chose not to foul the Nuggets, Murray missed a shot in the lane, and James got the rebound with 4.0 seconds left.  Following a timeout, James did not score on the final possession being guarded by Murray and Aaron Gordon, who was credited with the blocked shot. That play also was part of the NBA Last Two Minute Report and was deemed correct.  “Murray (DEN) uses both hands to make clean contact with the ball after James’ (LAL) gather,” the report read. “Gordon is aligning to move alongside James’ (LAL) path and marginal body contact occurs prior to Gordon cleanly blocking the driving shot attempt,” the report said.  The Lakers’ season ended with the loss, and they head into the offseason with uncertainty about James’ future.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbGFrZXJzZGFpbHkuY29tL25iYS1hZG1pdHMtdG8tZXJyb3ItdGhhdC13b3VsZHZlLXRha2VuLWF3YXktbnVnZ2V0cy1nYW1lLXdpbm5lci1hZ2FpbnN0LWxha2Vycy1pbi1nYW1lLTQv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9sYWtlcnNkYWlseS5jb20vbmJhLWFkbWl0cy10by1lcnJvci10aGF0LXdvdWxkdmUtdGFrZW4tYXdheS1udWdnZXRzLWdhbWUtd2lubmVyLWFnYWluc3QtbGFrZXJzLWluLWdhbWUtNC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Savoie's arrival in the lineup comes as Rochester looks to take a commanding 2-0 series lead. He recorded 29 points in 19 playoff games with Winnipeg and expects an intensity similar to what he experienced in the WHL Playoffs.

To have two of them is going to be nice.""  Watch: Youtube Video  After a disappointing end to his WHL season, Savoie now has a clean slate. The Amerks are also treating Thursday night's Game 2 as a fresh start, despite their convincing win in the series opener. Momentum goes only as far as the next shift, and the Amerks are hoping for another strong start after scoring just 14 seconds into Game 1.  ""If the first shift of the game isn't a good shift then you lose that momentum,"" Appert said. ""If the first shift of the game is a strong identity-based shift then we can carry some momentum forward.""  The series will shift to Rochester with Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday.

"game","2008-09-02","Not Discerned","{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-25T15:01:23","What a thrill! Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is getting a full-fledged remake. Admittedly, this isn’t the first Metal Gear game I’d pick to get an overhaul, but it makes the most sense for a lot of reasons. For starters, it’s an awesome game. Duh.  Snake Eater isn’t even in my personal top three Metal Gear games (a controversial, borderline blasphemous stance) but I fully recognize it’s the best entry in the series. Despite being one of the more divisive outings, Snake Eater’s predecessor, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, was also one of the best-selling. Love it or hate it, Naked Raiden cartwheeled so Naked Snake could crawl. MGS2’s success was undoubtedly a bit of a monkey-paw wish, since it earned Kojima and company plenty of creative freedom, but apparently on the condition that it was used to make another Metal Gear.    Since MGS2, Hideo Kojima has repeatedly claimed that each new entry would be his last Metal Gear game – except, ironically, MGSV, which WAS his last. It seems like this urge to move on to new things is why Snake Eater, Guns of the Patriots, Peace Walker and The Phantom Pain are each such distinctive experiences. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” might be the mantra of many massively successful triple-A video game franchises, but it seems like Kojima’s anathema, which is by no means a bad thing. All forms of entertainment would be better if innovation and creativity were seen as worthwhile pursuits rather than financially risky endeavors. That said, video games are software, and development is an iterative process.  As Carl Sagan famously put it, “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe,” which is especially true of making video games. Not only do game developers regularly have to reinvent the wheel, they also have to reinvent (or at least replicate) the laws of physics that allow it to roll, turn, spin, and so on.  Metal Gear Solid 3 is one of the rare instances when Kojima’s team made a game that wasn’t breaking new ground in some capacity: MGS4 pushed the limits of the PlayStation 3’s cell architecture and Peace Walker did the same for the PSP, while also splitting the Metal Gear experience into portable bite-sized missions that could be played co-op. In order to make Metal Gear Solid V, Kojima and his team developed a brand new proprietary game engine, The Fox Engine, from the ground up. After parting ways with Konami, Kojima quickly got to work on Death Stranding, but that required founding an entire studio, hiring a team, and traveling the globe to find a game engine that was capable of rendering a photorealistic Norman Reedus taking a dump and chugging Monster Energy.  “ MGS3 felt familiar but also introduced new concepts like picking the right camouflage, tending to wounds, and the eponymous addition of a stamina gauge that would necessitate the eating of snakes  Metal Gear Solid 2 put the PlayStation 2 through its paces, and while Metal Gear Solid 3 by no means rested on its laurels or felt samey, it was very clearly built on the foundation of its predecessor. That said, it certainly zigged when everyone expected a zag: after MGS2 concluded its story with a rat’s nest of loose ends dangling off the edge of a cliff, the sequel was actually a prequel. MGS3 felt familiar enough to play but it also introduced completely bonkers new concepts like needing to pick the right camouflage for each environment, tending to wounds and illnesses, and of course, the eponymous additions of wildlife and a stamina gauge that would necessitate the eating of snakes. It’s very possible that the development team was able to focus on these novel new ideas because they weren’t preoccupied figuring out new hardware and/or completely reinventing basic mechanics.  So, yeah, that’s a roundabout way of saying it’s a great idea to remake Snake Eater because it’s a great game. Not exactly rocket science. Making sense of the many twists and turns of the Metal Gear series’ convoluted narrative? That’s another story. The other big thing Snake Eater has going for it is that it’s a prequel - it’s chronologically the earliest game on the Metal Gear timeline, and can therefore be played as with no prior knowledge of the lore.  The numbering of the Metal Gear series is almost comically obtuse: Metal Gear Solid is technically the first entry in the “Solid” series, and was many players’ introduction to the universe, but it’s the third Metal Gear game. Despite Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake never getting a western release, Metal Gear Solid has numerous references to it. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was a straight sequel, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, contrary to its number, was simultaneously the fifth game but also a prequel. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is the direct sequel to MGS2, and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is a non-numbered sequel to 3, but also sets up Metal Gear Solid V, which is actually in two parts, Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. If you’re a Metal Gear fan, you already knew all this, and if you’re not, you stopped reading three paragraphs ago.  Which Metal Gear Solid game would you like to be remade after Snake Eater? Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker Metal Gear Rising Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Answer See Results  Snake Eater has plenty of winks and nods to returning players, but it doesn’t require any requisite knowledge for the story to make sense (well, a crash course in Cold War-era global politics doesn’t hurt). If more remakes are on the table, Snake Eater is an excellent means of onboarding first-time players, and even if there are no more remakes planned, going from Snake Eater to The Phantom Pain isn’t too jarring. Aside from Snake suddenly sounding like Keifer Sutherland. Who knows? Maybe the Snake Eater re-snake will pave the way for a full-on modern reimagining of the very first Metal Gear – though it’s hard to imagine that without Kojima’s involvement, which seems very unlikely.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlnbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvd2h5LW1ldGFsLWdlYXItc29saWQtMy1pcy10aGUtcmlnaHQtZ2FtZS10by1yZW1ha2UtZmlyc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2018-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T10:00:00","Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was certain to poke its head above the parapet during the latest PlayStation Showcase, and when it did, it didn't disappoint. In over 12 minutes of mixed gameplay and cinematic footage, we saw two of the supervillains Peter Parker and Miles Morales will lock horns with in their latest combined adventure – Kraven the Hunter and The Lizard – and we got a glimpse of some of the new moves they'll bust out to break skulls, sail through the skies, and skirt across bodies of gorgeously-rendered water while dodging bullets, missiles, and various other deadly projectiles.  I've played through the first of Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man games on PS4 twice since its 2018 launch, and both times I've been totally bowled over by one particular section: its Rykers Island prison break level. Towards the end of 2021, in fact, I wrote about how Rykers Island was my absolute favorite part of Spider-Man, and asked: can Spider-Man 2 match its spectacle? Not that the original game is boring before this point, but it's at this juncture that the game blows wide open, giving us a series of blockbuster set-pieces and narrative forks that, for my money, rival anything we've seen from Spidey's larger-than-life Hollywood adaptations and its comic book source material previously.  After less than 10 seconds of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in motion, however, and I'm already certain Insomniac has succeeded in going bigger and bolder than ever before.  Countdown  (Image credit: SIE)  Going into the PlayStation Showcase, we already knew that Kraven The Hunter will be Sony's first R-rated Marvel movie when it lands later this year, which, combined with what we also know about the character's comic book origins, paints a pretty vivid picture. This guy's a bastard, basically. He's dark, meticulous and moody, even by Marvel bad guy standards, and that's how Insomniac and PlayStation chose to kick off their Marvel's Spider-Man 2 gameplay footage.  And then, bang. We were thrown forward six months, out of the jungle and into the sun-kissed city, snaking through the peaks of the New York City skyline from the viewpoint of a military-grade drone. There was mention of Queens, an area well out of bounds in OG PS4 Spider-Man, and then we were down among the football fields and the leafy streets of a suburban neighborhood. ""The beast could be anywhere,"" said a soldier-type carrying an assault rifle as he and his cronies piled out of an armored truck. Peter Parker, dressed as Spider-Man but augmented with the black symbiote suit, burst from a cellar entrance, landed in the backyard, and then started raining pain on his uninvited guests.  This involved the main man using the Spider-Man Symbiote suit's myriad abilities to great effect – from hurling himself in the air with Doc Oc-esque tentacle propulsion, to using the same bio-engineered appendages to slam enemies into the ground, grab multiple foes at once, and generally offer mammoth power boosts as he picked off his prey one-by-one. From when Parker first smashed through the basement door, to his seamless transition into combat and unleashing the symbiote suit, I counted eight, maybe nine, seconds. Three years of doubt and uncertainty since Miles' DLC was washed away in less than 10 seconds.  (Image credit: SIE)  One of the things I adored most about the Rykers Island level in the first Marvel's Spider-Man was the simple fact it took us to an area otherwise inaccessible to the player beforehand. This game's open-world is stunning and sprawling, but because of this, the urge to see more is hard to shake. Rykers offered a glimpse of the world beyond the sandbox boundaries, and the carnage driven by a literal prison break was as chaotic as you'd expect.  The above standoff in some poor sod's backyard was hardly the same in spectacle terms, but it did share similar tenets. In a breakneck blur, we were shown what the new symbiote suit is capable of in the heat of action; we got a glimpse at how fluid combat is, this time built natively for the PS5's technical capabilities; and, of course, we learned that Peter and Miles are no longer confined to the busy borough of Manhattan. And while I get that all of this is engineered to excite would-be players like myself, it definitely worked.  Marvel's Spider-Man 2 topped our PlayStation Showcase predictions list ahead of the show. With a tentative, but reiterated, launch date of ""Fall 2023"", it was a dead-cert to show itself over the course, but, given how little we've seen of it since its official reveal almost two years ago, it needed to impress. It did exactly that, and it did so very quickly. And now the march towards the end of the year feels longer than ever before.  Here's everything announced at the PlayStation Showcase 2023","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcmFkYXIuY29tL2ktdGhvdWdodC1zcGlkZXItbWFuLTItY291bGRudC1tYXRjaC10aGUtZmlyc3QtZ2FtZS1pdC10b29rLWxlc3MtdGhhbi0xMC1zZWNvbmRzLXRvLWNoYW5nZS1teS1taW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","1971-07-17","Not Discerned","{""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T19:38:41","The Milwaukee Brewers played a crisp 2-hour, 9-minute game Wednesday in a 4-0 win over the Houston Astros, marking the shortest game at American Family Field/Miller Park since Sept. 6, 2008, when the Brewers beat the Padres, 1-0, and Ben Sheets outdueled Jake Peavy in a battle of aces.  In the age of the pitch clock, games in Major League Baseball are down to an average of 2 hours, 39 minutes, a drop of 27 minutes from last season and the lowest average since 1984.  A Brewers game in Boston on July 17, 1971, lasted only 1 hour, 36 minutes, though that one doesn't count — the 5-3 loss was called after six innings because of rain. So among nine-inning games, what are the shortest in Brewers history? Here's a sampling, though we'll stick to just home games:  More:The baseball commissioner has a message for Wisconsin. Fix American Family Field — or else  More:American Family Field will get a new scoreboard next season. It will cost $6.45 million.  Shortest home games in Brewers history  April 20, 1973: Brewers 2, New York Yankees 0 (1 hour, 42 minutes)  The intimate gathering of 8,348 fans barely had time to sit down for the fastest nine-inning game (home or road) in club history. The Brewers had only two hits but made them count — a single by Darrell Porter and two-run homer by Dave May three batters later. The Brewers only walked once, but Jim Slaton was just as effective in throwing a complete-game shutout for the Crew, allowing five hits and one walk.  May 6, 1979: Brewers 4, Toronto 0 (1 hour, 44 minutes)  This was a much bigger crowd (53,962), and the Brewers actually amassed 10 hits. Robin Yount homered, Sixto Lezcano had two run-scoring hits and Lary Sorensen allowed just four hits and a walk in nine innings.  Aug. 1, 1971: Brewers 3, Washington 2 (1 hour, 49 minutes)  Skip Lockwood allowed a couple runs on five hits and two walks but went the distance, and Bobby Mitchell's two-run home run in the sixth proved to be the difference in the second game of a doubleheader sweep. In the first game, Mitchell hit a three-run homer in the third that helped the Brewers prevail, 4-3.  Aug. 4, 1976: Brewers 4, New York Yankees 3 (1 hour, 50 minutes)  Doubleheader games just moved faster. Milwaukee scored all its runs in the third, and New York scored all of its runs in the third on Thurman Munson's three-run blast. But Bill Travers only allowed five hits total in a complete-game win, outdueling Catfish Hunter. The Yankees got even in the nightcap, 7-2.  Sept. 17, 1974: Brewers 3, Cleveland 2 (1 hour, 53 minutes)  Jim Colborn worked into the ninth and Tom Murphy locked down his 20th save of the year after the tying run reached base. Bob Hansen's single in the seventh broke a 2-2 tie.  June 17, 1985: Brewers 2, Blue Jays 1 (1 hour, 54 minutes)  Moose Haas allowed only one unearned run on three hits with no walks and outdueled Dave Stieb, who permitted a rare Jim Gantner home run in the sixth to account for the winning run. Gantner hit only five homers that season.  OK, so we've established that games moved faster in the 1970s and 1980s. What about from the '90s to now?  More:Increased pace of play having marginal impact on Brewers concession sales only down 5%  More:Milwaukee Brewers revert to seventh inning for final beer sales  Fastest home games in the 1990s  Oct. 1, 1995: Brewers 8, Boston 1 (1 hour, 57 minutes)  Dave Nilsson's two-run homer in the first set the tone against knuckleballer Tim Wakefield, and Nilsson later added a double. When John Jaha hit a three-run homer in the eighth, it was an 8-0 blowout, and Scott Karl finished the complete-game after allowing a leadoff homer in the ninth.  July 29, 1997: Brewers 2, Blue Jays 0 (2 hours, 1 minute)  It's not the one you're thinking. In the first game of a doubleheader, Jose Mercedes allowed three hits in seven innings, and Gerald Williams provided all the offense with a two-run homer in the fifth. This came one day after Steve Woodard's unforgettable debut in a 1-0 win over Toronto in the first game of another doubleheader, though that game went 2 hours and 17 minutes.  Fastest games of the 2000s  Sept. 6, 2006: Dodgers 2, Brewers 1 (2 hours, 4 minutes)  Chris Capuano worked eight strong innings but Derek Lowe one-upped him. Matt Kemp's RBI single in the seventh broke a 1-1 tie, and Kemp also tripled leading off the fifth and later scored an earlier run to tie.  May 7, 2007: Brewers 3, Washington 0 (2 hours, 5 minutes)  Geoff Jenkins hit a three-run homer in the second, and that was all the scoring for the day. Chris Capuano allowed seven hits but no walks in eight innings, and Francisco Cordero locked down the save.  Fastest games of the 2010s and beyond (aside from Wednesday)  May 17, 2016: Brewers 4, Cubs 2 (2 hours, 10 minutes)  Chase Anderson took a no-hitter into the eighth, when Ben Zobrist led off the frame with a double. Anderson was forced to leave one out shy of a complete game after allowing back-to-back homers to Jason Heyward and Kris Bryant, but Jeremy Jeffress locked it down by striking out Anthony Rizzo. Jonathan Lucroy homered for the Brewers, and Chris Carter had a two-run double.  July 26, 2010: Brewers 3, Reds 2 (2 hours, 10 minutes)  Randy Wolf worked seven innings and Rickie Weeks hit a two-run homer in the third to tie the game. Jim Edmonds gave the Brewers the lead in thrilling fashion with a two-out homer against starter Bronson Arroyo in the eighth.

"game","2020-02-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T13:06:05","Sign up for the GI Daily here to get the biggest news straight to your inbox  Today marks the awaited release of indie title Protodroid Delta, a 3D action-platformer from solo dev Adam Kareem.  Game development is never an easy endeavour to start with, but Kareem went through it on Hard Mode, as a hobbyist developer who had to balance his dream project with a full-time job and raising kids.  ""I’m a bit of a poser, you could say, because I don’t have any background in games formally,"" Kareem smiles. ""I was studying mechanical engineering in school, and I work full-time in tech, doing hardware engineering type stuff, but I picked up games as a hobby, just because I saw games like Sonic Adventure, Mega Man X, things that I loved as a kid.  ""I always felt like there would be some cool ways to improve on them. And so, I decided as a hobby to tinker with, 'Hey, maybe I can make a Sonic that controls really well in 3D', because I felt like Sonic Adventure wasn’t really doing all that.""  Kareem also says that he ""always hoped that Mega Man would make the jump to 3D,"" which is what led him to develop fan games for a couple of years from early 2018, during his winter break.  Protodroid Delta's developer Adam Kareem  ""A friend of mine told me about game engines, what Unreal was, and that’s when I started taking online classes, and just diving headfirst into YouTube. Let me tell you, not just because I work at Google, YouTube is great,"" he laughs, referring to his day job as a product design engineer at the tech giant.  ""It’s just as easy as that, I took advantage of that. Really great YouTube channels like Matthew Wadstein’s channel, and Virtus Learning Hub, and Ryan Laley… Just folks who, out of the goodness of their hearts, are like, 'I’m going to teach some games dev stuff'. You dig with that long enough, while also making games so you can learn while doing, and then eventually I built up this competency in games.  ""But I felt like what I brought to the table was always just a design[-centric] thinking about, fundamentally, why doesn’t this work as a mechanic? Why is this aesthetic of a character appealing or not appealing? That’s my identity.""  Kareem gave a GDC talk earlier this year about his background and inspirations, entitled ""Finding Inspiration and Planning Luck: A Story of a Solo Dev-Dad of Color.""  He still works full time and is ""still a hobbyist, technically,"" he smiles. We talk about that balance, reminiscing over a quote from Strange Scaffold's Xalavier Nelson Jr. about ""operating from a place of stability"" when a dev and destigmatising the idea of maintaining a day job.  ""That’s a really insightful perspective too, because I felt so liberated in terms of the creative choices I could make, in terms of the timeline the game was going to be, because I wasn’t depending on it for my wellbeing, for my livelihood,"" Kareem says.  ""Since I had a job which was compensating and taking care of myself and my family, it gave me a comfort of, I can just tinker with this mechanic for a week, two weeks, whatever, and I’m not pressing up against schedules, deadlines. It’s not going to be like, 'Sorry folks, I can’t pay you for the next month', and have that kind of consideration. I think normalising that would be really great. I would caution though, that if you are doing that, make smaller games. I wish I had known how big this thing would get when I got into it. But it’s definitely very tough, doing both.""  Kareem started working in earnest on what would become Protodroid Delta in late 2019 after releasing a handful of fan games based on Sonic and Mega Man, some of which were received really well. But he had reached a barrier – as good as the titles were, he couldn't go anywhere with them because he obviously didn't own the IPs.  ""I was like, ‘Well, I’m spending hours, really just pouring so much of myself into this, that I should at least remove the barrier of wanting to go commercial with it, and just really, truly make it my own'. And so, that’s where Protodroid came from. It was like, 'Okay, what are some ways that I can be inspired by the Mega Man thing?'  ""It all sprung from that fan game. And I got confidence that that was the route to [take], because I put it up on Itch.io, I put it up on Game Jolt, and it got a few thousand plays, and people just kept commenting, ‘This is fun! Oh, this is what [Mega Man] X7 should have been'. I got these proof points. I was like, 'Okay, all the fan games you make, take this one, and now create a world of your own that you can then do whatever you want with'.""  The project got picked up by Humble Games as part of its first Black Game Developer Fund in 2020. In fact, it will be the first title from the fund to be published under the Humble Games banner.  ""I felt so liberated in terms of the creative choices I could make, because I wasn’t depending on it for my livelihood""  But before that, Kareem ran a Kickstarter campaign that raised almost triple the amount he was initially hoping for (over 1,600 backers pledged almost $60,000 with an initial goal of $20,000). When asked about the challenges he met with crowdfunding, he laughs: ""How much time do you have?""  ""Kickstarters are super hard,"" he continues. ""Why are they hard? Because it’s very helpful if you can hire a marketing team or a studio to run that. What people don’t know about Kickstarters is that the ones that are successful run ads. Now, A/B testing, trying to find the best ads to run, [and] managing all that is a full-time job in and of itself, on top of the three or four months I took to build up the Kickstarter page.  ""So, I would say the biggest challenge with Kickstarter is just how to run your ads successfully, or basically how to successfully get the word out on a continuous basis, because that’s what funnels in the funding for it.""  But the successful Kickstarter is also what helped attract Humble's attention.  ""The Black Game Developer Fund was amazing, because it’s something they created in response to the Black Lives Matter uprising and social movement, and they put their money where their mouth was,"" Kareem says. ""They were really like, 'We want to make an effective change', and what better way to do that than to highlight people who are already in this space and creating?""  The financial help came with ""no strings attached,"" Kareem adds.  ""It wasn’t like, 'And once you’re done, we have the IP' or 'once you’re done, we have first rights at publishing'. It was just like, 'You do whatever you want with it. We just hope to see some sort of vertical slice, just some sort of progress'. Just 'Go, be happy. Do your thing.’  ""It all sprung from that fan game. And I got confidence that that was the route to [take]""  ""The side benefit from that was they connected me with an industry veteran in Justin Woodward, and he’s amazing. And he has been, in so many ways, a champion and advocate for my project, and connected me with the right people throughout the journey. And that was the Trojan horse of gifts. I was just expecting the money, but then he was a big part of all the things that sprung out from that.""  Woodward is one of the two strategic advisors of the Black Game Developers Fund, appointed by Humble in October 2020, alongside Sithe Ncube. We talked to them last year about the venture's steps to independence.  In a funny turn of events, Humble did end up signing a publishing deal for Protodroid Delta, even though Kareem initially wanted to go it alone, wishing to retain full control over his dream project.  ""I initially wanted to go with self-publishing because, given my work commitments, I always cherished the total freedom I had, that I can launch this game whenever I want to. I can add or remove features whenever I want to. And I really cherish that total autonomy. This was just going to ship to PC, and I didn’t have to ship to other consoles and stuff. But Humble was just such an amazing partner. I was worried about the strings that come attached. But they were just very transparent, and then offered publishing support.""  That helped Kareem to continue developing the game he really wanted to make, this 3D platformer with a distinct personality, with character design being a particularly important aspect for him.  ""[The characters] do look deliberately different from the rest of the gaming industry for the most part,"" he says. ""And that’s really important to me. You look at so many games [and] the characters are all pretty much homogenous. They’re either represented as white or fairer skinned.  ""You look at Smash Bros, for example, the base roster is 64 selectable characters, how many have darker skin? You’ve lost 40 right there, because none of them do. How many are not animals? You lost 22 more. And the only thing you’re left with is Ganondorf and Mr Game and Watch. So, you get little kids like me, who are like, 'Which character looks like me? The one who is evil incarnate or Mr Game and Watch'.  ""I wanted to be very deliberate with my character design to create characters for folks who seldom see themselves in gaming""  ""So I wanted to be very deliberate with my character design to create characters for folks who seldom see themselves in gaming, and to sample from different cultures. One of the neighbourhoods I used to grow up in was mixed Black and Latino, and those are two communities that often aren’t featured primarily within games. I wanted to create a space and a game where that is the case, so it becomes less 'un-normal' the next time it happens.""  A fairer portrayal of women was also an important aspect for Kareem, who notes that they're seldom the lead character in games, often relegated to being a support character, a love interest, or a plot device.  ""I wanted to invert that, and instead make a game which is predominantly female, [where] the central narrative conflict is amongst two women, and the heroes are women. And I think people resonated with that, to see a game which is being deliberate about that. It’s an important thumbprint about the game.""  We chat about the lack of representation across games, with Kareem pointing to major franchises such as Final Fantasy, which has a predominantly white cast.  ""Once you peel it back a bit, you realise that we’re making deliberate choices to exclude certain groups and cultural expressions""  ""They’re making deliberate choices about which cultures people are deeming desirable or interesting, and it’s a very narrowly defined space about what a fantasy setting can look like, and what these things can look like,"" Kareem notes. ""It’s an interesting question, but once you peel it back a bit, you realise that we’re making deliberate choices to exclude certain groups and certain communities and cultural expressions, and making deliberate choices to highlight other ones.""  Looking ahead, Kareem acknowledges that his position, working full time and developing a big game on his own in parallel, might not be sustainable in the long run.  ""Something has to give. So, I’m interested to see what sort of smaller hobbyist things I might be able to get into. Or depending on how this game does, maybe that changes my fortunes, and I’m like, 'I’m rich, I can do whatever I want!' That’s the dream,"" he laughs.  ""But realistically, that’s highly unlikely. So, I do know that doing this for three years, it comes at a cost, I spent less time with my kids, I spent less time with my wife. And mentally, I haven’t slept in three years.

"game","2023-06-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T20:22:54","Lightspeed Studios, best known for co-developing PUBG Mobile, and Will Smith, best known for slapping comedian Chris Rock on live television, have teamed up for a free-to-play open world survival shooter called Undawn.  Jokes aside, Will Smith is one of the biggest movie stars in the world, an Academy Award winner (and 4-time nominee) whose films have earned nearly $9 billion worldwide. Except for a Fortnite skin, this appears to be Smith's first real videogame role, and if I were to picture him as the face of a game I guess it would be something a little more grand—like Keanu Reeves in Cyberpunk 2077, or Liam Neeson in Fallout 3, or one of the many Hollywood actors who have performed in the Call of Duty series.  Instead, Will Smith is now the face of a free-to-play mobile shooter that's also coming to Steam. So, yeah, I'm as confused as you are. Go ahead and watch the star of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air wordlessly deliver a smackdown on some monsters making trouble in his neighborhood in the trailer above.  We first heard about Undawn in 2019 (it was originally called Dawn Awakening) but it's finally on the brink of release: the free-to-play multiplayer survival game launches on June 15 for mobile devices and on PC. If you need a refresher on what it is, exactly, read on:  ""In the post-apocalyptic world of Undawn, survivors have split into different factions each with their own rules of survival,"" reads a press release sent to PC Gamer (which, no joke, contained the words ""Get Jiggy"" in the subject line). ""During their daring adventure, players will encounter legendary survivor Trey Jones played by global movie star Will Smith. Trey will act as a guide to help other survivors navigate the world four years after a global disaster.""  It's a little hard to say what's in the actual game—the official site immediately gets busy tantalizing you with a list of rewards you get for pre-registering, like consumables and several different types of in-game currency. The Steam page is a little more to the point, showing off shooting, monsters, resource gathering, base building, and vehicles. It also shows a very cluttered mobile game HUD, so I'm not super optimistic it'll be enjoyable on PC.  As for Will Smith, he does fit into the world of Undawn pretty well, though mostly because he looks quite a lot like his character Robert Neville from 2007 zombie apocalypse film I Am Legend. I'm a little suspicious that Smith's character doesn't talk in the trailer, or even make noises like ""ugh"" or ""uff"" while running, sliding, and bashing monsters. Did he just lend his looks, and not his voice, to the game? I guess we'll find out on June 15.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3dpbGwtc21pdGgtZmluYWxseS1waWNrZWQtYS1nYW1lLXRvLXN0YXItaW4tYW5kLWl0cy1hLWZyZWUtdG8tcGxheS1zdXJ2aXZhbC1zaG9vdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Prior to Waggoner’s big fly, the Lions had tallied just one hit against New Home starter Ashton Lucio, taking a 1-0 deficit into the bottom of the fourth.

The demand for mobile games has greatly risen as a result of these causes. The demand for mobile games has greatly risen as a result of these causes. The in-game advertising market is anticipated to grow over the course of the forecast period due to a number of other factors, including an increase in gamers and a rise in partnerships between marketers and video game developers.  The in-game advertising business is expected to be driven by a number of factors, including decreased advertising costs, improved reach and ROI, quick integration, and straightforward setting of advertisements in social gaming. Additionally, the use of reliable gaming payment methods lowers fraud, which might help drive the market throughout the projection period. Market expansion is anticipated to be fueled by the expanding selection of free smartphone games that make money through in-game advertisements.  It is anticipated that a shorter product life cycle and the rising time and expense of game development would hinder market expansion. The expansion of the in-game advertising sector is anticipated to be hampered by gaming firms' growing reluctance as a result of diminishing advertising income.  You may reach your target audience with in-game advertising in a non-intrusive, highly observable setting. The probability that your brand will be remembered and recognized rises since you can engage with a captive audience that isn't likely to multitask.  Because it advances the achievement of a variety of corporate objectives and aims, increasing brand recognition is an important advantage of in-game advertisements. Brand recognition may broaden your target market, boost website traffic, foster greater brand attachment, and move customers farther down the sales funnel.

"game","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T21:16:01","There’s a bridge to cross the lava pit in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s Marakuguc Shrine, but it’s broken. More than half of the bridge is piled on top of itself on one side of the pit, with one clipped-off segment on the other. The bridge is the obvious choice for crossing the lava, but how to fix it?  A clip showing one potential solution went viral on Twitter shortly after Tears of the Kingdom’s release: The player uses Link’s Ultrahand ability to unfurl the stacked bridge by attaching it to a wheeled platform in the lava. When the wheeled platform — now attached to the edge of the bridge — activates and moves forward, it pulls the bridge taut, splashing lava as it goes, until the suspension bridge is actually suspended and can be crossed. But it wasn’t the solution itself that resonated with players; instead, the clip had game developers’ jaws on the ground, in awe of how Nintendo’s team wrangled the game’s physics system to do that.  To players, it’s simply a bridge, but to game developers, it’s a miracle.  The game programming flex of all time. pic.twitter.com/id2K5uE5mz — William Armstrong (@WillWArmstrong) May 21, 2023  “The most complicated part of game development is when different systems and features start touching each other,” said Shayna Moon, a technical producer who’s worked on games like the 2018 God of War reboot and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök, to Polygon. “It’s really impressive. The amount of dynamic objects is why there are so many different kinds of solutions to this puzzle in particular. There are so many ways this could break.”  Moon pointed toward the individual segments of the bridge that operate independently. Then there’s the lava, the cart, and the fact you can use Link’s Ultrahand ability to tie any of these things together — even the bridge back onto itself.  Nintendo reportedly used a full year of Tears of the Kingdom’s development for polish, and it shows. “The amount of different options available is a testament to the amount of work that every single person at every level of the team did, especially the QA testers,” Moon said. “Open-world games with a ton of real-time physics objects like this are notoriously difficult to QA test.”  Another big game that inspired this sort of physics-based shock and awe from game developers on social media was in 2020, when The Last of Us Part 2 included a rope necessary for solving a puzzle. Like Tears of the Kingdom’s bridge, the rope and its natural-seeming movements were just something players expected to work, but game developers could see how much work went into the development of it.  “Last time I saw something this impressive physics/gameplay wise was the rope in The Last of Us Part 2”  The bridge has a ton of different points that are pulling on each other within the physics system, said Luna Nielsen, a software engineer who goes by Luna the Foxgirl online and livestreams about the complexities of game engines. “It gets into some pretty mathy stuff. It can get really funky when something pulls a bit too much, and suddenly the bridge is inside of itself. So it has to push it out. And then one thing has moved too far back. It starts getting really bad, because [the pieces of the bridge] basically are distinct from each other’s movements.”  Software engineer Cole Wardell put it another way: “Imagine the lava bridge above, when you grab the end of it, you pull part of it to one side,” he said. “Well, now that drags the other attached piece a little bit with it, and that piece moving makes the next piece move, and so on and so forth. And if any one element of the track collides with something, it has to be nudged or slid back into somewhere that doesn’t collide, which moves the pieces next to it which moves the pieces next to it.”  “Last time I saw something this impressive physics/gameplay wise was the rope in The Last of Us Part 2. And the rope only appeared in [a] few very controlled scenarios,” said Rocksteady Games senior gameplay and combat programmer Aadit Doshi on Twitter. “To be able to confidently present the player with a stack of blocks that are linked with chains that move in accurate ways, without clipping, without objects shaking like crazy as it tries to figure out what it needs to do is awe-inspiring.”  Tears of the Kingdom also has its own rope-like physics flex: Another viral clip showed a door opening using four wheels and a chain. That’s a complex interaction that takes no shortcuts, Wardell told Polygon. “As a rule, physics engines take a lot of shortcuts and make a lot of assumptions, both for optimization purposes and to keep developers from pulling their own hair out,” Wardell said. “Almost all of these shortcuts, whether it be collision-free ropes [or] rotating objects only applying forces in specific ways, would make this kind of mechanism flat-out not work, or the chain start vibrating until it disappears from view in a single frame, or some other infamous physics glitch.”  He said that rope bugs “vibrating out of control” are so common because of these problems. “If you don’t do everything just right, one movement will cause the other parts of the rope to move, and their movement will cause more collisions — God forbid you want the rope to collide with itself. Those collisions will cause more nudges, which is more movement, which ends up with your robe vibrating out of the map.”  Doshi explained that complex physics are common in games, but said that Tears of the Kingdom pushes the limits of its engine to create exceptional gameplay and puzzles. “Realistic physics simulations take hours to do calculations to make sure it is highly precise and accurate,” he said. “Game physics needs to produce similar results every 16-32 milliseconds (60-30 frames per second).”  Some games are able to avoid these complexities by designing around them, Doshi said. That means restricting player action, which is the antithesis of Tears of the Kingdom’s design. There are constraints, but somehow, in this game, it still feels like nothing is off-limits.  “In game development, it’s not if physics will break down but when,” Gravity Well senior engineer and former Call of Duty developer Josh Caratelli told Polygon. That’s why there’s a whole Reddit page about physics goofs — player characters ragdolling into oblivion or enemies bouncing off the walls. It’s not that games with physics bugs or glitches are poorly made; it’s just really easy for things to go wrong.  Caratelli stressed, however, that Tears of the Kingdom’s physics are not magic — it’s clear that Nintendo greatly understands the physics interactions in the game. “What’s extremely technically impressive is how stable it is and how it all fits together in a way where there’s no pre-programmed solution and players can solve puzzles with complete freedom,” Caratelli added.  Moon noted that it’s not exactly that other studios can’t reach this level of technical innovation, but that they don’t prioritize the resources needed to do it. Often, that comes down to supporting the humans who make the games we play. Tears of the Kingdom was seemingly built on top of Breath of the Wild, reportedly with a large portion of the same team working on it.  “If you want good games, you have to give a damn about the people making them”  “There is a problem within the games industry where we don’t value institutional knowledge,” Moon said. “Companies will prioritize bringing someone from outside rather than keeping their junior or mid-level developers and training them up. We are shooting ourselves in the foot by not valuing that institutional knowledge. You can really see it in Tears of the Kingdom. It’s an advancement of what made Breath of the Wild special.”  According to Moon, it’s increasingly common for game developers to feel like they’re holding some feature or another together with duct tape, figuratively speaking, after the person who originally spearheaded its design got laid off or left; there’s a lot of time wasted reconfiguring and assessing how something was done. It’s not that Nintendo doesn’t have its own problems, because it certainly does — Nintendo of America QA testers spoke out about a “frat house” experience within Nintendo of America’s Washington headquarters last year, for instance. But the company does appear to value the expertise of its development staff.  “In addition to the overall hard work of the team, the institutional knowledge is clearly a factor in why this ended up being so smoothly done,” Moon said. “The more stable and happy people are, the more they are able to make games of this quality. If you want good games, you have to give a damn about the people making them.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL2xlZ2VuZC16ZWxkYS10ZWFycy1raW5nZG9tLzIzNzM3OTIxL3RlYXJzLW9mLXRoZS1raW5nZG9tLWJyaWRnZS1waHlzaWNzLWdhbWUtZGV2cy1leHBsYWlu0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9seWdvbi5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wL2xlZ2VuZC16ZWxkYS10ZWFycy1raW5nZG9tLzIzNzM3OTIxL3RlYXJzLW9mLXRoZS1raW5nZG9tLWJyaWRnZS1waHlzaWNzLWdhbWUtZGV2cy1leHBsYWlu?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-06-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T22:53:37","There is no denying that Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most hugely ambitious games to ever release on the industry. With years of development time, a huge scope that had to be cut short, and (ironically, given the game’s world) corporate meddling that resulted in a lackluster and problematic launch, the team at CD Projekt RED has been working nonstop to deliver on what they always promised the game could be. And it seems like they’re getting incredibly close.  Just a few weeks ago the studio released the “Overdrive” update for PC, which wowed players by implementing DLSS3 and Path Tracing to the game. This new form of RayTracing changed the way the game rendered, bringing fans a look into the dark future of Cyberpunk with lighting that changed the feel of the game almost completely.  But now there’s rumbling of the same team adding a new piece of technology to raise that up another notch. PC tech analyst CapFrameX shared on Twitter that the Ray Tracing capabilities of the game are about to be augmented with support for neural radiance caching.  Neural Radiance changes the way path tracing works by, in very simplified terms, replacing model pretraining with generalisation via adaptation. In other words, it’s an algorithm that adapts to the situation and doesn’t require to be “trained” before it works. That results in much better performance for Ray Tracing, enhancing global illumination and reflections in the game.  Of course, all of this should be taken with a grain of salt, as it is currently nothing more than a rumor. However, CD Projekt RED will take part in Summer Game Fest in June, where they’ll show off the game’s first expansion, Phantom Liberty. If they were to show off some new technology that makes their game run and look like never before, then this would be the perfect moment.

Can they keep it going without him?  Russell is leaving the Rainiers for the remainder of the week, in order to attend his son Stone’s high school graduation. Stone Russell attends IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he plays shortstop and is committed to play college baseball at the University of Florida.  Filling in for Russell for the remainder of the Las Vegas series will be the Mariners Minor League Field Coordinator, Louis Boyd. While Boyd is currently in an oversight position that involves visiting teams throughout the farm system, he previously managed the Everett Aqua Sox for the 2021 season.  Boyd will have some big name help, too. Mariners Hall of Famers Alvin Davis and Dan Wilson have both been in town this week, assisting the Rainiers coaching staff. Both work under the title of “Special Assignment Coordinator,” but they really do help out the minor league teams when they drop in. I’ve seen Wilson work blocking drills with Rainiers catcher before, and he filled in as manager for a series in Reno last year. Davis brings immense positive energy to the field, as one would expect from Mr. Mariner, and he has a world of experience to draw from when speaking with players.  The Rainiers also have a fill-in pitching coach for two games, yesterday and today. Max Weiner, the M’s Pitching Coordinator, is filling in for two games while Jairo Cuevas is away.  Let’s see if this group can get keep this Rainiers win streak going.  RAINIERS DAILY  YESTERDAY: Tacoma edged Las Vegas in ten innings, 5-4. The Rainiers tied the game 3-3 in the bottom of the ninth on an RBI double be Jake Scheiner. After Las Vegas scored in the top of the tenth, the Rainiers managed two runs in the bottom of the inning thanks to some wildness – three walks, including one with the bases loaded drawn by Kean Wong to tie the game. Cade Marlowe walked it off with a line drive single to center. The Rainiers have won four straight games and pulled within one game of the .500 mark.  TODAY: Las Vegas Aviators (21-26) at Tacoma Rainiers (23-24), 7:05.  OPPONENT AFFILIATION: Oakland A’s.  OPPOSING MANAGER: Fran Riordan.  SEASON SERIES: Tied, 4-4.  PITCHERS: RHP Adam Oller (1-1, 1.80) at LHP Tommy Milone (3-1, 2.70)  ROSTER MOVES: None today – unless you want to count the coaching staff moves detailed above.  HOT HITTERS: Zach DeLoach has an 11-game hitting streak, going 18-for-41 during the stretch… Cooper Hummel saw his seven-game hitting streak end last night… Mike Ford ranks second in the PCL with 48 RBI… Jack Larsen has a four-game hitting streak, and he has drawn six walks over the first two games of the Las Vegas series.  OPPONENT NEWS: Las Vegas is on a 12-game road trip; they just lost four of six at Salt Lake… the Aviators had a 22-run uprising in game two of the Salt Lake series… the Aviators have some hot hitters: Trenton Brooks has reached base in 20 straight games, and he has hit safely in 14 of his last 15 contests… Jonah Bride is batting .381 in May… the only former Rainiers player on the Las Vegas roster is pitcher Joe Wieland, who went 14-6 as a starter for Tacoma in 2016.

"game","2023-02-07","17:26:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-26T03:27:58","DOWNINGTOWN >> You may or may not believe in the old sports adage that its how you finish not how you started that counts, but the Bishop Shanahan girls lacrosse team sure does.  The Eagles have caught fire in the latter part of the season, and that momemntum carried into Thursday’s District 1 Class 2A semifinal as they used timely first-half scoring and a suffocating defense to knock off eight-seeded Gwynedd Mercy, 9-4.  The win catapults fifth-seeded Shanahan to its third consecutive title game, where they will face No. 7 Mount St. Joseph on Wednesday at a time and place to be determined. The Eagles won the previous two and are looking to be the first three-time champion since 2A began in 2018.  “It’s an amazing feeling,” said midfielder Caitlyn Hubiak. “It’s great to be a champion. We did it twice before. We’ve been here before, so we’re all ready to execute and bring home a three-peat.”  The two teams met earlier in the season with Shanahan coasting to an 11-3 victory, but the offenses took some time Thursday before clicking.  “I think it was a little bit of nerves,” Hubiak said of the goalless start. “We really had a great game Tuesday (a dramatic 10-7 win over Strath Haven). I think we needed a little bit of ime to get into the game, and then our shots started falling.”  The pair went nearly 10 minutes before notching the opening goal. Shanahan (14-6-1) had opportunities, but they were stymied by the play of goalie Jenny Keagy, who made six stops in the first half. The Monarchs (14-7) didn’t fare much better, but it was turnovers that were preventing them from getting on the board.  “Both of the defenses stepped up from the start,” said Gwynedd Mercy coach Bridget Beck. “Our defense played a phenomenal game from the minute we stepped on the field to the minute we stepped off. Our defense showed up today. Our goalie, Jenny, just made all the saves. Our defense just killed it in the beginning and we couldn’t score on our attacking end.”  The breakthrough for the Eagles came with 15:05 left as Annabelle Wiedel unleashed a low, hard shot off a free position to open their account.  They made it 2-0 as Silvia Baptista’s free position shot sneaked by Keagy, who got a piece of it.  Gwynedd got on the board from the 8-meter as senior midfielder Ellie Verrill ripped a shot past goalie Izzy Sawicki and the deficit was halved.  Shanahan restored the two-goal advantage as Wiedel scored while falling down with 5:26 remaining. Hubiak used a solo effort to bull her way into position to make it a 4-1 lead with 5:26 to play. Seconds later. Amelia Benner sent a low shot past Keagy for a 5-1 advantage Shanahan kept heading into the halftime break.  Benner continued her natural hat trick when she scored twice in the first five minutes of the second half to bump the lead to 7-1.  “Amelia was awesome,” said Shanahan coach Kacy Small. “She’s done things all year that nobody talks about. She just does a lot of the dirty work on the rebounds and is at the right time and does a lot of things to extend possessions for us. It was real good to see her cash in like that.”  Gwynedd turned a turnover into a semi-breakaway and turned it into a goal with sophomore Malley Connor on the receiving end.  Hubiak notched her second goal of the game as she did a little shake-and bake move to lose her defender, get a little space and scored to make it 8-2 with 18:39 left.  “A little bit of a signature move I do quite often,” said Hubiak.  Colleen Mullin and Audrey Beck scored on either end of a Stella D’Ambro tally to wrap up the scoring.  Sawicki, who was coming off a stellar game against Strath Haven, made 10 saves for the victory.  “Their defense threw something at us we haven’t seen before and unfortunately, we weren’t able to adjust quick enough,” added Beck.  The Monarchs will face third seed Upper Moreland in the third-place game Wednesday.  “Resetting over the weekend,” said Beck. “We are definitely going to practice how to handle pressure and be able to connect more.”  But for the Eagles, winners of 10 of their last 11, another trip to the promised land awaits.  “Our biggest thing right now is respecting all of our opponents,” said Small. “This has been a really wild year in the Ches-Mont and across PA lacrosse, a lot of close games. This time of year, at least for our program, we’re just focused on doing what we have to do.”  Bishop Shanahan 9, Gwynedd Mercy 4  Gwynedd Mercy 1 3 — 4  Bishop Shanahan 5 4 — 9  Gwynedd Mercy goals: Verrill, Connor, Mullin, Beck.

"game","1983-07-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T20:31:56","According to gaming database Mobygames, officially licensed versions of Tetris have appeared on roughly 60 different gaming platforms, from the Oculus Quest to the Data Zapper M7000. Now, thanks to a new McDonald's China promotion, you can add ""giant plastic chicken nugget with an LCD screen"" to that list of official Tetris ports (to say nothing of the unofficial ones).  RetroDodo has the story of this strange promotion, which is centered around the 40th anniversary of the Chicken McNugget's premiere in 1983. That makes the protein-filled treat just a year older than Tetris itself, which was created on a Russian government mainframe computer by Alexei Pajitnov in 1984. And that, apparently, is close enough to make the game part of an International Children's Day promotion that will ""take you on the time machine leading to childhood,"" according to a machine translation of the official McDonald's China webpage announcing the machine.  A video unboxing and demonstration posted by one Chinese McDonald's fan shows crisp shots of nugget-Tetris and its unlit LCD screen, as well as the included customization stickers and carrying case. Another unboxing video includes a better look at the back of the machine, including a removable battery pack, speaker grate, and power switch.  That second video also includes a welcome size-comparison shot with a real Chicken McNugget , showing the unit is roughly four times as large as the boot-shaped nugget on which it's based. ""This is a pretty sizable nug"" as the video reviewer puts it (though it's got nothing on the world's largest Tetris , of course).  Nugget-Tetris' cheap LCD screen and sound might bring to mind the kind of cheap, unauthorized Tetris knockoffs you might find at the dollar store or flea market. But Retro Dodo's sources shared an image of the back of the unit, which includes complete copyright, trademark, and licensing information for ""Tetris logos, theme and, and Tetriminos,"" as well as the game's ""trade dress."" Nice to know that the McDonald's logo in the corner of the screen speaks to the ""official"" quality on display here.  Advertisement  From a gaming perspective, the machine gains authenticity points by playing a tinny version of Korobeiniki (aka, ""The Tetris song"") at launch and by including a ""hard-drop"" button that can send a tetromino immediately to the floor. But we definitely have to quibble with the machine's cramped, 13×9 square playfield (much more compressed than the copyrighted 20×10 standard set by The Tetris Company) and the fact that there's only a single large rotation button (clockwise). Still, as far as McDonald's video game promotions are concerned, we'd definitely take this nugget-Tetris over the extremely cheap Sega-themed LCD games that were featured in American Happy Meals during the '00s.  The fine print on the McDonald's website says there will only be 400,000 Nugget-Tetris machines available at mainland China locations through June 27, with an additional 100,000 available to users of the Ele.me food delivery app. That means the unit—which is available with food purchase for 30 yuan (about $4.24)—could become one of the rarest officially licensed Tetris games out there, especially in the West. Just wait a decade or so and we'll bet collectors will be sending unopened ""nuggets"" off to be graded by Wata Games or some other authentication service.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2dhbWluZy8yMDIzLzA1L2ZpbmFsbHkteW91LWNhbi1wbGF5LXRldHJpcy1vbi1hLWdpYW50LWNoaWNrZW4tbnVnZ2V0L9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2dhbWluZy8yMDIzLzA1L2ZpbmFsbHkteW91LWNhbi1wbGF5LXRldHJpcy1vbi1hLWdpYW50LWNoaWNrZW4tbnVnZ2V0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An accompanying blog post offers only a little more detail.  Concord will be a PVP first-person shooter set in space, headed to PS4 and PS5 in 2024.  Watch on YouTube Our first confirmation of Concord, from FireWalk Studios.  ""Concord is a bringing together of peoples,"" FireWalk Studios wrote. ""It's the power of games to build connection and inspire social play. The Firewalk team is driven by the type of exciting, unexpected moments and shared experiences that multiplayer games create.  ""Every time you log on is the beginning of a new adventure and every match is an opportunity for a new story. It’s these ideals that define Concord, its unique universe of vibrant worlds, and its rich cast of colorful characters.""  Sony announced it had bought FireWalk Studios only last month.

However, this game is set in 1919 and features animals and humans together. Check out the trailer below.  Watch on YouTube Revenant Hill - Announce Trailer  The game seems to be focused on building a community, after Twigs takes up residence in a wet log (of all places).  A PlayStation Blog post on the game reads: ""Grow crops to sell at the secret market or use for your own purposes. Put down roots. Run through the fields and the trees. Watch the seasons pass. Make friends who become neighbours who become family. Also make enemies. That's unavoidable sometimes. Figure out what the ghosts want. Host increasingly ambitious parties for witches and demons and other things that don't have proper names. Get tangled up in a world in the midst of violent change. Build a community by accident. Square dance with a possum. Eat mice.""  Ultimately, players will ""work [their] way up the ladder towards [their] dream job of being a fully licensed familiar"".  Twigs the cat.

More than two years after the project was canceled by IDW Games, Zombicide publisher CMON has picked it up — including the original design by Specter Ops creator Emerson Matsuuchi. The announcement coincides with the announcement by Konami of a remaster of Metal Gear Solid 3. No word yet on when or if the board game will have a retail release.  CMON describes Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game as a cooperative game of stealth (for one to four players) with an “intricate” narrative. The video game’s Shadow Moses arc can be played out across a 14-mission campaign, or players can dive into a VR Mission book with six stand-alone missions. The board game adaptation of the original Metal Gear Solid includes its most recognizable characters: Solid Snake, Meryl, Gray Fox, and Otacon as playable heroes; and Revolver Ocelot, Sniper Wolf, Psycho Mantis, Vulcan Raven, and Liquid Snake as bosses. Of course, it includes two cardboard box miniatures for authentic tactical espionage action gameplay.  The pre-order version of the board game, subtitled Integral Edition, is expected to launch by May 2024. Integral Edition will include an exclusive Metal Gear REX figure and a 109-page graphic novel illustrated by Kenneth Loh (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, G.I. Joe).  CMON has been in the business of making beautiful board games for quite a while now, and nearly all of its biggest hits have been funded on Kickstarter. The company completed its 55th campaign in April, bringing in more than $3.8 million for Zombicide: White Death, a new adaptation of its fan-favorite cooperative zombie hack-and-slash. But it’s no stranger to licensed games either, with partnerships that range from the Marvel universe to Cyberpunk 2077, Masters of the Universe, and Frank Herbert’s Dune.  Matsuushi’s design dates back to 2018, when the original version of this hidden-movement game (also titled Metal Gear Solid: The Board Game) launched on Backerkit. The publisher, IDW Games, eventually ran into challenges and canceled the project — a prelude to winding down its games business completely. IDW has only recently been stabilized under a new CEO, but the game design itself reverted back to Matsuuchi. Polygon reached out to IDW for comment about the situation, but it declined to offer one.  Wednesday’s announcement included a CGI trailer, and the manual for the game — which is still a work in progress — is also available to download. Expect to learn more about the game as we kick off the busy summer convention circuit, including Gen Con this August in Indianapolis.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzM1ODM0L21ldGFsLWdlYXItc29saWQtYm9hcmQtZ2FtZS1pbnRlZ3JhbC1jbW9uLXByZW9yZGVyLXByaWNlLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzczNTgzNC9tZXRhbC1nZWFyLXNvbGlkLWJvYXJkLWdhbWUtaW50ZWdyYWwtY21vbi1wcmVvcmRlci1wcmljZS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

These games have ranged from incredible AAA experiences to smaller indie titles that you perhaps wouldn’t have thought to pick up — had it not been for Game Pass.  Unfortunately, due to the service having such a high volume of games, it can be easy for smaller titles to get overlooked and passed up on, and believe me, there are many Xbox Game Pass games available that deserve so much more attention.  With our list, you will be able to find and try out some of these hidden gems and potentially, find your next indie game of the year.  Xbox Game Pass hidden gems: Dreamscaper  Help the young Cassidy overcome her nightmares. (Image credit: Freedom!

A roguelite like you’ve never seen before, Dreamscaper sees players adventuring through Cassidy’s dreams; uncovering memories, upgrading various gear items and, ultimately, vanquishing the nightmares that haunt those dreams. Each dream you enter differs from the last, even differing in weapons and abilities. But it’s in Cassidy’s waking life that is the most unique part of this roguelite.  Players will live Cassidy’s waking life; forge friendships, visit various locations, empower her with hopes and memories that will apply permanent changes whilst in the dream state. This is a game where you never stop learning new things, and you never stop unlocking new things to experience.  If you’re a fan of roguelites, then you must give Dreamscaper a try.

Now, if you have ever done an escape room in real life you will know exactly what to expect; hidden keys, coded passwords and more, except Escape Academy does it with a little more flair.  It’s incredibly fun, and you can enjoy it in its entirety in local and online co-op. What’s not to love? Oh, and playing it co-operatively is a unique experience too because it actually splits the screen so that each player can see what the other is looking at.  If you’re a lover of puzzle games, or just escape rooms in general then Escape Academy is not to be missed.

The short 4-hour story can easily be completed in a single sitting, which is great for those of us that struggle to find time for the 20+ hours of story that often comes with games these days.

You will come to know several teenage characters as they attempt to flee the country due to its harsh dictatorship. The way this is played is in a unique way though, as each time you successfully cross the border (or fail) you will take control of a new character – each one advancing the story a little further each time.  Road 96 has a visually pleasing art style, an incredible-yet-emotional soundtrack and the freedom to drive across many different routes to give you a fresh experience each time you play. Go on, take the risk.  Xbox Game Pass hidden gems: Chained Echoes  Relive the golden age of 16-bit JRPGs with Chained Echoes.

The long-awaited sequel to Homeworld 2, a sci-fi real-time strategy video game released way back in 2003, was supposed to come out in 2022 before its release was pushed back to the first half of this year. Now, its developer Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox Publishing have revealed that they're moving Homeworld 3's launch date to February 2024. In their announcement, they said that they want to deliver a game that ""lives up to the standards set by its predecessors.  They continued that in order to fully realize their vision, they need more time to refine and polish the game. Fans' reactions to the announcement on Twitter have been positive so far, with most of them supporting the companies for taking the time to get it right. Upon being asked about the collector's edition they sold, they said those who purchased the box will still receive it at launch.

""In fact,"" they added, ""the team is able to achieve as much if not more when given the additional personal time."" They didn't go through any technical hurdles and change the scope of the game either — it just simply takes time to create and polish a whole game.

The Rangers, who were coming off their sixth straight losing season, have won five of their past six games to improve to 31-18. They are three games ahead of the defending World Series champion Houston Astros atop the American League West.  ""This is close to what I was hoping,"" Texas manager Bruce Bochy said. ""I wanted us to get off to a good start. I thought that was important.""  The Rangers were off on Thursday after taking two of three games against the Pittsburgh Pirates to open a nine-game road trip that concludes with a three-game series against the Tigers.  The Orioles, who posted their first winning season since 2016 last year, were expected to contend for a wild card. However, after earning a three-game sweep of the host Toronto Blue Jays and then taking two of three against the host New York Yankees, the Orioles are 33-17 -- their best start through 50 games since 1997 (35-15).  They have the second-best record in the majors, trailing only the American League East-leading Tampa Bay Rays (37-15).  ""It's been great, and we've had a chance to win night in and night out,"" Baltimore outfielder Austin Hays said.  The Orioles are coming off a 3-1 win over the Yankees in the rubber match of a three-game series on Thursday.  Kyle Gibson gave up just two singles over seven shutout innings. Anthony Santander and Hays provided the big hits with a run-scoring single in the fifth and a two-run double in the eighth, respectively. Santander went 3-for-3 with a walk.  ""This was a huge series win, and it's on to (Friday),"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said.  Baltimore took two of three against the Rangers in the teams' first matchup of the season, winning the opener 2-0 on April 3 before cruising to a 7-2 win in the second contest. Texas avoided the sweep with a 5-2 win that was its first victory over the Orioles in nine meetings.  The Orioles will give the ball on Friday to rookie Grayson Rodriguez (2-1, 6.21 ERA), who is coming off a solid outing in his latest start. The right-hander gave up two runs on four hits with six strikeouts and a walk in five innings during a no-decision at Toronto on Saturday.  Rodriguez, who hasn't lasted more than 5 2/3 innings in an outing, made his major league debut against the Rangers on April 5. He wasn't involved in the decision after yielding two runs on four hits with five strikeouts and a walk in five innings.  Texas right-hander Jon Gray (4-1, 3.02), who will start Friday, pitched well against the Orioles the last time he faced them. Gray picked up the loss despite allowing just two runs on four hits with seven strikeouts and two walks in 6 1/3 innings during a 2-0 setback on April 3.  In three career starts vs. Baltimore, Gray is 1-2 with a 3.68 ERA.  Gray was sharp on Saturday, allowing just a run on five hits with six strikeouts and two walks over five innings of an 11-5 win over the visiting Colorado Rockies.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9vcmlvbGVzLXJhbmdlcnMtYnJpbmctaG90LXN0cmVha3MtaW50by0zLWdhbWUtc2VyaWVzLTIwMjMtMDUtMjYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Boston Celtics defended home court in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Thursday, rolling to a 110-97 win over the Miami Heat at TD Garden to force a Game 6 on Saturday.  The Celtics are just the 15th team in NBA history to make it to Game 6 after trailing a best-of-seven playoff series 3-0. No team has ever won a series after trailing 3-0 in 150 instances.  Celtics Talk POSTGAME POD: Celtics become only 15th NBA team to force Game 6 when down 3-0 | Listen & Subscribe  Boston's role players stepped up in this one, with Derrick White and Marcus Smart contributing 24 and 23 points, respectively. Jayson Tatum flirted with a triple-double (21 points, eight rebounds, 11 assists), while Jaylen Brown chipped in 21.  Duncan Robinson led the Heat with 18 points while Jimmy Butler tallied just 14, as Miami's offense struggled mightily with Gabe Vincent sidelined due to an ankle injury.  Here are our takeaways from Boston's second straight blowout victory, which cranks up the pressure on Miami for Game 6:  Derrick White: Difference-maker  White had a quiet offensive series against the Philadelphia 76ers in Round 2, but he's made a massive impact in the Celtics' last two wins -- particularly with his outside shot.  The C's guard connected on 6 of 8 3-pointers in Game 5 -- three of which came in the first quarter to help Boston race to a 35-20 lead.  White aggressively looked for his shot all night and now has 40 points on 13 of 21 shooting (9 of 15 from 3) in the last two games.  The Celtics are at their best when they're spreading the floor and multiple players are hitting 3s, and White led the charge in that department Thursday. After hitting 15 of 36 3-pointers in Game 5, Boston is now 10-2 this postseason when it makes at least 13 3-pointers and 0-6 when it makes 12 or fewer.  Tatum the facilitator  Tatum scored 12 points in the first nine minutes of play and didn't score again until the 6:39 mark of the third quarter. But that doesn't mean he was off his game.  The Celtics superstar adopted a pass-first mentality after his hot start, making quick decisions on Miami double-teams to set his teammates up for open looks.  Grant Williams 3â£ pic.twitter.com/d48EIkJ7Yc — Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) May 26, 2023  Tatum's 11 assists are a season-high and his most since Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors (13). While he struggled from 3-point range in this one (1 of 6), Tatum still left a significant imprint on the game, sparking the C's early with his scoring and helping secondary scorers like White and Smart get going with his passing.  Winning on the margins  The Celtics beat the Heat at their own game Thursday night.  Miami thrived on second-chance points and points off turnovers in Games 1 through 3, but Boston dominated both categories in Game 5, racking up 17 second-chance points to the Heat's seven and 27 points off 16 Heat turnovers. The Celtics also racked up a season-high 13 steals and grabbed 12 offensive rebounds.  Smart set the tone for Boston's hustle in the first minute by diving for a loose ball and setting up a Tatum layup. The C's out-hustled the Heat all night, playing with a desperation that matched the do-or-die stakes.  Defense -> Offense ð¯ pic.twitter.com/FMPBuGcLUg — Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) May 26, 2023  The Celtics will need to come out with the same energy in Miami on Saturday night if they want to continue their historic comeback.  Heat feel Gabe Vincent's absence  Vincent has been a key cog in Miami's offensive attack in this series, and the Heat's offense stalled without him early in Game 5.  The Heat mustered just 20 points in the first quarter, committing six turnovers to just three assists. Kyle Lowry committed two of those early turnovers while starting in Vincent's absence and finished with a brutal stat line: five points on 2 of 5 shooting with one assist and four turnovers.  MARCUS SMART ð¥ pic.twitter.com/34eVvVZxz1 — Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) May 26, 2023  Vincent's status for Saturday's Game 6 in Miami remains unclear. But it certainly bears watching, as he's one of the Heat's few reliable scorers outside Butler.  If Vincent can't go in Game 6 -- set for Saturday at 8:30 p.m. ET at Kaseya Center in Miami -- expect the Celtics to bring a similar defensive intensity and force the 37-year-old Lowry to make plays.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYm9zdG9uL2NlbHRpY3MvY2VsdGljcy1oZWF0LXRha2Vhd2F5cy1ib3N0b24tYmxpdHplcy1taWFtaS1nYW1lLTUtY29udGludWUtZWNmLWNvbWViYWNr0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vY2VsdGljcy9jZWx0aWNzLWhlYXQtdGFrZWF3YXlzLWJvc3Rvbi1ibGl0emVzLW1pYW1pLWdhbWUtNS1jb250aW51ZS1lY2YtY29tZWJhY2s_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-07-22","Not Discerned","{""SantaMonica"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T16:30:12","Sony didn't let the lack of E3 stop it from delivering a big summer games event. The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for more than three years now, so it was time to see the announcements that will shape the console's future. The most recent PlayStation Showcase had plenty of those to go around, with expected and unexpected game reveals.  Granted, the show was a more subdued than what the rumors suggested. There was nary a whisper of a Bloodborne remake or port during the event, unfortunately. Instead of huge, first-party reveals, we saw more mid-size, multi-platform titles. Games like Ghostrunner 2, Helldivers 2, and Square-Enix’s iffy-looking Splatoon clone Foamstars don’t exactly scratch that new God of War itch. Still, these10 trailers from the 2023 PlayStation Showcase highlight the titles that we can't wait to pop into our PS5s and stream to our PlayStation Q handhelds.  1. Alan Wake 2  In 2010, Remedy Entertainment delivered a moody survival-horror shooter that asked “What if Stephen King had to shoot a lot of guys?” This long-awaited sequel continues not only Alan’s surreal nightmare, but also connects to Remedy’s other trippy shooter, Control. Alan Wake 2 releases Oct. 17.  2. Assassin's Creed Mirage  After nearly a decade of massive, open-world Assassin’s Creed experiences, Mirage looks to pull the franchise back to its tighter, stealthier, more murderous roots. Even the Middle Eastern setting recalls the first game, hopefully implying a return to series form. After a delay, Mirage is set for an Oct. 12 release.  3. Marathon  Before Bungie became famous for Halo and Destiny, the team developed an innovative series of Mac first-person shooters called Marathon. We don’t know how this new Marathon connects to the old Marathon just yet. It seems to draw more from the recent “extraction shooter” genre, but it certainly looks cool.  4. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2  Sony’s big holiday game for 2023 is Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. A sequel to both the original Spider-Man and the Miles Morales spin-off, this gameplay demo showed how we will switch between the two heroes. In the trailer, we see Peter succumbing to the symbiote suit's dark influence as he tussles with The Lizard and Kraven the Hunter.  5. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater  The curtain is pulled, and the much-rumored Metal Gear Solid 3 remake has finally been revealed. But if Hideo Kojima is developing Death Stranding 2, who at Konami is working on this remake? We don’t know, but the PlayStation Showcase confirms the game's existence. Even if revisiting this classic chapter in Snake’s story turns out to be a huge mistake, at least the original games are being rereleased on modern platforms in Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1.

Neva  The creators of Gris, a beautiful indie game, are back with Neva, another beautiful indie game. The trailer didn’t show much gameplay, but it teased the intense emotional bond that you'll build with a mystical wolf-monster.  7. Phantom Blade Zero  No, this isn’t Ghost of Tsushima 2. Phantom Blade Zero is an original, Wuxia-inspired action game by a company called S-Game. The title promises heavy Souls-style action, but we were especially impressed by the swordplay's speed.  8. Resident Evil 4 VR  The PlayStation VR 2 is a powerful, top pick for virtual reality headsets. Sony showed off several games coming to the device, such as a Beat Saber expansion and a new Crossfire game. However, one VR game clearly stood out. The Resident Evil 4 remake is one of the best games in recent memory, so it’ll probably be pretty cool in VR, too.  9. Revenant Hill  Night in the Woods looked like a cute game about talking animals, and it was. However, it was also a thoughtful, brilliantly written narrative adventure about modern issues affecting individual people and the world at large, so we have high hopes for the team’s next project: Revenant Hill. The cats are back.  10. Sword of the Sea  If you didn’t already know that Sword of the Sea featured talent that created Abzu, Journey, and the Pathless, you could still probably guess that after looking at this trailer. A stylish sand surfing game? Sure! And it looks like a lot of fun.  For more, check out the best PlayStation 5 games you can play right now.

"game","2018-10-14","Not Discerned","{""Dublin"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","2023-05-25T20:44:51","The NFL has only played one game ever in Ireland, and one of the teams involved in that game, the Pittsburgh Steelers, is hoping that the league will soon be making a return to the country.  The Steelers' director of business development and strategy, Daniel Rooney, revealed Thursday that Pittsburgh is interested in playing a game in Ireland after the NFL granted the team international marketing rights in the country this week.  ""Our aspirations long term are to play a game in Ireland,"" Rooney said, via the Associated Press. ""As we move through the process, we'll be evaluating all options.""  Rooney was in Ireland on Thursday with former Steelers star Kordell Stewart to celebrate the team's partnership with the Emerald Isle. One reason the Steelers were granted marketing rights to the country is because of the team's close ties to the region. For one, former Steelers chairman, Daniel M. Rooney, once served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland (2009-12). Also, the Steelers are one of just two teams to play a game in the country. Back in July 1997, the Steelers beat the Bears 30-17 in a preseason game that was played at Dublin's Croke Park.

Thanks for signing up! Keep an eye on your inbox. Sorry! There was an error processing your subscription.  To this day, that still stands as the only NFL game ever played in Ireland. The Steelers were given a Waterford Crystal trophy for winning that game, a reward that the team still keeps at its practice facility.  With so many ties, Ireland felt like a natural fit for the Steelers.  ""When the opportunity arose for NFL teams to become more active in countries outside of the U.S., the Steelers could not have been more excited to re-establish the traditions my grandfather so proudly established here in Ireland, as well as bring new ones,"" Rooney said, via the team's website.  Although the Steelers would like to play a game in Ireland, it's not clear when that would happen. As far as regular-season games go, the country doesn't seem to be on the NFL's radar right now, which means the Steelers will likely be waiting a few years.  Patriots owner Robert Kraft mentioned in January 2018 that he would like to see his team play a game in Germany, and five years later, that's finally going to happen. If the NFL sticks to a similar timeline, that means the Steelers likely wouldn't play a game in Ireland until 2028 at the earliest.  The NFL could always put a preseason game there, but the league has been shying away from international preseason games. Over the past 12 years, there's only been one, and that came in 2019 when the Raiders played the Packers in Winnipeg, Canada. The last time a preseason game was held outside of North America came back in August 2005 when the Falcons played the Colts in Tokyo.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzL3N0ZWVsZXJzLXdhbnQtdG8tcGxheS1yZWd1bGFyLXNlYXNvbi1nYW1lLWluLWlyZWxhbmQtaGVyZXMtd2hhdC15b3UtbmVlZC10by1rbm93LWFib3V0LXBpdHRzYnVyZ2hzLXBsYW5zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The most recent game agreement, which secured the matchup in Jacksonville through the 2023 season, outlined an option to extend the rivalry game in the neutral site the following two seasons as long as the two schools notified the City of Jacksonville prior to June 30, 2023. The schools are formally notifying the city this week.    “The City of Jacksonville has been an historic host for one of the great rivalry games in all of college football,” Florida Athletics Director Scott Stricklin said. “We are excited to have the game in Jacksonville for another two seasons.”    “We are pleased with the decision to exercise the option that will keep the game in Jacksonville for 2024 and 2025,” said UGA J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics Josh Brooks. “We look forward to discussions that I’m sure will continue over the next couple years exploring all the options for 2026 and beyond. We continue to be appreciative of the working relationship we have with the University of Florida and the City of Jacksonville.”    “Jacksonville has been the proud home of the Georgia-Florida game since 1933,” Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry said. “We are excited to welcome back the thousands of Dawgs and Gators to Jacksonville in 2024 and 2025. I want to thank the University of Georgia and University of Florida for their continued faith and investment in our city.”    A staple October tradition, the Florida-Georgia game has been played in Jacksonville since 1933 with the exception of the 1994 and 1995 seasons during the construction of TIAA Bank Field. The Gators and the Bulldogs are currently slated to meet on Oct. 28 for this year’s matchup.

This year's show will air live across the world and will be held at the YouTube Theater at Hollywood Park. For anyone looking to be there in person for all of the announcements, tickets are on sale now. For everyone else who isn't ready to make the trek to Los Angeles, here's how you can watch Summer Games Fest from the comfort of your home or local movie theater.  When is Summer Games Fest 2023?  The show will officially kick of on Thursday, June 8, at the following times:  12 PM PT  3 PM ET  8 PM BST  5AM AET (June 9)  How to watch Summer Games Fest  You'll be able to catch the showcase on all of the usual social media platforms that Summer Games Fest is available on, and live cinema screenings of the event will also be offered. More details on which cinemas you can visit to watch SGF will be shared at a later date.  YouTube  Twitch  Twitter  TikTok  Steam  Who will be at Summer Games Fest?  Every year sees a number of publishers and studios from across the industry appear on the SGF stage, and the 2023 edition says that there will be updates from more than 40 ""partners"" during the year. So far, the list includes big names such as Sony, Xbox, Square Enix, and Activision, as well as a number of other companies that have made a big impact over the last couple of years, including Annapurna Interactive, HoYoVerse, and Netflix Games.  Activision  Amazon Games  Annapurna Interactive  Bandai Namco  Behaviour Interactive  Capcom  CD Projekt Red  Devolver Digital  Digital Extremes  Disney  EA Games  Epic Games  Focus Entertainment  Gearbox Publishing  Grinding Gear Games  HoYoVerse  Kabam  Larian Games  Level Infinite  Magic The Gathering  Neowiz  Netflix Games  Nexon  Niantic  North Beach  Paradox Interactive  Pearl Abyss  Phoenix Labs  Plaion  PlayStation  Pocket Pair  Razer  Samsung Gaming Hub  Second Dinner  Sega  Smilegate Entertainment  Square Enix  Steam  Techland  Tribeca Festival  Ubisoft  Warner Bros. Interactive  Xbox  What to expect at Summer Games Fest  If previous years are an indicator of what you can expect, then prepare for plenty of game trailers, a few premieres, and short interviews with developers. There'll probably be some heightened security around the stage as well, especially after last year's Elden Ring incident at the Game Awards. Mortal Kombat 1 developer NetherRealm Studios has already confirmed that the first gameplay for the upcoming brawler will be shown at Summer Games Fest, and Remedy Interactive will reveal raw gameplay for Alan Wake 2 as well.  Beyond that, SGF usually doesn't have too many blockbuster reveals, and the bulk of the show normally contains a number of new trailers for games that have already been revealed. With Square Enix attending, it's a safe bet that something related to Final Fantasy 16 or its new soapy multiplayer shooter Foamstars will be shown, Bandai Namco probably has a Tekken 8 trailer prepared, and Activision could show off footage from this year's Call of Duty.  Street Fighter 6 will be a week old by the time that Capcom hits the stage, so the publisher will probably be focused on its next game, Exoprimal, and HoYoVerse will likely have new updates for Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt Red debuted new footage of the game's Phantom Liberty at last year's Game Awards, and the studio did mention that it would reveal more details about the DLC in June.  Once Keighley's show wraps up, the rest of June contains several other showcases that you can tune in for. There'll be a daily barrage of shows, so get ready for the return of Wholesome Direct on June 10, the Future Games Show Summer Showcase that same day, the Xbox Games Showcase and Starfield Direct on June 11, and Ubisoft Forward on June 12.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtc3VtbWVyLWdhbWUtZmVzdC0yMDIzLXN0YXJ0LXRpbWUtYW5kLXdoYXQtdG8tZXhwZWN0LzExMDAtNjUxNDU3My_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1lc3BvdC5jb20vYW1wLWFydGljbGVzL2hvdy10by13YXRjaC1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LTIwMjMtc3RhcnQtdGltZS1hbmQtd2hhdC10by1leHBlY3QvMTEwMC02NTE0NTczLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T22:23:39","Game and Fish makes additional cuts to antelope licenses  Applicants have until midnight May 31 to modify or withdraw  Cheyenne - The Wyoming Game and Fish Department has made additional reductions to antelope license quotas for several hunt areas located in Carbon, Lincoln, Sublette and Teton counties. Recent collar data and field observations by wildlife managers indicate further reductions are warranted.    The Game and Fish Commission initially approved antelope license quotas at their April Commission meeting. An emergency rule was adopted to amend the approved license quotas as there was not ample time to undergo the regular rulemaking process. The emergency rule was proposed by the Game and Fish, approved by the Commission and signed by Gov. Mark Gordon on May 25.    Quotas in the following antelope hunt areas have been further reduced: 53, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 and 101.        Baggs Pronghorn Herd – Hunt Area 53    Quotas in the Baggs Pronghorn Herd, Hunt Area 53, have been reduced due to many pronghorn moving out of the area this winter and having yet to return, some having died due to severe winter conditions and others likely still migrating back to their summer ranges. Collar data is unavailable for the Baggs Pronghorn Herd, and these reductions were made due to field observations and the absence of pronghorn in the hunt area.    Sublette Pronghorn Herd — Hunt Areas 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91 and 101    Antelope in the Sublette Pronghorn Herd experienced severe winter conditions, record-breaking snow depths and a devastating pneumonia outbreak. Recent snowmelt has allowed wildlife managers to spend more time on the landscape and observe a significant increase in antelope mortalities. The observations and updated collar data now indicate approximately 75% of the collared adult doe population in the Sublette Pronghorn Herd have died due to Mycoplasma bovis induced pneumonia and winter severity.    Full-price antelope license quotas in the region were initially reduced during the season-setting process by approximately 50% compared to 2022 quotas, and all reduced price doe/fawn licenses were removed. The emergency rule further reduces quotas in these hunt areas.    The license application period for antelope closes at midnight MDT on May 31. Applicants can modify or withdraw their application at any time before the deadline.

"game","2023-09-26","15:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T21:05:00","At GamesBeat Summit 2023, trust and safety issues, especially for diverse gamer populations, were top of mind, and nailing it was the focus of the panel, “How to do trust and safety right before you’re forced to do so.”  “The game industry has come of age,” said moderator Hank Howie, game industry evangelist at Modulate said. “We are no longer this ancillary form of entertainment — we are the 800-pound gorilla of entertainment. It’s time to fully take on the mantle of leadership in the arena of trust and safety, at the CEO level of every company. To do anything less risks putting your company in financial peril, in addition to being in a morally bankrupt position.”  He was joined by leaders from Take This, a mental health advocacy nonprofit, Windwalk, which focuses on building online communities and “web3” law firm, Gamma Law, to discuss the state of trust and safety, regulatory changes bearing down on games companies, and what developers can do now to put guardrails in place for their communities.  Here’s a look at the highlights of the discussion — and don’t miss the full panel, available free on demand here.  A small but violent faction  “It is frankly, really really difficult to moderate a third-party platform, especially a pseudo anonymous one,” said Richard Warren, partner at Windwalk. “What’s working really well is self moderation, but also culture setting.”  Being intentional about your moderation programs and establishing a standard of behavior, especially among diehard fans, is what sets the tone of any tight-knit community.  But the challenge, said Eve Crevoshay, executive director at Take This, is that while we know how to create good spaces, some ugly norms, behaviors and ideologies have become incredibly common in these spaces. It’s a small but very loud problem — and that loudness means that the behavior has become normalized.  “When I say toxic, I mean specifically misogynist white supremacist, neo Nazi and other xenophobic language, along with harassment and mean behavior,” she said. “We haven’t seen yet space where that stuff is actually actively prohibited or actively pushed out of a community. We are identifying those solutions for how we address that, but right now, we see really high incidences.”  It’s driving away not only gamers who are uncomfortable in those spaces, but also industry professionals who don’t feel safe in their own game’s community. And there’s evidence that kids in these spaces are learning toxic behaviors, because the environment is so choked with it, she added.  “Every young white man, a boy in the U.S., is on an explicit path to radicalization unless they are taken off it,” she said. “And so I want to be really clear. It’s not just games. We do have solutions, but we have to use them. We have to implement them. We have to think about this. And that’s why we do the work that we do, and that’s why we’re getting regulatory attention.”  What you need to know about upcoming legislation  In April the EU Digital Safety Act came into effect, and California’s Age Appropriate Design Act passed in September and will be effective July 1, 2023. It’s crucial to for developers to take notice, because other states will not be far behind.  “I think the regulatory landscape not just in California, but at the federal level in the U.S. is heating up substantially,” Crevoshay said. “We’ve been speaking with the Senate Judiciary Committee, with Representative Trahan from from Massachusetts. They’re all barking up this tree around not just child protection, but around the larger issue of extremist behavior in online spaces.”  Both the EU and California laws introduce new privacy restrictions and rules around information gathering, targeted advertising and dark patterns, meaning a business cannot take any action it knows or has reason to know, is “materially detrimental” to the physical health, mental health or well-being of a child. Secondly, they’ll regulate the kind of content that appears on a platform.  “Not only are we as game platforms to follow these procedures in respect to information collection, and so forth, but we also have to take steps to protect children from harmful content and contacts,” said David Hoppe, managing partner at Gamma Law.  But it’s not clear exactly how that will transfer to the real world, and what guardrails game companies will need to put in place, he added. The EU Digital Services Act is also likely to be passed over the summer, which asks platforms to put in place measures to protect users from illegal content by asking adults to choose what types of content they want to see. Failure to comply will see companies getting hit with substantial fines. For instance, the California act starts at $2,500 per child.  What game companies can do now  The unfortunate fact is that it is easy to start a community today, and unofficial, third-party communities are flourishing. And that’s what you want, of course, Warren said. But it’s also a curse, in that moderating these communities is completely untenable.  “All that you can really do is as a first-party is understand the culture that we want to set around our player base,” he said. “We want to design a game that reinforces this culture and doesn’t lead to these negative occurrences where users can get really, really pissed off at each other — and try to reduce the kind of hateful content that people will make or the hateful discussion points that users have in game and bring to the community.”  A culture around regulation and requirements for moderation, whether it’s human or AI, is essential to the task of creating safe spaces, Crevoshay added, as well as consequences for harmful behavior.  “You need a carrot and stick approach,” she said. “Good design goes a really long way, both in a community and in the game itself in increasing pro-social behavior, increasing shared positive norms and aspirational ideas. But if you don’t also have the stick, it can very easily devolve into a problematic space.”  “The days of anything goes and turning a blind eye, that is not going to fly even in the United States anymore, and certainly not in Europe,” Hoppe said. “First take a territorial approach, and evaluate, based on the budget that you’re able to allocate at this stage, where those funds should be spent. The California law actually lays out very precisely what steps you are to take in terms of evaluating the current situation and determining the points that need to be focused on.”  There are also game design tools currently available that help developers create safe spaces. The Fair Play Alliance offers the Disruption and Harms in Online Gaming Framework, a detailed and comprehensive catalogue of what we know about problematic in-game conduct today, with the goal to empower game industry with the knowledge and tools to support player well-being and foster healthier, more welcoming gaming spaces around the world.  “If you build from the ground up with the intention of creating spaces that are more welcoming to everyone, it’s really possible to do it,” Crevoshay said. “It just has to be baked in from the very beginning of the process in designing spaces.”  And despite the fact that there are regulations bearing down on developers, “you can do it just because it’s the right thing to do,” Howie said.

"game","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T23:04:15","Story of Seasons, the franchise formerly known as Harvest Moon, has long been a single-player experience, where players farm, fish, and rear animals in quiet, idyllic worlds. That’s set to change in future, with a newly-announced Story of Seasons sequel designed to support multiplayer sessions with friends.  During a recent game showcase, the Marvelous team announced two new Story of Seasons adventures. The first is a traditional farming simulator where players will farm crops, explore a sweeping world, and get to know their local town through classic gameplay.  The second game is described as ‘a Story of Seasons you can play with everyone’. While exact details of this adventure were not announced, it’s clear Marvelous has major plans for this new, multiplayer-focused title.  ‘We’ve heard our fans loud and clear, and they want to play Story of Seasons together with all their friends,’ game director Hikaru Nakano said during the company’s game showcase. ‘The concept of playing Story of Seasons together is a bold one, and a direction we haven’t taken with the series until now.’  Despite this lack of experience, there are plenty of reasons to keep an eye on the project.  Read: Video games are the new art therapy  The ability to fish, farm, and rear animals with friends is likely to attract a whole new audience to this beloved franchise, particularly given the growing popularity of the multiplayer farming genre.  Stardew Valley achieved new life and longevity when it introduced multiplayer capabilities. Animal Crossing: New Horizons brought the entire world together with its multiplayer, town-hopping functionality – which even spawned a real life chat show.  While the farming simulator genre is perfect for relaxing and spending time alone, there’s also plenty of potential in allowing players to take on cosy activities together, while building a thriving farmstead.

At Sony's latest PlayStation gaming showcase on Wednesday, the company teased a surprise new device that should be coming later this year. Called ""Project Q,"" it looks very much like a giant display fused with a DualSense controller.  The handheld, which should play all PlayStation games over Wi-Fi, has an 8-inch HD LCD screen and a controller that Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan promised will have all the features of the DualSense that's standard on the PlayStation 5.  Watch this: PlayStation Announces Project Q Gaming Handheld 04:52  The price of this screen-equipped Wi-Fi streaming handheld is unknown, and it's unclear how Sony will position this device. Is it, as a colleague noted, something like a Wii U tablet for the PS5? Is it a home-based local Wi-Fi companion for the console? Can it be used on the go? And can it essentially also double as an everyday DualSense controller with second-screen benefits, like Nintendo's Wii U once did?  According to a source that leaked the news of this handheld originally, the release date could be late November this year.  Streaming handhelds are a definite trend now, with Android devices like Logitech's G Cloud and the Razer Edge. It's unclear how or if Sony's new handheld will work offline at all, but it's clearly being pitched as a second screen and a mobile play option for the PS5. Meanwhile, the Backbone One game controller, which has a PlayStation partnership and works with phones to play PS5 games wirelessly via streaming, just announced an Android-compatible model.  A glimpse of the handheld next to the PS5 for comparison. Sony Interactive Entertainment  Sony's had a lot of pricey PlayStation 5 accessories debut this year. The PlayStation VR 2, a $550 VR headset that's tethered to the PS5 with a cable, almost seems like an opposite proposition to what Project Q offers. Sony also has the expensive DualSense Edge, a $200 customizable pro controller.  Sony's second-screen PS5 game handheld does look exciting, though the price isn't known. A screen that large could make games look great and a full-featured controller would make everything feel as responsive, possibly, as playing on the PS5 itself. Maybe, just maybe, Sony might consider a new Vita someday, too?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL3NvbnktcHJvamVjdC1xLXBzNS1nYW1lLWhhbmRoZWxkLXJldmVhbGVkLXdoYXQtd2Uta25vdy1zby1mYXIv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25ldC5jb20vZ29vZ2xlLWFtcC9uZXdzL3NvbnktcHJvamVjdC1xLXBzNS1nYW1lLWhhbmRoZWxkLXJldmVhbGVkLXdoYXQtd2Uta25vdy1zby1mYXIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-19","13:52:00","{""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T05:21:38","The Coachella Valley Firebirds didn't start fast Thursday, but they again provided fireworks at the finish in a 6-4 win over the Milwaukee Admirals to take Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals in front of 8,897 inside Acrisure Arena.  In their previous game, on May 19 versus the Calgary Wranglers, the Firebirds needed three third-period goals to force overtime. They then scored in sudden death to emerge victorious in a must-win game in front of a raging crowd on their home ice.  Six days later, again at home, Coachella Valley used a similar third-period rally to claim victory in a game that could prove to be significant.  Trailing by a goal in the final period, the Firebirds scored three times in a span of three minutes and 22 seconds. They then added a fourth, empty-net goal for good measure.  Captain Max McCormick scored the first during the Firebirds' rally to tie the game, 3-3. Fellow all-star Andrew Poturalski, who scored the overtime game-winner in the previous game to eliminate Calgary, then scored the goal that gave Coachella Valley the lead for good.  McCormick scored the next two goals to give him three in the third period for the first playoff hat trick in Firebirds' history.  ""You've got to try to not get too high and not get too low throughout the playoffs,"" McCormick said. ""It's only Game 1, so we've got to find a way to bounce back and have a big Game 2.""  The Firebirds never trailed until the third period, when the Admirals scored back-to-back goals to take a 3-2 lead that silenced the home crowd.  Firebirds head coach Dan Bylsma said that was a pivotal moment in the game.  ""I felt a little bit like we were punched in the face a little bit,"" Bylsma said. ""They got the 3-2 lead and the guys on the bench and the people in the stands were a little bit in dismay and a little bit in shock and it kind of played out that way for the next two or three or four minutes, and it was the shift by our top line that got us back in the game and got the fans back in the game with that (next) goal.""  The rally was the latest in a series of late-game heroics for this Firebirds' squad that has displayed a knack for rising to the occasion in big moments during their inaugural season in the American Hockey League. Coachella Valley scored walk-off overtime goals to win two of its previous three games before Thursday.  Then, against the Admirals, it was as if the Firebirds flipped a switch once they fell behind and quickly ran away with the game.  ""It didn't really feel like we were panicking at all,"" defenseman Jimmy Schuldt said. ""We knew that we were going to score. It was just a matter of when. We've been through all these different situations and all these types of games. We play with a calm demeanor, but we play with urgency and trust that we're going to play the right way.""  The Firebirds were 1-for-4 on the power play and 3-for-3 on the penalty kill. Coachella Valley goaltender Joey Daccord recorded 18 saves in the win.  Game 2 between the Firebirds and Admirals is Saturday inside Acrisure Arena. Puck drop is 7 p.m.  Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) will be played in Milwaukee on May 29, June 1 and 3. If the series extends beyond that, Games 6 and 7 would be at Acrisure Arena.  ""We've dealt with a lot of adversity and we've had all different types of games,"" Schuldt said. ""Some high-scoring games, some low-scoring games, so we're kind of ready for whatever the game throws at us.""  The goals  1-0, Firebirds: Tye Kartye put Coachella Valley on the board first, at the 4:14 mark, with his first goal for the Firebirds since April 23. Kartye, who missed three weeks while playing in the Stanley Cup Playoffs with the NHL’s Seattle Kraken, one-timed the puck past Yaroslav Askarov on assists from Ryker Evans and Joey Daccord.  1-1: The Admirals answered back 30 seconds later on a goal by Joakim Kemell. Adam Wilsby and Spencer Stastney assisted on the play.  2-1: On a penalty kill, Schuldt scored a short-handed goal on a breakaway that allowed the Firebirds to regain the lead at the 5:38 mark of the second period. Alexander True and Matt Tennyson assisted on the goal.  2-2: Just like in the first period, the Admirals answered back quickly. Two minutes after the Firebirds regained the lead, Milwaukee managed to get the puck on a 3-on-1 break. Admirals forward Phil Tomasino then flipped the puck past Daccord to silence the home crowd.  3-2, Admirals: Michael McCaron gave the Admirals their first lead of the game on a open look at the 1:52 mark in the third period.  3-3: McCormick evened the score with his eighth goal of the season to fire the home crowd back up. True and Tennyson assisted on the goal.  4-3, Firebirds: Poturalski added his second goal in as many games to put Coachella Valley up by a goal just 47 seconds after McCormick tied it up. Kartye and Jesper Frödén assisted on the play.  5-3: McCormick put the game away with a one-on-one goal at the 10:54 mark in the third to give the Firebirds a two-goal lead. Kole Lind assisted.  6-3: McCormick scored his third goal of the game on an empty net in the closing minutes.  6-4: Jimmy Huntington scored a meaningless goal just before the two-minute mark in the game to give Milwaukee its fourth goal of the game.  Firebirds' player of the game  McCormick gets the nod, and not just because of the three goals he scored. The 31-year-old forward from Wisconsin was also the emotional leader in the game, mixing it up with Milwaukee players and getting on his teammates at various points of the game. He was among a few players who provided a spark, not just the goals, that led the way for Coachella Valley in the final period.  McCormick leads all AHL players with 10 playoff goals this season, and he's second (behind Lind) with 18 points.  Ice nuggets  History repeats itself: If history is any indication, Game 1 of a series has been good to the Firebirds. Coachella Valley is 3-0 in Game 1s this playoff series -- all lopsided wins. In the first round they beat Tucson 5-1, in the second round they beat Colorado 6-2 and in the third round they beat Calgary 6-3.  While the Firebirds are now 4-0 in Game 1s this season, they are 0-3 in Game 2s.  ""Right now we just need to look forward to that Game 2,"" Schuldt said. ""That's something that hasn't really been going our way, so we're hoping to change that.""  Hershey evens series: In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bears blanked the Americans, 2-0, Thursday to even their best-of-seven series at one game apiece. The game was the 500th all-time between the Bears and the Americans; while the Firebirds and Admirals played in their first-ever matchup.  The winner of the series between the Bears and Americans will play the winner of the Firebirds and Admirals' series in the Calder Cup Finals.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T18:00:00","Our hero Link traipses over the rocky Sky Islands high above the kingdom of Hyrule in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Nintendo’s latest installment in the epic video game series. The knight will quickly learn to ascend through ceilings and hillsides, rewind time, and fuse objects and weapons. He’ll acquire cold weather garb and armor. But for now, our shirtless, still-weak hero enters a cave, where his sole defense from the cold is sautéing spicy peppers on a cooking pot.  It’s one of many delightful scenes from the video game that everybody at your work is probably discussing, the follow-up to 2017’s top-selling Breath of the Wild (BOTW), another game with a cooking element. You may have heard about Link’s ability to build vehicles or fuse a monster eyeball to an arrow for better accuracy, part of the action-adventure game where Link journeys through Hyrule to defeat an ultimate evil. He overcomes trials and helps characters solve problems. But for home cooks like me, the latest version of Zelda is also an encapsulation of the joy of cooking. As part of Link’s journey, he must collect ingredients and cook to survive. But I most relish the details in the game that make us pause and take in the everyday delights of preparing a hot meal—even when there may be far bigger challenges in the game (and in life).  As the peppers sizzle and dance around the pot to a cheerful percussion of clanging cookware that starts up whenever he cooks in the game, Link hums along—briefly forgetting that he is moments from freezing to death in the cave. A short, dramatic musical interlude and a sparkly poof of steam from the pot announce the meal is ready, and he cheers over his sautéed peppers as a caption explains its benefits: health restoration! Ten minutes of cold resistance! Meanwhile, I savor the enticing in-game descriptor: “The spiciness of the pepper has been broken by the heat for a sweeter taste.”  Tears upgrades a style of gaming called open-world gaming, which encourages players to explore an immersive landscape with quests, beasts, and tools to help players get around and defeat enemies. The game likewise takes its cooking elements very seriously. It offers an entire reference cookbook of ingredient combinations for dishes and elixirs to satisfy those of us who prefer guidance over improvisational cooking. Link can also conjure single-use pots to cook on the go, rather than having to batch-cook a bunch of recipes anytime he stumbles across a cooking fire, as was the case in BOTW. In the last version of Zelda, sometimes cooking got so tedious I found myself half-assing it. (Anyone who’s batch-cooked for the week on a Sunday can probably relate.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvbmFwcGV0aXQuY29tL3N0b3J5L3plbGRhLXRlYXJzLW9mLWtpbmdkb20tY29va2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T14:00:00","Corny dialogue has been part of video games almost since they have existed. From 1989’s Zero Wing spawning the decades old “All your base are belong to us” internet meme, to the clunky translations of the pre-remake Resident Evil games (“the master of unlocking”), to Skyrim’s infamous adventurer who once took an arrow to the knee and never shuts up about it, non-playable character (NPC) dialogue has rarely been exactly Shakespearean, and the frequent repetition doesn’t help. But could AI tools change that, enabling a world full of characters that respond believably when you talk to them?  In collaboration with Google, a team of researchers from Stanford have built a game demo called Smallville that integrates the AI writing tool ChatGPT. Instead of just walking into walls and setting themselves on fire like the classic Sims characters we all knew and loved, the game’s 25 characters can instead comfortably discuss topics such as local politics and composing music, pulling from ChatGPT’s enormous database.  They can also retain information from previous conversations, drawing out these discussions over two days, and referencing information that was given to them much earlier in the 48-hour simulation. The characters were even able to organise a Valentine’s Day party, after being prompted by researchers.  In about a year and a half, we could see this type of technology being used in smaller indie games, with wider adoption coming in about five years  In the arms race that is modern blockbuster gaming, where every studio wants to make the most complex, modern RPG ever, the idea of NPCs having nuanced ongoing conversations over a period of months in the background could have the most ambitious publishers salivating – and cash-strapped indie devs eyeing up a tantalising way to cut development costs.  One of the key researchers on the Stanford project, Joon Sung Park, a PhD student computer scientist, thinks that, as speculative as some of this seems right now, real-world implementation could be coming sooner than expected: in about a year and a half, he predicts, we could see this type of technology being used in smaller indie games, with wider adoption coming in about five years. It’s unlikely that you’d be talking to a language model such as ChatGPT directly, as this type of integration costs a lot of money at present. Indie developers may instead use this approach to create much wider and more varied conversations during development. “Within 10 years I think this approach could be very common, if this is what people in the industry want, and if people find these types of interactions interesting. And then in the 20 to 30-year timescale, maybe we can run really large-scale simulations,” he says.  He took an arrow in the knee … the infamous Skyrim guard who became a meme. Photograph: Bethesda  Joon hopes that rather than replacing game writers, this type of AI integration would change their position within game development. He compares the potential future role of video game writers to the TV series Westworld, in which scientists created a collection of biomechanical robots and a human-made world based on the old west, but once created, the characters were free to do as they please (with some restrictions), and form their own narratives within their simulated cage.  Though the technology isn’t anywhere near as advanced as that used in Smallville, Ubisoft, the multibillion-dollar company behind franchises such as Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, announced in March that it was set to start implementing AI into its game writing. The publisher highlighted that the technology will just be used for writing what are known as “barks” – canned phrases or sounds made by NPCs during gameplay.  It always sounds like the dawn of a new age, but tends to end up being disruptive and demoralising  But claims from the likes of Ubisoft and Stanford researchers that AI-generated writing will supplement rather than replace human efforts don’t seem to have done much to soothe the fears of games industry writers.  Ed Stern, a lead narrative designer at UK studio Splash Damage, says that the general reaction from game writers and narrative designers to AI-generated dialogue “is strongly negative”.  “As a trade, we’ve learned to be suspicious of claims of fancy new tech that can do everything we do cheaper, faster, better,” he explained. “It always sounds like the dawn of a new age, but tends to end up being disruptive and demoralising without actually saving time or money or increasing quality.”  Stern said the industry reaction is “pretty much the same” as game concept artists’ to AI art generators. “We’ve all heard horror stories of bosses who genuinely don’t get why they can’t just fire the coders, artists and animators – let alone the writers – and replace us all with AI tools,” he said. “Good bosses know the difference between good work and derivative copypasta, but it’s a slope that needs no greasing as far as developers are concerned.”  Walking into walls and setting themselves on fire … old-school NPCs in The Sims  Stern, who has worked on games such as Gears Tactics and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, feels writers often aren’t afforded appropriate respect for their work, compared with coders and other technical staff. There is a mindset, he thinks, that says: “Not everyone can code or draw or animate, but everybody knows the alphabet. How hard could words be?”  He points out that you still need a human to check every line of a game’s dialogue before release, as well as to record, edit, implement and test it – all time-consuming processes. Stern also points to accidental plagiarism as a potential problem, as “large language models” such as ChatGPT are trained using vast swathes of data taken from the internet.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Free weekly newsletter Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It seems to all be in place, but there is no soul in it  For some developers, even if incorporating AI could make economic sense in future, it’s a compromise they are not willing to make artistically. Artem Koblov, creative director at indie developer Perelesoq Studios, has been actively trying to incorporate AI into his own company’s development process for some time, but wasn’t pleased with the results. “If an AI can predict your game’s script, then your game’s script is not good enough,” he says.  “The text always somehow feels shallow. There’s no depth, no subtext, no nuances and insight. It seems to all be in place, but there is no soul in it … Writers put their soul into even small descriptive text, or ‘flavour text’,” he says, referring to the in-game item descriptions and books that add richness to virtual fantasy worlds. “These phrases can make the player unwittingly smile, and improve the overall impression and atmosphere of the game. They can really represent a meaningful part of the experience.”  Stern echoes Koblov’s quality concerns: “At the AAA end of the industry, there’s an expectation of quality, and the indie audience really values handmade artisanal craft,” he says. But he does admit that “for lots of games, people just don’t care as much”, pointing towards the more commercially driven mobile sector, where very small teams are often working on tight budgets and deadlines, and competition is ferocious.  Stern and Koblov both wanted to highlight that the writing process itself is a very small part of the immense expense involved in game development. “Writers are cheap,” Stern explains. “You’ve got hundreds of staff working for two or three years: coders, artists, animators, system designers, QA, producers, managers … a handful of writers, usually only brought in for a few weeks or months? That’s a fleabite.”  Character behaviour in the Smallville demo. Photograph: Joon Sung Park  The simulation technology outlined in Stanford’s study isn’t exactly cheap, either. The simulation, which lasted just 48 hours, used around $5,000 of GPT tokens. Stern also wonders if some studios’ tech-related announcements are primarily aimed at shareholders who like hearing buzzwords they recognise: “There’s a bandwagon, and it looks bad if they’re not jumping on it. It tends not to be game devs who are demanding this tech.”  Joon feels that it is important not to downplay the danger of blending creative AI and gaming. The GPT engine is programmed not to say anything offensive, though people have certainly dedicated plenty of time to coaxing it into saying something racist or politically divisive. But “if your aim is to achieve believability,” Joon points out, “conflict and feuds are also a part of believable human life”. There is a possibility that sufficiently advanced AI-powered game characters could say something out of turn, offensive or cruel. “It’s a bit of a balancing act where you want the game to be believable, to give players compelling interactions and opportunities, but also make sure it’s safe enough.”  It may seem that creative AI could be capable of helping game studios produce superior – or at least larger – gaming experiences, and it could be happening sooner than anyone expects. But for writers, a bigger, cheaper game doesn’t put food on the table. Fears about AI replacing human jobs aren’t unique to video games, but this is a mammoth industry filled with expensive moving parts – and writers, who never felt particularly powerful in the first place, have justified fears.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9nYW1lcy8yMDIzL21heS8yNS9jb3VsZC1haS13cml0ZS1zdXBlci1pbnRlbGxpZ2VudC12aWRlby1nYW1lLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtc3RhbmZvcmQtc21hbGx2aWxsZdIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9nYW1lcy8yMDIzL21heS8yNS9jb3VsZC1haS13cml0ZS1zdXBlci1pbnRlbGxpZ2VudC12aWRlby1nYW1lLWNoYXJhY3RlcnMtc3RhbmZvcmQtc21hbGx2aWxsZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Dallas had Game 7 on home ice against the Seattle Kraken and played some of their best hockey of the postseason. Dallas found a fine line between intensity and calm and controlled the game enroute to a methodical 2-1 win. They would like to do the same thing on Thursday to keep their season alive.  The great thing about playing 16 playoff games is you have a lot of experience to fall back on.  ""Any time you're in an elimination game, regardless of what the series is at, it's all about your response,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. ""I think desperation is almost an automatic, but it has to be controlled desperation and focused desperation. The nice thing is we've been through an elimination game and responded well and I expect the same thing here tonight.""  Video: DeBoer on Gardner and Borque being called up  The Stars have a daunting task trying to win four games in a row, but it starts with winning one. DeBoer quoted the old adage of eating an elephant one bite at a time, which definitely applies here. The players say then understand they have to keep their focus short-term and not get overwhelmed by the bigger mountain.  ""We know we have a good team,"" said defenseman Ryan Suter. ""To know that we have the game within us, we can show up and be our best tonight.""  Video: Ryan Suter on relying on the team game  The Stars in Game 7 battled through a 0-0 game more than 30 minutes before finally taking the lead against Seattle, and that's a great lesson for the team. Vegas has played very well and Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill is coming off a shutout, so there could be the need for patience on Thursday. But it seems Dallas can find that place.  ""We made big mistakes last game that we know we can fix,"" said forward Jason Robertson. ""We have a lot of veterans on this team, a lot of energy. We've had to respond all year.""  Video: Robertson on the Inconsistency this Postseason  Dallas has often played its best game after a bad one. Game 7 came on the heels of a 6-3 loss in Game 6. The Stars also responded to a 5-1 loss to Minnesota with three straight wins and then rebounded from a 7-2 loss to Seattle with two straight wins. That's been a huge aspect that has helped get Dallas to the Western Conference Final.  ""We're just worried about trying to get our first win in this series,"" forward Max Domi said. ""That's all that matters. Obviously, we're going to have to play some desperate hockey now with our lives at stake here. I'm looking forward to it. This group has always answered when our backs are against the wall. It should be no different [in Game 4].""  Video: Max Domi on the Confidence in the Locker Room  Jamie Benn is out for two games after being suspended for a crosscheck in Game 3. Evgenii Dadonov is out with a lower body injury. That means the lineup will change.  At the morning skate, rookie Wyatt Johnston (who had been centering Benn and Dadonov) was on a line with Tyler Seguin and Mason Marchment. Domi then was centering Joel Kiviranta and Ty Dellandrea. Luke Glendening, who was a healthy scratch in Game 3, is expected back in the lineup, and Fredrik Olofsson could also jump in. The Stars called up Mavrik Bourque and Rhett Gardner from the AHL, so those two are also options. Olofsson played 28 NHL games this season and has been with Dallas throughout the playoffs. Bourque had 47 points (29 goals, 27 assists) in 70 games with the Texas Stars, while Gardener had 40 points (10 goals, 30 assists) in 71 games in the AHL. Gardner also had 8 points (4 goals, 4 assists) in the playoffs for Texas.  Bourque has played no NHL games, while Gardner has played 40.  ""The question becomes are you better putting a young guy in for his potentially first NHL game in a situation like this or are you going to go with someone who has been on the road with us the whole time,"" DeBoer said. ""The easy answer is whoever gives you the best chance to win.""  Video: DeBoer on Focusing on the Next Game  Bottom line, the team will have to make adjustments and find a way to get good chemistry with new lines. The group of defensemen are expected to stay the same and Jake Oettinger will be in net again.

Trailing 5-4 in the middle of the sixth, the Jayhawks were going toe-to-toe with the fourth-seeded Horned Frogs. But TCU (35-22) scored five runs on four hits, including a two-run homer to take a 10-4 lead, before adding one more in the seventh and three in the eighth to secure a run-rule victory.  The Jayhawks (25-31) dropped to 1-1 in Big 12 Championship play and will now play Kansas State (34-23) in the Dillons Sunflower Showdown on Friday in an elimination game. First pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m. CT.  “We’ll be back tomorrow, ready to go,” Coach Dan Fitzgerald said. “I just told the guys after the game that we don’t have the luxury to spend a lot of time on this one. Let’s get our minds right and be ready to compete tomorrow. Thankfully, we’ve approached every game with that end of the season mentality of this is the only game we’re promised. These guys will bounce back, and we’ll fight tomorrow. I have zero questions about that.”  For the second straight day, Kansas got on the scoreboard first. Mike Koszewski started the game with an 11-pitch walk to get a man on base to start. After a strikeout, Kodey Shojinaga singled through the right side to move Koszewski to third and put runners on the corners. A hit by pitch then loaded the bases for Michael Brooks, who lifted a sacrifice fly to left to plate Koszewski and make it 1-0.  TCU responded in the bottom half of the inning, however. The Horned Frogs scored three runs off a single and triple to take a 3-1 lead after the first.  The Jayhawks got it to within one in the second, thanks to a 400-foot home run from Luke Leto. Kansas then tied the game an inning later when Cole Elvis doubled with two outs to score Janson Reeder and knot the game at three apiece.  The Horned Frogs responded with a pair of runs in the bottom half, though, to regain the lead at 5-3. Kansas chipped away in the sixth inning when Jake English homered to left to make it 5-4 for his ninth home run of the season.  But TCU had its answer in the bottom half with its five-run frame and then cruised from there.  Reeder and Koszewski both had two-hit nights for the Jayhawks, while Leto and English both went deep. Elvis hit his team-high-tying 16th double in the loss.

Three-pointers threaten to make it go the distance.  The Boston Celtics found their way to the NBA Finals last year with a stingy, opportunistic defense and a steady cascade of three-pointers. It would appear they have captured that combination once again to keep their hopes of a second appearance alive.  Disorganized and distracted four days ago, the Celtics have climbed out of a 3-0 hole with two consecutive wins over the Miami Heat, forcing a Game 6 in South Florida on Saturday.  Final score: 110-97. The Celtics wasted no time building a double-digit lead. They led by 15 at the end of the first quarter and the margin remained 15 or better in the second half until the waning minutes.  The Celtics made 9 of 20 three-pointers in the second half of Game 4 to avoid a sweep and bounce back from a six-point halftime deficit. They also feasted on nine second-half Miami turnovers, committing only two themselves.  Rinse, repeat in Game 5. Starting with Bam Adebayo on the game's first possession, the Heat turned the ball over five times in the first seven minutes, gifting Boston 10 points off of them. The Celtics, meanwhile, maintained their long-range sharp shooting, hitting 8 of their first 13 3s.  It is the first time the Heat have lost two games in a row this postseason and the recipe for their downfall was identical in both losses: copious turnovers and woeful three-point shooting. Taking care of the ball and punishing the Celtics from deep, conversely, is what they rode to that 3-0 best-of-seven series start.  ADVERTISEMENT  With Gabe Vincent unavailable after spraining his ankle late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, coach Erik Spoelstra had to start 37-year-old Kyle Lowry, who looked every one of his 37 years. He contributed five points, four turnovers and one assist in 30 minutes, a long way from the 17 1/2 points on 58 percent shooting that Vincent had been providing in this series.  Stat to Know: As disappointing as Lowry might've been, the ineffectiveness of the Heat's best two players, Jimmy Butler and Adebayo, was the real shocker. Butler had a quiet 14 points and a plus-minus of minus-24. Adebayo scored 16 points but had six turnovers.  Play of the Game: Al Horford rebounded the miss of a corner three-pointer by Marcus Smart, rebounded the miss of his own putback attempt and then kicked the ball back out to the perimeter, where it made the rounds until Jayson Tatum buried a three-pointer from deep, giving the Celtics an 18-5 lead.  Quote of the Game: ""We always have to stay positive knowing that we can, and we will win this series. We just have to close it out at home"" -Jimmy Butler  What's Next for the Heat: Return to the friendly confines of Kaseya Center, where they are 6-1 this postseason and hopefully will have Vincent (sprained ankle) available.  What's Next for the Celtics: They handed the Heat their first home playoff loss four days ago. If they maintain the energy and focus they've displayed in the last 96 minutes, they could become the fourth team in NBA history to force a Game 7 after starting the series 0-3.

Kyle Lowry started in Vincent's place and had five points, two rebounds, one assist and four turnovers in 30 minutes in the Heat's 110-97 loss. Miami has a 3-2 series lead.  ""It's really unfortunate,"" Vincent said after Thursday's shootaround. ""I'm a competitor. I love to compete with my guys, it's definitely the highest stakes, so I'll be here supporting them, watching them do their thing tonight.""  Vincent, who is averaging 17.5 points during the Eastern Conference finals, originally injured the ankle during the fourth quarter of Tuesday night's Game 4 loss after going up for a jumper and landing awkwardly. He is shooting 58% in the series -- and 50% from 3-point range vs. the Celtics.  Coach Erik Spoelstra said Vincent went through a workout Thursday, but the ankle is not ready for game action yet.  ""He is feeling better,"" Spoelstra said. ""Just not quite good enough to play an Eastern Conference finals game. But that's why the guys respect him so much; he was doing everything possible to try to get out there.""  Vincent is hopeful he'll be able to return if Game 6 is needed on Saturday in Miami. The Heat have a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.  He started each of Miami's first 15 playoff games and is averaging 13.1 points in the postseason -- third-best on the Heat behind Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo.  Spoelstra, speaking before Game 5, expressed confident in Lowry's increased role.  ""There's a confidence level,"" Spoelstra said of having Lowry start. ""He's brought that to the second unit. That has really helped stabilize that group. It was what we really needed and it's something that happened -- a real bonus that happened -- unfortunately because he was out for five weeks [with left knee soreness] and we had to take this step to get him back into it.  ""But he has that way. He's done that everywhere he's been -- been at his best in the biggest moments -- but he helps bring a lot of confidence and just stability to whatever unit he's playing in.""  The Heat were also again without guards Tyler Herro (hand) and Victor Oladipo (left knee).  Herro, who broke his hand in Game 1 of the playoff series vs. Milwaukee, has resumed workouts after having his brace removed.  ""There's no timetable,"" Spoelstra said Tuesday of Herro. ""He does have the brace off, and he's able to do ballhandling and some shooting.""  Oladipo will miss the rest of the season with a torn patellar tendon.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-26T05:57:41","BOSTON — The Boston Celtics are halfway to history.  When they woke up Tuesday morning, the Celtics were down 3-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals. Now, it’s 3-2, and the series is heading back to Miami for what should be an intense Game 6 on Saturday (8:30 ET, TNT).  The defending Eastern Conference champs came out hot in Game 5, never trailed, and stayed alive (again) with a 110-97 victory that wasn’t that close. Boston led by at least 15 points for the entire second half … until Miami put together four straight garbage-time scores.  After a stunning first three games, Boston has looked a lot more like a No. 2 seed playing a No. 8 seed. The Celtics are still behind in this series, but given how well they’ve played over the last two games, the impossible looks a lot more likely.  “I think once we got ourselves together,” Jaylen Brown said after Game 5, “we all looked each other in the eyes and said hey, we’re not going out like this.”  Here are some notes, quotes, numbers and film from a game that made the Celtics just the 15th team (of 151 candidates) in NBA history to force a Game 6 after trailing 3-0.  1. So this is the team that ranked second defensively  They say that defense wins championships. And in turning a 3-0 series into a 3-2 series, the Celtics have played championship-level defense. Game 4 was the Heat’s least efficient offensive game of the postseason (18 total games, including the AT&T Play-In Tournament). And Game 5, when you subtract their nine garbage-time points, was nearly as inefficient (87 points on 81 possessions).  Miami was missing Gabe Vincent, who averaged 17.5 points on 58% shooting (including 11-for-22 from 3-point range) over the first four games and turned his left ankle in the fourth quarter of Game 4. But the Celtics were largely responsible for their opponents’ struggles.  “Their activity level has gone up the last two games,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, “and that’s what you have to expect in a competitive playoff series.”  The Celtics weren’t terrible defensively through the the first three games. They were good enough to force the Heat into a lot of late-clock situations. Through Game 4, Miami had taken *29% of its shots in the last seven seconds of the shot clock.  * That’s much higher than the highest regular-season rate for any team (24% – Philadelphia) and more than double the Celtics’ rate through the first four games (14%).  Game 5 was more of the same, plus a reduction in 3-point volume and a whole lot of turnovers. The Heat’s 23 3-point attempts were their fourth fewest in a game this season, and their fewest since before the All-Star break. Their 16 turnover weren’t their most in the playoffs, but their 13 live-ball turnovers (all committed in the first three quarters) were tied for their second most in a game this season (100 total games). Live-ball turnovers, of course, create transition opportunities, which make the Celtics’ own offense a lot easier.  The Celtics managed to apply pressure on the perimeter, while not getting taken advantage of in the paint. The Heat ranked 25th offensively in the regular season, but they’re never easy to defend.  “Those guys, they play at an incredible pace,” Brown said. “The pace they play at is kind of similar to the Warriors. They sprint to their spots. They sprint off screens. They find those pockets. They relocate. You can’t blink because they’ll relocate, you’ll lose a shooter for a three, so you’ve got to be disciplined. You’ve got to be sound, you’ve got to chase those guys, because all night they’re going to be running. You’ve got to bring your track shoes.”  The Celtics are now 4-0 when facing elimination in these playoffs, having allowed just 100.3 points per 100 possessions over those four games. That is elite defense … that hasn’t been there when their season hasn’t been on the line.  2. Heat’s big two come up empty  The Heat do have a guy who can beat great defense with great offense. But Jimmy Butler had a quiet night, scoring just 14 points (his lowest total of the playoffs) on 5-for-10 shooting. He was just 2-for-5 in the paint and attempted just six free throws.  According to Second Spectrum tracking, Butler had just three isolations on Thursday after averaging 18.3 through the first four games. He continued to attack Derrick White, but White held his own enough to keep that from being a adjustment-needed matchup …  “Our offense was disjointed a little bit,” Spoelstra said when asked about Butler’s lack of offense. “We weren’t able to initiate our offense, get the ball where we needed it to go in spots where you could operate. If we can get Jimmy in his comfort zones and strength zones more consistently, he’ll be just fine.”  Bam Adebayo couldn’t pick up the slack, scoring just 16 points on 8-for-15 shooting. He’s not a scorer like Butler and he did have a flurry of points off the catch and in transition when the Heat scored on six straight possessions midway through the third quarter. But when Adebayo was asked to handle the ball, the Celtics attacked, and he committed six of his team’s 16 turnovers.  “You have to give them credit for the activity,” Spoelstra said. “They jammed us up several times in the paint with quick hands, strip-downs, things of that nature. We have to shore that up. That’s two games in a row of that. We do have to be aggressive and then make the appropriate plays with appropriate spacing.  3. Making the right reads, Part II  Through the first four games, Brown was shooting just 39%, including 3-for-25 from 3-point range. And he didn’t get off to a good start in Game 5, airballing his first shot attempt and going 1-for-4 in the first quarter. Fortunately for the Celtics, he turned it around after that, finishing with 21 points on 9-for-18, making as many 3s in the first 15 minutes of Game 5 (3-for-4) as he had in Games 1-4 combined.  More important was that both Brown and Jayson Tatum continued to make good reads instead of taking bad shots …  The Celtics have definitely played harder on defense over the last two games of this series, but they’ve also figured out how to best attack the Miami defense.  “The last two games we’re getting the advantage quick,” Boston coach Joe Mazzulla said, “and then the two-on-ones are there, and then we’re reading the two-on-one. When we play fast but organized, that’s when we’re at our best.”  “You know exactly where to attack,” Brown said. “You know exactly where to take advantage of your matchups and kind of allows an aggressiveness to level out, and that’s what Miami wants to do. They want to really get after you on defense. They want to put you in bad spots. They want to really be aggressive on the ball, and as we’ve taken our time and being patient and seeing the game, the game is starting to come to us.”  The results are a more egalitarian offense. Tatum is an elite scorer and Brown can make tough shots, but the Celtics are at their best offensively when the ball is moving, seams are being attacked, and everybody’s getting good looks.  Tatum finished with 11 assists, tied for the third most in his career (532 total games). And he created more buckets than that, attacking the weak spots in the Miami defense and getting off the ball when he saw a second defender …  Of course, it helps when the other guys make shots. And in Game 5, White and Marcus Smart were a combined 10-for-14 from 3-point range, each scoring more points than their two All-NBA teammates.  “It’s a long series,” Tatum said, “and you’re going to need big games from different guys at different points of a series. That’s why it’s a team sport. You need everybody at some point to come up big, and Smart and D-White is the reason we won tonight. Those two guys, their ability to hit shots tonight, spread out the defense, and then making plays on the defensive end.”  4. Good for both offenses  On the “hockey assist” from Tatum above, the soft spot in the Miami defense was Kevin Love. At times, it was Cody Zeller, who got absolutely torched by Tatum in the pick-and-roll on two straight possessions (one, two) late in the first quarter. (Zeller can at least say that he’s got something in common with Kia MVP Joel Embiid: In the last game each played, neither could contain Tatum.)  Other times, the weak spot was Duncan Robinson. And as is the case almost every time he plays, it’s good to ask which offense is happier to have Robinson on the floor?  The Heat tried to hide Robinson in their zone defense, which they played for most of the second and fourth quarters. But he even had trouble there, picking up five fouls in his 28 minutes.  Still, Robinson was terrific offensively on Thursday, scoring a team-high 18 points on 7-for-10 shooting. And only two of those seven field goals came from beyond the arc. As noted, the Celtics ran the Heat off the 3-point line, but Robinson was able to score inside. He even drove past Al Horford on a fourth-quarter isolation.  Robinson has been scaring the bleep out of opposing defenses with his movement and 3-point shooting since the last time (2020) the Heat went to the Finals. But he took 88% of his shots from 3-point range that year and he’s now evolving into more of a dual threat, able to put the ball on the floor and score inside the arc.  “Two or three years ago, everybody was pretty committed to getting him off the three-point line,” Spoelstra said before Game 5. “He had to work on different ways to still help our offense, which he always does.”  5. Two down …  The Celtics were the much better team in the regular season, and they’ve been the much better team over the last two games. They certainly have the ability to win any game that these two teams play, and they probably should win any game that these two teams play.  This was just the third team in the 27 seasons for which we have play-by-play data to rank in the top two on both ends of the floor. The other two — the 2014-15 and ’16-17 Warriors — won the championship. The Heat, meanwhile, had the worst regular-season winning percentage of the 151 teams that have held a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven series.  Yes, the Celtics can do this … as long as they can keep their foot on the gas.  Having the chance to make NBA history and reach the Finals should certainly be enough of a carrot to keep them focused for another 96 minutes of basketball. They’ve played great defense every time their season has been on the line.  But playing hard consistently has been an issue for the Celtics for most of the season, and bad habits can come back to bite you at the wrong time. Shouldn’t Games 1-3 of the conference finals been important enough to play this hard?  The Celtics are halfway to history, but Game 6 in Miami should be the toughest of the four games to get.  * * *  John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

"game","2023-04-20","Not Discerned","{""SaoPaulo"", ""SaoPaulo"", ""Brazil""}","2023-05-25T09:30:00","Brazilians have reacted with horror to the news that a mobile phone game in which players were able to buy and sell enslaved people was until recently available to download on Google Play.  Dubbed the “Slavery Simulator” (Simulador de Escravidão), the disturbing game also allowed players to inflict different forms of torture on black characters.  The game, which had no age classification, had reportedly been available since 20 April this year and had been downloaded more than one thousand times. Users reviewed the game positively, with one describing it as “excellent to pass the time but lacking more torture options”.  The game was removed from the Google Play store on Wednesday but remained available to those who had already downloaded it, the newspaper Folha de S Paulo reported.  The existence of a game making light of slavery was met with outrage and disgust by Brazilians, who denounced it as racist and called on the developer Magnus Games and Google to be held to account.  “Blatant racism!! […] The image illustrating the game has a white man surrounded by black men. It is absurdly violent. Google and the developer must answer for this crime of hatred and racism,” tweeted Renata Souza, a black activist and politician from Rio de Janeiro.  “Racism is not entertainment, it’s a crime!” denounced Quilombo Periférico, a collective mandate of black city councillors in São Paulo.  Racism is an enduring problem in Brazil, which is still coming to terms with the legacy of slavery. The country imported the highest number of enslaved Africans in the Americas – an estimated 4 million – and was also the last in the region to abolish slavery, in 1888.  “At any time your black child could come across a game in which they are reduced to enslavement, and if your child is white, they will be taught through recreational racism to become an enslaver in real life,” said Bruno Cândido, a black lawyer who teaches anti-discriminatory law.  Brazil’s ministry for racial equality said it had contacted the developer and Google to work with them on measures to curb racist content online.

The Orioles are now 13-3 in series-opening games. They actually did not lose either of the first two series where they lost the first game. Tampa Bay beat the Orioles 3-0 May 8 in Baltimore in the series opener, but the Orioles took the series, winning the next two games. They also lost the opener 9-5 on May 15 to the Los Angeles Angeles, but won the next two games of that set and split a four-game series.  The Yankees (30-20) have won seven of their last eight games, nine of their last 11 games and 12 of the last 15 games. Tuesday’s victory marked their fourth walk-off win this season (also 4/19 vs. Los Angeles-AL, 4/22 vs. Toronto and 5/3 vs. Cleveland). They improved to 4-2 in extra-inning games, and each of their last three wins have been come-from-behind wins.  They have won a season-high five straight games to mark their longest winning streak since a seven-game run from Sept. 18-25, 2022. New York is a season-high 10 games over .500.

The Orioles (31-17) remain three games behind Tampa Bay for first-place in the American League East. Overall, they have won three of their past four, five of seven, nine of 13, 14 of 22 and 22 of the last 32 games. They are 16-9 on the road and 9-7 in games within the AL East.  The Orioles have scored five or more runs in each of their last five games and in seven of their last eight games. They are 1-3 versus the Yankees this season and 8-15 since the beginning of 2022. Baltimore is now 3-3 in extra-inning games and 9-6 in one-run games.  With last night's loss, they fell to 27-2 this year when leading after eight innings.

Rutschman has hit hit safely in his last six games against New York and in 11 of his 13 games.  Center fielder Cedric Mullins went 1-for-4 with a walk and solo homer last night, hitting No. 8. He has a six-game hitting streak, batting .435 (10-for-23) with four runs, four doubles, two homers and six RBIs over that stretch.

The Eagles, 29-0 and ranked No. 2 in the nation by maxpreps.com, were simply too much for the Panthers Wednesday, with hard-throwing junior pitcher Jayden Dubanewicz (a Florida commit), and a host of hard-hitting players.  Douglas, in fact, has now won three straight state titles and 51 consecutive games dating back to last season.  “We played a very good team and, like a few other teams who have played them, no one has slayed that dragon,” Plant coach Dennis Braun said. “(Douglas) also played very well (Wednesday).”  Braun said he didn’t see any flatness from his team after its highly emotional 5-4, come-from-behind victory over Park Vista just one night earlier.  “I didn’t see anything that indicated we had a letdown or anything,” Braun said. “There were some things we could have done a little better.”  Douglas jumped on Plant (21-8) right away with three runs in the first inning on two doubles and two singles.  The Eagles added four more runs in the fourth on a triple, a double, two walks and a single. The momentum was completely on the Eagles’ side, especially with Dubanewicz dealing his 90-plus mph live fastball.  “He’s definitely one of the best arms we’ve seen this year,” Braun said. “He’s certainly right up there.”  Plant scratched out just one hit and had only one other runner reach base (on an error,) while Douglas, which came in averaging eight runs per game, collected 10 hits.  For Plant, which made the state semifinals last season, it marked the first time since 2009 that it reached a championship game in baseball. The Panthers were going for their second state title in school history, the first coming in 1988.  Plant surprised a lot of people this season by reaching the final after finishing as a district runner-up to Alonso. From there, however, the Panthers were outstanding in defeating Sarasota 14-2, Lakewood Ranch 7-0, Windermere 1-0 and Park Vista 5-4.  “We have every reason to be proud of our season,” Braun said. “I am very proud of our guys and how they handled themselves.

Of course, Sony Bend is making a new IP now that the platform holder rejected its plans for a Days Gone 2.  Ross' full tweet reads: ""I get a little bummed out from these PlayStation Showcase shows because they only remind me we could of had Days Gone 2 out a month ago if we'd have just stuck to our guns.""  Had this been the case, it would have given a Days Gone sequel a roughly four-year development cycle, with the original game releasing in April 2019. As such, you'd have to imagine it would be a follow-up built largely on the foundations of Days Gone, but with some key gameplay improvements. For example, Jeff Ross has in the past described Days Gone 2 as the ""definitive version"" of the game, with better animal AI and the ability to swim.  ""I would add more systems,"" he said in an interview last year. ""Systems are very simple. And if they’re simple, they can be elegant and very rich for the player. I knew adding one or two more layers to the systemic elements of it would have been something that we could have wrapped our heads around, it would have led to a ton of richness for the players and a ton of unique open-world moments and responses that we haven’t seen before. Let’s sink our teeth into this and do something even more epic.""  A Days Gone 2 released in 2023 would definitely have boosted Sony's plans for the year, with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Helldivers 2 currently slated for the next six months.

It included heavy hitters such as Spider-Man 2 and the long-awaited Alan Wake 2 (you can check out that trailer right here), but it also featured a sequel that took many of us by surprise: Helldivers 2. Those among us, such as myself, who were unfamiliar with this franchise until today would be forgiven for thinking this looked like a big, AAA Starship Troopers video game because it absolutely does. That is absolutely a compliment. Take a look.  If that doesn’t give some extremely hardcore Starship Troopers vibes, I don’t know what does. I was half expecting Casper Van Dien to show up as Rico. Worthy of Paul Verhoeven, dare I say. Admittedly, I was unfamiliar with the original Helldivers, which came out in 2015. Coming at this blind, I was amazed that this wasn’t based on the source material in question. The timing is also interesting, as another video game, Starship Troopers: Extermination, recently hit early access on Steam. In any event, Helldivers 2 looks like an absolute blast.  The game sees players working in squads to take out massive, bug-like alien threats across various planets. It is being developed by the folks at Arrowhead Games Studios, who were also behind the original. It is described as a “heart-pounding, high-intensity, friendly-fire-enabled feast of cooperative destruction!” Players will again assume the role of galactic peacekeepers and soldiers on behalf of Super Earth. Johan Pilestedt, CEO and Game Director at Arrowhead had this to say about it:  “I’m ecstatic to finally reveal the project we’ve devoted ourselves to over the past few years. Our team’s achievements in this time have been a source of immense pride. Whether you’re a seasoned player of the original game or a newcomer to the Helldivers universe, I can’t wait for you to dive into our tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a totalitarian regime. Brace yourselves for adrenaline-fueled moments, intense action, and a bond that forms when you rely on your team to complete missions or comically fail due to the reckless handling of over-the-top firepower. Most importantly, we hope that the laughter we share in the studio while playing the game will resonate with you as you enjoy this crazy universe.”  One potential downside is that this game will require an internet connection, which is becoming increasingly common. So don’t expect to have this on standby on days when your internet suddenly goes down. The good news is that it will also be available on PC as well as the PlayStation 5, so people such as myself who have a Steam Deck can get in on the action as well.  Helldivers 2 arrives later this year, but no specific release date has been announced just yet.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhbmdvcmlhLmNvbS9vcmlnaW5hbC9oZWxsZGl2ZXJzLTItbG9va3MtbGlrZS10aGUtc3RhcnNoaXAtdHJvb3BlcnMtZ2FtZS1vZi1vdXItZHJlYW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Crime Stoppers  Darel King was charged on Monday in connection to that 2019 armed robbery and murder, according to recently unsealed court documents.  An affidavit supporting King's arrest, written by Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives Special Agent Dustin Hurt, did not identify the victim.  However, Hurt's narrative precisely matches publicly disclosed circumstances of Guthridge's slaying, down to the date, time on the clock and block — Kent Street near Seymour Avenue — where the fatal shooting took place.  An anonymous caller claimed to have been remotely playing an online Playstation 4 basketball game with the victim at the time of the murder, and that audio of the slaying had been recorded by the game.  ""We heard all the arguments, and further gun shots,"" the tipster told investigators, according to the affidavit. ""I hope this video helps.""  The recording, given to investigators by the tipster, picked up the dispute between victim and killer, according to Hurt, who transcribed the suspect's demands for cash and ""bows,"" slang for a package of marijuana.  ""Don't move. Talk quick. Where is the money at? You got thirty seconds bro,"" the suspect said, according to the the affidavit transcription.  ""I have been sitting outside your house since earlier, man. Where the f---ing money at? You got thirty seconds. Think I'm playing?

A short time later, the agent said he heard 12 gunshots on the recording, according to the court document.  King had already been on investigators' radar for this slaying and witnesses identified his voice as the man shouting commands on the PlayStation recording, according to Hurt.  The case is being pursued by the U.S. Attorney's Office because a robbery involving drugs exposed King to federal statues governing violent actions in the context of interstate commerce, an agency spokesperson said.  King is being held without bail and his next court date is set for June 5.

"game","2017-10-26","Not Discerned","{""Kyoto"", ""Kyoto"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-24T18:30:08","It’s a god game with the patina of a ronin story that makes you wonder, This is good, but is this as good as it gets? Photo: Nintendo  The legend began in a cave. Before his knack for billion-dollar ideas helped make Nintendo a titan in gaming, Shigeru Miyamoto, designer, producer, and director, grew up in postwar Kyoto Prefecture, close to the city but closer to verdant hills and serene forests. Without a television, he filled his days with books, art, and excursions into nature, including one that led him to a dark opening in the countryside, as he recalls in David Sheff’s Game Over: How Nintendo Conquered the World. When Miyamoto returned to explore it with a lantern, he found a second passageway inside the first. The memory of the cave and his youthful taste for discovery inspired the work that later made him an international celebrity: the colorful worlds traversed over countless incarnations of Super Mario Brothers, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda, games that rewarded a keen eye with the thrill of uncovering secrets and that turned friend groups in neighborhoods and schools into informal tip networks invested in a better understanding of Miyamoto’s creations.  The Legend of Zelda added the gilded veneer of myth to the designer’s travels, putting players in the green tunic of Link, the silent elfin protagonist and uniter of peoples, dimensions, and timelines. The directors and mechanics have changed over the years, but the rhythm of Zelda games — the balance of convention and invention, the expanding and contracting ambitions of the franchise — has beat steadily for decades. A universally beloved installment would come out, and the next one would push the envelope. 1986’s The Legend of Zelda dropped players into an unfamiliar landscape of hidden passageways and intriguing caves, then 1987’s The Adventure of Link served players brutally difficult side-scrolling combat. 1991’s A Link to the Past offered a window into the destruction of Hyrule (a few years before Final Fantasy VI let its villain scorch the planet), then in 1993’s Link’s Awakening, you woke up on an unrelated island inhabited by characters inspired by Twin Peaks. 1998’s Ocarina of Time married gorgeous 3-D graphics, tight combat, and rich commentary on growth and decay, then 1999’s Majora’s Mask dove into comedy horror, science fiction, and rural absurdism. (That game has its fans, but others received it as if they were being shown Groundhog Day after buying a ticket for Back to the Future Part II). The whiplash of the dark themes and art style of 2006’s Twilight Princess following the seafaring cartoon quest of 2002’s The Wind Waker typified ’90s and aughts director Eiji Aonuma’s long tug-of-war with the fandom.  But on Switch, Zelda is breaking patterns. In 2011, Skyward Sword introduced director Hidemaro Fujibayashi (Oracle of Seasons and Ages; Four Swords; The Minish Cap) to the main series with an origin story that takes Link to the skies, soaring on a paraglider that opened up Wii gameplay as dramatically as Ocarina’s 3-D makeover. But rather than ditch the conventions of the previous installment, 2017’s Breath of the Wild built on the high-flying challenges of Skyward, presenting a vast, brutal, beautiful Hyrule on the newly released Switch, stuffed with unique puzzles, terrifying encounters, and arresting scenery. This month, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Fujibayashi’s follow-up to a massive hit, defies Zelda tradition yet again, daring to pick up directly with the world and story of the previous game, a rarity in a series with a relative aversion to direct sequels. In Tears of the Kingdom, everything is where it was, but nothing’s quite the same. The villain Ganon has been stopped, Princess Zelda has devoted her life to education and archaeology, and the people you met in scattered settlements and principalities are working to put their lives back together… until a disturbance nudges Link toward a second journey around Hyrule, one that sparks revelations about the region’s past, future, and geography. The deeper you get into the game — up into the Sky Islands or down into caves — the more it feels like Fujibayashi is telling a story that wraps its arms around the lore and ideas of the past two games, bookending Zelda’s millennia-spanning story with lively creation and apocalypse myths.  Fujibayashi’s Hyrule is a vast network of shrines, where you upgrade health and stamina, and temples, where you locate and defeat troublesome bosses. Several dozen hours and side quests (and shrines and two major temples) in, Tears of the Kingdom’s interest in subverting expected outcomes on the way to familiar solutions is apparent. You start the game with the Master Sword and are tempted in every subsequent prompt to wave the thing around, but the plot isn’t clear, being parceled out only after story achievements. Meanwhile, Link is suspended somewhere between boyhood, manhood, and divinity, a Hercules who lets his arms do all the talking. Everyone is happy to see the silent swordsman, eager to exchange whatever goods and currency they’ve squirreled away for the chance to escape menacing monsters or procure supplies from locations reached by sailing on the wind (or, you know, teleporting). Tears is a god game with the patina of a ronin story. The great fairies are spooked; the villages of the humanlike Hylians are modernizing faster than the local elders care for; the stone Gorons and the birdlike Rito are experiencing identity crises tied to ecological changes; Hyrule’s reporters are stressed; and players eventually become embroiled in a juicy local election. There’s a real-world resonance to it all.  You show up to Tears to work wonders — panting and struggling, perpetually boxing above your presumed weight class — that your adoring public respects but fears. Link’s (techno-organic? chrono-kinetic?) powers make most NPCs jump, but it’s not enough to stop them piling on requests that are smoothed over by the bending of time and an ability to lift heavy objects with a wave of the hand. Link unravels the mystery of the Zonai, whose ruins can be found in Breath of the Wild, aided by the tech they left behind. Replacing the previous game’s telekinetic, bomb-spawning arsenal are the Ultrahand, Recall, Ascend, and Fuse abilities. Ultrahand feels like Breath’s Magnesis but glues random things together, making you think like a builder and trivializing challenges for anyone demented enough to create contraptions that supplant the game’s intentions. Recall one-ups Stasis, running the clock back on a huge variety of moving items; with sharp reflexes, it can return a vehicle you flew off a cliff. Ascend provides an exit strategy for caves and fights and takes a bit of the edge off verticality in a game that thrives on tickling your vertigo. (Don’t go too far before tracking down the Autobuild power, which indexes Ultrahand creations for summoning so you can bring the right Zonai mech or all-terrain vehicle to the fight.)  Fuse expands your arsenal of swords, staves, and clubs dramatically, undercutting the weapon degradation that previously made players wary of gratuitous, sword-breaking enemy encounters — and if you get weird with it, the game opens up immensely. A lively imagination is your most effective tool in Tears of the Kingdom, and finding the synergy between powers, weapons, and Zonai tech is a delight. Stick a mining cart to a shield for a skateboard, or combine that shield with a rocket for a block option that shoots you into the sky. Attaching items to arrows offers a fiendish palette of status effects, adding value to Tears’ myriad collectible critters, leading you into fights you would otherwise ignore and realizing Miyamoto’s decades-old dream of bomb-arrow fusions. The way your armada of perks slowly tips the difficulty scale in your favor as you discover crueler building blocks, like cannons and time bombs, gives Tears a customizability that stands out in the series but falls in line with modern trends in gaming. And it gives great footage: The Switch’s 30-second videos are punchy enough for TikTok; the map seems dense enough for years of YouTube lore explainers.  Everything in the game seems designed for the express purpose of goading you into deeper plundering. You don’t miss the endless supply of bombs in Breath of the Wild if you spend enough time in the caves. The depths are dark and terrifying, filled with enemies that hit hard and hamper your ability to recover health; they’re also your source for currency in the game’s chilling poe exchange (as well as sturdy weapons and crafting materials). Reaching the Sky Islands is a drain on your stamina, but the Zonai battery charges and unique vegetation there come in handy everywhere else on the map. Mini-bosses drop unique fusion materials: Fasten the heart of a giant stone Talus or the core from a Flux Construct — the giant box monster — to a strong enough weapon and you become one of the most dangerous forces on any field of play. Or use the billion tactical maneuvers at your disposal, stunning the enemy with a spicy pepper to the face. The challenges inside shrines nudge you toward even more elaborate traversal tricks (Makasura Shrine outside Kakariko Village introduces the Stabilizer — power it up and it springs itself, and a number of objects you may think to attach to it, into an upright position, goading you to slingshot yourself across a large, imposing pit — while Sinakawak Shrine in the Rito domain primes you for at least six months’ worth of outrageous flying devices.) Ascending and descending to temples net you a companion you can summon to the battlefield, slyly adjusting difficulty or abetting stylish gameplay sequences, another quiet game changer in a Zelda entry brimming with them.  The freedom to jump in and out of Hyrule’s atmosphere and subterrane; a nonlinear story of style influencers, workers’-rights violations, unnatural disasters, and cultural schisms; and the hundred paths to solving miles of puzzles make for a game that will take ages to finish unpacking. So it’s a touch frustrating that Tears hovers around 30fps six years after the prior game did, and, in a decade of visual marvels like Horizon Forbidden West, its incredible draw distances come at the cost of textures that can feel dated. You’re always gazing farther afield, though, scanning for points on the map where you’ll die exquisitely, valiantly, hilariously, and embarrassingly on the way to success. Tears is tapping the ceiling of what the Switch can do, like Ghost of Tsushima left us wondering if it represented the peak of the PS4’s capabilities. This is good; is this as good as it gets? Whatever happens to the Switch, The Legend of Zelda is in a great place. Fans seem happy. Aonuma, a producer on the series since ceding the director’s chair, sounds eager to maintain the momentum. Pushing player creativity brings us into the era of sandbox survival-crafting games like Rust, No Man’s Sky, and Fortnite while embracing the lore, gear, locations, and enemies of this series’ illustrious past. Will Tears stick the landing with a story on par with Breath of the Wild? Will familiarity breed contempt for future Zelda titles patterned after these last two? Who cares? There are homing arrows, rocket skates, and treasures in grottos to get to. There are Koroks to shoot at the moon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbGVnZW5kLW9mLXplbGRhLXRlYXJzLW9mLXRoZS1raW5nZG9tLWdhbWUtcmV2aWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Shane McClanahan became the first eight-game winner in the majors and the Tampa Bay Rays rebounded from a 19-run loss to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 7-3 on Wednesday night.  McClanahan (8-0) allowed one run, four hits and struck out seven in seven innings. Tampa Bay is 10-1 when the left-hander takes the mound.  “As long as I help this team and put them in a good situation to win, that's really and truly all I care about,” McClanahan said. “Everything else will take care of itself.”  McClanahan joins Matt Moore (2013) and Charlie Morton (2019) as the only Rays pitchers to start 8-0 as Tampa Bay improved to 23-5 at home.  Luke Raley and Jose Siri homered for the major league-best Rays (36-15), who lead the big leagues with 97 homers.  Raley, a first baseman, pitched 1 2/3 innings Tuesday night in a 20-1 loss to the Blue Jays in which he allowed seven runs, including a grand slam by Vladimir Guerrero Jr.  “I rather be at the plate than on the mound,” Raley said. “It feels better to hit them than watch them go over.”  The announced crowd was a season-low 8,699. The Rays started the day averaging 17,478, which was ninth in the American League.  Toronto, which lost for the eighth time in 10 games, got a pinch-hit homer by Cavan Biggio during a two-run eighth off Jason Adam that made it 5-3.  Kevin Kelly replaced Adam with two on and got an inning-ending double play from Matt Chapman on a hard grounder to second.  Tampa Bay regained a four-run lead, at 7-3, on eighth-inning RBI singles by Siri and Wander Franco.  Blue Jays catcher Danny Jansen left in the fifth with left groin tightness.  “We'll see how he feels tomorrow,” Toronto manager John Schneider said. “We're just trying to be a little bit proactive with it. Just kind of taking it literally minute by minute right now.""  Raley and Siri hit solo homers in the second off Yusei Kikuchi (5-2) as the Rays took a 3-0 lead. Isaac Paredes had a first-inning RBI single.  McClanahan retired his first 10 batters before Bo Bichette doubled with one out in the fourth and scored on Guerrero's single. Guerrero drove in six runs Tuesday.  “He's unbelievable,” Raley said. “Every time he's out there we know we have a great chance of winning a a baseball game.”  Tampa Bay went ahead 5-1 in the fourth when Manuel Margot had a run-scoring triple and came home on Franco's single.  Franco had three hits and stole his 15th base. He stopped a career-long 12-game stretch without an RBI.  Kikuchi, who became the 11th Japanese-born to pitcher reach 100 MLB starts, gave up five runs and eight hits over five innings.  “I think just mistakes in the middle,” Schneider said. “It looked like they were kind of hunting pitches. Didn't get away with any mistakes today.”  Kikuchi had been 4-0 with a 1.80 ERA in six previous games against the Rays.  LONG WAIT  The Rays selected from Triple-A Durham former New York Yankees reliever Ben Heller, who last pitched in the majors on Sept. 4, 2020.  “There's been a lot of times in the last three years that I doubted if I've ever get another chance,” said Heller, who has been limited to 23 minor league games since a right elbow stress fracture in 2021. “Been getting a little emotional thinking about it.""

Thus, the project is already showcasing to the community what its metaverse will look like, and the integration of gameplay mechanics, testing, and the opening of all locations on the first planet are planned to be completed by the end of this year.      The GrabCoinClub team introduced the concept and popularizes a new genre of computer games, namely the Metaverse Role Playing Game (MRPG).      Anatoli Rybchin, the founder and CEO of the company, tells:  “Our project features an authentic gaming world, and the storyline is entirely created by the players.”      The protagonists of the game are FiHunters, wealth hunters on Blockchain networks. They are intelligent tigers and dragons coming from FiToria Exoplanet. FiHunters, with their ancient knowledge of wealth nature, have created 15,555 NFT artifacts that encrypt the answers to the question of ‘How to manage cash flow and gain financial freedom?’      To mine unique resources, a team of 15,555 FiHunters traveled to the blockchain planet of Polarity, where they encountered a colony of scientists from Earth who had flown in to explore blockchain possibilities and could not get back.      To help people, FiHunters are ready to transfer their knowledge to true adherents of the Play-to-Earn gaming model!”      The team chose Polygon, a second layer blockchain network with high speed and security and low transaction fees, as its home network.      Unlike its competitors, GrabCoinClub has a non-standard for Web3 projects market entry strategy and blockchain interaction architecture. The project uses three different token standards for different gaming assets.      ERC-721 NFT Tokens    The first NFT collection includes avatars of 15,555 FiHunters. By owning them, you can play as five characters in parallel and develop each one individually.      The second NFT collection is 15,555 unique artifacts that the FiHunters took with them. These include weapons and armor, spaceships, lands on the planet, pets, seven kinds of special buildings, cords and harvesters for resource extraction.      ERC-1155 SFT Tokens    ERC-1155 SFT tokens are 5 types of resources to be extracted, first-aid kits, ammo, character skins, etc. These are all in-game consumables, which the company will release constantly and regulate their quantity in the game and on the market.      ERC-20 Interchangeable Tokens    ERC-20 interchangeable tokens are the utility in-game currency called GrabClub (GC) that players can use to buy and sell in-game assets within the game and on any third-party marketplaces.    The game developer also included the option of Free-to-Play. This way players can connect to the game without authorization through MetaMask and play as space abo stuck in the colony. In Free-to-Play mode, the player can earn GC tokens without any limitations or purchases, which can later be withdrawn to a connected cryptocurrency wallet or spent on in-game assets.      However, the main surprise for the community is that after integrating all the game mechanics of the first part of the game, i.e. Planet Polarity, the management of decisions on the development of the project will go to DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, which will include the owners of the project's rare NFTs.      According to the project roadmap, the launch of game mechanics will start in the 3rd quarter of 2023. The company also plans to launch a closed social network and marketplace with access via NFT as well as list GC tokens on other cryptocurrency exchange.      The GrabCoinClub project team is public and has passed the KYC inspection, having been awarded an honorary silver badge from CertiK.

Cam Harris was 3 for 4 with a double and two RBIs and Ian Fuchs tossed six innings of four-hit baseball to lead Brock, which coasted after a five-run first inning at Abilene Christian University. The Eagles did, however, have to hold their breath in the second inning after Fuchs’ foot slipped off the first base bag while trying to beat out a throw to first.  The incident saw Fuchs fall to the ground in agony, after which his heavy limp to the Brock dugout immediately spawned activity in the Eagle bullpen. Fuchs, however, wasn’t finished. He managed to limp to the bullpen where he threw well enough to return to the game. He worked through the sixth, held Shallowater to one run and collected the win with one inning of relief help from Harris.  You need to be logged in to view the rest of the content. Please Log In .

ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout homered in the same game for the 26th time, leading the Los Angeles Angels to their fourth straight win and a sweep of the Boston Red Sox with a 7-3 victory Wednesday night.  “It’s pretty cool when we go deep twice,"" Trout said. ""Good things happen. ... (The Red Sox) beat us three out of four when we played them out there (in Boston), so it’s good to get a little sweep.”  Rookie Zach Neto hit a three-run homer during the Angels’ four-run second inning and added a double in his first three-hit game for Los Angeles, which has won six of seven overall.  The Angels' MVP duo came through in the early innings. Ohtani connected in the third for his team-leading 12th homer, taking James Paxton (1-1) to the opposite field with his fourth shot in 10 days. The pitch was 3.74 feet above the ground, making it the second-highest pitch on which Ohtani has ever homered.  “That's big power right there,"" Angels manager Phil Nevin said before referencing the overcast, cool weather patterns known as May Gray or June Gloom at this time of the year in Southern California. “The ball wasn't really carrying very well tonight, (so) to go the other way with the air the way it is right now (is impressive).”  Trout followed in the fourth with a two-run shot off Nick Pivetta, matching Ohtani's season total with his fourth homer in seven days. The three-time AL MVP also passed Joe DiMaggio with his 362nd career homer.  “You can just feel the excitement in the dugout, and how excited the fans are” when Ohtani and Trout go deep, Angels starter Tyler Anderson said.  Connor Wong homered for the Red Sox, who have lost four straight for the second time in two weeks. Masataka Yoshida doubled and scored on Enrique Hernández’s double in the fourth, but Boston has scored just four runs during its four-game skid.  “I think today was a lot better (offensively) than the last two nights,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “We took our walks and hit some balls hard. Obviously, at the end of the day it's how many runs you score, but I thought the approach was a lot better.”  Anderson (2-0) yielded five hits and one run over six innings for his first win in eight starts. The veteran left-hander had seven straight no-decisions since his debut for Los Angeles on April 2, but he improved his ERA to 3.14 in his last five starts after a rocky beginning to his Angels career.  Paxton lasted just three innings in his third start back from Tommy John surgery and a hamstring injury, yielding five runs, four hits and three walks.  “Stuff was OK,"" Cora said. “Just the command was off.”  Los Angeles went up 4-0 in the second inning on Gio Urshela's RBI flyout followed by Neto's third career homer. The 22-year-old rookie has firmly seized the starting job at shortstop since his major league debut in Boston last month, providing stellar defense and steadily improving offense.  “You can see how comfortable I'm feeling,” Neto said. “I'm about to go out there, have fun and be myself.”  UNHAPPY ANNIVERSARY  The Angels improved to 28-23 on the one-year anniversary of their final victory before the start of a franchise-record, 14-game losing streak that wrecked their previously promising 2022 season and led to manager Joe Maddon's firing.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: New starter Corey Kluber is moving to the bullpen this weekend with the imminent return of Garrett Whitlock, who has been sidelined since April 22 with an elbow injury.

The program announced Wednesday that its annual rivalry game for the Land Grant Trophy against Penn State will take place on Friday, Nov. 24 at 7:30 p.m. ET -- Black Friday -- at Ford Field in Detroit. The contest was previously scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 25 at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing, Michigan.  With the announcement of the new venue, the Spartans are now slated to play their final three regular-season games away from home. Their final game at Spartan Stadium will take place Nov. 4 against Nebraska.  ""This is a unique opportunity, for both our football program and our fan base, to play a Black Friday game at Ford Field,"" MSU athletic director Alan Haller said in a statement. ""Southeast Michigan is home to 100,000 alums, nearly 50 percent of our student body and countless more Spartan fans. Our men's basketball team has experienced tremendous support in Detroit, both at Ford Field and Little Caesars Arena, and we're excited to bring Spartan Football to our fans in the Motor City. The city is important to our mission not only as an athletic department, but our entire University. We anticipate that the experience will be so much more than a football game for our Spartan faithful.""  Despite counting as a Michigan State home game, the game at Ford Field will not be included in season ticket packages. According to the university's announcement, season ticket owners and Spartan Fund donors will be given purchasing priority when tickets are released.  ""The decision to move a home game out of Spartan Stadium was given careful consideration, as we understand the impact it will have on some fans,"" Haller said. ""As a community partner, we recognize home football brings benefits to the entire Mid-Michigan area. The fact that this game falls on a holiday weekend Friday increased our willingness (to) make the move. I believe our season ticket holders still have a strong collection of home games highlighted by Michigan and a premier non-conference game against Washington, with a total of six home games just as we had in 2021.""

"game","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T09:18:00","As the world’s most popular - and interactive - medium, gaming has the unique potential among all art forms to inspire change among users, spreading positive change and (almost literally) putting us in someone else’s shoes, letting us see the world through their eyes or experiencing a world that we, as players, have the power to influence.  A key point of activism is an attempt to inspire positive change in the world, whether that’s by raising awareness of issues that should be addressed or lobbying for governments to act, whether that be on social issues or the climate issue.  Activism is often treated seriously, but it still has the potential for joyful expression. We’ve previously highlighted the work of game makers inspiring positive change through gameplay, but what if we thought of activism as a game?  Daniel Fernández Galeote is a researcher at the Gamification Group, Tampere University. He is a journalist, game designer and developer. His current research explores public engagement with climate change and sustainability through games and gamification. Here he discusses the gamification of activism, and the surprising commonalities between game design and the power to provoke positive change.  Introduction: Activism, joy, and game design  We may assume that for an activist to exist, all we need is a perceived mismatch between what is and what “ought to be.” Although activism is typically conceptualised as being all about purpose, a goal alone may not be sufficient for many of us to engage and, perhaps more importantly, to keep on struggling. Especially when goals feel far away and moments of victory are scattered, our energy can run low and commitment may falter. This is why it is good to have multiple drives for being engaged, one of which may be joy.  Although pleasure may seem too lighthearted when our collective survival is at stake, us humans long for joyful moments of interpersonal and more-than-human connection, freedom, and accomplishment. Fortunately, activism can deliver many of these feelings, as most of those involved can attest, without having to compromise the fact that system change is a serious endeavour. Then, questions arise: how does activism provide moments of joy that effectively attract prospective participants? How do we keep ourselves active in a way that feels right for us and avoid burning out once we are ready to give it all? Can game developers recognise and augment these moments of joyful experience?  Game makers represent a collective that knows how to keep people motivated to persist through challenging journeys, and to enjoy doing so. Designers typically envision the player’s experience and craft interactive systems suited to afford such experience, which more often than not includes forms of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Through a few examples, I will illustrate how activism is more similar to games than we think, and how game professionals can contribute to designing activism in a way that supports long-lasting engagement. This is a task which activists have been working on for as long as social movements have existed.  The Rebirth event in the game Riders Republic included an in-game demonstration - the Climate March.  The activism Game: explaining the game and the meta-game  Given the ideas expressed above, it may not come as a surprise that the fight for change already incorporates multiple concepts and principles that we find in games and gamification. I have divided my examples in this regard into two categories, one with the game itself at the core of activism, taking actions which directly seek to provoke change, and the meta-game, or the social systems and activities built around, and usually supporting, action.  First, how can we call direct action a game? Forms of protest have been interpreted through playful and performative lenses before. A good example is L.M. Bogad’s book Tactical Performance, which theoretically connects and practically reviews creative practices in activism, from the civil rights movement’s carefully crafted sit-ins to the Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army’s (CIRCA) antics. Crucially, these are as much about directly engaging non-activists - from passersby, both in favour and against, to the police - as they are about giving a performance for them to witness.  Based on these examples, there is much to be gained in understanding memorable protest as a fundamentally creative, narrative, and interactive activity. While the environmental movement is full of examples such as the Red Rebel Brigade, which brings life to artfully crafted costumes in its performative rituals, there is much to gain from involving game designers into the mix. After all, performative protest has been seen in games. For example, the developers of Detroit: Become Human gave players the option to oppose violence with music, and the classic Marc Eckō's Getting Up was all about exposing corruption through graffiti.  Left, clown protestors in Frankfurt am Main, 2012. Right, the Red Rebel Brigade in Berlin, 2019.Credit: Heiko S and Leonhard Lenz.  Behind this playful interpretation of protest, direct action offers multiple avenues for intrinsic need satisfaction, or those needs that when satisfied may lead to self-motivation and well-being. According to Ryan and Deci’s self-determination theory (SDT), these are competence, autonomy, and relatedness to others. While this is not the only theory attempting to explain human motivation, it is a quite useful one in this context. So, besides offering a serious purpose to fight for, can activism satisfy intrinsic needs? A quick glance shows that it can. To reinforce competence and autonomy, activism can make sure that everyone has a role fit for their skills, resources, and willingness to risk, from offering safe monetary contributions to facing legal repercussions, effectively crafting a challenge that the person feels capable of facing.  To satisfy relatedness, we can see that action is deeply rooted in support practices. For example, in the game Alba: A Wildlife Adventure, an environmental catastrophe can only be averted with the support and action of the whole community. Even in one-person protests designed for pandemic times, the activist is rarely alone, with support roles offering practical assistance and mental support before, during, and after actions. Furthermore, activists usually organise actions as affinity groups, or relatively small and semi-autonomous units within a movement where ideas and rituals can be shared with trusted colleagues. Concepts such as challenge, skills, player agency, and teamwork are likely familiar to most game designers, who craft experiences that take into account and promote these components.  Singing as a form of protest in Detroit: Become Human.  As said above, direct action is only the tip of the iceberg of what being an activist means, and here we also find a direct parallel with games. In his 2011 book chapter “Reflections on Empirical Evidence on Games and Learning,” James Paul Gee discusses the difference between digital games as software, what he calls the “little ‘g’ game”, and the social interactions that players engage in within and around the game, or the meta-game. Together, these two form what he calls the “big ‘G’ Game.”  Applied to activism, it takes more than the action itself (the “little ‘g’ game”) to succeed. We need to consider the “big ‘G Game” - the social interaction that it inspires. Therefore, any understanding of activism as a Game will be incomplete without involving everything around it. The developers of the MMO Riders Republic understood this in their Rebirth event, where a virtual climate march and reforestation event combined collective joyful self-expression with a real tree planting campaign.  Planning and implementing a call for direct action in-game  Quests do not usually start when players arrive at a dungeon or any other sort of challenging arena. Rather, players typically prepare themselves by making plans, strategies, and acquiring resources. Direct action fundamentally works in the same way. Given this, game designers have a lot to say in how to support engaging preparation - after all, they only need to think of how communication, item and information acquisition, crafting, and other activities are supported in games. These insights may lend themselves to be incorporated in easier ways than is thought. With its typically democratic structures and voluntary ethos, activism is usually an activity undertaken freely, just as play often is; with its affinity and work groups, activists function through guilds and parties in the same way that MMO players do.  In fact, the experience of an activist begins much before it is time to prepare for an action. Is the starting point the moment when the person attends their first non-violent direct action (NVDA) training? Is it perhaps when they contact the organisation for the first time, when they first hear about the movement, or even maybe when they start asking themselves questions or feeling a concern? In any of these steps, designers and community managers can ensure that people feel supported all the way by contributing their knowledge and practice crafting tutorials as onboarding paths, progression systems, and playful experiences in and around games.  Finally, the meta-game also includes activities that can be crucial to the community without directly supporting protest. Well-being activities have been a way of staying connected and reinforcing community, in direct support of relatedness, through playful activities such as sports, board games, and hikes. Competence and autonomy can be exercised through prefiguration, or the forms in which we organise that reflect the changes we want - from urban gardening to cooperative forms of work and living. Understanding how people can live and satisfy needs in different ways can be inspirational and didactic experiences that game designers, as creators of alternative worlds, can bring about.  In Alba: A Wildlife Adventure, friendship and community support are essential for success.  Conclusion: Game developers are at the avantgarde of a joyful present and future  Developers willing to see activism as a game, but especially as a Game, can be particularly useful as part of social movements seeking to engage people in the long term. It is not only that action should take into account people’s need for both competence and autonomy, as games often do. As Carla Bergman and Nick Montgomery remind us in their book Joyful Militancy (thanks to Candi Vieira, from the IGDA Climate SIG Discord, for the recommendation), “strong relationships are the foundation of resistance,” and game designers may know a thing or two about supporting strong relationships in the face of challenge. If we want a sustainable future where joy plays an important role, we better start already, for the game of activism offers plenty of opportunities for it.

The Celtics finally got their first win of the series Tuesday night in Game 4 on the road, and superior bench play was a key factor in the outcome.  Celtics Talk POSTGAME POD: Celtics stave off elimination with Game 4 win against the Heat | Listen & Subscribe  The most notable bench performance came from Grant Williams, who scored 14 points with six rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block in 29 minutes. Boston outscored Miami by 15 points when Williams was on the floor.  ""Grant comes in and adds to winning,"" Celtics guard Jaylen Brown said after his team's 116-99 win. ""When he plays composed and keeps his head, he can be a tremendous asset. Just gotta keep talking to him, keep letting him know where the game is at, keep telling him to make the plays, play within his role, and I think he did that tonight.""  One of the best ways to predict whether the Celtics are going to win is the amount of 3-point shots they make. It seems obvious, but the Celtics are a bit of an extreme case because they often take so many of these shots. The C's are 9-2 in the 2023 playoffs when they hit 13 or more 3-pointers. When they connect on 12 or fewer, their record is 0-6. Boston hit 18 in Game 4.  Williams is a good outside shooter and can help the Celtics reach the level of 3-pointers they need to win. He went 4-for-6 from beyond the arc in Game 4 and is shooting 63.6 percent (7-for-11) in the series so far.  BIG SHOT GRANT WILLIAMS ð¯ pic.twitter.com/6UqhknjSyn — Celtics on NBC Sports Boston (@NBCSCeltics) May 24, 2023  Williams' minutes have been kind of all over the place during the playoffs.  He didn't play in Game 1 against the Heat. He played just 15 minutes in Game 1, Game 5 and Game 7 combined versus the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round. He didn't play in Game 6 of that series, either. Williams also didn't play in Game 1, Game 2 or Game 5 of the first-round series versus the Atlanta Hawks, and he played just 36 minutes total in that six-game series.  Despite the inconsistent playing time, Williams has been ready when called on. Celtics guard Marcus Smart praised Williams for keeping that focus.  ""Huge. Huge. He's a great professional. His professionalism is underrated,"" Smart said of Williams. ""We talk a lot about Grant, but we love Grant and we love everything he brings to this team. You need a guy like Grant on your team to win, and he helps us win games. When he's playing like that and he's focused like that, we're going to be alright.""  If Williams continues to be a threat from 3-point range and plays strong defense, the Celtics will have a good chance of extending this series to at least a Game 6.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYm9zdG9uL2NlbHRpY3MvY2VsdGljcy1qYXlsZW4tYnJvd24tcHJhaXNlcy1ncmFudC13aWxsaWFtcy1jbHV0Y2gtZ2FtZS00LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNl0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9ib3N0b24vY2VsdGljcy9jZWx0aWNzLWpheWxlbi1icm93bi1wcmFpc2VzLWdyYW50LXdpbGxpYW1zLWNsdXRjaC1nYW1lLTQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2U_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The developer, which last year bought several development studios and the intellectual property rights to a number of games including a new Tomb Raider game, said the deal would have ""set a new benchmark for the gaming industry"".  ""Late last night, we were informed that one major strategic partnership that has been negotiated for seven months will not materialize,"" it said in a statement.  The deal being negotiated included more than $2 billion in contracted development revenue over six years, it said.  ""The deal would have enabled a catch-up payment at closing for already capitalized costs for a range of large-budget games, but also notably improved medium-to-long-term profit and cash flow predictability for the duration of the game development projects.""  Shares in Embracer were down 40% at 0753 GMT, hitting an all time low, with analysts saying the drop was due to the news of the deal as well as the lowered outlook.  Hit by game delays, weaker demand, and ""lacklustre"" reception for some new games, Embracer on Wednesday reported a fiscal full-year adjusted operating profit of 915 million crowns ($90.1 million), roughly matching a profit warning issued last week.  It said that on top of the partnership deal falling through, it had had to postpone planned releases of a number of games under development, cutting as a result its adjusted profit forecast for the current year to 7-9 billion crowns, from 10-14 billion seen previously.

"game","2022-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T18:17:47","The poker world is abuzz as Hustler Casino Live is hosting five days of ultra high stakes cash game action featuring some of the biggest names in poker.  Jeff Walsh  The expectations for Hustler Casino Live’s Million Dollar Game are sky high – both as a piece of poker entertainment, as well as the history that might be made over five days of streaming.  With its minimum $1 million buy-in, nosebleed stakes of $500/$1000 (with a $1k bb ante), and an eclectic cast of characters, it’s easily one of the most anticipated livestreamed games in HCL (poker?) history. Simply put, with so much money on the table – a minimum of $7 million at the start of the day – every single hand could be the can’t-miss moment that has the poker world talking.  With five days of 10-hours-a-day coverage, there’s so much to keep an eye on. Who will be the most aggressive? Who will pull off the biggest bluff? Who will walk away the biggest winner? And who, if anyone, will go broke?  But aside from the stats, we’re keeping our eyes on some additional storylines that could play out during the course of the Million Dollar Game.  Can Nik Airball Bounce Back?  Over the past few months, love him or hate him, Los Angeles-based high stakes regular Nik ‘Airball’ Arcot has made a name for himself in the poker world. Thanks in part to his brash demeanor, trash talk and willingness to play big at every opportunity, he’s cultivated the public persona of a pro wrestling heel – a persona that helped him soak up the poker spotlight and turned him into one of Hustler Casino Live’s fastest rising stars.  But ahead of the Million Dollar Game, we’re a long way from Airball’s “The King of L.A.” era. Since early March he’s been on a very public downswing, including a session of HCL in which he lost more than $750,000 and, of course, getting taken to the cleaners for just over $1 million in his high-stakes, heads-up match against Matt Berkey.  So, while it’s true Airball is reportedly still up money while playing on livestreams (around $300,000 according to TrackingPoker.com), he’s in desperate need of a win. It’s impossible to know if his bankroll needs a boost, but his public persona could use one. And it would do him a world of good to thrive when the stakes are at their highest. Sure, for a lot of these players the money is the most that’s at stake, but for Airball there’s also a chance at rebuilding his reputation on the line. Can Arcot use the Million Dollar Game to rebound from his recent public L’s, or is this the game that buries him?  Ethan “Rampage” Yau Shoots His Shot  If you follow the world of poker vlogging at all, then you know that not only is Ethan ‘Rampage’ Yau one of the most popular players in the game right now, but he’s also been on a straight-up heater for the better part of a year. From winning WSOP Circuit rings (4), WSOP bracelets (1), a $25K High Roller at the 2022 WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas, and a more than $500K winning session on Hustler Casino Live, Yau has been able to accomplish in such a short amount of time what most poker players spend a career hoping to achieve.  But even with all the wins, cash gains, YouTube money, and locking up a deal as WPT Global’s newest ambassador, taking a seat with $1 million in this game in front of him is as big a risk as Yau has ever taken in poker. He’s shot taking, plain and simple. As of this writing, it looks like Yau is planning to bring $1.5 million to the game (likely sitting with $1 million and having a $500,000 rebuy ready if needed). Even with selling half of his action to his viewers, he admits that he’s “pretty nervous about the game to be honest.” So, we’re watching to see if Rampage’s charmed career hits new highs as he brings home a win for his community.  Playing for the Record Books  Rampage isn’t the only one shooting their shot. Hustler Casino Live, as a show, is doing the same. There’s never been a game like this: million-dollar minimum buy-in, nosebleed stakes, and five straight days of 10+ hour live coverage.  And with a show with such hype behind it, some expectations come with it. The first is viewership. It’s going to be tough to beat the current record for HCL, which was the May 2022 Creator Game headlined by Mr. Beast. That broadcast had a reported more than 100,000 concurrent viewers. And while HCL has done well in it’s wake, it would take a Herculean effort for the Million Dollar Game to match that number.  However, everything else – including the show that featured the infamous Adelstein/Lew hand – is on the table. With no less than $7 million on the table at a time and a number of notable personalities on board, the spectacle alone should make this their most-watched week of the year (and beyond).  Speaking of money, another looming possibility with all that cash is a shot at some of the largest livestreamed pots of all time. Currently, the largest televised cash game pot took place at a Triton Million Dollar cash game where Tom Dwan lost a $2.35 million pot to Paul Phua. Just recently, the largest U.S. livestreamed pot took place on PokerGO’s No Gamble No Future when Patrik Antonius dragged in a $1.978 million pot versus Eric Persson. The money to take down both of these records will be on the table at the Million Dollar Game, but will the action be wild enough to push these players to break records and make poker history?  Established Names vs. New Faces  By most accounts, Ryan Feldman is one of the industry’s best at crafting a lineup and he’s done a nice job here by bringing in a number of recognizable names that viewers will have history with. Doug Polk, Rob Yong, Jean-Robert Bellande, Brandon Steven, and the recently added Haralabos Voulgararis may not all have all played with each other exactly, but have entertained fans over a number of mediums and games for the better part of a decade.  On the other side of the lineup equation are some of Hustler Casino Live’s newer stars including the aforementioned Airball, social media star Mikki Mase, the aggressive “Prince Charles”, and the first person to ever sit with $1 million on the show’s livestream, Wesley ‘Wes Side’ Fei.  While the Friday lineup looks to be more of the “adults table”, with a wide crop of established names kicking off the broadcast, as the stream goes on the players will mix and match. We’re likely to see many great dynamics of new school players and veterans as each side tries to figure out how to deal with each other in real time for massive sums of money. It’s the benefit of having such a deep player pool (so far at least 18 players are confirmed for some part of the stream), and we will get to watch the collisions as they happen.  Will Persson Apply The Pressure?  No doubt about it, Eric Persson has a reputation as one of the more aggressive nosebleed poker players at the table. He’s incredibly vocal about requiring his opponents to play big (with their own money) and to play often – with a high VPIP.  He’s a game starter, boundary pusher, and, if you get on his bad side, trash talker. From giving Hellmuth the double middle fingers on PokerGO to annihilating “Mr.Dr.Batman” on Hustler Casino Live, Persson can be electric at the table. But, even he can switch gears – as we saw on the recent live episode of PokerGO’s High Stakes Poker. During that session, Persson seemed to pull back and let the action come to him.  But there’s one thing he’s always said, and that’s that money is the great equalizer. If enough cash is on the table you can put even the best poker players in the world to incredibly tough decisions for fortunes. Now he’s going to get the chance to bring that to one of the widest audiences he’s ever had.  and finally…  Will Alan Keating show up?  If Keating and Ryan Feldman get past their business differences, a Mr. Keating showing could take this broadcast to a whole other level.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkcG9rZXJ0b3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b3J5bGluZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gtaW4tdGhlLWh1c3RsZXItY2FzaW5vLWxpdmUtbWlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItZ2FtZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Meanwhile, professional sports are getting tougher to attend for families because of the expense.  ""I would say I come in here, grab one of those really good brats, and then $40 in beer,"" fan Will Benson said.  But there are some deals to be had.  ""You're gonna spend 50 bucks a pop every time you walk in with four people, (but) it's fun, it's an experience,"" fan Eric Robb said.  WCCO decided to do some research and find out how far three $20 bills will get you at a home game.  ""Whatever your budget, whatever the size of your group, we've got an affordable way for you to have a fun day watching Twins baseball at Target Field,"" Twins' business communications director Matt Hodson said.  First thing first -- tickets. You can grab a field view high seat for $15.  Transportation is next in line. If you're driving, parking will cost you $16 at Ramp A or B. You can reserve your parking in advance. Alternatively, you can slash the overall cost to just $4 by taking Metro Transit.  Then comes everyone's favorite ballpark nosh. Hit up one of the family value concession stands, where every menu item is less than $5. If you get a hot dog, nachos, and a soda there, you're looking at roughly $10 for your food tab. That brings the total spent to just under $41, even if you chose to drive and park in the ramp (and under $29 if you opted for public transportation).  There's another option to consider. You can lump your ticket and food together with a ""meal deal"" ticket in the Treasure Island Home Run Deck.

Last night’s heartbreaker was just Baltimore’s second loss in its last seven games, as the team sits at 31-17 and just two games in the loss column behind the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL East. The O’s don’t have a ton of depth in the starting rotation, but they’ve gotten just enough from guys like Wells, Kyle Gibson and Kyle Bradish to supplement a deep lineup and arguably the best bullpen in baseball.  Left for dead a few weeks ago, the Yankees have MLB’s best record in the month of May and are getting healthier and healthier by the day. New York also boasts a lights-out bullpen, and if Luis Severino (just back from the IL) and Cortes find their past form, this team will have more than enough pitching to support Aaron Judge and an offense that’s still a bit thin.

(Evan Wheaton - MediaNews Group)  ROYERSFORD >> Dylan Broderick is no stranger to finishing what he starts.  Having already gone the distance in a no-hitter this season, the Chestnut Hill College-bound senior once again threw a complete game to open Spring-Ford’s run through the District 1 Class 6A tournament.  Behind Broderick’s seven-inning stay on the mound and disciplined at-bats from up and down their lineup, the top-seeded Rams defeated No. 17 Lower Merion, 12-3 at Ram Stadium on Wednesday.  With the win, Spring-Ford (19-3) advances to the District 1-6A quarterfinals and will host No. 8 Avon Grove, a 10-0 winner over No. 9 Upper Darby, on Friday at 4 p.m.  “The loss to Phoenixville definitely fueled us a lot. We’ve practiced hard, we had a lot of time off,” Broderick said, noting his club’s loss to Phoenixville during the Pioneer Athletic Conference Final Four. “It was easy to check out and be done with it, but we just had to stay focused. We knew if we came out here and played our game, we wouldn’t lose. So that’s what we did.”  FINAL — No. 1 Spring-Ford 12, No. 17 Lower Merion 3 Dylan Broderick pitches a complete game.

With the final nine-run cushion in hand and his team being three outs away from advancing, Broderick entered the top of the seventh inning with 91 pitches on his count.  After a leadoff walk, Broderick dialed back in, forcing two fly outs and a lineout to close his complete game without relief.  “We were up nine runs, we could’ve probably brought someone in when he was at 90 pitches, but he wants to finish. He’s a senior,” Rams coach Rick Harrison said. “Let him finish his job. And he did. Got a little close at the end and he wouldn’t be slated to pitch again until Tuesday, that’s six days rest. We’re just trying to instill that tough mentality.”  While Broderick locked down the Aces (12-10) from the mound, Spring-Ford kept the pressure up at the plate right from the start. Two walks and a base hit from Broderick loaded the bases in the bottom of the first inning and from there, a walk and wild pitch brought home runs to lift the Rams up 2-0.  In the following inning, David Ruckman (2-for-4, four RBIs) and Virginia Commonwealth pledge Nick Moyer added a pair of RBI singles to give Spring-Ford a 4-1 lead after Lower Merion cut the game to one run, 2-1 off a sacrifice fly from Henry Rendle to score Matt Rinaldi in the top half.

Over the next three frames, Broderick kept things air-tight with no Aces reaching third base while pitching a 1-2-3 sixth inning.  “They came out swinging the bats well, so I just stuck to the game plan,” Broderick said. “Threw strikes, hit my spots and executed.”  Riding a 4-2 lead, the Rams pulled away in the bottom of the third inning. Upon loading the bases with no outs, a wild pitch, RBI single from Gage Swanger (2-for-3, three runs, three RBIs) and two-run line drive from Ruckman doubled Spring-Ford’s output, 8-2.

Swanger added a two RBI single to center an inning later to close out the scoring.  “These guys have been together from the get-go,” Lower Merion coach Colin Quinn said. “They’ve supported each other, were positive for each other, cheering them on even in the seventh inning. Still cheering, still pumping each other up.”  The Aces had good reason to keep the fire lit from their dugout. In its first postseason appearance since 2018, Lower Merion defeated No. 16 Neshaminy, 4-2 in the first round of the District 1-6A tournament, marking the first time in 18 years the program has won a playoff game.  In his second year at the helm of the Aces, Quinn credited Lower Merion’s senior class with helping to turn the program around after missing an entire season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.  “This group of seniors, they didn’t have a freshman season because it was the Covid year. For them to be able to come out to playoff baseball after really only getting three of the four years they should’ve had, it’s just a testament to their ability to overcome adversity,” Quinn said.  College of Charleston commit Drew Hollowell and Jack Scholz led the Aces at the plate all season with .362 batting averages, respectively. Sam Wright (.346) and Rendle (.304) also batted .300-plus for Lower Merion this season.  Lehigh commit Van Willner (2.13 ERA) earned the win against Neshaminy in the previous round to send the Aces further than they’ve been since 2005.  “Their ability to just have a great baseball IQ and put that into action really made a huge difference this year,” Quinn said.  Spring-Ford is back in the district’s Elite 8 after exiting in the first round last year. In 2021, the Rams won the PAC Championship, reached the District 1-6A quarterfinals and made it all the way to the PIAA semifinals.  “We just have to continue to play with confidence,” Broderick said. “We know if we play our game, nobody’s going to beat us. The only team that can beat us is us. We have to stay confident, everyone does their jobs and we’ll win.”  Spring-Ford 12, Lower Merion 3  Results Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 R H E Lower Merion 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 3 3 2 Spring-Ford 2 2 4 0 2 2 — 12 7 0  Lower Merion Spring-Ford ab r h bi ab r h bi Scholz 3 1 0 0 Ruckman 4 0 2 4 Whright 3 0 0 0 Moyer 3 1 1 2 Hollowell 3 0 0 0 Flores 3 1 0 0 Rinaldi 3 1 1 0 Broderick 2 1 1 0 Whright 3 1 1 0 Witmer 2 2 0 1 Rendle 2 0 0 1 Korchok 2 2 0 0 Rogers 0 0 0 0 Swanger 3 3 2 3 Myers 3 0 0 0 McVey 3 1 1 0 Slensky 3 0 1 0 Cecconi 1 0 0 0 Totals 23 3 3 1 Totals 23 12 7 10  2B — Wright; 3B — Rinaldi.

Barkov and his teammates posed for photos with it before he carried it off the ice.  ""The last thing that we're going to do is be is superstitious about not touching it,"" said forward Matthew Tkachuk, who scored the game-winning goal with 4.9 seconds left in the third period. ""Like, nobody said we were even going to make the playoffs. I think it's pretty cool to touch it, carry it around and take pictures with it. We earned that thing.""  The Tampa Bay Lightning, who won the Trophy each of the past three seasons, touched it all three, but were defeated in the Cup Final by the Colorado Avalanche in six games last season. Prior to that, they won the Cup in 2020 against the Dallas Stars and in 2021 against the Montreal Canadiens after touching it each time.  In 1996, the only other time Florida won the Prince of Wales Trophy, captain Brian Skrudland lifted the trophy; the Panthers were then swept by the Avalanche in the Cup Final.  Florida will play the Vegas Golden Knights or Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Final. Vegas leads that series 3-0 and can advance to the Cup Final with a win in Game 4 on Thursday (8 p.m. ET; ESPN, ESPN+, CBC, TVAS, SN).  Five of the past seven teams to win the Cup have touched the Prince of Wales Trophy. Prior to 2020, Sidney Crosby touched it in 2016 and in 2017 before helping the Pittsburgh Penguins win the Cup each season, and Alex Ovechkin did the same in 2018 with the Washington Capitals, who won the Cup.  The tradition of not touching the Prince of Wales Trophy hasn't worked out well for Eastern Conference champions in recent seasons. The Boston Bruins in 2011 are the most recent team to win the Cup after choosing not to touch it. The past five teams to not do so lost the Cup Final.  Bruins captain Zdeno Chara did not touch the trophy in 2019, and Boston lost to the St. Louis Blues in seven games in the Cup Final. The New Jersey Devils (2012), Bruins (2013), New York Rangers (2014) and Lightning (2015) all lost in the Cup Final after refusing to touch the trophy.  Because of temporary divisional realignment due to COVID-19 in 2020-21, the third round of the playoffs was renamed the semifinals, instead of the conference finals. The Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the Lightning after they defeated the New York Islanders in the semifinals.  The Prince of Wales Trophy has been awarded to the Eastern Conference champion since the 1993-94 season.  ""[We] definitely didn't do it the easy way,"" Tkachuk said. ""We earned it. I feel like if you're blocking shots, taking hits, doing whatever it takes to win a trophy like that, you might as well enjoy it.""

In this VB Spotlight, industry experts break down the benefits of web shops and offer monetization strategies you can put into action right away.  Watch free on-demand!  Mobile game developers are constantly seeking ways to expand their player base and increase revenue opportunities – especially in light of the recent changes on both iOS and Android. Game developers are particularly interested not just in user acquisition, but incrementality with their paying users today, to help grow the average revenue per paying user. A web shop is a great way to do that, and it comes with an array of opportunities and advantages, says Berkley Egenes, chief marketing officer at Xsolla.  “A web shop is your own online ecosystem,” he says. “You control the message, the branding and the promotional benefits you provide for the game. From there you can offer everything from subscriptions to bundle packs and other unique offers tailored to individual players, all in a single branded online experience that drives user engagement and grows the average revenue per paying user.”  Web shops are driving success stories for publishers like Tilting Point, he adds. “For their game Star Trek Timelines, developed by Wicked Realm Games, the company tells us they attribute nearly a quarter of the title’s incoming revenue from the game’s web shop.”  Here’s a look behind the success stories.  Driving engagement, sales and retargeting  Players want the convenience of immediate access to in-game currency and items, and that’s where a web shop is crucial in delivering the kind of experiences that keep them coming back for more every time. Plus, the ability to offer promo codes revs up a web shop’s appeal and keeps the player checking back for deals and incentives.  For example, Star Trek Timelines offers exclusive high-value packs that are only available on the web, increased web-only discounts and twice-weekly offers, all to to help drive demand to their web shop.  While in-app purchases have their inherent benefits, web shops offer tremendous flexibility in payment methods, and provide a seamless transaction experience. Players can use any of their preferred local payment methods, including bank cards, PayPal, ApplePay, GooglePay and Amazon Pay, earned game credits, and even gift certificates. Through Xsolla, partners can curate a branded experience for their players with the localized payment selections, allowing each player to pay in their method of choice. And every transaction can be made seamless, driving them back to the game after every visit, to keep engagement high and revenue growing.  Enhanced personalization and scale  With that seamless pipeline between the game and the shop, the amount of valuable first-party user behavior data grows — you know who is buying, what, and when, and can connect it to how they behave in-game. From there, you can set up promotions and targeted offers and provide exclusive bonuses and incentives to players too, he adds.  This level of personalization, combined with segmentation strategies, allows developers to test and iterate different approaches to engage and retain players effectively. The scalability of web shops enables developers to create highly targeted email and newsletter campaigns, identify the social media platforms players spend the most time on, offer targeted deals and campaigns with partners like Adikteev and YouAppi, and even include bundles and exclusive promotions that catch player attention, encouraging repeat purchases and increased player lifetime value.  “Owning the online experience through a web shop and driving that engagement directly to the right consumers at the right time is showing significant incrementality,” Egenes says. “Essentially, it’s the opportunity for game developers to leverage foundational ecommerce philosophies around promoting a true consumer brand. When you do it effectively for your user base, you’ll see significant growth – in some cases we are seeing upwards of 4x growth in incremental sales.”  To learn more about the ways web shops are transforming mobile game monetization and engagement strategies, plus a blueprint for establishing your own web presence as app platform restrictions loosen, don’t miss this VB Live event!

The four screenshots mainly focus on the remake’s environmental details, from the texture of the leaves to the way that the sun beams through the jungle canopy. A Soviet soldier does appear in one screenshot, with another featuring a ferocious looking crocodile.  Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake - First Screenshots 5 Images  The original game was a Cold War-era spy thriller set in a fictional jungle environment in the USSR. One of its main conceits was that Snake had to eat food to survive, forcing him to hunt the local wildlife. In Metal Gear Solid 3, crocodiles are some of the most ferocious enemies in the game, swiping at Snake with their tails or biting his leg.  Konami has confirmed that all four screenshots are taken from an in-development version of the game, offering players a clearer glimpse of what to expect from the new remake. The PlayStation Showcase teaser did not feature any gameplay.  The screenshots align with Konami’s promise to faithfully translate the original game to modern consoles, with a special focus on graphics and sound. It will retain the original voice acting as well as the original story. Little else is known about Metal Gear Solid Δ save that it’s set to release on PlayStation 5.  Loading Play  Alongside the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake announcement, Konami also confirmed the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 1, which will feature the first three games. It’s set to release in Fall 2023, with Metal Gear Solid Δ rumored to be releasing sometime in 2024.

No one is hitting .400 anymore (sorry, Luis Arraez), projected contenders who started slowly are heating up (Astros, Cardinals, Dodgers, etc.), and projected noncontenders who started well have cooled (Cubs, Pirates, etc.). The grind that is the 162-game season is fully underway.  Our bi-weekly series breaking down various trends across the league continues Wednesday with one leadoff hitter's first inning dominance, a contender's bullpen issues, and a former star's return to prominence. Last week we looked at clubs with poor defense, trouble limiting stolen bases, and a lack of power.  Acuña's first inning excellence  Ronald Acuna ATL • RF • #13 BA 0.337 R 46 HR 11 RBI 27 SB 20 View Profile  To date, Braves wunderkind Ronald Acuña Jr. has been the best player in baseball. He's hitting a stout .337/.427/.588 with 11 home runs and 20 stolen bases, and he entered play Tuesday leading the league in both the Baseball Reference (2.9) and FanGraphs (2.7) versions of WAR. Acuña has played at an All-Star level since arriving in the majors 2018. This year, he's found another gear.  ""He's the best player I've ever seen,"" Braves righty Spencer Strider told MLB.com about Acuña. ""I don't know what else there is to say. Words can't really do it justice. He's the best player in the game right now and I'm just glad he's on our team.""  The first inning is when Acuña has really shined. He has led off all 48 games for Atlanta -- Acuña has not started a game anywhere other than leadoff since spending the first month of 2019 hitting cleanup -- and his first inning numbers are outrageous. He leads in just about every meaningful category leading off a game (min. 25 plate appearances leading off a game):  Acuña has hit ""only"" two leadoff home runs this season, fourth most in baseball behind Betts, Mickey Moniak, and Christian Yelich (three each), though he's made up for it with eight doubles. Mookie is the only other player with as many as six leadoff doubles. The .563 on-base percentage is outrageously good. Acuña is getting on base to start the game almost 60% of the time! What more could you want from a leadoff hitter?  Set the minimum to 100 plate appearances leading off the game, and all-time best season by a leadoff hitter belongs not to Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, but Jose Altuve. The Astros second baseman hit .330/.438/.730 leading off the game last season, good for a 226 OPS+. Henderson's best season leading off the game was a .343/.488/.636 (202 OPS+) batting line in 1993.  The single-season record is 17 doubles leading off the game by Hall of Famer Craig Biggio in 2004. Acuña is nearly halfway there already. Alfonso Soriano holds the total bases record with 101 in 2003. Acuña is nearly 40% of the way there. Soriano hit 13 leadoff homers that year, so Acuña has a lot of ground to make up there, but I wouldn't put it past him. He's so talented and so locked in.  The cynical among us will say Acuña hitting so well leading off the game must mean his numbers are lagging the rest of the time, and of course his numbers aren't that good in all other situations, but he is hitting .286/.392/.521 after the first inning. He's been otherworldly in the first inning and merely excellent the rest of the game.  Acuña has a real shot at the fifth 40/40 season in history and an outside chance at the first 50/50 season in history. It's a long shot, no doubt about it, but it's not completely out of the question at this point. Either way, Acuña is having a monster MVP-caliber season, and he's been historically great in the first inning two months into 2023.  ""What he's done has been incredible,"" Braves third baseman Austin Riley told MLB.com about Acuña. ""You catch yourself on the edge of (your seat) watching every swing, because you think something magical is going to happen. Just incredible.""  Tampa's surprisingly shaky bullpen  Peter Fairbanks TB • RP • #29 ERA 1.86 K/9 7.4 WHIP 1.24 S 5 BS 1 View Profile  At 35-15, the Rays have the best record in baseball, and they are the first team to win 35 of their first 50 games since, well, the Yankees last year (also 35-15). Tampa's pace has cooled since their historic 13-0 start, but they are 22-15 since starting 13-0. That's a 96-win pace. The Rays have gone from out of this world to merely outstanding.  As good as they've been this season, there is one area the Rays have been lacking: the bullpen. Their relievers have been surprisingly shaky, especially in May. Here are their bullpen numbers entering Tuesday, before three relievers and two position players combined to allow 16 runs in five innings in a blowout loss to the Blue Jays:  ERA: 2.95 (15th in MLB)  2.95 (15th in MLB) FIP: 4.66 (26th in MLB)  4.66 (26th in MLB) WHIP: 1.24 (10th in MLB)  1.24 (10th in MLB) Win probability added: minus-1.54 (25th in MLB)  minus-1.54 (25th in MLB) WAR: minus-0.4 (29th in MLB)  Only the Athletics, who are a money laundering operation more than a competitive baseball team, have received worse bullpen production (minus-2.1 WAR!) than the first place Rays. Tampa has the fourth mosts blown saves (10), and the bullpen has taken nine of the team's 15 losses. The bullpen is a concern for the Rays. There's no doubt about it.  Part of the problem is the lack of bat-missing ability. Rays relievers have struck out 17.4% of batters faced this season, the lowest bullpen strikeout rate in baseball and comfortably below the 23.8% league average for relievers. There's something to be said for quick outs on the ground, sure, but in the late innings of close games, you want strikeouts, and the Rays don't get 'em.  Given their reputation, it's easy to think the Rays will just reach into the farm system and bring up a dynamite reliever or three, and be on their way. If it were that easy though, the Rays would have already done it. The pitching reserves are depleted enough that the front office picked up guys like Chase Anderson, Jake Diekman, Javy Guerra, and Zack Littell off the scrap heap earlier this month.  ""I think they've done a good job given the circumstances,"" Rays manager Kevin Cash told the Tampa Bay Times recently. ""Given how the starters have gone down, they've had to carry a bigger load, some of them that we didn't ideally want to happen.""  Unreliable bullpens have sabotaged many great teams (see: 2011-14 Tigers), and Tampa is having too special a season to leave it unaddressed. Whether it's getting help at the trade deadline or an outside-the-box solution (Drew Rasmussen in relief when he returns?), the Rays need to address their bullpen. It's the one real flaw in this powerhouse team, and it is a significant one.  ""We're fine. Have we pitched the way we should? No,"" righty reliever Jason Adam told the Tampa Bay Times. ""But at the same time, we're still a top bullpen in the league. I think it instills confidence in a lot of us that we haven't pitched how we should and we're still among the top. So it's going to be fun when we start taking care of business.""  Sale's recent resurgence  Chris Sale BOS • SP • #41 ERA 5.01 WHIP 1.17 IP 50.1 BB 13 K 62 View Profile  Coming into the season, there were many reasons to be skeptical of the Red Sox rotation, and those concerns have been founded two months into 2023. Boston's starters entered play Tuesday with a 5.44 ERA (26th in MLB) and 1.5 WAR (25th in MLB). Six pitchers have made at least three starts for the Red Sox and only Brayan Bello has even a league average ERA.  That said, as poorly as things have gone to date, there are reasons to be optimistic about Boston's rotation moving forward. James Paxton has looked very good in his two starts back from the injured list and Garrett Whitlock is expected back this coming weekend. Also, Chris Sale has pitched very well lately. In fact, he's pitched like the Chris Sale of old the last four times out:    IP per start ERA WHIP K% BB% Opp. AVG/OBP/SLG First 5 starts 4.6 8.22 1.74 27.3% 9.1% .316/.391/.547 Last 4 starts 6.8 2.30 0.70 30.8% 2.9% .163/.212/.316  ""I haven't felt this good since 2019 before I blew out my elbow,"" Sale told the Boston Globe recently. ""I had a start against Anaheim (13 strikeouts and eight scoreless innings on Aug. 8, 2019) that I felt like I was picking up steam. Then that was it. It hasn't been until lately I'm getting that feeling back.""  Several injuries, some serious (Tommy John surgery) and some fluky (finger broken by a comebacker, fell off a bike and broke his wrist), limited Sale to only 48 1/3 innings from 2020-22. He has not been healthy and dominant in the same season since 2018, when he was the ace of Boston's World Series champion team. And at age 34, his first five starts this year were a red flag, for sure.  As he's gotten his legs under him and gotten back in sync mechanically though, Sale's fastball velocity has increased, and more velocity gives you greater margin of error. Sale's velocity has increased each month this year, and, in his last three starts, he's had his best velocity since that 2018 season. He really is beginning to resemble his old self.  Chris Sale's fastball velocity has continued to climb this year. Brooks Baseball  ""Mechanically I'm getting to better spots when I need to,"" Sale told the Boston Globe last week. ""Before I was a little stiff and getting away from the things that made me successful. I feel like my routine between starts is better, too.""  The best predictor of future injury is past injury and it's fair to wonder whether Sale can make it through a full 162-game season, if not physically then at least effectively. That's a question for another time. Right now, Sale is again pitching like an ace, something the Red Sox badly need to remain in contention. He's an arrow-up player after entering 2023 as an unknown.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL21sYi10cmVuZHMtcm9uYWxkLWFjdW5hcy1lYXJseS1nYW1lLWV4Y2VsbGVuY2UtcmF5cy1vbmUtd2Vhay1zcG90LWNocmlzLXNhbGVzLXN1cnByaXNpbmctY29tZWJhY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The trailer features a cast of colorful characters shooting various brightly-colored foam at each other.  The gameplay is similar to Splatoon, but instead of paint, you and your colorful friends shoot foam at one another. The trailer only showed in-match gameplay, so we don't know if you're going to be able to gather together in a town square to show off weird art to one another.  Rather than both teams racing to cover the entire map in their color of paint, the foam being shot in Foamstars will be used to both attack and change the layout of the map. So, theoretically you'll be able to create cover or alternate ways to traverse the map.  Foamstar doesn't have a release date quite yet, but if you're looking for a Splatoon-like shooter to play on PS5, Foamstar might just be it.  Jackie Thomas is the freelance computing queen.

The match kicks off at 7 p.m. and streams live on MLS Season Pass on Apple TV.  Last weekend, Revolution II battled back from a two-goal deficit to defeat Philadelphia Union II, 4-3. This marks the second straight come-from-behind victory for Revolution II after Homegrown midfielder Damian Rivera’s brace led the squad to a 3-2 victory over Toronto FC II on May 14. Against Philadelphia, Homegrown midfielder Esmir Bajraktarević’s three goals made him the first player in the team history to record a hat trick. Bajraktarević now owns five goals on the season, tying him for the team lead alongside Rivera and Revolution II forward Marcos Dias.  “These guys [Bajraktarević and Rivera] are talented young players that can be difference makers,” head coach Clint Peay said following last weekend’s win. “These games are important for them to continue to build their confidence as attackers and as guys who can be playmakers. They've shown when they come and play with us. I know that it's just going to help them as they continue to get opportunities with the first team.”  New England’s attack holds its position as the top-scoring unit in MLS NEXT Pro. Revolution II’s 24 goals place them ahead of Crown Legacy FC (21) and Colorado Rapids 2 (20). Bajraktarević also ranks among the league’s best with an MLS Next Pro high of three goals outside the 18 this season. He also sits tied for fifth-most goals in the league, having only played three games with Revolution II this season.  New England last saw Columbus on April 16, falling 3-0 to the defending MLS NEXT Pro Cup Champions. Jordan Adebayo-Smith and Weverton led Revolution II with two shots, one on target each, as goalkeeper Nico Campuzano made two saves in the match. With a 2-1-1 home record this season, Thursday’s contest marks New England’s first home match since April 30 as Revolution II is set to host Columbus and Inter Miami in a span of four days.  “It's Columbus first and that's all we're worried about,” Peay said. “We want to take stock and figure out where we are physically and also thinking about what's going to make the most sense. Columbus is a good team and has always given us challenges. We've got our work cut out for us this week to prepare.”  WHAT TO WATCH FOR AGAINST COLUMBUS CREW 2:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldm9sdXRpb25zb2NjZXIubmV0L25ld3MvcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1paS1nYW1lLXByZXZpZXctbmV3LWVuZ2xhbmQtdGFrZXMtb24tY29sdW1idXMtY3Jldy1paS1vbi10aHVyc2RhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Goaltender Malcolm Subban made 21 saves and extended the Rochester win streak to seven-straight games.  “Subby was excellent when he needed to be excellent,” Appert said. “He gave us a really calm, composed game tonight.” His calmness, paired with the lockdown on defense, was key in keeping the savvy Hershey veterans from getting many good looks on net.  “They try to look for screens and tips and back-door chances,” Subban explained after the game. “So for me, it’s just making that first save and trying to control the rebounds.” Subban applauded the defensive effort — especially all their blocked shots.  Now that's how you start game one of the Eastern Conference Finals 👏 pic.twitter.com/hKNqSGpj2R — x-Rochester Americans (@AmerksHockey) May 23, 2023  The defensemen also contributed on offense, factoring on each of the Amerks’ five goals. Joseph Cecconi, who was celebrating his 26th birthday, scored just 14 seconds into the contest, and deflated the home crowd.  Cecconi was quick to credit his teammates for his early goal, adding: “Everyone’s scoring right now for us, so it’s been a fun game to play in.” He’s not wrong.  During the seven-game win streak, the Amerks have outscored their opponents 41-21, including 12-3 in the first period. Mason Jobst and Jiri Kulich are on seven-game point streaks. Ethan Prow is on an AHL-best six-game assist streak.  Things seem to be clicking on offense. “People are really rising to the occasion and seizing the opportunity, doing whatever it takes to win,” Subban said after the game.  “When you look around, that’s the one thing we have in common: how bad we want to win right now.”  And while the 5-1 win felt dominant to fans watching, Appert sees room for improvement from his young squad. “I didn’t think we were great tonight,” he said, “but we were pretty good. We did a good enough job to give us a chance.”  Appert noted that Hershey had plenty of chances as well, so the game could have been way closer. “I thought we handled their pressure relatively well,” he added. “Now we have to reset, try to learn some things, and get better tomorrow.”  An adjustment the team made after the first two rounds was managing the lead in the third period, as they did last night. “I thought we did a better job managing it than maybe some of the other leads we’ve had in the playoffs,” Appert explained. “We didn’t sit back, but I’d still like us to attack more.”  12 points in 9 games for Mason Jobst 👀 pic.twitter.com/hL8ZTi57yH — x-Rochester Americans (@AmerksHockey) May 24, 2023  Managing a third period lead is a balance, which has been tougher to accomplish with the young team, though they are improving. “You need to stay aggressive, because we’re a better team when we’re aggressive, without playing risky and not managing the puck.”  Subban was happy with the defensive effort in the third period: “It was unreal, all the blocked shots they had. [Hershey was] trying to get traffic in front to get pucks through, and I couldn’t see much, but guys were selling out so it was awesome.”  The team was able to support Subban, as the netminder is always able to support his squad. “Every game, we know he’s going to be that guy,” Cecconi said. “We can count on him to make big saves throughout the entire game, so we feel a little more relaxed out there.”  The Amerks have an optional practice on Wednesday, as they’re using the day to make adjustments, something that’s been a strength of this team all season long. “At this time of year, you have to be willing and able to adjust,” Appert said.  “To be able to watch video and apply it the next day in the game, that’s a part of becoming a pro and playing well in the playoffs. Our guys have been exceptional at that, but it’ll be important that we get better tomorrow.”  Appert expects Hershey to be great in Game 2, just as Toronto was great in Game 2 of the North Division Finals. He knows they’ll have to increase their competitiveness and their puck management, but he also expects Hershey to increase the physicality.  “That’s what Syracuse tried to do once we won a game. That’s what Toronto tried to do when we won a game,” Appert said. “We might not be the most physical team, but we’re not scared.”  Cecconi agreed: “We expect every team we play to run around and play physical on us.” And how the team responds is simple. “We just do a good job of sticking to our system: playing aggressive, playing confident. You can obviously see what happens when we do that.”  The Amerks will square-off against the Bears for Game 2 in Hershey on Thursday night. The game can be streamed on AHLTV or heard on The Fan Rochester with Don Stevens and Brian Duff. Fans across New York state can also watch on MSG Network, while fans in Rochester can watch at The Distillery (all locations).

"game","2023-05-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T15:00:28","Some of the best fighting games to try out with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium memberships.  Fighting games are some of the most thrilling, fulfilling, and complex games out there. The genres varied enough for anyone to become a brawling master – from Street Fighter to Tekken, there’s a flavor of fighting game for every type of player. Thanks to PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog*, it’s easier than ever to find a title you vibe with. Whether you want to try classic 2D, 3D, anime, arena, or a genre offshoot, it’s all there.  With PlayStation Plus you not only get access to dozens of fighting games, but you can also take them online to test your skills against players across the globe. Here are some of the best fighting games you can play right now on PlayStation Plus.  Ultra Street Fighter IV  No fighting game series is as iconic as Capcom’s Street Fighter series. While Street Fighter II birthed the genre’s golden age, Street Fighter IV was critical to its resurgence in the late 2000s. It brings back both mainstay and niche characters from the past, giving players more options than ever before when it comes to battles.  With Ultra Street Fighter IV, in particular, there are additional mechanics like the Red Focus Attack, the ability to select a dual Ultra combo, and more costumes than ever. It’s a great place for newcomers to get acclimated to the measured pace of the series, especially for those interested in playing the upcoming Street Fighter 6.  Available with PlayStation Plus Premium  Dragon Ball FighterZ  Bandai Namco’s Dragon Ball FighterZ gave the series one of its most fleshed-out fighting game spin-offs to date. Take the multiverse by storm and assemble a team of three Dragon Ball characters of your choice. Each fighter has three unique assist attacks to help the character you’re currently controlling damage their opponents further.  Dragon Ball FighterZ also has an extensive story mode in which Goku and the Z-Fighters take on some of their greatest foes once more. With great character interactions, like the uneasy alliance between Cell and Gohan, and tons of anime-faithful animations, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a fighter worthy of any Dragon Ball fan’s time.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition  Injustice: Gods Among Us takes the best of DC Comics’ brave and the bold and pits them against one another. Developer NetherRealm Studios takes the bones of Mortal Kombat and adds new features–such as interactable objects, transitioning environments, and more dynamic movement options–to make you feel like a true superhero or villain.  Each character has a special ability to amplify their unique superpowers that you can use in battle at the touch of a button. There is also a health wager mechanic where characters clash with one another and quip at each other. Throw Batarangs, launch enemies into a giant Captain Atom, or clash with your foes in the Fortress of Solitude in one of the most definitive fighting game experiences. Just watch out for the flying pigs.  Available with PlayStation Plus Premium  Fighting EX Layer  If you’re a fan of classic fighting games from the original PlayStation era, Fighting EX Layer from Arika is a must-play. This spiritual successor to the cult-favorite Street Fighter EX series feels like a blast from the past. Like games from that retro era, it starts simple, but after some playtime, the depth reveals itself.  Fighting EX Layer’s signature feature is the Gougi System, which adds passive abilities to characters when in-battle requirements are met. With 13 layers available to attach to each character, there are many different ways to play everyone. Do you want to add an extra layer to your mix-ups? Then use the Shinobi Gougi to unlock invisible dashes. Or maybe you’re a fan of the Infinity Gougi, which allows you to cancel out of blockstun with supers and passively build super meter, giving you more chances at big damage. This fighter is all about choice and giving you the freedom to strategize accordingly in battle.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Touhou Genso Rondo: Bullet Ballet  Have you ever wondered what would happen if you mixed fighting game battles with the fast-paced shooting action of bullet hell games? Touhou Genso Rondo: Bullet Ballet from NIS answers that question in spectacular fashion. Imagine taking your favorite shoot-’em-up and making it an arena-confined versus experience and you’ve got the gist of things.  You and another player control bullet hell boss characters, unleashing devastating attacks toward one another while trying to dodge hundreds of projectiles. And if you’re a Touhou fan, there’s a story mode where you can learn more about the series’ most popular characters, including Reimu and Marisa.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid  Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid from nWay is the fighting game of Super Sentai fans’ dreams. Not only can you pick from a multitude of different Power Rangers heroes and villains, but you can select up to three and play as a team, complete with assist attacks and active tag maneuvers. Unleash chaos against your opponents by summoning a giant robot Megazord as a last-ditch tactic. If you venture into this one be prepared to practice long combos and push your skills.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Mortal Kombat 11  NetherRealm Studio’s Mortal Kombat franchise makes yet another grand return with Mortal Kombat 11. This entry acts as a direct continuation to Mortal Kombat X and changes the formula once more. The fighting shifts into a slower, more grounded style, focused on neutral and equal-advantage combat over speed. The defense has been upgraded to add more options, such as wakeup attacks and an armored combo breakaway.  Along core fighting changes comes another exciting story mode and more character customization similar to Injustice 2. There’s even an upgraded Krypt mode resembling an open-world bonus room players traverse while learning about the Mortal Kombat world and its behind-the-scenes development.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Dead or Alive 5: Last Round  The Dead or Alive series is one of the most over-the-top 3D fighting games out there. Flashy extended combos and stage interactions – where characters are tossed into explosions, electric barriers, and off buildings – are a major part of that. But that’s not all Dead or Alive has to offer. While simple to understand, the title’s depth begins to open up when the mind games of its Triangle countering system become apparent in battle, but it never overshadows the fun factor. If you’re looking for spectacle and simple yet complex fighting, this Koei Tecmo game is for you.  Available with PlayStation Plus Extra, PlayStation Plus Premium  Garou: Mark of the Wolves  Venture into the past of famed fighting game developer SNK – known for the King of Fighters and Metal Slug series – with Garou: Mark of the Wolves. This high-skill fighter is one of the best there is and well worth the effort it takes to master. The beautiful 2D sprites on display are also a treat to the eyes, featuring remarkably detailed animations for its colorful roster, which includes the iconic Terry Bogard, Rock Howard, Gato, B. Jenet, and more. With so many characters of varying styles and difficulties, Garou is essential for any fan of retro fighting games or SNK’s classic titles.  Available with PlayStation Plus Premium  The Last Blade 2  Yet another classic from SNK’s extensive archive of fighting games from the ‘90s. The Last Blade 2 is a weapon-based fighter mixing slow, methodical play with high-octane combat. While the game is slower-paced at a glance, the intensity, quick reflexes, and requisite combo skills become evident when locked in the heat of battle.  Available with PlayStation Plus Premium  Tekken 7  Tekken 7 builds upon Bandai Namco’s iconic 3D fighter with beautiful graphics and even more complex mechanics. Each character now can now execute Rage Art and Rage Drive attacks, making offensive play more exhilarating (and allowing for nail-biter comebacks if you’re getting pummeled). And with the return of transitioning stages, there’s more of a need to hone your combos than before. There’s also a story mode to delve into and tons of guest characters from other franchises to play as, like Geese Howard from The King of Fighters and Noctis from Final Fantasy XV. Just be ready to jump out of your seat when you witness your first slow-motion finish.

"game","2023-05-03","10:30:00","{""Hoover"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T22:34:07","Diggs' game-winning blast lifts Hogs past Aggies in 11    HOOVER, Alabama -- With two swings of its bats, 2-seed Arkansas changed the trajectory of its SEC Baseball Tournament and pushed 10-seed Texas A&M to the brink of elimination on Wednesday at the Hoover Met.  The biggest swing belonged to designated hitter Kendall Diggs, who launched the game-winner homer on a 2-1 pitch to lead off the bottom of the 11th inning, lifting a big fly over the left-field fence for the dramatic and hard-fought 6-5 Arkansas victory.  ""For me, going up there, I didn't want to jump on something that really wasn't over the plate,"" Diggs said. ""I wanted to make him come to me, and he did with that first-pitch fastball. The next two were really good pitches, probably maybe a ball down, so 2-1 count. I knew he was going to challenge me with something. I was just trying to get the head out, and it was good.""  It wasn't just good. It was great.  Four innings earlier, the same could be said for the swing taken by his teammate, Jared Wegner.  With one big swing of Wegner's bat in the bottom of the seventh, Arkansas erased the lead Texas A&M had held virtually all game, as Wegner's blast over the left-field wall came with the bases loaded. His grand slam gave the Razorbacks their first lead of the game at 5-4.  ""With my grand slam, the previous two at-bats I was kind of late on a lot of fastballs, and they were attacking me with fastballs,"" Wegner said. ""They brought in (reliever Brandyn) Garcia who has velo, so I was kind of hunting a fastball middle in and got it off on that first pitch.""  The lead was short-lived, however, as Austin Bost's own blast to left to lead off the top of the ninth tied it, 5-5, setting the stage for extra innings and, eventually, Diggs' final heroics.  Arkansas had its chances in the bottom of the 10th, trying a safety squeeze that backfired with one out when pinch runner Hunter Grimes was thrown out trying to score by sliding head-first into home.  Between the dramatic Arkansas homers, there were plenty of fine defensive plays and some solid pitching in the affair that Texas A&M seemingly had under control for much of the game.  Texas A&M jumped on top early in the top of the third inning after Brett Minnich led off with a double to left center. Max Kaufer singled and leadoff hitter Hunter Haas walked, loading the bases. After Zack Morris came in to pitch, replacing starter Cody Adcock for Arkansas, Minnich scored on Jack Moss' RBI grounded out while Kaufer advanced to third and Haas to second.  Trevor Werner then delivered the big blow of the inning, knocking a two-RBI single through the left side of the infield to score both Kaufer and Hass, giving the Aggies a 3-0 lead.  The Aggies made it a 4-0 advantage when Ryan Targac led off the next inning with a solo home run.  Meanwhile, Arkansas left seven runners on base over the first four innings, including two in each of the first three frames.  The Razorbacks broke through, sort of, in the bottom of the fourth when the scored without the benefit of a hit. Harold Coll walked and Parker Rowland was hit by a pitch, with Coll advancing to third and Rowland to second on a subsequent passed ball. Tavian Josenberger then lifted a sacrifice fly to left field, scoring Coll.  But even then, the Razorbacks left Rowland stranded at third.  Their frustrations at the plate continued until the two big swings from Werner and Diggs finally settled it.  Dave Van Horn, coach of the Razorbacks, credited the relief pitching of Morris and winning pitcher Will McEntire, who took over for Morris to start the eighth and threw the final four innings, with the win as much as the home runs of Werner and Diggs. Together, the two of them combined to throw nine complete innings of five-hit ball, giving up just one run each, walking two and striking out eight.  ""Zack Morris was the story, five-plus innings, I think 80-something pitches, and gave up a run. Just a super job by Zack,"" Van Horn said. ""Then Will coming in and just throwing nothing but strikes, he gave up one home run. They hit a couple balls hard, obviously, but he also got them out front a lot, and we had some quick innings.""  HOW IT HAPPENED  T3 | Texas A&M's Minnich led off the inning by doubling to left center. Kaufer singled to left, advancing Minnich to third. Haas walked, loading the bases. Zack Morris came in to pitch, replacing starter Cody Adcock for Arkansas. Moss grounded out, scoring Minnich while advancing Kaufer to third and Haas to second.

Tri-West showed why they are one of the favorites in Class 3A this year, and topped Lebanon 10-0 in six innings to claim the sectional title.  ""Against a formidable team like this that is one of the best in our area, you just want to give them your best game,"" Lebanon head coach Robert Archambeau said. ""We had a couple of errors that hurt us, and you saw in our games against them that Audrey Lowry adapts to the game and knows where to put the ball. I am happy for the contact we did make today and all in all this was a great season.""  The Bruins grabbed control of the game in the first inning.  After a single and a double to open the game, a pair of sacrifice flies gave the Bruins a 2-0 lead.  An error kept the inning alive, before a 2-run homer made it 4-0 in the opening half inning.  ""It makes it tough, but we were able to put up a couple of zeros after that,"" Archambeau said. ""The first inning wasn't great, but I was proud of our effort. We tried to stay even keel throughout. The bats weren't there tonight, but when Audrey is pitching, that happens to a lot of teams.""  The Bruins added three runs in the fourth and then three more in the sixth to provide the final margin.  Lebanon got a single from Lillie Hollingsworth in the third and one from Mackenzie Carey in the sixth.  The Tigers end the season with a record of 24-7.  They graduate four starters, but bring a good core back.  ""The seniors have gone from 13-18, to 18-13, to now 24-7,"" Archambeau said. ""Regardless of who they are playing, who's on the team, or where they are playing, there's been growth, love and there's a lot of excitement. This senior group has created a massive excitement for years to come. The seniors legacy has been to have fun, make memories, but give a heck of an effort. There are a lot of girls coming up who are going to put on the Lebanon jersey and remember what these girls did, and that's a cool legacy to have.""

Alan Wake 2 is one of the many fabled gaming sequels that gamers have waited a long time for and even thought it may never happen. The first game came out in 2010 and it was pretty clear a sequel was not happening after Remedy moved on to other projects but after securing funding a couple of years ago, it was able to make this dream a reality. The game is finally almost here and we got our first look at Alan Wake 2 at the PlayStation Showcase and it looked great.  Unfortunately, if you're a die hard fan, you won't be able to get a physical copy. Remedy confirmed that the game will only be available digitally, a decision the studio arrived at for a variety of reasons. A large portion of players now buy games digitally which has led to consoles being made without disc drives. It will also mean that players will get the game at $60 on consoles and $50 on PC, something that wouldn't be possible if they had to pay to produce discs and boxes. It also means that there's no risk of selling a physical copy that still requires a download to play due to patches and whatnot. You can read the statement below.  ""There are many reasons for this,"" said Remedy. ""For one, a large number of have shifted to digital only. You can buy a Sony PlayStation 5 without a disc drive and Microsoft's Xbox Series S is a digital only console. It is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only. Secondly, not releasing a disc helps keep the price of the game at $59.99 / €59.99 and the PC version at $49.99 / €49.99. Finally, we did not want to ship a disc product and have it require a download for the game — we do not think this would make for a great experience either.""  Ultimately, it's a bit of a bummer for those that like a disc or don't have internet. Perhaps a big version of the game with future expansions and such will be released later, but as of right now Remedy notes it has no plans to make a disc version of the game. Either way, it may be signaling a change in the industry as digital games become more embraced.  What do you think of this decision? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on Twitter @Cade_Onder.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvbmV3cy9hbGFuLXdha2UtMi1kaWdpdGFsLW9ubHktZXhwbGVuYXRpb24v0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9jb21pY2Jvb2suY29tL2dhbWluZy9hbXAvbmV3cy9hbGFuLXdha2UtMi1kaWdpdGFsLW9ubHktZXhwbGVuYXRpb24v?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

HOW IT HAPPENED  The Fighting Irish finished game one with a strong offensive outing, recording 15 hits on the day. The Irish were led by TJ Williams and Carter Putz who each finished 3-5 at the plate. Zack Prajzner, Vinny Martinez, and Brooks Coetzee each recorded two hits a piece for the Irish.  Despite trailing 2-0 heading in the bottom of the first after Pitt struck with a lead off home run and an RBI double, Notre Dame didn’t waiver. They responded with four hits and a run from Putz as he scored on an RBI single from Coetzee to bring the Irish within one after the first.  The Panthers tacked on one more run in the top of the second to make it a 3-1 ballgame before Carter Putz scored again on a triple from Vinny Martinez, his first of the season. DM Jefferson reached on a HBP and as he went to steal second, Martinez would steal home for the final run of the inning to make it an even 3-3 heading into the fourth.  The Panthers claimed the lead yet again in the top of the fourth after a three-run home run to right field. Trailing 6-3 heading into the bottom frame, Williams recorded a base hit followed by a Prajzner double to put both of the Irish runners in scoring position. Williams scored on an RBI groundout from Putz, bringing Notre Dame within two at 6-4 heading into the top of the fifth.  Pitt put up one more run in the fifth before recording two solo home runs in the seventh to take the advantage at 9-4 heading into the eighth inning. Casey Kmet and Estevan Moreno each picked up their first hits of the day as they started the frame with back-to-back base hits. Putz was back at it again as he launched a ball into deep left center for an RBI double to score Kmet and make it a 9-5 ballgame. The Irish recorded one more hit in the ninth as Coetzee singled to center field but Notre Dame’s efforts would not be enough to overcome the four run deficit.  Aidan Tyrell dropped to 8-3 on the season after throwing 4.0 innings before he was relieved by Radek Birkholz. Birkholz pitched 3.0 innings before Caden Spivey took the mound in the eighth and ninth inning. The staff recorded four strikeouts on the day.

"game","2023-12-06","Not Discerned","{""Limburg"", ""Hesse"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-24T15:25:00","For a few years now, we’ve heard Final Fantasy XVI is inspired by HBO’s Game of Thrones, and during my cover story trip to Tokyo, Japan, to speak with Creative Business Unit III, I learned more about this. Specifically, and perhaps critically, I learned that the team was inspired by the first four seasons of Game of Thrones. Or at least, that’s where it started.  “Right around the start of the game’s development back when we’re in that early period is right about when [Season 4 of Game of Thrones on HBO] was airing,” FFXVI producer Naoki Yoshida tells me. “We had seen it grow into this television show that was loved around the world, not just by older generations but younger generations as well. So we bought the Blu-Ray box of Seasons 1, 2, 3, and 4, and made everyone on the team watch it basically to get across to developers that this is what’s trending in the world – that this is the type of fantasy that people are enjoying.”  The Iron Kingdom  But Yoshida says the team took great caution to avoid FFXVI feeling like a carbon copy of Game of Thrones. While its inspirations are clear, it feels like its own thing after playing and watching the game for roughly five hours. Plus, with everything else going on in the game – specifically the Eikon vs. Eikon combat – the team drew on other sources of inspiration like Attack on Titan, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Godzilla, Ultraman, and more.  Not only does Game of Thrones inspire the story and world feel of Final Fantasy XVI, but it also inspires a lot of its visual style, according to art director Hiroshi Minagawa.  Final Fantasy XVI Art Director Hiroshi Minagawa  “When I joined the team and spoke with Takai-san about the overall look of the game, we had that broad stroke that we wanted to have something that’s going to have that Game of Thrones feel, that kind of pure standard high fantasy that you’d see in that type of program and visual medium,” he tells me.  While people today still argue where Game of Thrones began to falter, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who thinks the answer is somewhere in those first four seasons. Those episodes are fantastic television, and if FFXVI’s take on fantasy comes close to rivaling them, we could be in for something special. Fortunately, we don’t have too wait long because FFXVI hits PlayStation 5 on June 22.

Ejoy, the Alibaba (9988.HK) subsidiary behind the hugely popular strategy game, said on microblogging site Weibo that it would appeal the decision of the Guangzhou court, and that the game will continue to operate.  ""Three Kingdoms Tactics"" is Alibaba's most profitable game, earning more than $1.97 billion from player spending since launching in 2019, according to data firm App Magic.

The game follows a warrior with only 66 days left to live on a journey through a dark fantasy world reminiscent of that seen in this year’s Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.  Unlike that game, Phantom Blade Zero looks to be more of a character action game, with fast-paced melee combat similar to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. The game takes place in what is being described as “Phantom World,” a universe where Chinese kung fu mashes up with steampunk, arts of the occult, and other random things that float the boat of S-Game founder an CEO Soulframe Liang.  The game contains a semi-open world with large hand-crafted maps, and if you make the effort to overcome challenges and defeat powerful enemies, you’ll be rewarded with “weapons, armor, artifacts, skills, and other ways to customize or progress your character.” One of the aims of the gameplay is to empower players to unleash powerful combos without mindless button-mashing. But speaking of cool combos, Kenji Tanigaki is the game’s action director, and he is “the fight choreography master behind many of the classic martial arts films that inspired us.”  Phantom Blade Zero is in the works for PlayStation 5.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzY2FwaXN0bWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3BoYW50b20tYmxhZGUtemVyby1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQtdHJhaWxlci1wczUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2017-10-06","Not Discerned","{""Buffalo"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-25T04:01:00","Westside Gunn’s activities as a rapper, A&R, fashionista, and wrestling fan are well-documented, but within the Griselda family, Conway the Machine and Benny the Butcher have quietly been putting in work. Since its founding in 2016, Benny’s Black Soprano Family label has ballooned into a seven-man unit. The collective’s standout has always been Buffalo rapper Heem, a straightforward storyteller with a nimble and commanding voice. He’s more of a parallel to artists like Boldy James or Styles P than Benny: a street soldier with eyes in the back of his head, preoccupied with stark details that put you in the thick of the action.  His second album From the Cradle to the Game works from some of the oldest templates in rap history: rags to riches, make momma proud, put on for the homies, never forget where you came from. Heem spent his youth in one of Buffalo’s roughest areas, and every song on From the Cradle looks back at grisly moments from his teenage years. Take opener “Reasonable Doubt,” where he reflects on a crime that almost ended his career before it began, or “Cocaine County” which details his experience at the mixing bowl with unnerving specificity, from the sound the fork makes to the flip phones used to make the deal. “I’m the one who went to war, you never shot nothin’/BSF stand for: ‘you’d better stop frontin’,” he raps on the thumping “Radio Raheem, judging anyone who’d fake hardship for attention. Heem can be a guarded and tough presence, but any time spent above ground is a blessing; he seems grateful for the possibility of one day being able to swap “crack money for some real estate and businesses.”  Some songs—like the Tyrie Hames-produced “Picture Me Rollin” and the Marc Spano-produced “Same Ole G”—fall into bland Roc-A-Fella worship, while others deploy the same crunchy mid-tempo stomp that you hear from most Griselda affiliates. Specific flourishes keep the album from lulling: Take the mandolin strings and vocal sample Hames adds to “Mamie Lee” or the soulful minimalism of Jansport J’s work on “Long Way Home,” both of which suit Heem’s traditionalist style.  What Heem brings to the table, and what From the Cradle excels at more than anything, is highlighting the conflicting emotions he’s felt while on the road from nothing to something. He seamlessly shifts between remorseless and wounded, hard-nosed and contemplative, and the cracks in his voice naturally emphasize his struggles.

The Georgia-Florida game has been played in Jacksonville since 1933, except for the 1994 and 1995 seasons during the construction of TIAA Bank Field. The Bulldogs and Gators are scheduled to meet on Oct. 28 for this year's matchup.  The extension comes after Georgia head coach Kirby Smart expressed recruiting concerns with playing the game in Jacksonville prior to their most recent matchup last October, because NCAA rules don't allow schools to host recruits at neutral sites.  ""We're allowed to use tickets, but we can't host them,"" Smart said last October. ""We can't do anything. So I never understood -- I never understand -- what would we do with them? We can't legally see them. We can't talk to them, we can't host them. Visit with them.  ""We can say, 'There's a ticket at the gate. Enjoy the game.' So that's really all we can do. We'll do that. We'll have some kids go to the game.""  Georgia athletic director Josh Brooks said in a release, ""We are pleased with the decision to exercise the option that will keep the game in Jacksonville for 2024 and 2025. We look forward to discussions that I'm sure will continue over the next couple years exploring all the options for 2026 and beyond. We continue to be appreciative of the working relationship we have with the University of Florida and the City of Jacksonville.""  Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said, ""The City of Jacksonville has been an historic host for one of the great rivalry games in all of college football. We are excited to have the game in Jacksonville for another two seasons.""  Georgia has won five of the last six meetings, most recently a 42-20 victory on Oct. 30, 2022, and leads the all-time series 55-44-2 (or 54-44-2, per Florida records).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzIyODUxL2dlb3JnaWEtZmxvcmlkYS1yaXZhbHJ5LWdhbWUtc3RheWluZy1qYWNrc29udmlsbGUtMjAyNdIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzIyODUxL2dlb3JnaWEtZmxvcmlkYS1yaXZhbHJ5LWdhbWUtc3RheWluZy1qYWNrc29udmlsbGUtMjAyNT9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Royals hadn’t won a single game in the 10th region tournament in nine years. Their last victory being against the Nicholas County Blue Jackets in the quarterfinals in 2014. Their luck finally turned around this game, having held the Mustangs to zero.  Mason County’s star pitcher, Landon Scilley, was on fire on the mound this game, throwing 88 pitches across all seven innings, with ten strikeouts. Scilley has been an important asset to the Royals all season long, and led his team to victory over the Mustangs. Backing Scilley up behind the mound, were the rest of the Royals strongest gloves, Connor Butler, Eli Porter and Cole Horch in the outfield, all having made necessary plays to keep the Royals ahead.  “The catch out in left, by Connor, you know that was a bullet, his speed allowed him to go get that. He’s made those plays all season. The double-play up the middle, with Westin Messer and Trey Cracraft that was a huge play to get us outta that inning there, and it kept the momentum our way. Cole Horch out here in right field, sliding grab right here in this last inning, another huge play. My pitching has been really good, I feel confident in any arm that goes out there, and that’s because of the gloves behind them.” said Royals head coach, Jason Butler.  In the top of the third, Butler made a diving catch in left field for the first out of the inning, Messer and Cracraft getting Ben Doyle out advancing to second, and Evan Moore out advancing to home in the top of the fourth to end the inning, and Horch made a diving catch in the bottom of the seventh to get an out in foul territory for the second out of the inning.  The only run this game came off of a home run from Cray Fite in the bottom of the fourth. The slugger was down 1-2 in the count, and nailed the fourth pitch thrown over the fence in left field to score the Royals first and only run of the game.  “It was good to come out in that first inning and see us put the bat on the ball. Had a couple miscommunications there in that first inning, but its okay because I trust my guys. Landon Scilley on the base pass is one of the biggest threats in the region. You gotta try to make some things happen early, put them on their heels and let that other team know that Mason County’s here to play baseball.” said coach Butler.  Mason County shut out the Mustangs, and won 1-0 in the top of the seventh. The Royals will take on the Harrison County Thoroughbreds this evening in the semifinal round of the tournament. The ‘Breds advanced to the semifinals after having beaten the Bourbon County Colonels 6-2 in the second game of the night.  The Royals plan to spend Tuesday practicing and preparing for their game against the ‘Breds, in hopes to advance to the championship round.  “We’ll go back and we’ll have a great practice, we had great preparation leafing up to this game. They;re dialed in, they know there’s a prize ahead of them. It doesn’t matter who we play we’ll show up and we’ll be ready to play. I think a clean practice tomorrow, we won’t change anything as far as our routine, and we’ll be ready for Wednesday.” said coach Butler.

Slavin was later ruled out for the game with an upper-body injury.  Slavin was playing the puck behind his own net when Bennett laid a massive check on the Hurricanes' top blueliner, who subsequently hit his head on the boards while falling to the ice. Slavin attempted to stand but struggled regaining his balance. He was eventually helped off the ice and escorted to the Carolina locker room by a trainer.  There was no penalty called on Bennett for the hit. However, ensuring reaction from Slavin's teammates -- slashing by Brent Burns and cross-checking by Jordan Martinook -- put Florida on a power play.  Carolina was already down 1-0 when Slavin went out, after Anthony Duclair scored 41 seconds into the first period. The Hurricanes were swept by Florida in the best-of-seven series with Wednesday's loss to end their season.  Slavin has been a playmaker for the Hurricanes all season and has two goals and six points in 14 playoff games. He is averaging 24 minutes in ice time during the postseason.  Hurricanes forward Stefan Noesen also left the bench during the first period, though no update was provided on his status.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzI0NDUzL2h1cnJpY2FuZXMtamFjY29iLXNsYXZpbi1nYW1lLTQtdnMtcGFudGhlcnMtdXBwZXItYm9keS1pbmp1cnnSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uaGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzcyNDQ1My9odXJyaWNhbmVzLWphY2NvYi1zbGF2aW4tZ2FtZS00LXZzLXBhbnRoZXJzLXVwcGVyLWJvZHktaW5qdXJ5P3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The loss was the fourth in a row for Fayetteville and drops the club to 0-4 in extra inning games this season.  Jose Guedez allowed a single run in the top of the first inning, but dominated for the rest of his outing. The right-hander out of Venezuela struck out four of the last five hitters he faced and retired ten in a row before departing in the fifth inning.  Jackson Loftin spotted Fayetteville the lead in the fourth, singling to center to drive home Garrett McGowan. An errant throw coming in from center field on the play allowed Leosdany Molina to score as well for the 2-1 advantage. Loftin would steal third and score on a wild pitch later in the inning to cap a three-run rally.  In the sixth, Myrtle Beach cut it to a 3-2 game on an RBI single from Rafael Morel. Fayetteville quickly counter punched in the bottom of the inning, loading the bases while facing Dominic Hambley. Narbe Cruz was hit by a pitch, granting McGowan home plate for a 4-2 lead.

"game","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-25T00:01:00","Earlier this week Wingspan designer Elizabeth Hargrave wrote a Twitter thread outlining a glaring issue the board game industry has with representation: namely, that there simply aren’t enough games winning awards and getting published that have been designed by women.    It’s not a tough argument to make! Board games are a huge and social industry, played by people of all persuasions all over the world, but as Hargrave points out the nominees for the Spiel des Jahres—board gaming’s biggest award, picked from the creators of the biggest games of the year—have overwhelmingly been men:  Advertisement  The sane response to this would be to say, yes, this is a problem! Board game design has traditionally been dominated by white men, but as the market has grown and evolved, the demographics of published and award-winning designers (you need to be the former before you can become the latter) has failed to grow alongside it. More work needs to be done to encourage more women—and more people who aren’t white men—to get into game design and get their games published, because as Hargrave says, we’re “restricting the brainpower and life experience that goes into games”, and “Our gaming choices are poorer for it.”  Advertisement Advertisement  Ryan Dancey, COO of Alderac, took a different approach. To avoid paraphrasing, I’ll just leave his direct reply to Hargraves here in full:  I have taken more than 1,000 game pitches since 2016. I would say that less than 10% of those were from female designers. Effectively none of them were games AEG would publish. We did a call for submissions from female designers specifically; we got one publishable design -@elizhargrave‘s Mariposas. There have been a couple of pitches that came close; most commonly where a female pitched with a male designer. There is one team of two female designers that pitch great but their games are too light for us. I know why we didn’t proceed with those pitches but they were at least in the ballpark. Typically when I am pitched by a female, the game tends to fall into one of several broad categories: * It’s a game about politics; in general, we don’t publish games about politics * It’s a party game; in general, we don’t publish party games * It’s a pitch from a designer very early in their design journey and the game isn’t competitive in the modern market - it usually is either too much like another game, or very generic, or its more of an idea than game design —— I’ve never been pitched a wargame by a female. I’ve never been pitched a 2-player fighting game by a female. I’ve never been pitched a giant fighting robots game by a female. I actually don’t think there’s much of a market in those categories because there is so much competition, but I wonder if a game design by a female would be orthogonal to the existing designer patterns and produce something remarkable. —— I think there is a significant gap between when someone decides to try and become a game designer and when they produce their first publishable game. Life in that gap consists of a lot of rejection and negative criticism. I wonder if that gap accounts for a good part of the missing female design cohort - females are socialized in the West to avoid situations where they’re subjected to fairly harsh criticism of their abilities and creative ideas. Males are socialized to take the punches and keep moving forward. Getting across the gap is how you turn someone into a “real game designer” who gets paid for their work and who makes designs that are attractive to publishers. —— So far, we haven’t seen much award consideration go to games that exist almost entirely as crowdfunding projects. I know there are many more females doing game design & production via crowdfunding who just don’t connect with publishers. The nature of the SdJ is that a crowdfunding game is effectively shut out from consideration.  Advertisement  To Dancey’s credit, he has since apologised and asked people to “hold him accountable” :  Yesterday I engaged in a discussion about the lack of representation of women as designers in the gaming community. It was not my finest moment. I’m embarrassed and mad at myself for the tone and content of my contribution to that discussion. It doesn’t reflect my views and it certainly doesn’t reflect the views of the company I work for. I’m sorry for any harm I have caused and any offense I have given. This topic is extremely important to me and I want to be a part of the solution not a part of the problem. I’ve discussed both my poor original message and the aftermath with my leadership team and with the rest of our company and I want to outline some concrete steps that we’ll be taking to do better in this regard. * We are going to actively connect with designers from under-represented demographic groups, especially women, and offer mentorship and development support of their projects even if AEG is not publishing games of that kind. * Some people have suggested various organizations that could benefit from our support. We will proactively reach out to the groups that we have been made aware of and aggressively look at pitches from members of these groups. * Our goal has been to publish the very best games, we are going to expand that goal to help and provide more support to the people who we want to be in business with get to a place where they are being seen and published. Check back with me in a year and hold me accountable; I’ll provide updates as we make progress.  Advertisement  But the fact he was thinking any of that stuff originally, let alone writing it publicly, let along replying directly to one of the few successful women designers in board games really says a lot about Hargraves’ original points, not just about women but other marginalised designers as well. Something the industry has been struggling mightily with these past few years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8va290YWt1LmNvbS9ib2FyZC1nYW1lLXNleGlzbS13b21lbi1kZXNpZ25lcnMtcmVwcmVzZW50YXRpb24tMTg1MDQ3MjczOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But there have been few candidates as good as the 2023 Boston Celtics. Maybe none.  Of the other 150 teams that were down 3-0 in a best-of-seven series, 126 (84%) of them had a worse record than their opponent in the regular season. The Celtics were 13 games better than the Miami Heat this season, the biggest such differential for the 151 teams that have been down 3-0.  The Heat actually had the worst regular-season winning percentage (.537) of the *121 different teams in NBA history that have held a 3-0 series lead. By winning percentage, this is the third biggest differential for a trailing team in the 151 3-0 series, with one of the two series that had a bigger differential being the Heat’s conference semifinals win over the Milwaukee Bucks in 2020.  * 27 teams have led multiple best-of-seven series 3-0. That includes the 2017 Warriors, who had 3-0 leads in all four of their series, losing only Game 4 of the Finals.  Statistically, that 2020 Heat team (+2.7 per 100 possessions, seventh best) was a little closer to those Bucks (+9.4, first) than this one (-0.5, 21st) was to the Celtics (+6.7, first) in the regular season. That series also came after a 20-week hiatus in the season. The other 3-0 series with a bigger discrepancy took place 76 years ago, before the NBA was called the NBA.

And a lot of the Heat’s postseason success is about hot shooting.  But the Celtics are still in a big hole, they’ve yet to win three straight games in these playoffs, and the last time they won four straight was before the All-Star break. There are reasons beyond “make or miss” for the Heat’s 3-1 series lead, and the Celtics aren’t the only quality opponent that Miami has out-executed in this postseason.  Boston did take the first step toward making history on Tuesday, winning Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals. Here are three things to look for as the series goes back to Boston for Game 5 on Thursday (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT).    1. Better reads  It is a make-or-miss league, and the Celtics had almost as many 3-pointers in Game 4 (18-for-45, 40%) as they did in Games 2 and 3 combined (21-for-77, 27%). There wasn’t a significant increase in ball or player movement, and the percentage of their 3-point attempts that were off the catch was only slightly higher (70% in Games 2 and 3, 73% in Game 4).  But the Celtics’ stars seemed to read the Miami defense better, forcing tough shots and drives into traffic less often.  On Boston’s third possession of Game 4, Jaylen Brown was isolated against Gabe Vincent, a defender he’s tried to attack quite often in this series. But after setting a cross-screen for Jayson Tatum, Al Horford made a sharp cut toward the basket, catching Kevin Love off guard. That drew Max Strus into the paint and left Derrick White open in the left corner. Brown first looked to hit Horford, but read the defense well and threw a long pass to White, who drained an in-rhythm 3 …  Later in the first quarter, the Heat had some switch confusion on a back-screen, leaving Marcus Smart open in the post. And as soon as Vincent came over to help, Smart sent a cross-court pass to Brown for another corner 3. Late in the period, Brown made a sharp pass to Robert Williams III for a dunk after Williams set a flare screen and rolled to the rim …  The Heat are a great defensive team, but there are openings to be exploited, especially with the attention they’re paying to Tatum and Brown. Every half second counts and continuing to make quick and smart decisions can help the Celtics score in their half-court offense.  “It’s been taking us a little while to kind of figure it out,” Brown said after Game 4. “It ain’t always going to be you scoring the ball normally because they’re not guarding us normally.”  2. Turnovers and transition  The Heat have lived late in the clock, taking 29% of their shots in the last seven seconds, compared to the Celtics’ 14%. But both offenses would prefer not to play in the half-court and, instead, take advantage of transition opportunities. And it’s not a coincidence that the game they won (Game 4) was the first in this series in which the Celtics had fewer turnovers than the Heat.  All turnovers are not created equal, of course. While the overall number was even (15-15) in Game 1, the Celtics had six more live-ball turnovers (12) than the Heat (six). That difference was plus-7 and plus-4 (bad numbers) for Boston in Games 2 and 3, and minus-3 (5-8) in Game 4.  You don’t need a live-ball turnover to run, though, and the Celtics were sometimes able to push off a made basket on the other end of the floor to get a good shot …  Corner 3s are generally good shots, and the Celtics attempted more corner 3s in Game 4 (6-for-16) than they did in Games 2 and 3 combined (4-for-14).  Transition opportunities will continue to be critical for both teams. Getting them starts with getting stops and preventing them begins with executing offensively and not turning the ball over.  “When they score, it’s easy to set your defense,” Tatum said Tuesday. “But you’re getting stops, you’re getting turnovers, and you’re running. Maybe it’s a cross match, you find a mismatch or something. That’s how we want to play with pace.”  3. Butler in isolation  According to Second Spectrum tracking, Jimmy Butler has isolated 18.3 times per game in this series, up from just 8.3 times per game through the first two rounds. His 73 isolations over the four games are 43 more than any player in either conference finals series and 24 more than Brown (27) and Tatum (22) combined. Many of those have been true isolations, with Butler on one side of the floor and his four teammates all on the other side.  The Heat haven’t been as efficient with Butler in isolation in this series (1.06 points per chance) as they were through the first two rounds (1.16). And Game 4 was their least efficient of the four in that regard (0.76), with Grant Williams’ block of a Butler turnaround jumper being the highlight on the Boston side …  There was no real secret to the Celtics’ success vs. Butler (who still scored 29 points) in Game 4. They were sharper defensively in general, doing a better job of staying in front of Butler’s drives and staying down on his pump fakes. They switched most screens and the defender against whom Butler attempted the most shots (3-for-7) was Rob Williams, who’s big and bouncy.  If they can be similarly successful in Game 5, the Celtics could be halfway to history.  * * *  John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(WTVD) -- The Carolina Hurricanes lost 3-4 to Florida Panthers Wednesday night in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals.  Matthew Tkachuk scored a power-play goal with 4.9 seconds left, Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 36 shots to cap off a brilliant series, and the Florida Panthers earned their first trip to the Stanley Cup Final in 27 years by beating the Carolina Hurricanes 4-3 on Wednesday night to win the Eastern Conference title in a sweep.  Tkachuk's goal was his second of the night - and maybe the biggest in Panthers' history. The Panthers will play either Vegas or Dallas for the Stanley Cup starting sometime next week; Vegas currently leads the Western Conference title series 3-0.  The Panthers scored 10 goals in the series, and Bobrovsky ensured those were all they needed. Four games, four one-goal wins, three of them coming from Tkachuk in dramatic fashion - two in overtime to end Games 1 and 2, and then this one to cap Florida's stunning rise from No. 8 seed to East champions.  Ryan Lomberg and Anthony Duclair had the other goals for Florida, which swept a series for the first time in franchise history.  Jordan Staal - his brothers Eric and Marc play for the Panthers - took a tripping penalty with 57 seconds left in regulation, setting up the power-play that Tkachuk finished off.  Jesper Fast seemed like he might have saved the season for Carolina, getting a tying goal with 3:22 left in regulation. Paul Stastny and Teuvo Teravainen had the first two goals of the night for the Hurricanes, while Brady Skjei and Jordan Martinook each had two assists.  But the night - the series, too - belonged to the Panthers. They were swept by Colorado in the 1996 final.  The tone was set early. Duclair scored 41 seconds into the contest, and not even a minute later Florida's Sam Bennett delivered a hard hit - but clean, in the sense that it drew no penalty - to Carolina's Jaccob Slavin behind the Hurricanes' net.  Towels waved, strobe lights flashed, and the fans wasted no time letting the Panthers know that they were ready to a clincher.  Tkachuk made it 2-0 on the power play midway through the first. Carolina - a 113-point, division-championship-winning team in the regular season - made it 2-1 later in the first on Stastny's goal, and Teravainen tied it early in the second.  Lomberg's goal midway through the second gave Florida the lead again. It stayed that way until Fast got the equalizer with 3:22 left, and then Tkachuk finished it off - getting the Panthers to the title round in his first season.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2Nhcm9saW5hLWh1cnJpY2FuZXMtbmhsLXBsYXlvZmZzLXNjaGVkdWxlLWdhbWUvMTMyOTI4NTgv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmMxMS5jb20vYW1wL2Nhcm9saW5hLWh1cnJpY2FuZXMtbmhsLXBsYXlvZmZzLXNjaGVkdWxlLWdhbWUvMTMyOTI4NTgv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In the footage, EA and Codemasters’s Social and Content Manager PJ Tierney uses the generic and customisable player car, starting from 22nd on the grid of a three-lap race.  Held at night – as will the actual race in November – there’s a relatively short sprint into the first corner, a sweeping left-hander. After Turn 4, there’s a high-speed straight leading into a tricky, and tight, Turn 5 to Turn 9 complex abutting the illuminated Sphere venue.  Further around the lap, we head down Las Vegas Boulevard. While the asphalt is mostly a simple straight line with a kink, it’s adorned on either side by large hotels and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant – all faithfully recreated in-game. The average speed for the venue is set to be among the highest on the calendar.  The trackside furniture appears to be the main draw here, as opposed to the layout itself, although we’ll reserve final judgment for when the game ships next month, and perhaps more pertinently, the grand prix later in the year.  Unlike many contemporary rivals, the Formula 1 game does not use laser-scan technology to recreate its circuits. Instead, the Vegas venue has been recreated using reference images and photogrammetry data.  “Our team has designed a wonderful virtual recreation of one of the most exciting and striking cities in the world,” said Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters.  “The sheer scale and density of the buildings in Las Vegas has been a fun challenge for the team along with the vibrance and energy of The Strip lit up for the Saturday night race. It took over 1900 days of cumulative development time to deliver that level of authenticity.”  The footage also showcases the Champions Edition limited-time pre-order Las Vegas-themed customisation items: namely a chrome car livery, race suit, gloves and crash helmet.  Of note, Tierney’s team-mate appears to be Pastor Maldonado, the one-time Grand Prix winner presumably part of the My Team icons this season, again part of the Champions Edition.  The footage can be watched on Formula 1’s YouTube channel.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yc3BvcnQuY29tL2dhbWluZy9uZXdzL2ZpcnN0LWxhcy12ZWdhcy1nYW1lcGxheS11bnZlaWxlZC13aXRoaW4tZjEtMjMtZ2FtZS8xMDQ3MzAwMi_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb3RvcnNwb3J0LmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvbmV3cy9maXJzdC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtZ2FtZXBsYXktdW52ZWlsZWQtd2l0aGluLWYxLTIzLWdhbWUvMTA0NzMwMDIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(0:45)  SUNRISE, Fla. -- Florida Panthers' captain Aleksander Barkov will be back in the lineup for Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals Wednesday after leaving the first period of Game 3 with a lower-body injury.  The Panthers lead their best-of-seven series with Carolina 3-0 and can reach a Stanley Cup Final for the second time in franchise history with a victory in Wednesday's tilt.  ""Ready to roll,"" was how Florida coach Paul Maurice classified Barkov following the Panthers' morning skate, which Barkov was a full participant in. ""Freshest guy on the ice,"" he said.  There was 7:04 remaining in the first period of Monday's game when Barkov took a hip check from Carolina forward Nick Drury and immediately retired to Florida's dressing room. His return was deemed ""questionable"" from there.  The shorthanded Panthers went on to beat Carolina 1-0. Maurice joked in explanation for Barkov's absence that the center was ""at a bar mitzvah. ... He didn't want to disappoint the kids."" The Panthers' coach clarified Tuesday that Barkov's injury wasn't serious, and his health status would be reevaluated prior to Game 4, when Florida would make a decision on his availability.  Having Barkov centering the Panthers' top line again is a major boost. He's tallied four goals and 12 points in 15 playoff games so far and is Florida's most trusted performer in the faceoff dot.  It's not just Barkov's on-ice abilities that impact the Panthers. Maurice stressed Wednesday morning that Barkov's leadership and attitude are just as critical for Florida, especially when so much is on the line in this postseason.  ""He's possibly uncomfortable with the idea that he's talked about more than other players,"" said Maurice. ""He would think [the other] 13 forwards are every bit as important as he is, and he believes it and that's the way he treats everybody. Most guys, they think that when they get to that elite level, they do have this kind of ego ... but he seems to be completely devoid of ego and still pushes himself very hard.

Illustration: by Diego Patiño  There is a woman in Elden Ring who offers her embrace to all intrepid travelers of the Lands Between. She can be found in Roundtable Hold, the moldering bastion of an ancient order of knights that serves as the game’s hubzone. Players come here to reinforce weapons, to complete questlines, and — if the mood suits them — to accept a hug from a mysterious old crone in a black shawl, sitting quietly on a cot in one of the Hold’s dusty apartments. She pulls you close to her bosom, whispers a few elliptical koans into your ear, then releases you back into your adventure. Nothing about this encounter alters the scope of Elden Ring, save for the tiny, almost imperceptible icon that has suddenly materialized below your health bar.  That icon, as it turns out, represents a minor tax on your character’s total hit points. It is transmitted to any character who shares that quiet moment with the crone, and it is entirely possible to finish Elden Ring without realizing that your lifeforce has been enfeebled by her treachery. It’s easy to lift the curse: Player inventories contain an item called “Baldachin’s Blessing”; cast it and your vigor will be restored. But the game never prompts you with that solution or even tips that there’s a problem in the first place. Elden Ring, as always, keeps its players in the dark.  The infamous hug was at the heart of a backlash that consumed Elden Ring after it received a round of rave reviews upon its release in February. FromSoftware, the studio behind Elden Ring and other modern classics like Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, has achieved mythical status among gamers for its sphinxlike design principles. Levels are labyrinthine and proudly Machiavellian; an enemy in the first Dark Souls can permanently sever half your health bar with a debuff; the cure is sold by a nondescript merchant on the other edge of the continent. Worldbuilding is teased out through cryptographic item descriptions and environmental context clues. Want to unlock Bloodborne’s True Ending? First you must retrace your steps back to the very beginning of the game to find and consume three pieces of an eldritch umbilical cord. FromSoftware gives no quarter to its audience; its catalogue is free of waypoints, quest logs, tutorials, or expository labels. You either figure out what that lady did to you in Roundtable Hold or you don’t. Elden Ring doesn’t care either way.  The studio’s indifferent approach to game development has been surprisingly influential for the rest of the industry. 2023’s most important release is The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, a sequel to the vaunted Breath of the Wild, which gives players a wide expanse of Hyrule and asks them to find their own version of fun. Inquisitive players will slowly decipher the game’s toolbox and learn how to fuse together automotive contraptions from the plywood and battery engines lying around the arena. Others might miss that opportunity — or, perhaps more likely, be simply unwilling to summon the patience to understand the systems — rendering the game an empty, solidarity experience. Although Tears of the Kingdom is an inherently kinder game than Elden Ring, Nintendo, much like FromSoftware, has constructed a masterpiece out of liberation and frustration. Not everyone is equipped to come along on the ride.  Last March, a number of professional game developers criticized what they felt was Elden Ring’s poor user interface. “[It’s] so bad I can only imagine FromSoft’s devs smoking at their desk and using CRT monitors,” tweeted Ahmed Salama, a UX director at Ubisoft Stockholm. Blake Rebouche at Guerilla Games agreed, bemoaning Elden Ring’s “quest design.” These complaints make sense when you understand the full context. Both Ubisoft and Guerilla are responsible for a number of vast open-world games that operate on a wholly different wavelength from Elden Ring. In Assassin’s Creed, Ubisoft’s flagship franchise, the world map is speckled with markers denoting collectibles, raids, loot to be plundered, and NPCs to converse with. There is never a moment when you are disoriented; the developers would never dare saddle the player with a furtive, debilitating status effect to saturate the vividness of the fiction.  Developers are not wrong for thinking that Elden Ring is punishing in the way it withholds information — but ironically to fans of FromSoftware, those very hindrances are crucial to the game’s appeal. Last year, an image went viral on Twitter parodying what Elden Ring might look like if it was developed by Ubisoft. The immense, arcane vistas are now cluttered in a miasma of meters, doodads, and button prompts. A compass at the top of the screen keeps track of all the enemies in our wake; text in the corner reminds us to visit the Elden Shop, where we will surely spend a tranche of in-game currency on a brochure of cosmetics — all tiered by rarity, of course. To the Elden Ring community, this would be a fundamental desecration of the game’s veiled splendor. The fans have made themselves clear: They relish a video game that leaves them feeling a little lost, or confused, or unsure about where to go next, even if that sensation is completely antithetical to the tenets of modern game design.  It’s a fool’s errand to try to make a game for everyone. — Alex Beachum, ""Outer Wilds"" co-creator  “It’s the idea of a game being this large, complex thing that exists stoically, without interacting with you, that you can explore. It makes you feel like an archaeologist, rather than exploring something linear that presents its entirety on its face,” says Andrew Shouldice, the programmer, designer, and artist behind 2022 standout Tunic. “The joy of discovery, I think, is dependent on the possibility of you not having found it. Otherwise it doesn’t really feel like a discovery. There need to be things that don’t want to be found, and they can’t talk to you as a player before they’re found.”  Tunic elevates Elden Ring’s difficulty to a comical degree. It is, on the surface, a top-down Zelda facsimile, except that everything in the game is written in an imaginary, glyph-based language. The player has no guidance in navigating this world, so they feel around in the shadows, generating their own postulations about the game’s esoteric secrets, letting Tunic’s opacity seep into their skin. When you put the pieces together — when you figure out, say, the fast-travel system that’s lying in plain sight — your imagination is nudged further down the rabbit hole. What else could they possibly be hiding? Shouldice believes this is one of the most sacred sensations in gaming, and perhaps a tradition that has fallen by the wayside.  “If you’re playing the original Legend of Zelda for the first time and you didn’t know there were walls you could bomb open, you accidentally do it for the first time, and you’re like, Holy shit. Every wall is suddenly a question mark,” he says. “That feeling, where you turn back and look at everything differently, is the most exciting thing to me.”  Alex Beachum, co-creative lead on 2019’s sublime Outer Wilds, goes further. He tells me that his design philosophy doubles as a protest against the trends he’s witnessed at big-budget, triple-A studios. “There’s the modern open-world game, where you can’t see the map because of all the UI icons on it,” says Beachum. “I hate that stuff so much. I’m the guy who modded The Witcher III to get rid of the mini-map.” Outer Wilds takes place in a tiny, overlooked solar system — five planets, three moons, and a comet — which you probe with a modest wooden space shuttle. You blast off in any direction, and about ten hours later you may finally solve the mystery of our collective cosmic existence. The game is hugely ambitious and dogmatically hands-off in its interface.  “The goal was to make an exploration game that was driven by player curiosity and nothing else,” says Beachum. “There are no quest markers, because then players would just be following the markers, and not of their own volition.”  Like Elden Ring, Outer Wilds has been regarded as a masterpiece because of the way the environment seems to crack open in strange and fascinating ways the more you tug at it with your mouse and keyboard. But I’ve also spoken to plenty of people who bounced off of the game entirely. Maybe they found themselves marooned in deep space with no recourse, or maybe they missed a keystone to an early puzzle, which sent them off course and left them adrift. The latent wonders of Outer Wilds never grabbed them, so they moved on to other games and other responsibilities. Beachum made peace with that inevitability long ago; not everyone is meant to solve this mystery.  “It used to be way worse, but by the end of the development, fewer people were falling off the bandwagon. Every game is like that to a certain extent. It’s a fool’s errand to try to make a game for everyone, because that will make it the blandest thing,” he says. “We’re constantly trying to make people curious, but I’ve always wondered what our curiosity conversion rate is. I want to know how many people go in without a lot of natural curiosity and we hook them, rather than people who are always going to like our game.”  Beachum tells me about one memorable playtest, as Outer Wilds was rounding into shape, with a focus group that featured a staunch Call of Duty loyalist. Beachum did not expect him to fall in love with a tender space opera that included no combat, a lot of reading, and a layman’s lesson in quantum entanglement — but somehow the game got its hooks in him. The frustration morphed into bliss, as it has for so many gamers before.  Still, as someone who adores Outer Wilds, and Tunic, and Elden Ring, it’s hard for me to assert that anyone who doesn’t savor their inscrutable riddles is wrong. That accursed hug only increased my appetite for more of From Software’s twisted ciphers, and maybe that makes me the weirdo. (Many of these concerns also tie in to a larger conversation about accessibility. Recently, studios have introduced a suite of options designed to make their games more playable for disabled participants — high-contrast modes for visually impaired gamers, universal subtitles for deaf gamers, and so on.)  Sometimes a studio’s attempts to create a truly self-directed world can backfire and the wide-open panoramas actually impede a player’s ability to mesh with the setting. After all, nothing reminds you that you’re playing a video game, with all sorts of video game-y problems, than being unable to determine what action is required to proceed to the next level. But I will say that towards the end of Elden Ring, you might find yourself in a secret arena called the Consecrated Snowfield. The steps it takes to arrive there are ridiculously cryptic, to the point of being almost impossible without a guide, but if you make it to the edge of the tundra, your character will pass through a secluded portal into a place known as the Haligtree — a massive, verdant redwood, pockmarked with oozing funguses, with entire townships resting on its branches. The enemy encounters there are extremely difficult, punctuated by the single hardest boss ever constructed by FromSoftware.  It’s one of the most memorable sequences I’ve ever played through on my PC.  And yet the Haligtree can be completely overlooked if you never stumble across it. The credits will still roll at the end of Elden Ring with an entire unexplored universe resting on your hard drive. You may then comb over the YouTube walkthroughs and Fandom pages afterward marveling at everything you missed — the overwhelming scale of it all burbling in your chest. All those unknown elements in the game can be frustrating, yes, but also alluring. Perhaps that’s one secret to great game design: the majesty doesn’t need to be played in order to be felt.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1kaWZmaWN1bHR5LWZyb21zb2Z0d2FyZS1lbGRlbi1yaW5nLXRlYXJzLW9mLXRoZS1raW5nZG9tLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Charlotte"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T20:11:30","by  Game on: Old school play still holds sway  PHOTO | AALIYAH BOWDEN Cecelia Bain-Ross (left), Donna Kirts, and Linda Bain-Clark (right) sitting at Polo Clubhouse at Mountain Island Lake, a senior citizen community, play the board game Mahjong.  Game night is a little different in 2023.    Every Tuesday, Linda Bain-Clark gathers to play Mahjong with her sister and a couple of her neighbors at the Polo Clubhouse at Mountain Island Lake.    Bain-Clark started playing a couple of years ago after there was a sign posted in her neighborhood.    “I think it's good. It's the game that really excites me,” Bain-Clark, 76, said. “I think it's a game of strategy. You have to think and plan moves. I play with a group of wonderful women and they are just delightful and we have a really good time together.”    Bain-Clark’s sister, Cecelia Bain-Ross said she enjoys spending time with friends and Mahjong.    “The camaraderie is wonderful and everybody's on a level playing field,” said Bain-Ross, 70, who has played for three years.” “It doesn't matter who you are, how well you play. If you like to have fun, it's just a nice game.”    Even though the game originated in China, between 60 to 70% of people who play Mahjong are Jewish. There is no data that shows how many African Americans play. Mahjong is played with four people and has rectangular pieces with illustrations of Chinese characters and symbols called tiles. The object is to collect winning sets of tiles similar to the card game gin rummy.    Some people still play board games like Monopoly or Taboo while others resort to card games like Uno, Spades, or Black Card Revoked. During the pandemic, board games made a comeback when folks were stuck in the house with their family.    According to a 2020 survey, more younger people enjoyed playing board games compared to older generations. In the survey, 38% of Gen Zers found them very enjoyable while only 31% of Baby Boomers found board games somewhat enjoyable. Thirty-eight percent of younger Americans enjoy playing board games more than older generations.    Now that game night is back, are board games still played?    “I actually recently played both board games and card games with my brother, sister, and our cousin when he came to visit about two weeks ago,” said Gamah Toney of Charlotte.    “We ended up playing Trouble, and we played a few other board games and a card game. I think between the two I would say that I had the most fun playing the board games —definitely interactive fun.”    Toney, 24, said her favorite board games are Monopoly, Clue, Guess Who, and Scrabble.    According to an unscientific poll by The Post, 57% of participants said they preferred card games, while about 43% said they like board games more. Two people said they enjoyed both.    Card games have grown in popularity among young people. “I think our generation just from what I've observed and what's popular, definitely more card games,” said Toney.  Chris Ford, who lives in Greenville, N.C., prefers card games. His favorites are Uno and spades.    “Card games, because for one you don’t have to worry about bringing out a big board, and then cards, you can pretty much bring them out anytime and just have fun,” Ford, 26, said. “I will say it’s becoming card games, like Questions, especially towards dating. Whenever it’s time to have a drinking game, people mainly pull out a card game.”    Ford added that on weekends when he is relaxing with his family, they may play Monopoly.    Whether you play board games or card games, it’s OK. Both are good for improving brain function, relieves stress, and are great ways to socialize with family and friends.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoYXJsb3R0ZXBvc3QuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8yNC9saWZlLWFuZC1yZWxpZ2lvbi9nYW1lLW9uLW9sZC1zY2hvb2wtcGxheS1zdGlsbC1ob2xkcy1zd2F5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-06-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T16:28:14","No one is quite as helpful for getting through a post-apocalypse as Will Smith, and that’s great news for survivors in the upcoming survival game Undawn. Developers Lightspeed Studios and Level Infinite released a new trailer for the game on Wednesday that announces its latest character, Trey Jones, who will be played by Smith.  It appears that the developers are pulling bits of inspiration for the character from Smith’s past roles, especially his character Robert Neville from I Am Legend. In that movie, Smith plays a lone survivor in a bleak urban setting, which certainly seems to fit Undawn’s general themes.  The developers have announced this appearance as Smith’s video game debut, which is surprisingly sort of true. Despite 30-plus years of stardom, Smith hasn’t appeared in any games beyond sitting for some cover art and a very rough approximation of Agent J in Men in Black II: Alien Escape. But he’s never voiced a character in a game before — although we still haven’t seen him speak in Undawn either.  Undawn is an open-world survival game that allows players to gather resources, build bases, and team up with other players to survive the world and dangers of an irradiated world. Undawn is currently allowing players to pre-register for early access to the game, as well as other rewards, and had a closed beta test in April. The game is set for release on Android, iOS, and Windows on June 15.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzM1ODA4L3dpbGwtc21pdGgtdW5kYXduLWdhbWUtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRl0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucG9seWdvbi5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wLzIzNzM1ODA4L3dpbGwtc21pdGgtdW5kYXduLWdhbWUtcmVsZWFzZS1kYXRl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We didn't see anything in the way of actual gameplay from the Fairgame$ trailer, but according to a post on the PlayStation blog, it's a competitive heist game about robbing the ultra-rich. And it the trailer is any indication, there will be a lot of grappling hooks and breaking into giant vaults and mansions involved. It seems to include teams competing against one another to rob absurdly loaded mansions, with a pretty hefty dose of Payday vibes.  Fairgame$ PlayStation Showcase 2023 Trailer 11 Images  Haven was first announced back in 2021 as a new Montreal-based studio intended to ""create worlds where players can escape, have fun, express themselves, and find community."" Raymond founded it on the heels of her departure from Google after her Stadia-focused studio there was shut down. Previously, Raymond has been known for her work on the Assassin's Creed franchise.  Later, Sony acquired Haven entirely, and PlayStation 4 and 5 lead system architect Mark Cerny began working closely with the studio on research and development.  Fairgame$ is planned for launch on PC and PS5 at an unannounced date. In the meantime, check out our full recap of all the announcements from the PlayStation Showcase.

"game","2023-05-24","18:09:00","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T21:32:00","Dallas Stars captain Jamie Benn has been suspended two games -- coming in the playoffs or regular season -- for cross-checking against Vegas Golden Knights forward Mark Stone, the NHL Department of Player Safety announced Wednesday.  Benn was ejected less than two minutes into the Stars' 4-0 loss at home in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals for cross-checking Stone, the Vegas captain, around the jaw while Stone was flat on the ice.  ""It's important to note that Benn is in control of this play at all times and makes the decision to deliver a forceful cross-check to a prone player,"" the NHL said in its ruling Wednesday afternoon. ""This is simply an unnecessary decision by Benn and it is delivered with sufficient intent and force to merit supplemental discipline.""  Sources told ESPN that the NHL landed on a two-game suspension for a few reasons. As the match penalty Benn was given indicated, they believed there was intent to injure on what was a ""dangerous"" play to an opponent in a prone position.  Why wasn't this suspension more in line with the one-game ban handed to Vegas defenseman Alex Pietrangelo for his intentional slash on the arm of Edmonton Oilers star Leon Draisaitl in Game 4 of their second-round series? The answer is location: The NHL felt that Benn targeting Stone's neck or head was worse than an arm.  The NHL has typically handed out a one-game suspension for cross-checks during the course of play -- like Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Matt Niskanen in 2020 and Los Angeles Kings forward Blake Lizotte this season. But dropping a stick down on a vulnerable player required something more substantial for Benn.  The Stars trail 3-0 in the series and will be without Benn for Thursday's elimination game in Dallas. Benn will miss the team's first regular-season game in 2023-24 if the Stars are eliminated in Game 4.  Earlier Wednesday, Benn, when speaking to reporters, described it as a ""heat of the moment"" play that led to the match penalty Tuesday night. He said he needed to be more responsible with his body and stick.  ""That was my first shift of a game on home ice, when you're pretty jacked up and you're down 1-0. So you want to try and get your game going. Emotions are high and it's just an unfortunate play,"" Benn said. ""I put my team in a tough situation, so it's pretty unfortunate.""  ""It didn't feel good,"" Stone told reporters Wednesday. ""I think I was more a little bit surprised. It was early in the game, it was my first shift of the game. I didn't expect to get stomped on like that. But I could hear the ref making sure I was all right and I felt okay to get up. The refs made sure the right call was made.""  When asked if he would change anything on the play, Benn said he believed that he fell on Stone.  ""Obviously, didn't want to take a five-minute penalty, but when the game happens fast, emotions are high. Obviously I would've liked to not fall on him and I guess use my stick as the landing point,"" he said.  The NHL also fined Stars forward Max Domi $5,000 on Wednesday for a slashing penalty against Stone at 18:09 of the third period.  Domi wasn't penalized on that play but he was involved in an earlier mess at the end of the second period when he hit Vegas defenseman Nicolas Hague from behind, then threw a couple of punches at Hague. Domi was assessed cross-checking and roughing minors plus a 10-minute misconduct penalty.  In addition to their captain, the Stars will also potentially be without forward Evgenii Dadonov for Game 4, as he is doubtful with an injury.  Information from Reuters was included in this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzIzMzU3L2RhbGxhcy1zdGFycy1qYW1pZS1iZW5uLXN1c3BlbmRlZC0yLWdhbWVzLWNyb3NzLWNoZWNraW5nLXZlZ2FzLW1hcmstc3RvbmXSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmhsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc3MjMzNTcvZGFsbGFzLXN0YXJzLWphbWllLWJlbm4tc3VzcGVuZGVkLTItZ2FtZXMtY3Jvc3MtY2hlY2tpbmctdmVnYXMtbWFyay1zdG9uZT9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T21:51:15","Revenant Hill is the latest game from the developers behind Night in the Woods. At first glance at the game’s announcement trailer, you’d be forgiven for thinking Revenant Hill was the sequel to Night in the Woods. The cat featured bears a suspicious resemblance to one Mae Borowski, NITW’s protagonist. But according to the PlayStation blog announcing the game, Revenant Hill takes plays in the early 1900s, long before Borowski and her band of friends arrived in Possum Springs.  In Revenant Hill, you play as Twigs, a cat that’s fallen on hard times and forced to do odd jobs to pay the rent on the wet log he calls home.  “Grow crops to sell at the secret market or use for your own purposes,” wrote technical director Coby West on PlayStation’s blog. “Put down roots. Run through the fields and the trees. Watch the seasons pass. Make friends who become neighbors who become family. Also make enemies.”  From that, Revenant Hill sounds like a congenial life sim game, but knowing The Glory Society, there will likely be a dark twist or two. Given the strong resemblance between Twigs and Mae, perhaps Revenant Hill is a prequel, taking place at a time when humans and not anthropomorphized animals were the dominant species. Maybe Revenant Hill will explore the events that led to the humans’ downfall. Or maybe the resemblance is purely artistic and there’s no connection between either game save the strong themes of community and working-class struggle. Whatever the case, Night in the Woods was a fantastic game, so I’m all in on Revenant Hill.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzczNjYwMi9yZXZlbmFudC1oaWxsLXRyYWlsZXItbmlnaHQtaW4tdGhlLXdvb2RzLXByZXF1ZWwtZ2xvcnktc29jaWV0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Despite a lackluster performance Tuesday night in a 4-0 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals, Jake Oettinger will be in net for the Stars when they take the ice Thursday at American Airlines Center for Game 4.  “Jake Oettinger is playing tomorrow night. So we’ll put that to rest,” Pete DeBoer told reporters Wednesday.  “Jake Oettinger is playing tomorrow night. So we’ll put that to rest,” Pete DeBoer said. — Joseph Hoyt (@JoeJHoyt) May 24, 2023  Ticket Ticker Get the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  Oettinger was benched just 7:10 into Game 3, as the Stars trailed 3-0 in the first period. He allowed the first goal at the 1:11 mark, the second on a five-minute power play and the third less than 90 seconds later on a backhanded shot by William Carrier.  “It wasn’t the start obviously that we drew up,” Oettinger said. “I think if I make a couple big saves early it’s a different game.”  Oettinger has been complimented this postseason for how he’s performed after losses. DeBoer told him before the series finale against Seattle that he was the best response goalie he’s ever coached.  Oettinger’s performance in Game 3, clearly, didn’t fall into that category, but Oettinger said his confidence hasn’t been shaken.  “I had a great skate today,” he said. “First time in a long time I’ve been able to put in a ton of work on a practice day, so I feel really good right now. I just got back to the basics and I’m going to take it one shot at a time for the rest of the series.”  Oettinger lost back-to-back starts for the first time this postseason in Games 1 and 2. Now, the Stars are in a 3-0 hole that is rarely crawled out of in the NHL.  “It’s the first team to four wins. They don’t have that yet,” Oettinger said. “It’s not over yet, and I think every guy in this room believes we can come back.”  Scott Wedgewood entered on Tuesday and saved 10 of the 11 shots against him — allowing a single goal in the second period, one second after a Vegas power play had expired. Oettinger saved just two of five shots against him in his seven minutes.  Wedgewood, the backup on Thursday, defended Oettinger postgame saying there wasn’t much more he could’ve done on a few of the goals against him.  Still, that didn’t make the performance in Game 3 easier for Oettinger to swallow.  “You pretty much feel like you want to cry,” Oettinger said. “You put your whole season into this and you want to play your best in these moments. When you can’t do that for your team and your fans, it’s one of the worst feelings in the world. It’s part of the position. When people say the ups and downs, this is the downs. I’m never going to give up. I’m never going to stop believing in myself, so I’m going to go out there tomorrow, put it all on the line and put my best foot forward.  “I’m going to go out there and give my team a chance to win.”  Mission impossible?  To advance to the Stanley Cup Final, the Stars will have to become the fifth team in NHL history to overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit. It has never happened in the NBA.

""You pretty much feel like you want to cry,"" the Dallas Stars goalie said of his brief performance in a 4-0 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 3 of the Western Conference Final on Tuesday.  ""You put your whole season into this, and you want to play your best in these moments. When you can't do that for your team and your fans, that's one of the worst feelings in the world.

The Stars will be counting on that when they try to stave off elimination in Game 4 at American Airlines Center on Thursday (8 p.m. ET; ESPN, ESPN+, CBC, SN, TVAS).  [RELATED: Complete Golden Knights vs. Stars series coverage]  Oettinger is on a three-game losing streak, something he's never experienced in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Entering Game 2 against Vegas, he was 22-1-3 with a 2.02 goals-against average and .933 save percentage following a loss in the regular season and postseason.  That resilience is what the Stars need in Game 4. They're confident they're going to get it.  ""They made some elite shots and some elite plays,"" said goalie Scott Wedgewood, who made 10 saves on 11 shots in relief of Oettinger in Game 3. ""We have to be a little more dialed as a group, but I'm not worried about that kid.""  Oettinger, 24, was outstanding during a six-game win against the Minnesota Wild in the Western Conference First Round (2.01 GAA, .929 save percentage, one shutout) but sputtered at times against the Seattle Kraken in the second round. He was replaced by Wedgewood in the third period of a 7-2 loss in Game 3, when he gave up five goals on 17 shots, and pulled after allowing four goals on 18 shots during a 6-3 loss in Game 6.  He rebounded with victories in Games 4 and 7.  ""You just learn that that's what these playoffs are all about and that's what the great goalies do,"" Oettinger said. ""I'm going to go out there tomorrow and give my team a chance to win and just go from there.""  Oettinger had a heavy workload throughout the season, going 37-11-11 with a 2.37 GAA, .919 save percentage and five shutouts in 62 games (61 starts). He didn't get much of a break when Wedgewood was out from Feb. 19-April 3 with a lower-body injury and rookie Matt Murray started three games.  ""I know talking to him he says he feels great, doesn't feel any energy issues and those are conversations we've had every day,"" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. ""We've limited his practice time, things like that.""  On Wednesday, Oettinger appreciated having some time to practice.  ""I had a great skate today,"" he said. ""First time in a long time that I've been able to put in a ton of work on a practice day, so I feel really good right now.  ""Just got back to the basics and I'll take it one shot at a time for the rest of this series. It's the first team to four wins.

Yet, that hasn't stopped fans from hoping that the next big hitter on PS Plus is arguably PlayStation’s biggest game yet, none other than God of Ragnarök. When discussing the May 2023 games, fans are preying upon the gods that we’re treated to the latest adventures of Kratos and Atreus.  On the topic of first-party PlayStation games yet to come to the subscription service, Reddit user trucker-123 said: “I hope Sony can speed up the release of Sony first-party made games on PS Plus. Off the top of my head, God of War Ragnarok is the one big Sony first-party-made game that is not available on PS Plus yet,” replied trucker-123.  Advert 10  “I'm glad I held out. Come on God Of War [Ragnarok]” pleaded Originalchunker408. “I look forward to the day we finally get GoW Ragnarok,” added EtheusRook.

UMass student Grant Beebe was there for them. ""We've only played three games. I'm optimistic because we've still got a seven game series,"" he said.  Beebe is all-in for his team. Back in the fall, his friends pitched in to pay for a new tattoo that required some courage. In bold letters on his thigh, ""Boston Celtics 2023 World Champions"". He has no regrets for his commitment to optimism. ""I'm not going to be like shameful of it or embarrassed that I got it. I mean, I got it knowing it was a risk. If anything, it could just be a metaphor for taking risks,"" he said.  Grant Beebe's Boston Celtics 2023 World Champions tattoo CBS Boston  Another confident Celtics fan is Danny Rose. ""It's a new day, new game, anything can happen,"" said Rose.  We first met this stuffed basketball hat wearing fan during last year's finals. With that blood curdling screech, a star was born. ""Everyone was recognizing me,"" Rose said. ""People were jumping out of cars to take pictures with me.""  Hours before Tuesday's do-or-die game, some fans sounded like they had already given up. ""I think fans are very reactionary here. If you play poorly, they're not going to get up on their feet,"" said sports radio show host Scott Zolak. On the Sports Hub, the Celtics were not a big topic.  ""Well, we're not going to have much left,"" said co-host Marc Bertrand.

We hope he didn't delete the shots of Grant Beebe's tattoo. ""If anybody's going to do it, it's going to be a team from Boston,"" said Beebe. ""And then if we don't make it all the way this year and the tattoo doesn't come true, I honestly just think it makes the tattoo a little bit funnier.""  He does have a back-up plan to extend the life of his tattoo. He says the three can easily be turned into an eight for the 2028 World Champions. That would allow for five more years to make the tattoo relevant.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2Jvc3Rvbi9uZXdzL2Jvc3Rvbi1jZWx0aWNzLTIwMjMtd29ybGQtY2hhbXBpb25zLXRhdHRvby1haGVhZC1nYW1lLTQtaGVhdC_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYm9zdG9uL25ld3MvYm9zdG9uLWNlbHRpY3MtMjAyMy13b3JsZC1jaGFtcGlvbnMtdGF0dG9vLWFoZWFkLWdhbWUtNC1oZWF0Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In only the smattering of days since players discovered the “game-breaking” glitch, before Fortnite developers “temporarily disabled” the kinetic blade’s usage in tournament playlists, some unwitting competitive players were suddenly, unceremoniously blown up.  They never stood a chance. The glitch didn’t give them one; it made their deaths happen offline. Fortnite leaker FNBRIntel, on Twitter on May 21, explains why.    Advertisement  Behind the Fortnite kinetic blade exploit  The kinetic blade exploit could only be used after a series of careful steps were performed. A devious player would have to make sure they were out “in the open” before selecting a nearby target. Then, they needed to “disconnect wifi and dash to [a target],” “use the slice feature [repeatedly] until you feel like you’ve done 200 damage,” and finally “reconnect wifi.”    Advertisement Advertisement  And then the deed was done. “You’ll be teleported back and granted the kill,” FNBRIntel said.  Advertisement  While those exploiting the bug would be working hard behind the scenes, methodically executing each overpowered step, the players they targeted would have no idea anything was wrong, or that the other player was attacking them, let alone plotting evil things offline. They would be playing their game like normal, until they spontaneously died. Awkward.    The kinetic blade is a fairly recent addition to Fortnite, arriving to the battle royale along with the rest of its Chapter 4 Season 2 update earlier this spring, and so developer Epic Games seemed to be vigilant in monitoring it. In addition to vaulting the blade from tournament playlists, the developer started handing out temporary bans less than 24 hours after the exploit’s discovery for players that use it outside of tournament mode. Kotaku reached out for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.    Advertisement  With great power comes great removal from Fortnite.

"game","2023-03-08","10:30:00","{""Hoover"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T18:31:04","HOOVER, Ala. – Sixth-year head coach Mark Kingston has challenged his team recently to give a complete performance in all phases. On Tuesday, in a single elimination game to open the SEC Tournament, his team did just that defeating Georgia 9-0 at the Hoover Met.  The Gamecocks (39-17) slugged a dozen hits, put up runs in four innings, didn’t commit an error and got shut down pitching efforts from starter James Hicks and reliever Cade Austin.  “I think this was our best all-around game (recently),” Kingston said. “That is what it felt like for the first 40 games for us, truthfully. That’s about what the first 40 games felt like. We just knew that our offense would be there, defense would be there and we pitched at a high level.”  Final box score  Hicks, who threw a career high 90 pitches, didn’t encounter much trouble throughout much of his 6 2/3 innings performance. A pair of runners reached in both the second and fifth innings, but he was able to navigate through the trouble.  “Very pleased with how our guys showed up to play today,” Kingston said. “Went through BP in the cages and the energy was good from the minute I saw them at breakfast. We just came out and played extremely well in all facets of the game. I’m really proud of this group.”  Offensively, the Gamecocks were able to come through, starting in the bottom of the second inning. Sophomore Evan Stone knocked a two-strike, two-out, two-RBI single to left field to put the Gamecocks on top.  Two innings later, that lead would grow as Dylan Brewer and Michael Braswell both notched RBI singles, while Cole Messina worked a bases loaded walk to put his team on top 5-0.  “I feel like we stuck to our approach the whole game,” freshman Will Tippett said. “When we stick to our approach, we’re a great offense. Work counts, take walks and when they throw the ball in the middle of the plate, we mash.”  Hicks would encounter his biggest trouble in the seventh when, after recording two quick outs, he gave up a walk, single and then hit his final batter of the game. The bases were loaded and the Gamecocks called upon Austin.  “It was awesome,” Hicks said of his first start against an SEC opponent. “It’s something I’ve dreamed of all my life. It’s something I’ve been working towards. I’m really grateful for the opportunity, and I just wanted to go out there and hold nothing back. I’m really happy with how I performed.”  The sophomore came through in the clutch striking out top-of-the-order hitter Ben Anderson on an inside fastball to end the threat. Hicks finished the game with four hits allowed, two walks and six strikeouts.  And if the Gamecocks didn’t have enough runs already, Tippett came through with a bases loaded triple, splitting the gap in right center. He went 3-for-4 on the day with a pair of singles.  ""The triple felt nice,"" Tippett said. ""It was fun running around the bases.""  Freshman Ethan Petry added an RBI to his team-leading total, now at 70, on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth.  Austin was credited with his second save of the season pitching 2 1/3 innings of relief giving up one hit with three strikeouts.  South Carolina will take on No. 3 seed LSU on Wednesday in its second game of the SEC Tournament. First pitch is set for 10:30 a.m. and will be broadcast on the SEC Network. The Gamecocks have reached the double elimination portion of the tournament.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3NvdXRoLWNhcm9saW5hL0FydGljbGUvR2FtZWNvY2tzLXBsYXktY29tcGxldGUtZ2FtZS1hZHZhbmNlLWluLVNFQy1Ub3VybmFtZW50LTIxMDY0NTczMS_SAXpodHRwczovLzI0N3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS9zb3V0aC1jYXJvbGluYS9BcnRpY2xlL0dhbWVjb2Nrcy1wbGF5LWNvbXBsZXRlLWdhbWUtYWR2YW5jZS1pbi1TRUMtVG91cm5hbWVudC0yMTA2NDU3MzEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Athletic's Ari Wasserman, who signed a non-disclosure agreement with EA Sports after he was recently shown proprietary material, said enhancements for next year's game will be pleasing to fans.  ""They were asking how often I see this happen (in recruiting) or how should we do this or that, and I will tell you, because I’ve seen kind of some of the back of the interfaces of what they’re working on and stuff, it is going to be awesome,"" Wasserman said on this week's Andy Staples Show. ""They’re doing it in a way where you’re not just going to get a Madden engine with the college uniforms. Like they are really trying, and I think the reason why they delayed it a year was that they wanted to make sure that when the game finally made its return, that it wasn’t just some crappy knockoff of Madden and that it was its own thing.  ""And like the dynasty mode and like recruiting, and rankings and territories and all the things that we talk about on this show is going to be represented to some extent in the video game.""  Fans clamored for years on what they want developers to include in the game, from updated uniforms and stadiums, to the College Football Playoff and transfer portal, there's a ton of ground to cover in the next installment.  EA Sports vice president and general manager Daryl Holt told ESPN last year that improving the game after a near-decade long hiatus is a major undertaking considering how much college football has changed since its last release in 2014.  ""That's the best date for us to bring the game that we think is going to meet or exceed our player expectations,"" Holt said. ""And cover the breadth and scale of what we want in the game. We're trying to build a very immersive college football experience.""  Tentatively titled EA College Football, the game's revival has sparked a massive response from fans of the franchise, which has been defunct for nearly 10 years after issues arose over name, image and likeness.  The game originally aimed for a July 2023 release and sparked interest from not only fans, but also many current NCAA football players. An informal poll of more than two dozen players at schools within the Power Five conferences conducted by 247Sports last summer revealed an overwhelming desire to be included in the game. Money was an issue only for one player polled.  Way-too-early college football bowl projections coming out of spring practice  247Sports' quiz of players was not exactly a scientific poll, but the overwhelming urge for football players who grew up playing EA Sports' NCAA Football games as children to be included in the game is something the developer is betting on as it prepares to partner with an agency to secure a group license.

Speaking at a Q&A session about the title Nadji Jeter, the artist voicing Miles Morales, responded positively to a fan’s question about the game being co-op – Insomniac Games, on the other hand, wrote “Nope! It is an epic single-player adventure!” on Twitter when asked the same question, contradicting the VA.  It’s likely that Jeter either wasn’t aware of the mechanical details, as that’s not really his job, or that this was simply a misunderstanding: There will be cooperation between different characters in the game, but of course that isn’t really what “co-op” means in the video games context.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL3ZpZGVvX2dhbWVzL2FydGljbGVzL3NwaWRlcl9tYW5fMl9pc19hX3NpbmdsZV9wbGF5ZXJfZ2FtZV9pbnNvbW5pYWNfY29uZmlybXMvczFfMTcxNDRfMzg4NDI0NTPSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy55YXJkYmFya2VyLmNvbS92aWRlb19nYW1lcy9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbXAvc3BpZGVyX21hbl8yX2lzX2Ffc2luZ2xlX3BsYXllcl9nYW1lX2luc29tbmlhY19jb25maXJtcy9zMV8xNzE0NF8zODg0MjQ1Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After a two-out single by the Brewers’ Brian Anderson to left field, Baker and trainer Jeremiah Randall came out to talk to Altuve and then took him out of the game. Mauricio Dubón replaced Altuve at second base.  “He was feeling sick, so that’s why he called us out there,” Baker said after the Astros’ 6-0 loss to the Brewers at American Family Field. “We took him out because we thought it was the best thing to do for precautionary reasons. He was feeling sick, and you could sort of see it.”  Through a team spokesman, Altuve declined to comment after the game. He was 1-for-3 before being pulled, legging out an infield single in the third inning.  Baker said Altuve was being evaluated by doctors, with an update to come before Wednesday's series finale. Given the 12:10 p.m. start time, it’s likely Altuve will be given the day off, especially with the Astros off Thursday before beginning a series Friday at Oakland.  Baker said Altuve hadn’t complained about any illness before the sixth, but the manager could sense something was wrong.  “You know how you can look at somebody and tell?” Baker said. “He had that look, so we took him out.”  Astros starting pitcher J.P. France said he didn’t notice anything amiss with Altuve during the game.  “When I first saw Dusty come out, I thought he was going to pull me, and he went to Altuve, and I didn’t know what was going on,” France said. “They pulled him, and I was like, ‘Man, that’s unfortunate.’ ”  Altuve sat out Monday’s series opener, but Baker said that was a planned day off after Altuve played all three games of the previous series against the A's, his first action since being activated from the injured list after being sidelined with a fractured right thumb suffered in March during the World Baseball Classic.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL3RleGFzLXNwb3J0cy1uYXRpb24vYXN0cm9zL2FydGljbGUvaG91c3Rvbi1hc3Ryb3Mtam9zZS1hbHR1dmUtMTgxMTU3NTkucGhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Redmond"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:00:00","Disappointing but not surprising. It's a kids/older fans of the IP/characters/world and so on game but I do think Xbox games do get the short end of the stick even if there is an audience wanting the game but publishers won't get the money amount they seek for it. I mean how many people play Disney Dreamlight Valley on Gamepass/Xbox besides PlayStation and Switch. Probably a sizeable amount of people?  I assume even Hotwheels, Lego and more have sizeable audiences on Xbox. I mean even the Xbox 360 had Kung Fu Panda and other licensed games in bundles back then. What happened where at least 1 million maybe 2 million (at a guess or a few hundred thousand or whatever the case) Xbox game sales of a kids/older fans game is bad with a Xbox One 50 million install base and whatever the case Xbox Series sized audience? Sure many kids may play whatever is trending but there is still an audience for singleplayer games on Xbox as there is Nintendo or PlayStation. I mean how many platformer fans are veterans and older people not just kids that they can appeal to.  I'm a platformer fan I gladly support the Indies and AAA platformers I seek out if the price is worth it of course and the games don't disappoint me. I supported Clive n Wrench and enjoy it and I didn't like Ratchet Rift Apart so I don't need a PS5 so sticking with my PS4 instead I can use the PS5 my family has no problem but I'm in no need to buy PS5 versions to play them the sacrifice on PS4 doesn't bother me at all.  Which I think is a bit ridiculous there is an audience no matter how big or small that only have an Xbox why should they have to buy a third party on another platform just because they aren't able to get it it isn't a first party, it was an exclusive deal it was just they happened to skip Xbox due to them not knowing the demand of casuals, core gamers and otherwise that may be interested in this game or other games that also skip Xbox.  I mean how many anime artstyle gamers (ones that aren't based on an anime license but have an artstyle that is anime like say when Danganronpa 2 went to Gamepass I was surprised when they released there all these years later) on Xbox couldn't play certain games and now can as they were on PlayStation 4, Vita and Switch and Xbox got access to some of them the ones many AA Japanese publishers never made available to Xbox gamers until now (I mean same with Wii U owners for many games too they never got access to but still Xbox has the audience over other consoles of course and 50 Million Xbox Ones clearly there was at least 1 million Xbox owners willing to play some games outside the 'image' Xbox has but publishers seem to not see that even besides the money amounts speaking for themselves as well).  With Project Spark/Dreams yeah Xbox owners I don't think cared as much for Project Spark, making their own game, maybe the tools were confusing or a creative game of that sort isn't for that audience/wasn't big enough but I thought it was cool Xbox had something like it, maybe it was ahead of it's time and too early or maybe it wouldn't change anything if released now or before Dreams. But compared to PlayStation owners got used to Little Big Planet and keep supporting Media Molecule and it just so happened to be that small audience that used the tools/and the larger audience bought it for the campaign levels and moved on so people wanting a easy campaign in Dreams got that/and the creative audience got a great game with so many tools to use and make whatever they wanted.  Is there many players EU/US interested maybe but on Xbox not sure. I mean it's not like it's image of games that sell well on it is the only audience on Xbox they aren't all shooter/racing/sports gamers only there are many other people buying other games on Xbox clearly.  Doesn't make people go hmm should we make an Xbox version the audience online and offline may pick it up but will we make the money amount we seek for the platform (I think publishers aim too high on sales still). I don't know enough about Microids. I bought Gear Club Unlimited 2 for Switch, think Eden Studios did a good job (reviving themselves also) and are doing well from mobile game to console space. I don't know if the other Microids games are any good or just shovelware which I assume may be the case as a publisher and the devs they work with. But like many European smaller publishers they are a grey area for me on quality or games they even make.  The thing to me is every little bit counts so no Xbox version seems odd when even if it doesn't do well in the grand scale of things all versions offer them enough money than less without an Xbox version. Is the cost high to port it/consider development for it I'd assume not that much.  Is there demand for this game I bet among kids and old fans for sure. Maybe newcomers buy it/see the tv shows even if it's more a game I think fans care about.  I do think Xbox gamers do get the short end of the stick though.  Sure it can run on the console but I do think the target audience focus many seem to give the Xbox is not accurate.  You may see the majority fit the shooter, sports and racing focus but I don't deny that many games do deserve to be on Xbox they aren't just the majority they are the other audinces on any other platform just they use an Xbox primiarly or have it as a second console.

While in other cases many Xbox gamers may be anime/anime game fans.  There may be just people that stuck with Xbox and had no issues getting kids games in the 360 era but do now due to games like this not being on the platform because many skip Xbox when a fanbase clearly only has an Xbox or would like an Xbox copy available they don't want to buy another console for a third party game they can have access to on there but publishers don't want to bother.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1cmV4Ym94LmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvaW5kaWUtZ2FtZS1za2lwcy14Ym94LWxhdW5jaC10by1zZWUtaWYtdGhlLWRlbWFuZC1pcy1zdHJvbmctZW5vdWdo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mandatory Credit: Ed Mulholland-USA TODAY Sports  The New Jersey Devils are back outside to play a hockey game. First reported by Dave Pagnotta of The Fourth Period, the Devils will play in a Stadium Series game in the 2023-24 season. The Devils will likely be home against the Philadelphia Flyers in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ.  There is no date yet for the game to get played, but we know it will be played in February. Just a few months ago, the rumors began to swirl when NHL Network reporter Kevin Weekes posted a tweet about the potential stadium series game and how the Devils could be involved.  I’m told the NHL is going to host 2 Stadium Series games next season in February 2024 at MetLife Stadium on back-to-back days involving 4 teams: Devils/Flyers and Isles/Rangers — David Pagnotta (@TheFourthPeriod) May 23, 2023  The Devils have not played a Stadium Series game since the 2013-14 season when they played the New York Rangers at Yankee Stadium. The Devils ended up losing that game 7-3. This will be only the second time the Devils have played a Stadium Series game in franchise history.  The game will allow the young core to experience a tradition many teams have had throughout the league. However, some guys on the roster have experience playing outdoor games. Dougie Hamilton and Tomas Tatar have played in a Winter Classic with their former teams, the Bruins and Red Wings. Erik Haula also provided a three-point performance in an outdoor game against the Blackhawks in 2016.  As for which part of the young core can significantly impact this game, I believe that will go to Erik Haula. Haula has become that veteran leader that the Devils are looking for. While Haula may not have provided in the playoffs that much, he still did an excellent job in the regular season. When paired with Jack Hughes, both players provided great production. As mentioned earlier, he has experience with the Stadium Series game as well. Once the Stadium Series game comes, he could put on an excellent performance with Jack Hughes as his wing, and both can provide a lot of chances against the Flyers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vcHVja3NhbmRwaXRjaGZvcmtzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL25ldy1qZXJzZXktZGV2aWxzLWRldmlscy13aWxsLXBsYXktaW4tYW4tc3RhZGl1bS1zZXJpZXMtZ2FtZS1pbi0yMDI0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T04:26:01","NEW MANCHESTER — Some teams just thrive on being the underdog.  Oak Glen came into Tuesday’s second game of the Class AA Region 1 Championship series with its backs to the wall, having seen Keyser score 10-straight runs a day earlier in the opening game of the best-of-three and having had a more than three-hour bus ride home to think about it Monday night.  And, as they have before, coach Eric Hayden’s group responded.  Senior hurler Chase Patterson tossed a complete game shutout on the mound and the Golden Bears were able to produce just enough offense to scratch out a 2-0 win at the Field of Dreams Complex to knot the series at 1-1 and force a winner-take-all Game 3.  “We were led by our seniors,” Hayden said. “Chase Patterson was great on the mound, he’s been a bulldog for us all season, and senior Hunter Rhoades had two hits at the plate. We came out and executed very well. It was a great team effort.  “It was very important to us (to win the seniors’ last game at home). This group has been through a lot, their first year was COVID … they’ve put a lot of work in and a lot of hours in.  “This senior group has led this team and we’re going to lean on them until we get to Charleston.”  They’ll take another long bus ride as the teams will decide the series today at Keyser.  “We’re fighters,” Hayden said of his group’s response after losing Game 1 10-1. “Not many people had us here, we talked about it clear back in the beginning of the year in the gym. We’re the snake in the grass. Nobody expects us to get it done, but this group is capable of getting it done and they’ve proved that, and we’re not done.  “We’re not ready to be done, we’re going back down there to fight some more.”  Patterson fanned seven, walked just two and scattered six hits to come through with the clutch victory on the hill. He got out of a jam in the seventh to close things out, stranding Golden Tornado (19-6) base runners on second and third to end the game. He fired just over 100 pitches in going all seven, more than 60 percent for strikes, while his defense played errorless ball behind him.  “Pitching is everything, and he’s been great for us,” Hayden said. “Here at home, at Fairmont (in sectionals), when we’ve needed him, we’ve been able to lean on him.”  As they did in the opener Monday, the Golden Bears (14-11) struck first, taking a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the second when Maddox McKay put a ball in play with two outs and the Keyser infield committed its second error of the inning, allowing TJ Decapio to score.  In the sixth, Robert Carter gave the Golden Bears a little more breathing room driving in Decapio, who had gotten to third on Tyler McKay’s double.  Keyser’s Noah Broadwater fired six strikeouts and walked just one, while teammate Josh Shoemaker had a pair of base hits.  “The first part of (Monday’s game) was tight, too, (Tuesday) we just couldn’t get hits when we needed them” Keyser head coach Scott Rohrbaugh said. “We either struck out or hit it at people and to their credit, their guys made the plays. There was good pitching on both sides, both teams left runners on … it was a good game.  “When you get to this point, it’s not supposed to be easy. We’ll try again (today).”  WVSSAC Class AA Region 1 Championship  Game 2 at Oak Glen High School  Oak Glen 2, Keyser 0 (series tied 1-1)  Keyser 0-0-0 0-0-0 0 – 0 6 3  Oak Glen 0-1-0 0-0-1 x – 2 7 0  KEYSER (19-6): Broadwater (LP, 6IP, 2R, 1ER, 7H, 6K, 1BB) and Rotruck.

Things from the Backbone One like the offset analog sticks, orange Backbone button, and three lines menu button are all present. But on this special version, the ABXY buttons are swapped for Sony’s cross, circle, square, and triangle, the color of the grips matches the standard PS5 white, you can see a PlayStation logo on the back of the controller, and your phone will plug into the controller with a USB-C connector instead of Lightning.  Otherwise, you can expect a very similar experience to what you’d get from the standard Backbone One (which also launched later for Android). The controller lets you play games across all sorts of different services, including games you download from app stores as well and titles you stream from services like Xbox Game Pass — the controller isn’t exclusively functional with PlayStation Remote Play even though it’s PlayStation-branded.

"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T01:39:00","The Yankees’ leader in games played is a 22-year-old who entered spring training with a long-shot chance of even breaking camp with the team.  Anthony Volpe, who hit the game-winning sacrifice fly in the 10th inning of the Yankees’ 6-5 comeback win over the Orioles on Tuesday night a the Stadium, is the lone member of the club to play in each of the Yankees’ first 50 games, during which he has impressed enough to remain an everyday option, even if his bat is still adjusting to major league pitching.  Volpe entered play Tuesday with a .687 OPS that had been boosted by good plate discipline (20 walks) and solid pop (seven home runs).  His baserunning — successful on his first 13 stolen-base attempts — has been his standout skill, turning plenty of singles into manufactured triples.  The next step would be for his bat to catch up to his legs and his mostly reliable glove. Volpe, who went 0-for-4 before the big sacrifice fly game-winning RBI, is 3-for-22 (.136) in his past seven games, sinking his average to .207.  “He’s had his ups and downs at the plate. With that said, he’s gotten a lot of big hits for us,” manager Aaron Boone said before the Yankees opened a series with the Orioles in The Bronx. “He’s hit some balls out of the ballpark. He’s given you a glimpse [of] I think a guy that’s going to be really good at controlling the strike zone and being a guy that in the future you can envision hitting at the top or in the middle of the lineup.  Anthony Volpe has had his offensive moment, but is still getting used to big-league pitching, while his defense have been solid. Noah K. Murray / NY Post  “He’s not been overwhelmed by anything.”  Defensively, Volpe is middle of the pack when measured by Defensive Runs Saved, and Boone said he has “overall played really well” at shortstop. His six errors led the team, but so did his games and innings played.  The biggest hole has been in Volpe’s ability to consistently make contact. The New Jerseyan had struck out at least once in 10 straight games, a funk in which he whiffed 15 times in 34 plate appearances. His 30.4 percent strikeout rate entered play as the worst among 20 qualified shortstops.  Volpe was punched out in just 17.7 percent of his 497 plate appearances in Double-A last year. The lack of contact is a new challenge for him, but so is the major league level itself.  “The more at-bats you get here, the more exposure you get here,” Yankees third-base coach Luis Rojas said of the adjustment that comes when rookies transition to the major leagues. “The more information there is for teams, and the more strategy they’re going to put into you.”  Anthony Volpe has played a solid shortstop through the first 50 games of the season. Paul J. Bereswill  Rojas, as Mets manager, watched top prospects such as Amed Rosario and Andres Gimenez attempt to turn minor league domination into major league results, with mixed success.  He said he has seen prospects with talent levels similar to Volpe, but he has seen few with a similar makeup.  “On top of his abilities, it’s his poise. The New York stage, you know what it can do to a young man. This kid is the same every day,” Rojas said of Volpe, who played just 22 games at Triple-A before winning the big-league job during spring training. “Slow start, bad day, bad streak — he’s the same kid.  Anthony Volpe trips over first baseman Ryan Mountcastle after getting thrown out on a ground out in the second inning of the first game of the Yankees-Orioles series at the Stadium. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post  “You see a bright future when somebody’s that consistent at that age. You’ve gotta think he’s going to get even better.”  There is less pressure for Volpe’s bat to further emerge now that he is at the bottom of the lineup — he batted seventh Tuesday — after several injuries previously had forced him up to leadoff.  And even through an inconsistent offensive beginning to his career, his consistent threat on the base paths has compensated. After 50 games, Volpe has earned plenty more time.  “I think he’s a really good-looking player,” Boone said. “I think he’s confirmed a lot of things that I think we expected when we made the decision at the end of camp to bring him with us and make him our shortstop.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL3doZXJlLWFudGhvbnktdm9scGUtc3RhbmRzLXdpdGgtNTAtZ2FtZXMtYXMteWFua2VlLXVuZGVyLWhpcy1iZWx0L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL3doZXJlLWFudGhvbnktdm9scGUtc3RhbmRzLXdpdGgtNTAtZ2FtZXMtYXMteWFua2VlLXVuZGVyLWhpcy1iZWx0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WHTM) — A locally-owned tabletop board game establishment recently reopened at a bigger and better Lancaster County location earlier this month.  Six Feet Under Games is owned and operated by Susan (Sue) Waldbiesser who first opened her and her husband’s tabletop board games depot back in 2004, at a storefront off of Lincoln Highway. According to Waldbiesser, shortly after in 2006, they relocated to a 4,000-square-foot storefront in New Holland, Pa.  The idea to open a tabletop board game store first came to her and her husband after they struggled to find board games to order online that they could play with their younger kids, according to Waldbiesser.  Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.  “You know we use to deal with a lot of disappointment from ordering games online, so that pushed us to really do something about it,” Waldbiesser added. “There would be a short two to three-sentence description of the game, and then when we got it, it would be nothing like it was described online.”  Additionally, Waldbiesser’s husband had previously written a business plan for a board game store while completing a project for his master’s degree. According to Waldbiesser, although her husband’s original business plan has changed over the years since the official launch of Six Feet Under Games, the concept has remained the same.  “We want to get a game onto the tables of every family and group,” Waldbiesser stated. “There is a game out there for everyone – if we don’t carry it then we will help you find it. Our overall mission is to improve socialization through tabletop gaming.”  Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.  Six Feet Under Games officially relocated to their new 7,100 square-foot location in Gap, Pa. back on May 1. According to Waldbiesser, the relocation became necessary due to increased demand coupled with the lack of space at their previous location for a retail section.  “I needed more space – the way the business grew I needed more merchandise and I just didn’t have the space for it,” Waldbiesser said. “It became a necessity in order to serve local gamers the way that I wanted to.”  The new storefront had been acquired back on Feb. 1, and it took about three months to renovate the new space, according to Waldbiesser. Today, the large storefront is capable of seating up to 96 gamers at a time – which comes in handy for their weekly events and tournaments.  To check out some of the tournaments and events that they host, you can click here.  It should also be noted that Six Feet Under Games is not just a hub for gaming tournaments and events, but it is also a place to kick back, relax and have some fun. According to Waldbiesser, guests are invited to come in and browse their massive board game library, and are even encouraged to stay and play on-site.  The new storefront on 5360 Lincoln Highway, Gap, Pa. which was formerly a Sears Hometown Store, offers a wide selection of over 17,000 listed items and approximately 5,000 different games, which include:  Board games  Card games  Roleplaying games  Miniatures games  “I couldn’t be happier [with the new space], Waldbiesser said. “The area is great and the locals have been so welcoming. It has been really awesome moving here – relocating allowed me to do what I always wanted to do with this shop.”  The hours of operation for Six Feet Under Games are:  Tuesdays – Saturdays // 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Sundays // 12 p.m. to 5 p.m.  According to Waldbiesser, she is currently looking to create a few more part-time positions – if you are interested in applying you can send your resume to sixfeetundergames@frontiernet.net.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2xhbmNhc3Rlci90YWJsZXRvcC1ib2FyZC1nYW1lLWh1Yi1yZW9wZW5zLWF0LW5ldy1sYW5jYXN0ZXItY291bnR5LWxvY2F0aW9uL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2xhbmNhc3Rlci90YWJsZXRvcC1ib2FyZC1nYW1lLWh1Yi1yZW9wZW5zLWF0LW5ldy1sYW5jYXN0ZXItY291bnR5LWxvY2F0aW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If you're still a Killer Instinct stalwart, you might run into load times lasting ""40-60 seconds, but potentially minutes depending on your connection speed,"" and a warning that the game is ""Refreshing DLC Timeout"" next time you play, but otherwise the game should be the same as it ever was. The quality of life update has also added a couple of PC-specific fixes: both players will no longer lose points after one of them leaves Ranked mode on Steam, and all characters should now be unlocked for players on Game Pass.  When you consider that this version of Killer Instinct actually released a full 10 years ago—only the PC version came out in 2016—and this server shift applies to all platforms, it's honestly quite heartening (okay, they have Microsoft money, but still). I mean, maybe it shouldn't be impressive that a game isn't simply shutting its doors forever as soon as it reaches a certain age, but these are the times we live in. Now if only everyone else could do the same.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3Byb3BzLXRvLXRoaXMtZGVjYWRlLW9sZC1maWdodGluZy1nYW1lLWZvci1tb3ZpbmctdG8tbmV3LXNlcnZlcnMtaW5zdGVhZC1vZi1zaHV0dGluZy1kb3duLWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to Kotaku, multiple sources claim the currently unnamed Star Wars game will release before the end of this financial year. If this is the case, it means it would be here before the end of March 2024. While Electronic Arts once had the keys to the cosmos, this will be Ubisoft's first foray into the world of Wookiees.

Three months ago, Alex Hay shared to Reddit that he was ""gutted"" to hear that Starfield had been delayed from its original November 11, 2022 release date, as that meant he likely wouldn't be able to play it due to having recently stopped treatment for lung cancer. Hay died shortly after, as shared by the MacStories community of which he was an active and accomplished member.  Over on Reddit where the tragic news was shared, many Starfield fans are committing to naming their ships and/or characters after Hay in tribute, but some think there's a more profound way to remember him. As the YouTube account Light explains, there's precedent for Bethesda immortalizing a fallen fan in-game. The Fallout 4 character Evan, available only in the Nuka-World expansion, is a tribute to a Reddit user's brother, a Fallout fan who passed away before Bethesda could deliver a personalized care kit.  The hashtag ""AlexInStarfield"" got some traction on Twitter earlier this month, but it's so far failed to get Bethesda's attention, at least publicly. There are some commenters pointing out that development on Starfield is likely nearing completion, which is true, but there's always the possibility of adding a tribute in a post-launch update.

"game","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T04:30:00","DALLAS -- — The Vegas Golden Knights kept their composure and got the best payback after an ugly hit early against their captain.  They have a 3-0 series lead in the Western Conference Final and are now just one more win away from making it to another Stanley Cup Final.  Ivan Barbashev scored a power-play goal after Dallas Stars captain Jamie Benn was ejected because of his hit on Mark Stone less than two minutes into the game. That was the second of three goals the Golden Knights had in the first 7 1/2 minutes, leading to an early exit for goalie Jake Oettinger as they won 4-0 in Game 3 on Tuesday night.  “You keep your composure,” said Alex Pietrangelo, who added a goal midway through the second period.  After the two captains collided near the blue line and Stone fell to the ice, Benn lunged forward with both hands on his stick and made contact near Stone’s neck as he was sliding over the center line.  “We’re upset when we see that, he’s our captain,” coach Bruce Cassidy said. “But at the end of the day, they make a call that gives us a chance to make them pay for the penalty. And we did with one goal anyway, so we’ve doubled our lead. ... Do it the right way. That’s been our mindset all along.”  While Oettinger had the shortest start of his career, Vegas goalie Adin Hill stopped 34 shots in his first career postseason shutout. Hill also became the second Knights goaltender with a five-game winning streak this postseason — Laurent Brossoit won five in a row before an injury.  After four consecutive comeback victories in these playoffs, including two overtime wins at home to start the best-of-seven series, the Golden Knights were in control all of the way in this one.  Game 4 is Thursday night, when Vegas will have the opportunity to advance to its second Stanley Cup Final in the franchise’s six seasons.  The Golden Knights were Western Conference champions during their inaugural 2017-18 season, then lost the Cup Final in five games after winning the opener against the Washington Capitals. Vegas missed the playoffs for the only time last season, before coach Pete DeBoer was fired and became the Stars coach.  Johnathan Marchessault scored only 71 seconds into the game, which was only 42 seconds before Benn was assessed a game misconduct after a five-minute major for cross-checking.  “Let’s put it this way, he made a mistake. He feels really badly about it. I don’t think anyone in the building feels worse than he does about it,” DeBoer said. “I’m not going to pile on, he’s been a leader here for his entire career, and leads every day on and off the ice. ... Fortunately Mark Stone’s OK, and we’ve got to live with the consequences.”  The Stars played the rest of the game without Benn, who could also face an NHL suspension after the league reviews the play.  Just before Benn’s early exit, he had a wrister that was stopped by Hill but was initially still loose under the goalie as Benn tried to get his stick back on it.  The goal by Barbashev, who later had two assists, was one of only three shots the Knights got on net during the five-minute penalty. His 30-foot wrister for a 2-0 lead came after a Ty Dellandrea’s short-handed break was blocked and Nicolas Roy took the rebound the other way before passing to Barbashev.  “What goes unnoticed in there is the save by Adin Hill on the shorthand 2-on-1 ... and we come down and score,” Cassidy said. “That 15 seconds of hockey is a huge impact of the game.”  Oettinger was pulled and replaced by Scott Wedgewood after William Carrier’s backhander made it 3-0 with 12:50 left in the first period.  The 24-year-old Oettinger has now lost three starts in a row. He has lost four of five overall, the win being when he had 22 saves for the Stars in their 2-1 win in Game 7 of Western semifinal against Seattle.  Wedgewood stopped 10 of 11 shots, with Pietrangelo’s goal coming just a second after the end of a power play as Miro Heiskanen was coming out of the penalty box.  Stars center Max Domi got a game misconduct with 21 seconds left in the second period. After his cross-check against Nicolas Hague, Domi started throwing punches.  “I think you guys know exactly what was being discussed,” Hague said when asked about what led to that incident. “There’s no reason for me to get involved in anything. It is what it is, and we got a big win.”  Fans in the arena reacted to the ensuing penalty by throwing water bottles, food and other items on the ice. With extended time needed to clean up the playing surface, officials sent both teams to their locker rooms early for the second intermission with the Knights up 4-0.  Those final 21 seconds were played after the intermission before the clock was reset to 20 minutes for the third period.  “It was a little weird,” Hill said. “I’ve never seen so much stuff on the ice, that’s for sure.”  Game notes  Stars forward Evegenii Dadonov left with a lower body injury in the first period and never returned. ... It was the first Western Conference Final game in Dallas since May 19, 2008, when the Stars lost to Detroit in a decisive sixth game.  ------  AP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhLmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9yZWNhcD9nYW1lSWQ9NDAxNTQ4NDE10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:13:35","Tuesday’s Game Report: Cardinals 8, Reds 5  By Rob Rains  At least in the opinion of Adam Wainwright, there is nothing great about the Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati.  Making what could be his final start in the ballpark where he has struggled more than at any other stadium in his career, Wainwright did not pitch great on Tuesday night – but it was good enough to get a rare win.  Wainwright allowed five runs over 5 2/3 innings, earning the 197th win of his career thanks to a big night from the offense, led by a pair of home runs from Paul Goldschmidt.  The win was only the second for Wainwright in Cincinnati in his last 11 starts there, dating back to the start of the 2016 season. The other victory came in 2019, in a game when the Cardinals scored 13 runs.  In those 11 starts, Wainwright has allowed a combined 50 earned runs in 52 1/3 innings.  Here is how Tuesday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Goldschmidt had just one hit in his previous 21 at-bats before homering in the first inning. After the Cardinals scored twice in the second, Goldschmidt connected for his second homer in the third that gave the Cardinals a 4-1 lead … Tommy Edman drove in three runs with a triple, double and sacrifice fly and scored two runs … Lars Nootbaar had two RBIs on a pair of singles … Nolan Gorman singled in the third to extend his hitting streak to 14 games.  On the mound: Wainwright had only thrown 77 pitches before he was pulled from the game with two outs in the sixth and runners on first and second … Chris Stratton stranded the runners and protected the 7-5 lead through the seventh … After Giovanny Gallegos retired the Reds in order in the eighth, Ryan Helsley allowed a two-out single and back-to-back walks that loaded the bases in the ninth but got a groundout from Jonathan India to end the game.  Key stat: The two home runs by Goldschmidt increased the team’s total so far in May to 38, the most they have hit in the month since hitting 42 in May of 2012. They have seven games left in the month. The franchise record for home runs in May is 45 set in 2000.  Worth noting: Nolan Arenado and manage Oli Marmol were ejected by home plate umpire Will Little after Arenado grounded into a double play that ended the third inning. Arenado was upset by some calls during his at-bat, and was still mad about a checked-swing called by Little in Monday night’s game when Little was umpiring at first base … It ws Marmol’s third ejection of the season, the second time he has been tossed from a game by Little … Goldschmidt has 19 career homers in 54 games at the Great American Ballpark, the third most among active players, trailing Anthony Rizzo and Andrew McCutchen … The Cardinals released minor-league outfielder Trejyn Fletcher, their second-round pick in the 2019 draft. The high school outfielder had limited experience, playing in the northeast, and could never get untracked offensively. Fletcher, 22, was hitting .205 in 21 games at Palm Beach this season … The organization’s top pick in last year’s draft, lefthander Cooper Hjerpe, worked six no-hit innings on Tuesday night for Peoria.  Looking ahead: Steven Matz will get the start on Wednesday night in the third game of the series.

Check out more newsletters  In the aftermath of the Maple Leafs’ second-round elimination by the Panthers, the endlessly creative Sean McIndoe of The Athletic ranked every one of Toronto’s 29 playoff defeats since the team’s 2017 return to the playoffs following nine misses over the previous 10 seasons.  A few days later, a question on the @nyrangersmuse Twitter account asked, “If you change the result of ANY Rangers game in NHL history, which game would it be and why?”  A plurality of responses cited the 2-0 Game 7 defeat to the Lightning in the 2015 conference finals. A number pointed to the 3-2 Game 6 overtime elimination loss to the Devils in the 2012 conference finals. Regrets were expressed over the Game 3 preliminary-round elimination at the hands of the Islanders on J.P. Parise’s goal at 0:11 of overtime in 1975.  There were references to Game 2 of the 1979 Cup final in which the Rangers, who had won the opener at the Montreal Forum, took a 2-0 lead before losing 6-2 en route to a five-game series defeat. Some identified the Game 5 double-overtime elimination by the Kings in the 2014 final and others the best-of-five elimination by the Islanders in Game 5 of the 1984 first round on Kenny Morrow’s OT winner.  Howie Rose cited one that resonates with older generations, the Game 7 defeat in Chicago in the 1971 semifinals, three days after Pete Stemkowski’s Game 6 triple-overtime winner had kept the Blueshirts alive in their quest to end the then-31-year drought.  Lightning strike  The Rangers appeared to be headed to the Stanley Cup final in 2015 after Dominic Moore’s Game 1-winning goal in the conference finals, but the Lightning had other plans. Getty Images  In considering the responses, the 2015 defeat, indeed, was memorable in that it completed perhaps the most puzzling series in team history.  The Rangers had won the Presidents’ Trophy with a franchise-record 113 points (53-22-7) in a season in which Henrik Lundqvist had been sidelined for nearly two months after being struck in the throat by a shot, the club going 18-4-3 in his absence.  The Blueshirts took out the Penguins in five games in the first round. They then rallied from a 3-1 series deficit to defeat the Capitals, winning both Games 5 and 7 in overtime at the Garden on goals by Ryan McDonagh and Derek Stepan, respectively.  The Rangers then defeated the Lightning at the Garden in the opener of the conference finals. A second consecutive trip to the final seemed a matter of a week away.  It wasn’t.  The Rangers did not win another home game. They scored 17 goals (5, 5, 7) in going 2-1 at Tampa in Games 3, 4 and 6. They scored two goals in the next three matches at MSG, shut out 2-0 in both Games 5 and 7.  Losing three games at home in the 2015 conference finals sealed the Rangers’ fate against the Lightning. Getty Images  A confusing trilogy  The only series remotely comparable to that was the 1973 semifinals against the then-named Black Hawks that completed the Chicago trilogy.  After losing the seven-gamer in 1971 on a pair of trigger-position goals off faceoffs by Bobby Hull (the Game 7 dagger applied following an icing infraction committed by Brad Park), the Blueshirts swept the Hawks in ’72, culminating with a Gene Carr Game 4 goal that produced as loud a noise, to this day, as I have ever heard in the building.  They then won Game 1 of the 1973 rematch in Chicago, 4-1, before losing Game 2, 5-4.  They scored three goals the rest of the series, though, one apiece in Games 3 and 4 at MSG and in Game 5 in Chicago to drop the series in five games. It never made any sense.  Just like 2015 has never made sense.  But that Game 7 in 2015 is not the one I’d reverse, and the reason is Ryan McDonagh, Marc Staal and Dan Girardi were all injured.  McDonagh probably would not have been able to play in the final against the Blackhawks after toughing it out for the final three games against Tampa Bay with a broken foot.  Staal and Girardi, both of whom had leg or foot issues, would have been severely compromised if able to play.  And the team would have been without Mats Zuccarello, sidelined since the final game of the first round after sustaining a fractured skull.  So I doubt the Rangers would have been able to stay with Chicago. A second straight defeat in the final likely would have been more disappointing than losing in the conference finals. That’s why I would not have chosen this Game 7 as the one to reverse.  The one game I want back…  The Rangers couldn’t slow down Bobby Hull in Game 7 of the 1971 final, allowing the Black Hawks star to tally a goal and two assists in Chicago’s 4-2 win. Bettmann Archive  I was prone to going with Howie on this one. The pain of that 1971 Game 7 defeat lingers. I’m not kidding.  I’m not so sure the Rangers would have been able to beat Ken Dryden and the Canadiens in the final, but I’d love to have seen it. Still, there was a Cinderella vibe to the Habs and their neophyte goaltender out of Cornell. So that’s not the one I would choose.  The one I want back is the opener of the 1972 final in Boston, a game in which the Rangers fell behind 5-1 by the 10:46 mark of the second period.  I remember — and can still feel — the waves of humiliation that were about to crash upon the Blueshirts. But then Rod Gilbert scored before the second period ended.  And then the Rangers scored again and again and again, and the game was 5-5 after Bruce MacGregor’s goal at 9:17 of the third period. The Blueshirts were on their way to the same kind of miraculous comeback that would send them to the Cup — the same way the Canadiens had overcome a 5-1 deficit in Game 2 of their first-round series against the B’s a year earlier to win 7-5 en route to a seven-game victory.  This was it.  Until it wasn’t.  Because at 17:44, here came Ace Bailey — tragically lost on UA Flight 175 on 9/11 — to beat Eddie Giacomin on the short side for the 6-5 winner. The Rangers never quite recovered.  The Blueshirts lost Game 2, won Game 3 at home and were defeated in a Sunday afternoon game at MSG in which Park fought with Bobby Orr.  Trailing 3-1 in the series, the Rangers staved off elimination with a 3-2 Game 5 victory in Boston in which Bobby Rousseau scored twice in the third period to overcome a 2-1 deficit.  Ace Bailey’s third-period Game 1 goal against Eddie Giacomin in the 1972 Stanley Cup finals sent the Rangers to a defeat from which they would not recover. Getty Images  The denouement came a couple of days later in Game 6. Orr did his 360 at the blue line against a helpless MacGregor, beat Gilles Villemure and that was that. It was 3-0. Johnny Bucyk and the hated B’s eventually skated off with the Cup through the Zamboni entrance. It was the first time in my life I had been in the presence of the Stanley Cup, and believe me when I tell you I hated every moment of it.  If only Eddie had made that save in Game 1…  If only.  They would have won the Cup. The most popular team in the Emile Francis Era would have won the Cup.  I know it.

With the former, CBUIII gets to create settings and characters they can easily return to in future patch quests, expansions, and more. But theoretically, that’s not the case with the latter – Clive Rosfield’s story wraps up in Final Fantasy XVI.  And right now, that indeed could be the end of Clive and the rest of Valisthea’s story because currently, CBUIII has no plans for FFXVI DLC, according to director Hiroshi Takai. He and producer Naoki Yoshida say the team’s priority is getting the game into players’ hands to see what they think.  “It’s a one-off game,” Yoshida tells me. “We’re asking players to pay the full price for this experience, and so we want an experience that’s going to equal the amount of money that players are going to be paying and we want them to have satisfaction equal to what they paid or even more than that.  He, Takai, and the rest of CBUIII I speak to reiterate they created Valisthea to be vast, and it’s a world the team would like to return to. I get the sense if the demand is there, CBUIII is ready on a moment’s notice to return, perhaps through DLC or, harkening back to its MMO expertise, an expansion. At this point, considering recent entries like Final Fantasy XV and Final Fantasy VII Remake did receive DLC, it’d be unusual to see FFXVI not receive any.  “We have no idea if people are going to fall in love with Valisthea and fall in love with Clive’s story and want to see more of the world and more of its characters,” Yoshida says. “So while we always want to consider DLC or spinoffs or those types of things where you can learn more about the game, first we want to see if Valisthea and Clive are really things players around the world want to see more of and then make that decision.”  On a similar note, Takai says there aren’t any plans for non-game tie-ins a la FFXV’s Kingsglaive to supplement the world of FFXVI for the time being.

"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T05:12:21","SEATTLE -- — J.P. Crawford and Ty France hit back-to-back home runs in a three-run fifth inning, and the Seattle Mariners beat Oakland 3-2 Tuesday night to send the Athletics to their sixth straight loss and 14th in 16 games.  Oakland dropped to 10-40, which projects to a 32-130 record. That would be the most losses for any team in a season since the 1899 Cleveland Spiders went 20-134.  The A’s matched the 1932 Boston Red Sox and 1897 St. Louis Browns for the fourth-worst 50-game start in big league history at 10-40, ahead of only the 1897 Louisville Colonels at 7-43, and the 1899 Spiders and 1904 Washington Senators at 9-41.  A controversial fan interference call hurt the Mariners in the eighth. After France was hit on the left wrist by a Trevor May fastball and replaced by pinch-runner Sam Haggerty, Julio Rodríguez hit a foul fly down the line.  Ramón Laureano settled under the ball and was about to catch it, but a fan raised an arm out of the stands and over the field. Though the fan didn’t touch the ball, first base umpire Carlos Torres decided the fan interfered with Laureano’s view and called Rodríguez out, a decision upheld in a video review.  “It’s a strange call, you don’t see it called too often on the field,” Mariners manager Scott Servais said. “Sometimes it doesn’t get called and the other team takes it to review and then it goes from there, but it certainly was worth a challenge. We don’t want to take the bat away from Julio in that spot.”  France laid on the ground for several minutes after getting hit by May’s errant fastball earlier in the inning, and left the game after walking to first base. Initial x-rays said that France’s wrist was not fractured, but Servais said that he would likely miss at least the next couple of games as the team waits for swelling to go down.  Later in the inning, May also hit Seattle third baseman Eugenio Suarez in the back with a pitch.  “It’s a scary thing,” May said. “You don’t want to throw it by anyone’s face or anything. I don’t know (France) or Suarez personally, but I’ve played against them quite a bit. I know they’re good dudes ... You don’t want anyone to have to miss any time because you’re not very sharp.”  Laureano and Carlos Pérez hit RBI singles in the first off Marco Gonzales (4-1). who allowed five hits in six innings with four strikeouts.  “I thought we had a good gameplan,” Gonzales said. “Just some weak contact, some kind of fluky stuff happening in the first, and after that I settled in. I felt like we just attacked guys and I had confidence in my stuff and got ahead. I thought we saw the results from that.”  Tom Murphy doubled off Luis Medina (0-3) with two outs in the fifth, and Crawford tied the score one batter later with his second homer of the season. France then drove a slider 420 feet into the left-field bullpen for his third home run.  Jesús Aguilar, Gonzales’ last batter, grounded into a double play that ended the sixth, starting a streak of 11 straight Oakland outs to end the game.  “(Gonzales) made an adjustment after that first inning and we weren’t able to make the adjustment back,” A’s manager Mark Kotsay said. “He’s a veteran pitcher and he’s out there for a reason.”  Trevor Gott, Justin Topa and Paul Sewald pitched one perfect inning each, completing a five-hitter. Sewald is now a perfect 10-for-10 in save chances this season.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Athletics: Oakland reinstated May (anxiety) from the 15-day IL, and optioned LHP Kyle Muller to Triple-A Las Vegas. Muller, the A’s opening night starter, was 1-4 with an 8.04 ERA in 10 starts.  UP NEXT  Athletics LHP Ken Waldichuk (1-3, 6.85) will start Wednesday.

(AP) — Maikel Garcia had three hits, an RBI and a run and the Kansas City Royals beat the Detroit Tigers 4-1 on Tuesday night to snap a four-game losing streak.  Mike Mayers allowed one run on six hits in 4 2/3 innings in his first start for the Royals. He struck out a career-high eight and walked one.  “I would have liked a couple more outs,” Mayers said. ""We won — that's all that matters. The bullpen pitched really well. The adrenaline in the big leagues is a little more taxing than the adrenaline in Triple-A.”  His manager was impressed with his outing.  “He threw so many strikes and was efficient,” Matt Quatraro said. “Several times he had a three-pitch strikeout. He had a good cutter. He located his fastball and he threw several good breaking balls. He mixed it to the point where they weren't exactly sure what he was going to throw and he located it.”  Follow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules  Jose Cuas (3-0) was the winner, and Aroldis Chapman pitched a scoreless ninth for his second save.  Eduardo Rodriguez (4-4) took the loss. He allowed four runs — two earned — on eight hits in five innings. He struck out nine and walked two.  “I made, probably, two mistakes and I paid for it,” Rodriguez said. ""But the rest I just tip my hat to them because they made good swings on it.”  The Tigers threatened in the fourth, loading the bases with two outs on two infield singles and a walk, but Mayers induced a groundball from Miguel Cabrera.  The Royals got to Rodriguez in the fourth. Edward Olivares reached on shortstop Javier Baez's error and scored on a double by Michael Massey. Massey then came in on a single by Garcia. Garcia scored the third run of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Salvador Perez. Only one of the runs was earned.  “We had good at-bats off Rodriguez in the fourth,” Quatraro said. “To string a few hits together and put up some runs was nice. I really do believe we have a deep lineup. It's just a matter of consistently doing it night in and night out.”  Mayers labored in the fifth and left with the bases loaded and two outs. One of those runners scored on a single by Baez. Olivares singled with one out in the bottom of the fifth, scoring Bobby Witt Jr. with Kansas City's fourth run. Witt reached on the first bunt base hit of his career.  TRANSACTIONS  Royals RHP Nick Wittgren was selected from Triple-A Omaha. Wittgren, who pitched for Royals' pitching coach Brian Sweeney with Cleveland from 2019-21, had a 1.25 ERA with five saves in 17 appearances with Omaha.

"game","2019-07-07","15:00:00","{""Anaheim"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T19:36:00","“It’s not a gimmick. I genuinely love Mickey Mouse.”  AJ Grand-Scutton wants to prove his bona fides. For the CEO of Dlala Studios, serving as the creative director on Disney Illusion Island isn’t just another development job. It’s a chance to work in a world he’s long loved, paying tribute to the classic cartoon shorts that made Mickey and his pals some of the most beloved and recognizable characters in the world. There’s “a lot of the ‘30s and ‘40s” Mickey in the game, as Grand-Scutton notes, an era when Disney’s mouse wasn’t quite as mischievous as he was in his earliest 1920s cartoons, but still had a personality that could lead to unexpected hijinks and tomfoolery, especially when paired with his friends Goofy and Donald Duck. Those three are joined by Minnie Mouse as the four playable characters in Illusion Island, a platformer with Metroid-style elements that adopts the anarchic visual aesthetic of Disney’s recent Mickey Mouse shorts.  With its distinctive art style and surplus of charm, Illusion Island reminds me of Rayman Legends, only starring characters I’ve loved since before I could talk. It seems less frenetic, though, more focused on exploration and puzzle solving, in fitting with its Metroid inspirations. The four main characters all have their own unique skills and ways to move around, often having to interact with on-screen whatsises and gadgets to get to where they need to go. And although the hands-off demo I watched had a single player, up to four can play simultaneously, with each squad mate playing a different character. (Sorry, Daisy fans: Donald’s lady didn’t make the cut.) One thing none of them can do, though, is fight. That’s right: Disney Illusion Island is totally free of direct combat.  When he and lead designer Grant Allen “first started designing the high level of the game, all the walls were covered in Post-it notes,” Grand-Scutton reveals. “So we were like, this is what the game could be. These are all the disparate parts that could be involved in the game. And as time went on, we started taking Post-its off the wall, like this doesn’t make sense anymore. And combat stayed up there. And nearly every day, we were like, do we have to have combat and we were like, yeah. And we kept going and we just kept leaving it out there. And then it got to a point where we were like, okay, we need to talk about it. Like, why is combat on the wall? And we were both like, well, because a Metroidvania has to have combat. So we’re like, is there any reason combat is on the wall, except for these other games that have come before us that share a structure that had combat? And the answer was no. There was nothing else keeping combat in the game for us. So we took the Post-it off the wall, and we threw it in the bin. And luckily for us, Disney supported us.”  Mickey Mouse might be best known as a sweet, supportive, always cheerful corporate mascot for the world’s premiere creator of children’s entertainment, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t been violent in videogames in the past. He’s been wrecking monsters and weirdo creeps in games for decades. In stripping him of this violent streak, Disney Illusion Island understands the Mickey of the last 85 to 90 years better than pretty much any other game he’s been in. And that’s despite its visual influence being the modern day cartoon shorts instead of the classics.  At different points in the demo Mickey and his friends run into different new characters created specifically for the game—not just enemies, but NPCs who help move the story and quest along. “The real kind of fun challenge,” Grand-Scutton says, is making “a cast of characters that is new and original and has unique abilities” but then has to interact with these very well-known, well-defined characters from Disney. “I’d obviously never written for Mickey Mouse before doing this game. So we were learning about writing these characters and the tone and the type of language they use, and then we’re making this whole new set of characters that had to have their own unique personalities and characteristics.” Having these new additions make sense in the world of Mickey Mouse and crafting conversations that fit both the new and classic characters was a writing exercise than Grand-Scutton relished.  Again, it all points back to Grand-Scutton’s deep love and familiarity with the original Disney shorts. His favorite is 1937’s “Lonesome Ghosts,” where Mickey, Donald and Goofy are ghost exterminators (almost 50 years before Ghostbusters) who are pranked by bored and mischievous ghosts. “It’s my absolute favorite,” Grand-Scutton raves. “It embodies the stuff I really love about Mickey, which is like, he’s stupid. He’s slap-sticky. He’s very cheeky. It’s just really fun.”  “Lonesome Ghosts” inspired Disney Illusion Island in a few ways. One of the new characters bears a slight resemblance to the short’s ghosts, but Grand-Scutton explains how it influenced the game’s approach to its central character dynamics, and especially its depiction of Minnie Mouse. “I use [“Lonesome Ghosts”] as a reference for the game. How different would that have been if Minnie was there? I mean, she’s not a party pooper, but she’s not as stupid as the boys are when they’re together. That’s what I said to the team: Minnie’s not coming in like, oh, I’m going to be boring because I’m smart. She’s going to go on the adventure, she’s going to slap the boys when they’re being idiots, but she’s going to still want to have all the same fun, and ‘Lonesome Ghosts’ was always the example I used.”  With its modern look and classic inspiration, Disney Illusion Island strives to appeal to every generation of Mickey Mouse fan. And with a Metroid-like structure, a multiplayer style that recalls the console New Super Mario Bros. games, and its Switch exclusivity, it’s also aiming directly for fans of another legendary family-friendly brand. Disney and Nintendo fans alike will be able to see how Grand-Scutton and the team at Dlala fared when Disney Illusion Island hits the Switch on July 28.

"game","2019-07-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T10:43:40","Games-as-a-service refers to a monetization model in which the game is developed and released as a continually evolving service, rather than a one-time product. The game receives ongoing support from developers over years, and generates revenue through subscriptions or in-game purchases.  This business model has become the new standard for AAA gaming studios. Some games are even released for free to capture the largest player base possible, despite potentially operating at an initial loss.  Understanding your market is key before choosing to invest resources into creating new content  However, over time, many gamers have become familiar with predatory pay-to-win mechanics and loot box gambling. Many players have grown weary of companies that favor high-spending players, or 'whales,' over their free-to-play audience.  Meanwhile companies undergo crunch cycles to release an unfinished product that doesn't live up to the hype, and players can't help but feel that it's just another case of game studios squeezing cash from players without the quality gaming experience to justify it.  So what is the optimal way to release a live service game in this era, where players question the longevity of GaaS titles, and quality experiences don’t necessarily live long before getting shuttered? This article is intended to spotlight the keys to seemingly obvious strategies which most GaaS titles miss or could improve with implementing. Here are the four major strategies we cover:  1. Content is king  Smaller patches and season updates are the bread and butter of a service game. A good balance of longform or seasonal events, dailies (quests typically available for no longer than 24 hours), and battle passes will keep users engaged and surprise them every once in a while.  Content updates are a way to recapture and retain players from other titles they’ve moved on to. It’s not a failure of a studio or game when players check out from a game periodically – the cadence of updates helps with bringing them back.  World of Warcraft released WoW Classic in 2019, allowing players to experience the original version of the game as it was at launch in 2004. WoW subscriber revenue went up 223% as the franchise successfully re-engaged many players who had stopped playing the game and renewed interest even in the game’s latest updates and expansions.  Gamesight’s Yane An  Another game that further illustrates the importance of focusing on high quality content is No Man’s Sky. While during the initial release developer Hello Games faced backlash for not being able to deliver upon promises, the studio transparently continued to release major updates and expansions, winning back many players' trust and respect.The game finally went from being rated overwhelmingly negative to mostly positive on Steam, five years after release.  The gameplay loop of a live service game is its lifeblood. Without a fun, engaging, and fulfilling gameplay loop, it’s much more difficult to retain long term, committed players. One example of a well-designed, strong gameplay loop which continues to keep its community active is Genshin Impact's Spiral Abyss, a post-game battle tower challenge which changes every two weeks, encouraging players to achieve greater heights in-game once their scores reset.  As a game goes through its lifecycle, dedicate time to developing QoL improvements, new (wanted) features, and add polish to any unfinished aspects of the game. Don’t ignore key, critical concerns that large portions of the playerbase have. Try to understand what the core problem spurring their critiques is, and be transparent and communicative about how the team is tackling it. Transparency and honesty with a playerbase go a long way in building trust, which positively translates to an increase in long term players.  2. Harness the social ecosystems of your community  Creating a GaaS title means maintaining a commitment to your playerbase, who often become personally involved and invested in the game’s universe and well-being.  Developers have direct access to player feedback through social media, player surveys, and tracking marketing efforts. Players also generally consider game creators responsible for communicating updates on the state of their game; there's often both a passive expectation and desire to be kept in the loop through in-game updates.  This open and transparent communication is an important part of building trust and loyalty among the playerbase. Developers should pay attention to the demands of their community, even if they don’t give in all the time. Many games, like Apex Legends and Path of Exile, have active, regular updates from developers where they discuss upcoming content and changes.  Transparency and honesty with a playerbase go a long way in building trust, which positively translates to an increase in long term players  Understanding your market is key before choosing to invest resources into creating new content. This requires identifying your target audience, actively gathering data, and monitoring feedback. Just like how successful product development hinges on the principles of user-centered design, the most profitable games tend to iterate based on player feedback. Many games like Genshin Impact regularly collect and implement player feedback, rewarding players with in-game currency for filling out surveys.  Overall, building a strong community for a game requires a commitment to effective communication, transparency, and honesty. By focusing on these aspects, developers can create a dedicated and engaged player base that is invested in the game's success.  Developers should also pay attention to the conversations online, as well as content creators, who can create an engaged community around the game. Positively recognizing the user-generated content around your IP is a great way to build a relationship with your community.  Content creators also help drive creativity and innovation in the game, ensuring a game stays part of the conversation. Positive reviews and great engagement on social media like Twitch all provide social proof that your game is a worthwhile investment to new players.  3. The game balancing act between hardcore and casual  Games need to be enjoyable by both the seasoned gaming vet and the average player. It is necessary to be dynamic with game balance to ensure that general players have a path to reach high-skill play. If the gap is too large the game can be too frustrating for new players to mass adopt.  Balancing your game boils down to understanding your community – that is why they play the game and how they play it. It’s important to stratify your player base by demographics like hardcore and casual, as well as the modern addition of the content creator demographic.  Balancing your game boils down to understanding your community – that is why they play the game and how they play it  Understand the layers of your community, because exclusively catering to one specific portion of the playerbase may alienate others.  A game with a super vibrant community may suffer from changes geared toward high-skill competitiveness (Fall Guys, Genshin Impact, mainline Pokémon games). On the flip side, a game with a deep competitive community will balk at changes that lower the skill floor of the game (Counter-Strike, Escape from Tarkov, Apex Legends).  Segmenting changes based on game type or game mode can help reduce pushback from different demographics in a game’s general playerbase, like when Fortnite created its 'No Build' mode, or how most games offer separate ranked and normal queues.  Games with low skill floors and high skill caps allow for larger player bases (Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Valorant, Fortnite). You also need a healthy playerbase foundation in order to bring in new players. Finding a healthy balance between the needs of all of these parties is key to finding the biggest audience for your game.  4. Don’t force an esports status if it doesn’t fit  GaaS games often include competitive gameplay elements, such as leaderboards and rankings, which can motivate players to improve their skills and compete against one another. This can help build a passionate and dedicated player base that is invested in the game's success.  However catering to a highly competitive player base tends to fall short. The industry is over-saturated with high quality GaaS titles, so it’s hard to vie for people’s loyalties when perfecting an esport is already a full time job.  However fun should come first, and esports infrastructure second, if there is an organic demand and interest from the community. Fans will care about the competitive scene only if the core experience is fun; when that’s achieved, a wider audience will understand the complexity of the skill they’re watching.  Fans will care about the competitive scene only if the core experience is fun  Building an esports scene requires a significant investment of time, money, and resources. It may end up unsustainable for a given title, and a weak league can damage the game’s reputation.  The key to a good GaaS strategy is building a long-term, healthy relationship with your player base and treating them with respect by making the best decisions for your game. This involves listening to player feedback, and being transparent about updates and changes to the game.  Content is the most critical component of a successful GaaS game. Providing regular updates, expansions, and inclusive new content can help keep as many players as possible engaged and excited about the game.  While it's important to note industry trends and what other successful games are doing, it's also essential to focus on the unique strengths and vision of your game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaW5kdXN0cnkuYml6L3RoZS1vdmVybG9va2VkLWtleXMtdG8tbGF1bmNoaW5nLWFuZC1zdXN0YWluaW5nLWdhbWVzLWFzLWEtc2VydmljZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It feels all but confirmed that we'll see this mechanic in action at SGF alongside the game's other bells and whistles ahead of its September 19 launch.

The original Ticket To Ride, released in 2004, is a popular strategy game about connecting train lines across the continental United States. It was awarded the coveted Speil des Jahres that year, among the most prestigious in all of tabletop gaming. Over the last two decades, that game has spawned multiple different expressions, with maps that depict areas of Europe, Asia, and other continents, and several digital versions for PC and mobile devices.  A CGI trailer launched across social media on Tuesday teases a new edition of the game, which will reportedly include input from original designer Alan R. Moon. But the logo also features two names that cast a long shadow in the tabletop space: Rob Daviau and Matt Leacock.  Daviau invented the legacy-style format of modern board games with Risk: Legacy, a version of the classic wargame that evolves and changes across multiple sessions of play, telling a larger, overarching story of an entire fictional world. He later expanded the legacy concept into multiple additional board games, including SeaFall. The idea truly caught fire, however, when Daviau teamed up with Leacock, creator of the wildly popular board game Pandemic. Together, the pair created Pandemic Legacy, a critically acclaimed board game that’s widely regarded as one of the best ever made.  Bringing Daviau and Leacock together for the first time since Pandemic Legacy: Season 0, released in 2020, all but assures that this next version of Ticket To Ride will be a legacy game. But Asmodee, which owns Ticket To Ride developer Days of Wonder, tells Polygon that it has nothing else to add… for now.  Expect more information as we kick off the busy tabletop convention season this summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzM0NzUxL3RpY2tldC10by1yaWRlLWxlZ2FjeS1nYW1lLXRyYWlsZXItZGF2aWF1LWxlYWNvY2stbW9vbtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMzczNDc1MS90aWNrZXQtdG8tcmlkZS1sZWdhY3ktZ2FtZS10cmFpbGVyLWRhdmlhdS1sZWFjb2NrLW1vb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The assistant professor of philosophy at St. Norbert College in De Pere lost on Tuesday's episode of the TV game show, bringing his nine-game win streak to an end.  Chan was ahead entering Final Jeopardy!, but for his response seeking the names of two lovers in a Shakespeare play from the Latin words for ""blessed"" he wrote ""Who are Beatrice & Benedict?""  However, the correct response was the characters Beatrice and Benedick.  Being one letter off cost the Green Bay resident as he bet $12,201 of his $17,400 total, bringing his amount under Lynn Di Vito who, despite also getting the response wrong, bet a lesser amount of money. Di Vito wagered just $3,000 of her $14,800 to finish with $11,800.  Upon realizing he lost, Chan let out a deep sigh and bent over lowering his head to height of the podium.

In his written response, Benedict was crossed out and rewritten. Another Reddit user asked him what made him cross it out.  ""I was worried that my first Benedict was illegible -- I should have been making it less legible :0,"" he responded.  Chan won $252,600 during his nine-game winning streak, all of which were runaway victories.

The second miss cost him $3,000 in Double Jeopardy! as he tried to retake the lead from Di Vito, a retired museum educator from Colorado.

"game","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T02:51:00","CHICAGO — The bulk of the Mets’ resurgence over the last week was built on starting pitching and late-inning scoring.  Neither element was there for the Mets on Tuesday, when they got jumped early and wasted comeback chances later in a 7-2 loss to the Cubs at Wrigley Field that snapped their five-game winning streak.  Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander had ace-like performances Sunday in helping the Mets sweep a doubleheader against the Guardians, but the momentum stopped with Tylor Megill’s first career start in the Friendly Confines.  Offensively, the Mets went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position, on a night when Pete Alonso accounted for all their scoring, with a home run and an RBI fielder’s choice.  It was hardly the start the Mets (25-24) wanted to a six-game road trip that will also take them to face Colorado this weekend.  AP  The Mets have lost 10 of their last 13 road games and haven’t won a series away from Citi Field in over a month.  Megill lasted just 3 ²/₃ innings and allowed six runs, two of which were unearned, on six hits and two walks with five strikeouts. The outing was the shortest of the season for the right-hander, who had surrendered three earned runs combined in his previous two starts, spanning 11 innings, against the Nationals and Rays.  “My command was a little spotty, but I feel my stuff was playing well today,” said Megill, who averaged 94.4 mph — a shade above normal — with his four-seam fastball. “It’s just baseball. Things I guess tend to happen like that. No excuses. Just go out there and get the job done.”  Megill had been flip-flopped in the rotation with Kodai Senga, ensuring the Japanese right-hander will receive extra rest following his scheduled Wednesday start.  The Cubs battered Megill in the second inning, when they smashed two homers in taking a 4-0 lead. Selya Suzuki homered leading off the inning before Christopher Morel walked and Yan Gomes stroked a two-out, RBI single. Morel had advanced to second on a groundout and went to third on Gary Sanchez’s passed ball. Matt Mervis then blasted a two-run homer to extend the Cubs’ lead.  “I was falling behind in counts and then a few big fly balls,” Megill said. “A lot of pitches.”  Alonso’s home run in the fourth narrowed the gap to 4-1. The homer was Alonso’s seventh in 12 career games at Wrigley Field and continued his recent barrage: He homered in four straight games last week to tie a career-best streak. Alonso’s 18 homers overall this season lead MLB.  “I feel like I am doing a really good job of capitalizing on stuff in my zone and if it’s not there, not swinging or just having a good at-bat,” Alonso said.  Mets first baseman Pete Alonso (20) singles against the Cubs during the seventh inning.  Megill was removed with two outs in the fourth inning, after the Cubs had added two runs to place the Mets in a 6-1 hole. Both runs were unearned after Tommy Pham dropped Mike Tauchman’s fly ball to left for a two-base error to start the inning. Mervis and Dansby Swanson each delivered a two-out RBI single, ending Megill’s night. Dominic Leone entered and walked Ian Happ to load the bases before getting the third out.  “I didn’t think [Megill’s] numbers were indicative of how he pitched,” manager Buck Showalter said. “I just wish we played a little crisper behind him.”  The Mets had few early opportunities against lefty Drew Smyly, who escaped trouble in the first inning after he allowed a leadoff double to Brandon Nimmo. Smyly retired Eduardo Escobar and Francisco Lindor and walked Alonso with two outs before Mark Vientos struck out.  Eduardo Escobar has his right ankle checked during the first inning. AP  In the sixth, the Mets loaded the bases with nobody out, but managed just one run, on Alonso’s RBI fielder’s choice. Nimmo and Escobar singled in succession to begin the rally and Lindor walked, knocking out Smyly. But Jeremiah Estrada recorded three straight outs and allowed just one run to score.  Jeff McNeil had an opportunity in the seventh as a pinch hitter with runners on first and second and two outs, but he struck out against Mark Leiter Jr.  “We had a couple of opportunities — not many — but you have to cash those in when you are that far behind,” Showalter said.  Morel homered in the seventh against Stephen Nogosek to become the first Cubs player since Sammy Sosa in 1998 to homer in five straight games. The homer was the Cubs’ third of the game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL21ldHMtZml2ZS1nYW1lLXdpbi1zdHJlYWstYnJva2VuLWFmdGVyLWN1YnMtcmlwLXR5bG9yLW1lZ2lsbC_SAV9odHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9tZXRzLWZpdmUtZ2FtZS13aW4tc3RyZWFrLWJyb2tlbi1hZnRlci1jdWJzLXJpcC10eWxvci1tZWdpbGwvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:26:47","In need of a spark, Nashville SC coach Gary Smith inserted three of his top players − Hany Mukhtar, David Lovitz and Alex Muyl − early in the second half Tuesday night in a U.S. Open Cup game at Inter Miami CF.  That spark came 50 seconds later in the Round of 16 game when Muyl scored off a header to tie it at 1-1.  Another spark came less than a minute later, and this one, a lightning delay, did not work in Nashville's favor.  It halted all momentum.  After a 33-minute break with the rain still pouring, Miami regained control when midfielder substitute Nicolas Stefanelli scored in the 72nd minute to send the hosts to a 2-1 win, snapping Nashville's unbeaten streak over all competitions at eight games in front of a crowd of 2,244 at DRV PNK Stadium.  MUKHTAR SCORES TWICE:Hany Mukhtar scores twice in Nashville SC's 2-1 victory over Charlotte FC  NASHVILLE SC DOMINATES MIAMI:Nashville SC dominates Inter Miami, extends its unbeaten streak to seven games  ""It was really there for us to win with some senior players coming off the bench,"" Smith said. ""After the weather break we could say it was a lapse of focus or concentration that can sometimes happen. But it was the difference between the two teams tonight.""  Despite the loss, Smith said providing some of his less experienced players the opportunity to play quality minutes could be beneficial down the line.  ""It was huge for some of what we would call our fringe players,"" Smith said. ""Some really good performances. All in all I think the guys gave a terrific account for themselves. We played with a lot of pride, we played with a lot of determination and barrowing a little more quality in the final third, the final stages we might have even gotten ourselves an equalizer. But it wasn't to be.""  A 2-1 Nashville win over Miami had come in the streak just six days earlier at Geodis Park. The loss Tuesday prevented Nashville (7-4-4) from tying a club record 7-0-2 run it posted in 2021.  The win sends Miami into the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Cup for the first time. It was Nashville's first loss since falling 2-1 at New York City on April 15.  Midfielder Randall Leal missed a prime opportunity to give Nashville a first-half lead on a breakaway when he hit the right post in the 35th minute. That was Nashville's fifth shot and Miami still had none.  Miami finally took advantage in the 57th minute when Robert Taylor fed Franco Negri for a goal to go up 1-0. It came on Miami's first shot on target.  Mukhtar, the reigning Major League Soccer MVP who scored both of Nashville's goals in a 2-1 win over Charlotte on Saturday, took two shots in his 25 minutes of play. It was his first time to play in a U.S. Open Cup game this season.  It was only Miami's second win over Nashville in the series, which began in 2020 when both teams entered MLS. Tuesday's game was the first between the two teams in U.S. Open Cup play.  Miami was coming off back-to-back losses.

"game","2023-10-16","19:00:00","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:23:37","The Washington Mystics had a chance at revenge Tuesday night in their second consecutive battle against the Connecticut Sun but came up short in a 88-81 defeat to drop to 1-2 on the young season.  Early on in the contest in D.C., it was evident both teams’ frontcourts would be the focal point of their respective offenses.  The Sun were paced yet again by Alyssa Thomas (22 points, 10 rebounds, five assists), who has now led the team in scoring in two of their three wins to start the season. Alongside her, fellow forwards DeWanna Bonner and Brionna Jones chipped in double-figures with 11 points apiece. All five Connecticut starters scored in double-figures as the team shot 47.5% from the field.  Washington’s defense was a point of emphasis postgame.  “Obviously, [we were] not good enough closing down driving lanes,” Mystics’ head coach Eric Thibault said after the loss. “Our pick-and-roll coverage needs to improve quickly because we were not on the same page a few times. The ball is going one way and our help defender is going the other way, and that shouldn’t happen...[it’s an] early season game that we can learn a lot from.”  Shakira Austin, who has displayed some incredible progress in just her second year as a pro, was also key for the Mystics despite the loss as she poured in 14 points and seven rebounds. Brittney Sykes also had her best game as a Mystic since coming to Washington over the offseason, contributing 17 points and seven rebounds with a +10 rating.  Washington stayed in the game thanks to Elena Delle Donne, who the team seemed to feed offensively each time they got in their halfcourt sets. She chipped in 27 points on 11-of-18 shooting from the field. Her point total was the highest she’s contributed in a game since Sept. 3, 2019 vs. New York (30 points).  “I’m actually more excited about the minutes I’ve been playing. I’m like leading this team in minutes right now,” Delle Donne said with a laugh.  She’s right. Delle Donne has either led the team or tied for the team lead in minutes in each of the first three games of the season. This is after having the ‘greatest offseason’ of her career following multiple injuries that sidelined her for the majority of the past three seasons.  “Really not worried about the scoring,” Delle Donne said. “You know, there’s different nights, different things are gonna be needed. Tonight, I was feeling really good shooting it, but yeah, I’m excited about the minutes played and being able to bounce back with what, we had three games in five days? Feeling good, feeling strong.”  Coach Thibault was also happy with the two-time MVP’s performance but noted there is much work to do.  “We asked a lot of her today, probably more than we should have to,” Thibault said. “We’ve gotta find ways for her to attack people besides having her back to the basket, because it does take a toll. It’s just frustrating to lose regardless of the stats.”  Washington has a couple of days off before their next contest, away at Chicago on Friday night. The team will be able to practice in earnest for the first time since before their season opener last week.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi93YXNoaW5ndG9uLW15c3RpY3Mvc3VuLWZyb250Y291cnQtcG93ZXJzLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LW15c3RpY3MtZHJvcC1zZWNvbmQtc3RyYWlnaHQtZ2FtZdIBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi93YXNoaW5ndG9uLW15c3RpY3Mvc3VuLWZyb250Y291cnQtcG93ZXJzLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LW15c3RpY3MtZHJvcC1zZWNvbmQtc3RyYWlnaHQtZ2FtZT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ejoy, the Alibaba subsidiary behind the hugely popular strategy game, said on microblogging site Weibo that it would appeal the decision of the Guangzhou court, and that the game will continue to operate.

The fine, if upheld through the appeal, would be one of the heftiest issued by a court in China involving video games.  Ejoy was ordered to delete 79 items which were considered to have infringed on the copyrights of ""Shuai Tu Zhi Bin"", another popular strategy game developed by NetEase, according to the court's ruling.  The Alibaba unit said in its statement the court had rejected NetEase's demand to suspend the operation of ""Three Kingdoms Tactics"" while also acknowledging that the game had its own innovations.  ""Shuai Tu Zhi Bin"", also known as ""Invincible"", is one of NetEase's most profitable games, having made just under $1 billion since its launch in 2015.

"game","2023-05-20","17:00:00","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T06:23:15","Match info  Riverhounds vs. Columbus Crew  Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Round of 16  Date: Wednesday, May 24  Time: 7 p.m.  Location: Highmark Stadium  Tickets: Ticketmaster  Odds: Hounds +220 / Draw +250 / Columbus +105 (FanDuel)  TV: Pittsburgh’s CW  Streaming: CBS Sports Golazo (national), Pittsburgh’s CW (local)  Live statistics: USL Championship Match Center  Live updates: @RiverhoundsSC on Twitter  Match hashtags: #PITvCLB, #HOUNDTAHN and #USOC2023  PITTSBURGH (May 23, 2023) — One of the biggest crowds in Highmark Stadium history is expected Wednesday night, when the Hounds play deeper into the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup than they have in 22 years with a Round of 16 match at home against the Columbus Crew of MLS.  It will be just the second time the South Side venue has hosted MLS opposition — the first being a 3-1 extra time loss to D.C. United in 2015 — and the first since Highmark’s 2018 supporters’ section expansion. With those factors and a forecast of warm, dry weather, a crowd pushing toward the stadium’s 6,073 record is expected for what will be a stiff test for the Hounds.  The winner of Wednesday’s game will advance to the Quarterfinals, where they will go on the road to face FC Cincinnati on June 6 or June 7. Cincinnati moved on Tuesday night by eliminating the New York Red Bulls on penalties, 5-3, after playing to a 1-1 draw.  As one of two USL Championship teams remaining in the hunt for the championship of U.S. Soccer, the Hounds still have “underdog” status in title. But after dictating play for stretches in the 1-0 road win last round over the New England Revolution, the Hounds are no longer catching anyone off guard, as evidenced by the betting odds of only +220 — a steep decline from the +550 price against the Revolution.  The last time the Hounds and Crew met in a competitive match, the Crew took a 1-0 win to eliminate the Hounds from the 2019 Open Cup at Mapfre Stadium in the Ohioan capital. The teams have also met frequently in the preseason, including this year, when the Crew hosted a closed-door scrimmage at their training facility. But that match, which featured a heavy dose of trialists and reserve players getting the majority of minutes, will have virtually no bearing on Wednesday night’s highly anticipated tilt.  The Crew come into the match off a tough 3-2 loss Saturday to their rivals, FC Cincinnati, but Columbus showed how lethal it can be in its previous match in the Open Cup, a 5-1 demolition at Loudoun United FC. If anything is working against the Crew, it is the fact this is the team’s fifth match in 14 days (as opposed to the fourth in 15 for the Hounds), so it will be seen at game time whether coach Wilfried Nancy will deploy attacking stars Lucas Zelarayán and Cucho Hernandez from the outset or hold them back as options off the bench.  The Hounds, meanwhile, were able to cut short the nights of influential players such as Albert Dikwa, Danny Griffin, Kenardo Forbes and Arturo Ordóñez on Saturday, as the team cruised to the finish line of a 4-1 win over the Las Vegas Lights. That leaves Bob Lilley the option of a full-strength lineup Wednesday, rather than needing to rest players as he did bringing on Dikwa and Forbes in the final half-hour of the win over New England.  Fans attending the game should be aware of a number of changes as a result of the sellout crowd expected.  Gates for the match will open an hour earlier at 5 p.m., and the Tailgate Zone entertainment — live music, beer specials and more — will only be accessible inside the ticketed area of the stadium. Hounds local television partner KDKA will be broadcasting live from the field pre-match, and the Hounds will debut their new “Summer Gold” alternate kits when they take the field at game time.  Parking in the West Lot is sold out, and only fans and VIPs with digital parking passes will be admitted. Fans who did not purchase parking in advance are advised to enter on the opposite end of Station Square and utilize the main parking deck or one of the lots on the East end of the stadium.  As of Tuesday night, very few seats remain, in addition to limited suites and standing-room only tickets, all of which can be purchased through Ticketmaster or at the Highmark Stadium Box Office. The game will be shown locally on Pittsburgh’s CW, and the national stream will be free to watch through CBS Sports Golazo, which is accessible through the CBS Sports website and mobile app.  Downloadable Game Notes","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpdmVyaG91bmRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvbWF0Y2gtcHJldmlldy1jb2x1bWJ1cy1jcmV3LW9wZW4tY3VwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-04-25","19:05:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T01:41:15","The primary storyline heading into Game 1 of the Calder Cup Eastern Conference finals centered on how the Rochester Americans’ suddenly dynamic offense would fare against one of the best defensive teams in the American Hockey League.  During the regular season, Hershey gave up the second-fewest goals in the 32-team league, and then in bull-rushing Charlotte and Hartford out in the first two rounds, Bears goalie Hunter Shepard allowed only 12 goals in seven games.  Fourteen seconds into Tuesday night’s series opener at GIANT Center, we began to get the answer. Amerks defenseman Joseph Cecconi ripped a wrist shot from the slot past Shepard, and before 27 minutes had been played, Shepard’s night was done after he allowed four goals on just 16 shots.  From there, the Amerks cruised to a 5-1 victory for their seventh consecutive postseason victory, the club’s longest streak since 1991 when they won 10 straight before ultimately losing to Springfield in the Calder Cup Finals.  “I don't think we were great tonight, but we were pretty good,” Amerks coach Seth Appert said. “Hershey is gonna be great in Game 2, and so our game’s got to go up, our competitiveness in how we manage the puck, and we'll need to be willing to make adjustments to try to take away things they did to us or try to exploit things that we can with them.”  In winning six straight to eliminate Syracuse and Toronto, the Amerks averaged six goals per game and they were getting production from everywhere, and that continued again. Cecconi isn’t exactly a goal scorer, and neither is fellow defenseman Matt Bartkowski who blew a slap shot past Shepard early in the second period.  More expected were the goals by Brett Murray in the first, Mason Jobst in the second , and Lukas Rousek into an empty net in the third in what was a very impressive performance from puck drop to final horn.  Here’s what happened in Game 1:  First period: The ultimate in fast starts  Cecconi’s goal was a shocker, for sure, and it set the tone for the night. Murray tapped the puck to Cecconi at the red line and he skated up the middle unguarded and beat Shepard low to the blocker side, one the goalie surely would have liked to have back.  Malcolm Subban protected that early lead when he stopped Garrett Pilon on a breakaway and a little more two minutes later, the Amerks went up 2-0. Jeremy Davies pushed in from the right wing and backhanded a pass to Michael Mersch who was camped on the right post. Mersch quickly slipped a backhand pass to the other post where Murray had an easy tap-in.  Late in the period the Amerks, who have struggled when shorthanded, killed off the only penalty of the period, allowing just one shot on goal.  Second period: Doubling the lead  Bartkowski got things rolling when his blast from the left point sailed past Shepard low blocker side, a shot he never saw thanks to a screen by defenseman Zach Metsa at 1:42.  Not quite five minutes later, Jobst scored a beautiful goal to make it 4-0. He rushed into the zone with speed, made a quick move to his left to create separation from defenseman Lukas Johansen and from the left circle he wired a wrist shot top shelf over Shepard’s glove at 6:32.  At that point Shepard made the skate of shame to the bench, Zach Fucale replaced him, and he needed to be sharp right away as he kicked out his left pad to stop Jiri Kulich on a power play, then robbed Isak Rosen all alone on the doorstep.  The Amerks killed off another late penalty, and by not scoring and bringing some momentum into the third period, Hershey was done. It capped a solid defensive period.  “That was nice to see,” Appert said. “I think our defense was pretty good in the Toronto series for the most part … probably better than the number of goals scored looked like, but that’s a really good team. Subby did his job. He was excellent when he needed to be excellent. I thought especially in the middle period we defended really well, that got us out in transition a little bit more and it was a key to our win tonight.”  Third period: Dialing it back, holding on  Third periods have been a little weird for the Amerks in the playoffs when they’ve had a lead. They don’t play with the same aggressive style they do early, and they put almost zero pressure on Fucale. They didn’t get their first shot on goal until nearly 14 minutes had been played  Meanwhile, the Bears broke Subban’s shutout when Aaron Ness scored on a shot from the bottom of the left circle at 9:42. However, they weren’t able to get any closer as the Amerks continued to lock it down on defense before Rousek hit the empty net with 1:01 left to play.  “I thought we did a better job tonight of managing it than maybe some of the other leads we’ve had in the playoffs,” Appert said. “We didn’t sit back, but I’d still like us to attack more. There’s a balance; you need to stay aggressive because we’re a better team when we’re aggressive, without playing risky and not managing the puck.”  Inside the numbers  ▶ These two teams have been playing each other since 1956, the year the Amerks joined the AHL. The Bears joined in 1940 and in regular-season play, they have dominated Rochester, posting a record of 217-194-53. They met twice this year, the Bears winning 2-1 at home March 18, the Amerks winning 4-3 in a shootout March 24.  ▶ In the postseason, the tides are completely flipped as the Amerks now own a 25-10 record, having won six of the seven series they have played. The Amerks first Calder Cup championship came in a 4-1 rout of Hershey in 1965. The last time they faced each other in the postseason was 2000 and the Amerks swept 4-0 in the conference finals before losing to Hartford in the Calder Cup finals, their last visit.  ▶ With a 44-19-5-4 record for 97 points in the regular season, the Bears finished one point behind Providence for the top spot in the Eastern Conference and earned the franchise’s 70th postseason berth including its 14th in 16 seasons while affiliated with the Washington Capitals.  ▶ Entering the series, the Amerks were 12-for-29 (41.4%) on the power play in the first two rounds, but were also just 19-for-28 on the penalty kill. In this game they didn't score on their lone power play, and they killed off both of Hershey's man advantage situations.

"game","2023-04-13","Not Discerned","{""Pittsburgh"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:25:51","PITTSBURGH -- — Nathan Eovaldi pitched a complete game for the second time in five starts after throwing just two in the first 226 of his major league career, leading the Texas Rangers over the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-1 on Tuesday night.  Eovaldi (6-2) allowed six hits, struck out five and walked one, his fifth straight start of at least seven innings. The 33-year-old right-hander, a 12-year big league veteran, pitched a three-hit shutout in a 2-0 win over the Yankees on April 29.  “Right now, I feel like I'm really locked in,” Eovaldi said. “We're staying on top of the mechanics and just the little things, making sure we're doing the work. ... A lot of things have to go into a complete game. We were able to score runs early, we had the lead. Any time we have the lead, it's my job to prevent them from scoring.”  Eovaldi threw 71 of 104 for strikes after tossing 113 game against the Yankees.  “The key is just how efficient he's pitching,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “He didn't really have a stressful inning. Gave up the one run, but besides that, it's pretty easy work for him.”  Texas has won four of five, losing Monday's series opener 6-4 . Pittsburgh has split its last eight games after losing 11 of 12 and has not won a series since taking two of three at Washington on April 29 and 30.  Rich Hill (4-4) gave up five runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings with a season-high nine strikeouts.  “I think if you want to look at it as a good outing, fair outing or whatever, in my mind, that’s not a championship mindset,” Hill said. “You’ve got to hold yourself to a higher standard and you’ve got to be able to execute pitches throughout the entire game.”  Josh Jung hit his 11th home run of his first full season in the majors to give the Rangers a five-run lead in the eighth, crushing a curveball from Duane Underwood Jr. 444 feet to left. The 25-year-old hit five home runs in 26 games last year after debuting on Sept. 9.  “Love the way he comes down here every day and just works to get better, gives you good at bats,"" Bochy said. ""I really thought this kid would have a nice year. I know it's early, but I still feel that way, trust me.”  Two Texas runs came in on balks, one from Hill for the second of two runs in the first and another by José Hernández that capped a three-run sixth.  Pittsburgh's Ji Hwan Bae was picked off first in the third inning, then overran second and was tagged out on Andrew McCutchen's eighth-inning single. The Pirates committed three errors and had five wild pitches in their previous loss, an 8-3 rout to Arizona on Sunday.  “The tolerance is we have to be better in those moments,” Pittsburgh manager Derek Shelton said. “We’re still going to continue to teach because we have a bunch of young players and they’re going to make mistakes.”  Bryan Reynolds drove in the Pirates' run with a third-inning double.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Rangers: C Mitch Garver (left knee sprain) and OF Travis Jankowski (right hamstring strain) joined Triple-A Round Rock for rehab assignments. Garver, who has been out since April 8, is expected to DH the first two games before catching the third. Jankowski has not played since experiencing hamstring tightness against the Angels on May 7.  Pirates: 1B Ji Man Choi fielded groundballs from his knees before the game. He is on the 60-day injured list with a left Achilles sprain sustained April 13.  UP NEXT  LHP Martín Pérez (5-1, 4.01) will take the mound for the Rangers in the series finale Wednesday afternoon, opposite Pirates RHP Johan Oviedo (3-3, 4.69).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWxiL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE0NzE3NDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With fans (known as “kranks”) expected to be out in force to cheer and jeer the proceedings,teams from the City of Elmhurst and Elmhurst University will face off in a Town vs. Gown showdown beginning at 2:00 p.m. on the University Mall.  Fans are encouraged to bring lawn chairs, picnics and refreshments to enjoy during the game. The event is free and open to the public. Free parking is available in the Elmhurst University parking lots.  As has been the tradition for the past few years, Mayor Scott Levin will lead the City of Elmhurst squad, and the Elmhurst University team skipper will be President Troy VanAken. The Elmhurst History Museum’s executive director, Dave Oberg, will oversee the competition as “barrister” (also known as an umpire) and share the rules and slang terms with the spectators. (A list of terms is below.)  “The Vintage Baseball Game is a really fun way to learn about the history of one of our country’s favorite summer pastimes,” Oberg said. “Everyone has a fantastic time, whether they are on the field or spectators, so we are anticipating another great afternoon of old-school baseball at Elmhurst University.”  “We are grateful to Elmhurst University for hosting us, and to the Elmhurst Heritage Foundation for sponsoring this annual event,” he added. “It is truly a unique experience for baseball fans of all ages.”  For more information, visit the Elmhurst History Museum’s website, elmhursthistory.org, or call (630) 833-1457.  19th-century Baseball Terminology  Vintage Baseball Games are filled with their own vocabulary, including cheers and jeers from the stands and players.

Instead, they responded with a strong performance that will bring the series back to TD Garden on Thursday night. They avoided a sweep with a 116-99 win in which they shot 52.2 percent from the field and played some of their best defense in recent memory.  So what changed?  Celtics Talk POSTGAME POD: Celtics stave off elimination with Game 4 win against the Heat | Listen & Subscribe  According to Jaylen Brown, the players made an effort to connect with each other ahead of the do-or-die showdown.  ""Just coming together. Talking it out,"" Brown said after Tuesday's victory. ""A lot of times when you get to this point, down 3-0, you see locker rooms and teams start to go in the other direction. We wanted to make sure that we stayed together. We wanted to make sure that we looked each other in the eye, and came out today and put our best foot forward.  ""And I'm proud of our group for doing that. Because you see teams with their back against the wall and you see they just collapse. You didn't see that tonight. You seen us come together, you seen us play defense, you seen us make the right plays. And I feel like that shows a lot about our character, especially in a game where everything is on the line and everything has went wrong in the last couple of games.""  Brown acknowledged the unflattering reports and rumors that have surrounded the team in recent days. For the Celtics, the focus during their team get-together was to ignore the noise and stay together as a unit heading into what could have been the final game of their 2022-23 season.  ""Obviously, we underperformed in the last three games and you start to hear all these stories coming out about X, Y and Z,"" Brown said. ""Who knows where they actually come from. And 99 percent of them aren't true at all. So we wanted to stay together, and I think that was the emphasis last night, was make sure we was on the same page.  ""We didn't want to come out and lay an egg. We wanted to come out and play together. We wanted to come out and trust each other, come out and play some defense. Have some pride about yourself and find a way to win a game. We're all more than capable of doing it, so tonight we got it done.""  ""You start to hear all these stories come out about X Y and Z... 99% of them not true at all.""

The initiative focuses on helping students develop social and emotional awareness while developing critical workplace soft skills and work ethic. During the month of March, the CCCTC focused on Appreciation. The students did lessons on making sure they recognize that consumers decide which businesses they will support based on the service employees provide, being gracious at work, treating customers in a way that lets them know they are always respected, smiling on a regular basis, and identifying behaviors that go beyond the basic levels of customer service. Each month throughout the school year, the CCCTC focused on developing another “A” game attribute.

"game","2023-05-24","11:35:00","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:26:32","The Rainiers return home to open a 12-game homestand at Cheney Stadium, and it all starts with an 11:35 morning game today. Las Vegas is in town for the first six games, and then Sacramento comes in for the last six.  Tacoma and Las Vegas have played one series this year, a six-gamer at Las Vegas Ballpark the final week of April. The Rainiers lost four of the six games to the Oakland A’s affiliate, bookending the wins in the first and last games of the series.  The squad brings a little two-game win streak into the homestand. After dropping three of the first four games in Albuquerque, the Rainiers bore down and won the final two games with some timely hitting in each one, netting a series split.  For the first time in a couple of weeks, we have some roster changes.  The Mariners have ended a 16-day dry spell of Rainiers roster moves by rescuing 34-year-old right-hander Marcus Walden from the independent Atlantic League, where he was pitching for the Gastonia Honey Hunters – a team I had never heard of, until now.  Walden has tons of Triple-A experience, nearly all of it in the International League. He last appeared in the Pacific Coast League back in 2014 with Sacramento.  While Walden is going to be a starter for the Rainiers, it was a relief role that allowed him to achieve success in the major leagues as a 30-year-old rookie for the Boston Red Sox in 2019. That season he was one of the most frequently-used relivers in the majors, appearing in 70 games and going 9-2 with a 3.81 ERA.  To make room for Walden on the roster and in the starting rotation, Nick Davila was transferred to Advanced-A Everett. Davila was a feel-good story the last three weeks, putting up three very good starts as a fill-in from Low-A Modesto, and we’ll definitely be keeping an eye on him for the future.  RAINIERS DAILY  YESTERDAY: The whole league was off yesterday. On Sunday the Rainiers salvaged a split of the Albuquerque road trip by scoring two runs in the ninth inning and beating the Isotopes, 6-4, in a rain-delayed affair. Zach DeLoach went 5-for-5 in the game – the Rainiers first five-hit performance since Jantzen Witte did it in August of 2021. Pat Valaika drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly in the top of the ninth before Jack Larsen singled home an insurance run. The Rainiers bullpen was terrific, with Matt Festa nailing down his PCL-leading eighth save.  TODAY: Las Vegas Aviators (21-24) at Tacoma Rainiers (21-24), 11:35.  OPPONENT AFFILIATION: Oakland A’s.  OPPOSING MANAGER: Fran Riordan.  SEASON SERIES: Las Vegas leads, 4-2.  PITCHERS: RHP Colton Eastman (0-4, 4.96) at RHP Marcus Walden (0-0, 0.00)  It’s the Battle of Central Fresno High School alums, as Walden makes his Tacoma debut. Crazy that they both went to the same high school – even if they were eight years apart.  ROSTER MOVES: We went 16 days without a roster move, and that’s a Dipoto-era record. It ended yesterday when the Mariners signed Marcus Walden, and transferred Nick Davila to Everett. Furthermore, utilityman Dylan Moore is expected to start a rehabilitation assignment with Tacoma today.  HOT HITTERS: Zach DeLoach has a nine-game hitting streak, going 16-for-34 during the stretch… Cooper Hummel has hit safely in six straight games… Mike Ford has 46 RBI, which ties him with Las Vegas outfielder Cody Thomas for the lead all of minor league baseball… Mason McCoy homered twice during the Albuquerque series.  OPPONENT NEWS: Las Vegas is on a 12-game road trip; they just lost four of six at Salt Lake… the Aviators had a 22-run uprising in game two of the Salt Lake series… the Aviators have some hot hitters: Trenton Brooks has reached base in 18 straight games, and he had an 11-game hitting streak end Saturday… Jonah Bride is batting .382 in May… Tyler Soderstrom has 12 hits during a six0game hitting streak… the only former Rainiers player on the Las Vegas roster is pitcher Joe Wieland, who went 14-6 as a starter for Tacoma in 2016.

"game","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T03:56:00","The Boston Celtics are still alive. Facing elimination in Miami on Tuesday night in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Heat, the Celtics showed some impressive poise and finally knocked down some 3-point shots in a season-saving 116-99 win. Now, the series will return to Boston for Game 5 on Thursday night.  As expected, the Celtics came out with all sorts of energy in the opening few minutes, but the Heat withstood that surge and responded to take control of the game and control much of the first half. They went into the break up six, and quickly extended their advantage to nine early in the third, and seemed on the verge of a big run to pull away. After that point, however, it was all Celtics. They immediately ripped off a 16-0 run to take the lead and never trailed again.  Jayson Tatum was terrific in the second half, and finished with 33 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists on 14-of-22 from the field. He didn't have a single fourth-quarter field goal in the first three games, but made some big plays in the fourth to prevent a comeback from the Heat. Another major factor was the Celtics' 3-point shooting, which had been ice-cold to start the series. In this one, they knocked down 19 triples and outscored the Heat by 33 points from behind the arc.  Here are some key takeaways from the game:  Tatum leads the way  Jayson Tatum has not been the biggest issue for the Celtics in this series -- far from it, in fact -- but he also had zero fourth quarter field goals in the first three games and made some crucial mistakes down the stretch of Games 1 and 2. The Celtics needed a complete 48 minutes from him on Tuesday to stave off elimination, and he delivered.  In yet another clutch showing while facing elimination, Tatum poured in 33 points on 14-of-22 from the field and added 11 rebounds and seven assists. Even more impressive was the timing of some of his big moments, first to keep the Celtics in the game and then to help them pull away.  Early in the third, the Heat went up by nine after Tatum blocked a Max Strus 3, but the Heat forward recovered the ball and made the second attempt. A swing like that could have sent the Celtics spiraling, but Tatum wouldn't let it happen. He immediately came back down and drained two triples of his own to spark a 16-0 run that put the Celtics in front for good.  Then, after the Heat had cut the deficit to five while he was on the bench early in the fourth, he checked back in and turned momentum around. He made a mid-range jumper in the middle of the Heat's zone, which started a game-ending 12-0 run; during that stretch he scored or assisted on 10 of the points.  Celtics win the 3-point battle  If you had only watched this series and not the regular season, you would have no idea that the Celtics were sixth in the league in 3-point shooting (37.7 percent) and the Heat were 27th (34.4 percent). Through the first three games, the Heat went 44-of-92, while the Celtics were 31-of-106.  In a telling statistical note, the Heat's 39-point advantage from the 3-point line in the first three games also matched their overall point differential for the series.  That trend reversed in a major way in Game 4, as the Celtics finally started seeing some shots go down and finished 18-of-45 from deep, compared to 8-of-32 for the Heat. For the playoffs, the Celtics are now 10-2 when they make at least 15 3s and 1-6 when they do not.  An even more encouraging sign for the Celtics was that it wasn't just one or two players getting hot; the entire team got in on the action. Jayson Tatum, Grant Williams, Al Horford, Marcus Smart and Derrick White all hit at least three triples, and Jaylen Brown added another of his own.  'Don't let us get one'  The Celtics talked a big game prior to Tuesday night's showdown. ""Don't let us get one,"" Marcus Smart said. ""Don't let us win tonight,"" Jaylen Brown added. ""You let us get one, we feel confident.""  They backed up that talk with their best outing of the series and kept their season alive, but they still have a long road ahead. No team in NBA history has come back from a 3-0 deficit, and of the 150 previous instances, only three teams have managed to force a Game 7.  The interesting aspect of this matchup is that the Celtics were massive favorites, where as most teams that go down 3-0 are massive underdogs. That is to say, they have a much better chance of making history than the majority of teams that were in this spot before them.  It will not be easy, though, especially against a Jimmy Butler-led side. The Celtics need three more perfect performances, starting with Game 5 at home, where they are actually under .500 in the postseason at 4-5.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25iYS9uZXdzL2NlbHRpY3MtY29tZS1hbGl2ZS12cy1oZWF0LWhvbGQtb2ZmLWVsaW1pbmF0aW9uLWFuZC1mb3JjZS1nYW1lLTUtb2YtZWFzdGVybi1jb25mZXJlbmNlLWZpbmFscy9saXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-09-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T15:00:00","As a development team, the members of Piccolo Studio have an apparent interest in artistic interactive representations of uncomfortable realities. Their previous project, Arise: A Simple Story, was an affecting and powerful portrayal of death and heartbreak. After Us has broader ambitions, telling an allegorical tale about life after humanity and the complicated and often-devastating relationship we have always had with nature. The conclusions it leaves to the player to draw on those subjects are thematically heavy-handed but still impactful. The traversal-focused adventure that gets you there features moments of brilliance and beauty but some frequent frustrations along the way.  Players control a nymphlike girl who embodies the spirit of Gaia, moving through a world long left in shambles by human mishandling. Across an impressive variety of large interconnected stages filled with symbolic representations of nature’s destruction, players leap, sprint, and flit to chase down and recover the spirits of animals driven to extinction by humankind’s arrogance.  After Us’ most memorable elements are these surreal landscapes, filled with towering monuments to consumerism, piles of refuse, and towering human statues in anguish over what they’ve wrought. I looked forward to discovering each new destination. As exploration continues, the discovery of different animal spirits begins to populate each area with ghostly blue apparitions of the long-dead animals, sad and moving in equal measures.  The core gameplay of jumping and fighting back the devouring human spirits along the way fails to hold up to the surrounding visual feast. Leaps and other traversal mechanics are often imprecise, leading to too many respawns because landings are so floaty and hard to detect. The infrequent and rudimentary battles lack even the most basic abilities to lock-on or move laterally, resulting in strange retreats to gain some distance before the occasional quick turn to fling out an attack. I was eager to push past those moments and get back to exploration.  Most areas introduce clever new twists and gimmicks that help to keep the action lively. In one ruined landscape, I had to dodge between covered areas before the poisoned rain dragged me down. In another, I could teleport between abandoned televisions if they were tuned to the same image. Light puzzle solving comes into play with these new mechanics, but the solutions are rarely involved or complex.  While I was entranced by each locale I visited, each place I uncovered seemed to drag on too long. After Us is a game that could have scaled back on its scope and size significantly, and I would have felt its impact all the more. As it is, the long stages and vaguely ethereal music sometimes have a soporific effect.  After Us poses some well-tread but timely questions about our impact on the world and its living things. However, optional discoveries throughout the game suggest that Piccolo is trying to present a slightly more ambivalent take on the subject. Some of that is best left for the player to discover for themselves. I recommend After Us strongly as a piece of visual artistry. It’s less successful as an interactive experience, but none of its problems are so glaring that it should dissuade someone from discovering its striking and haunting world.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vcmV2aWV3L2FmdGVyLXVzL3VuY29tZm9ydGFibGUtdHJ1dGhz0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZWluZm9ybWVyLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvYWZ0ZXItdXMvdW5jb21mb3J0YWJsZS10cnV0aHM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Bethesda"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T22:00:00","Despite a booming job market overall, 2023 kicked off with the biggest tech companies laying off thousands of employees. Cuts at Microsoft hit Halo Infinite devs at 343 Industries and other game teams across the company, including at Bethesda. Months later, layoffs are continuing across other pockets of the video game industry, impacting major companies and smaller indies alike. Every week a new studio announces it’s shedding staff, and it’s not clear when the bleeding will stop.  Relic Entertainment is the latest victim. Parent publisher Sega announced on May 23 that the Company of Heroes 3 maker would cut 121 employees. “This comes at a time when external factors are challenging our industry more than ever, and we made this decision to restructure our organization to ensure maximum focus is placed on our core franchises,” Relic wrote in a statement.  Advertisement  Sega, which recently purchased Angry Birds maker Rovio for $775 million, didn’t elaborate on what those “external factors” were. “Sega is in a healthy financial position and remains fully committed to supporting and investing in Relic Entertainment and the franchises it is responsible for, including the critically acclaimed Company of Heroes series,” it wrote in a separate statement, suggesting Relic would back away from its other series like Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War.  Advertisement Advertisement  We haven’t heard how well Company of Heroes 3 ultimately sold, and the World War II real-time strategy game’s review status on Steam is currently sitting at “mostly negative.” A console port arrives on May 30, and Relic will no doubt be busy working on updates to the PC version to try and address some of the critical fan feedback.  If you’ve recently been laid off from a video game company or know someone who has you can share your tips, stories, and experiences at tips@kotaku.com  Advertisement  But Relic is far from an outlier when it comes to layoffs right now. Deck Nine, maker of visual adventure games Life Is Strange: True Colors and The Expanse: A Telltale Series, was hit with layoffs on May 19. The week before that it was The Molasses Flood, working on a Witcher spin-off for CD Projekt Red, which saw 29 developers laid off. VGC recently reported up to 90 layoffs at Deviation Games, a new studio working on a blockbuster exclusive for the PS5. And Sony shut down PixelOpus, the indie initiative behind Concrete Genie, at the beginning of May.    And that’s only this month. Here are some other layoffs that have happened this year so far, alongside how many employees were cut:  Advertisement  While we have yet to see the closure of a major studio, it seems unlikely that the current wave of layoffs in the video game industry will magically dissipate next week or even next month. It’s also not clear if there’s one central driving force behind them or lots of unique situations. Unlike the financial crisis in 2008 that sent shockwaves throughout the economy, the national unemployment rate right now is 3.4 percent in the U.S., with GDP continuing to grow each quarter. Even total spending on video games was down only 5 percent last month compared to a year ago.  So if the economy’s not about to implode and people are still buying new consoles and video games, what’s the problem exactly? One possible explanation is that shareholders are easily spooked and require routine blood sacrifices to keep them from fleeing. Another is that companies are cutting back now that money’s no longer cheap after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by nearly 5 percent in a single year in order to engineer a recession.  Advertisement  Those are the broader macroeconomic conditions, but on the ground at a particular studio or publisher, any number of other factors could be at play: lasting delays from the pandemic finally catching up, big games failing to meet sales expectations, or unannounced publishing deals that fell through behind closed doors.  Some companies, like Take-Two, cut jobs amid internal restructuring (after merging with Zynga) despite predicting $8 billion in booking in 2024 on the back of a possible Grand Theft Auto VI launch. Microsoft, meanwhile, reported $18 billion in profit after its layoffs last quarter, while EA reported $800 million in profit for the previous year.  Advertisement  Whatever’s going on right now, it hasn’t stopped new studios from continuing to pop up. Just today former EA DICE creative director Lars Gustavsson and other devs who contributed to the Battlefield franchise and other blockbusters announced the formation of a TTK Games with an aim to create a new shooter franchise. Whether studios like that will manage to survive until they can finally ship something is another question.

"game","2019-10-11","Not Discerned","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T14:08:09","For James Lewis, making the game industry diverse and inclusive is all about being intentional.  “One of the mantras [at Xbox’s Developer Acceleration Program] is that if you don't intentionally include, you will unintentionally exclude,” he says.  James spent years intentionally connecting with Xbox colleagues who shared his values. Today, James is the Program Lead for [email protected]’s Developer Acceleration Program, an initiative that helps underrepresented developers bring their games to Xbox. He knows that including unique perspectives on the platform will help draw in more diverse audiences – and that his team’s efforts can help reshape the game industry as a whole.  James’s path to the game industry was different than many of his colleagues. He had a bachelor's degree in theater and was pursuing a master’s in playwriting when he encountered Heavy Rain, an action-adventure game that changed the trajectory of his career. He was fascinated by the game’s “making of” video and realized that he wanted to start working behind the scenes on video games. James left his playwriting program and signed up for Full Sail’s Game Design master’s degree.  “I was very intimidated going in because I was the theater kid coming into a program where a lot of my classmates had a computer science background or more technical degrees than myself,” James says. “But I just worked really hard and did my best and tried to take advantage of every opportunity that we had. And I ended up graduating at the top of my class and made a lot of great connections along the way.”  James’s commitment to his new passion helped him land a post-graduation job at Xbox Game Studios. Over the next decade, he worked in production, account management, and business development at Xbox. He also started connecting with underrepresented voices in the gaming community: He was a member of the Black in Gaming Foundation and a co-lead for the employee resource group Blacks at Xbox. By 2019, James had found a group of likeminded colleagues who wanted to bring new voices to the Xbox platform.  “There was a lot of awesome work that was happening [to bring diverse games to Xbox], not as anyone's core job, but just because people were passionate about creating a more inclusive industry and creating more opportunities for developers,” he says. “It was a strong business need, because there is a need for us to reach more developers and create paths for more developers. But it also has always felt like the right thing to do. I personally believe that this is going to make our industry a better place when we have more voices represented in game development.”  During the next few years, James and his team worked behind the scenes at Xbox to develop a full-fledged, inclusive program for diverse game developers. James unveiled the Developer Acceleration Program with a presentation at the 2023 Game Developer’s Conference.  The Developer Acceleration Program partners with developers who belong to communities that are underrepresented in the game industry. This includes Black, Latino, and Indigenous developers; disabled creators; women; LGBTQIA+ developers; developers whose games responsibly center stories around diverse characters; creators who prioritize accessibility; and more.  The new program gives these individuals practical tools that many other developers already have. This includes funding to help them release their games on multiple platforms, assistance with prototypes, and access to subject matter experts through the program’s Green Room events.  “[For the Green Room events], we’ve had members from Game Pass come in, we’ve had members of the certification team come in. We also had members from our marketing team as well as our store team come in and talk about the game life cycle. And we had people come in and talk about accessibility best practices for games,” James says.  The Developer Acceleration Program’s resources are already making a difference to new, diverse creators: So far, the program has partnered with 100 titles and shipped around 30 games. Since the public announcement at the Game Development Conference, James and his team have been fielding new requests from developers and working on new partnerships.  Making an intentional commitment to his personal values helped James make a difference in a role that he’s passionate about – and it’s a useful approach for incoming game industry professionals.  “Students who are on this path [to increasing diversity and inclusion in games] should know that they don't have to change who they are to fit into this industry; the industry needs to change in order to welcome more people... I just hope that people don't take as long as I did to find your own voice, to find what really matters to you and then seek that out. But I'm encouraged daily by seeing so many different teams who have these really important missions and things that they're trying to pursue, that are making this industry a more inclusive space. So don't feel like you have to become something that you're not to fit into this industry. Help evolve this industry into being a more inclusive space.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ1bGxzYWlsLmVkdS9hYm91dC9mdWxsLXNhaWwtc3Rvcmllcy9nYW1lLWRlc2lnbi1ncmFkLWxlYWRzLWRpdmVyc2l0eS1pbmNsdXNpb24taW5pdGlhdGl2ZS1mb3ItZGV2ZWxvcGVycy1hdC14Ym940gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Wolverines (26-27) will take on Illinois on Wednesday (May 24) at 7 p.m. CDT. The game will be broadcast live on Big Ten Network.  Michigan went 1-2-3 in the top of the first before Big Ten Pitcher of the Year Connor O'Halloran (8-6) took the mound. He allowed a one-out single, but stranded the Iowa runner at third with a pair of strikeouts to end the frame.  The Wolverines took a 1-0 the lead in the top of the second when Joey Velazquez , who singled to left and advanced on a walk and a wild pitch, scored on a Mitch Voit single to third base.  Iowa (40-13) tied the game up in the bottom of the second with a sacrifice fly. O'Halloran stranded two more with a strikeout to end the inning.  U-M drew three consecutive walks to Voit, Gabe Sotres and Cody Jefferis to open the fifth inning. Ted Burton then appreaed to have been hit by a pitch, but the umpires ruled he leaned into it, and he and the next two batters struck out to put an end to the threat. In the bottom of the fifth, O'Halloran walked the opening batter but struck out two in a row; however, Iowa then scored six runs on four hits -- including a grand slam -- to take a 7-1 lead.  Tito Flores got one run back in the sixth on a solo home run with one out. Eamon Horwedel and Ahmad Harajli combined for a scoreless bottom of the sixth inning, leaving two runners on, and the Wolverines trailed 7-2 heading into the seventh.  Michigan drew two more walks in the seventh inning, but both Jefferis and Jonathan Kim were unable to score. Iowa added to its lead in the seventh off Harajli and Walker Cleveland with a RBI single and three-run home run to push its advantage to 11-2.  Flores got the Wolverines going again in the eighth inning with a one-out triple and scored on an error that allowed Jack Van Remortel to reach, but that was the extent of the damage. The Hawkeyes scored two more runs in the bottom of the eighth to invoke the run rule and end the game.  O'Halloran fanned seven batters as part of a five-inning line that saw him charged with seven runs on seven hits and two walks. With those seven punchouts, he now has 110 on the season, good for a tie for sixth all-time in a single seaon. O'Halloran also stands alone in 10th with 222 career punchouts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWdvYmx1ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjMvYmFzZWJhbGwtbWljaGlnYW4tZHJvcHMtb3BlbmluZy1nYW1lLW9mLWJpZy10ZW4tdG91cm5hbWVudC10by1pb3dh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-23","16:15:00","{""Florence"", ""Toscana"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-24T03:11:15","The Arizona Diamondbacks conclude their three-city road trip in Philadelphia this week, with the series middle game set for 3:40 p.m. on Tuesday. The game can be seen on Bally Sports Arizona. Follow this page for updates before, during and after this game.  Diamondbacks down Phillies for fourth straight win  PHILADELPHIA — The Diamondbacks won a game on Tuesday night with a collection of heroes, each of whom seemed to complement, if not outshine, the other.  Their 4-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park might not have been their most dramatic victory or their sharpest or most complete of the year. But it ranks up there with their best team victories, a night in which different contributors seemed to emerge with each passing inning.  Gabriel Moreno blasted a home run. Dominic Fletcher made a game-saving catch. Corbin Carroll had three hits, including the go-ahead single. Ryne Nelson fired six strong innings. The bullpen made pitches when it had to.  The Diamondbacks won their fourth in a row and their ninth in their past 11 games. They secured a fourth consecutive series victory — and have a chance to sweep with their ace on the mound. And they pulled themselves nine games over .500 for the first time in nearly five years.  “I think we’re in a really good spot,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. “We had a lot of energy, a lot of positive energy, and a belief that we’re going to go out and get the job done. If things get a little tense, whether it’s a tie score or a big at-bat, we relax in the moment and we expect to execute.”  After the Phillies scored in the bottom of the second, the Diamondbacks needed all of two batters to score a run of their own in the next half-inning. When the Phillies scored again in the seventh, the Diamondbacks answered in the eighth. The Diamondbacks did the same thing in both innings in which the Phillies scored on Monday night, as well, seemingly stunting any effort by the opposition to create momentum.  “I think that’s a good quality of this team,” Lovullo said. “They compete. They don’t shut down. That’s become very apparent. It’s happened a lot. You look at the shutdown opportunities the opposing teams have had, I don’t think we waste a lot of time. We come in energized and focused and score some runs, and that’s pretty powerful.”  Said Carroll: “I think it just happens. I don’t think that we try to score runs when other teams score runs. I think we stick with our approach. I think it more speaks to our ability to take them out of it and be level-headed and just continue to compete regardless of what happens out there.”  It was Carroll who put the Diamondbacks ahead for good in the eighth, lining a single into left to drive home Lourdes Gurriel Jr., who had doubled to open the inning. But it was Fletcher who kept them in the lead a half-inning later.  With the two out and the tying run on second, the Phillies’ Kyle Schwarber hit a liner into shallow center field. Fletcher immediately broke in and made a sliding catch.  “It was a hell of a catch,” Carroll said. “Great jump. He took the game into his hands right there. If he misses that one, we’re probably chasing a run. I love it. I’ve got all the confidence in the world in him. He makes that catch 10 out of 10 times.”  The late-game back-and-forth overshadowed both Nelson’s outing, which might have been his best of the year, and Moreno’s performance, which included a towering home run in the second and a strong throw to cut down Bryce Harper trying to steal in the fourth.  Nelson gave up just one run on three hits, with no walks and four strikeouts. In his past two starts, he allowed just one run on four hits in 11⅓ innings, walking four and striking out 10. After lefty Tommy Henry did the same the night before, Nelson seemed to make a case of his own to remain in the rotation when Zach Davies is expected to return from the injured list this weekend.  “I felt good,” Nelson said. “I think I got better as the game went on and executed some good pitches in big spots. I think it was a good one to build off of and get some momentum going.”  Moreno, who has been hitting around .300 with limited power production all year, showed in the second he has more juice in his bat than his stat line might suggest. Ahead in the count 3-1, he blasted a fastball from the Phillies’ Matt Strahm out to left-center field, a shot that left his bat at 107.6 mph and traveled 417 feet.  Diamondbacks don’t mind seeing top prospect Jordan Lawlar struggling  PHILADELPHIA — The Diamondbacks would prefer shortstop prospect Jordan Lawlar weren’t struggling in Double-A Amarillo, but General Manager Mike Hazen doesn’t sound too bothered by the fact that he is.  “I think having some struggles in the minor leagues,” Hazen said, “as much as we want the Corbin Carroll rocket ship to happen over and over again, I think it’s good for young players to have to go through this now and figure it out, figure out where the adjustments have to be made before they get up here.”  With Carroll’s graduation to the majors, Lawlar, 20, is now the organization’s top prospect. Though he raced through the minors last season, twice earning promotions and finishing in Double-A, he has hit a speed bump this year.  Entering Tuesday, Lawlar was hitting .162/.296/.342 with five homers in 142 plate appearances. He was just 5 for 51 (.098) through 14 games in May. The struggles are surprising not just because of how well Lawlar played last year, but because they are coming in a friendly offensive environment in Amarillo.  Hazen said the organization as a whole and the coaching staff in Amarillo are “spending a lot of time and energy” working to get Lawlar back on track. He said the prevailing thought is that the issues are not related to his swing mechanics.  “It’s probably more approach, pitch selection, how he’s being pitched,” Hazen said. “Some level of reaction to the inner half of the plate and trying to keep the ball out away from him, using the entire field. That’s kind of where our focus has been.”  Lawlar’s defense this year has been a bright spot, Hazen said. His play at shortstop last year raised questions from evaluators about his ability to stick at the position, but he might be quieting those concerns by being what Hazen described as “way more consistent” in the field.  “All of the reports defensively have been exceptional, which is awesome,” Hazen said. “He has been really working at that, which he really needed to do. Doing that is a big positive.”  The Diamondbacks were aggressive with Lawlar, moving him to Double-A last year at age 19, but Hazen doesn’t have any second thoughts about the assignment.  “I think if he had gone to High-A (to open this year) and gone off in the first two weeks to a month, we would have sent him up there anyway,” Hazen said. “And, look, we want these guys to hit a level where they’ve got to figure it out.”  Hazen compared Lawlar’s struggles at the plate to those of shortstop Geraldo Perdomo two years ago. Perdomo was slumping badly in Double-A when the Diamondbacks sent him back to Arizona midseason to rework his swing. Perdomo got back on track that year, and he has said those changes prepared him for the major leagues.  “Look at where he has come since then,” Hazen said. “The key to struggling is learning from the struggles. We’ll see what happens.”  Zac Gallen hoping for improvement in his return to Philadelphia  PHILADELPHIA — Right-hander Zac Gallen not only will be looking to bounce back from perhaps the worst start of his career last week in Pittsburgh, he will be looking to turn in a better performance in his “home” ballpark than he had last year.  Gallen, a native of nearby New Jersey who grew up attending Phillies games, was clobbered in this ballpark last year, giving up six runs (four earned) in 1⅔ innings. He did it with loads of family and friends in attendance.  He figures that experience will only help when he faces the Phillies again on Wednesday.  “I think every time you go home you have that thought in the back of your mind that you want to play well,” Gallen said. “If it doesn’t happen, you’re not really sure how you’ll deal with it. I’ve already kind of experienced that. So it’s all gravy for me. I get to come home, spend three days in a ballpark I grew up coming to as a kid and see a bunch of family. That’s the bigger picture for me.”  Gallen struggled on Friday in Pittsburgh, giving up a career-high eight runs (five earned) while issuing a season-worst four walks.  “I’m just working on getting that feel back,” he said. “That’s the biggest thing for me. Just making sure everything is in sync. I felt pretty good with my bullpen yesterday.”  Tuesday's Diamondbacks-Phillies pitching matchup  Diamondbacks at Phillies, 3:40 p.m., Citizens Bank Park  Diamondbacks RHP Ryne Nelson (1-2, 5.48) vs. Phillies TBA.  Nelson had one of his best outings of the season last week in Oakland, firing 5 1/3 innings of one-hit ball, though he did walk four batters, including three in the sixth inning before departing. It was the closest thing to a quality start Nelson has posted since April 15. … Nelson’s fastball velocity remained up in that start, averaging 94.5 mph, which is a tick above average for major league starting pitchers. … Nelson will be facing the Phillies for the first time. … The Phillies have not announced a starting pitcher, but they are expected to go with a reliever for a short outing before handing the ball to RHP Dylan Covey for bulk innings. … The Phillies optioned LHP Bailey Falter to the minors last week and pushed his old rotation spot back to this game by asking RHP Taijuan Walker to pitch on short rest on Sunday.

But I think all year long, we've been better when we've had to do things the hard way.""  Butler scored 29 points while grabbing nine rebounds and dishing out five assists, but he was still frustrated by the way he performed with so much at stake for a Heat squad that came into Game 4 hoping to complete the sweep. The Celtics narrowed the series deficit to 3-1.  Despite the setback, Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said he didn't get the feeling his team might suffer a letdown after failing to finish the series at home and get rested for a Finals matchup against the Denver Nuggets.  ""I didn't sense any of that,"" Spoelstra said. ""At some point, this is great competition. You know, sometimes it can get skewed, because, whatever, the 3-0. But we have great respect for Boston, what they are capable of. They are a dynamic offensive team that takes extraordinary efforts and commitment to get the job done. Our guys really want this ...  ""A lot of what we've done this year has been the hard way. We've been able to figure out ways to win, even if teams are playing well, if we are not in a perfect flow. And they got us tonight. You have to give them credit for that.""  Heat guard Caleb Martin echoed a similar sentiment, acknowledging the bitterness of the loss but remaining positive about what's ahead for Miami.  ""It's definitely disappointing,"" Martin said. ""That would have been a perfect world, perfect situation. But as we know and everybody else knows, we don't typically get things the easy way over here. So like I said, this is right up our alley. This is the way it goes for us and guys like us. Again, I think it's only going to prepare us for the long run. This could be good for us.""  That is what Butler is hoping, as well. He said he didn't feel the need to mention anything to his teammates as they prepare for a difficult challenge on Thursday against an opponent that finally appears to have woken up.  ""The only thing I'm going to say is we'll be OK,"" Butler said. ""Let's get back to doing what we've always done to get us to this point: Continually have belief in one another, knowing that we are going to win, and we will. We've just got to play harder.  ""There's not too much to say with this group because we already know. So we've just got to go out there and execute.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzE4NTI0L21pYW1pLWhlYXQtc2hha2UtZ2FtZS00LWxvc3MtYm9zdG9uLWNlbHRpY3MtY2l0ZS1zdWNjZXNzLWRvaW5nLXRoaW5ncy1oYXJkLXdhedIBiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzcxODUyNC9taWFtaS1oZWF0LXNoYWtlLWdhbWUtNC1sb3NzLWJvc3Rvbi1jZWx0aWNzLWNpdGUtc3VjY2Vzcy1kb2luZy10aGluZ3MtaGFyZC13YXk_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It isn't totally certain if the Panthers' captain will play in a potentially series-clinching Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday night. He left Game 3 in the first period with a lower-body injury.  But it's a possibility, coach Paul Maurice said Tuesday -- obviously, a very good sign for a team that is one win away from the Stanley Cup final. Barkov was listed as questionable after the injury but did not return to Game 3; tests and evaluation since have evidently ruled out any major issue.  ""It was as much precautionary as anything, to rule out anything sinister,"" Maurice said. ""We're very optimistic that he'll return soon and when he does, he'll be ready to go. ... We're optimistic that we would see him in Game 4 and, if necessary, we could see him in Game 5.""  Besides, Barkov could have some official duties to tend to if Florida wins Wednesday night.  The Prince of Wales Trophy awaits the winning team in the Eastern Conference. It is typically presented to the captain, and then the superstitions or lack thereof become evident. Some don't touch it at all and pose politely for photos, others do touch it, and some - Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin in recent years -- have picked it up and skated away.  ""He's a huge part of our team,"" Florida forward Eetu Luostarinen said of Barkov. ""He shows that on the ice. ... Obviously, we want him on the ice as much as we can.""  Barkov took a hit from Carolina's Jack Drury with about seven minutes left in the opening period of Game 3, without any obvious signs of major discomfort afterward. Barkov returned to the Florida bench after the shift and took a seat briefly before talking with someone from the Panthers' medical staff and departing for the locker room.  Barkov has four goals -- one of them just an incredible score in Game 2 of the East final that drew rave reviews from even the likes of Wayne Gretzky -- and eight assists for 12 points in Florida's first 15 games in this playoff run. The Panthers have a 3-0 lead in the East finals, trying to get to the Stanley Cup final for the first time since 1996.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzE2MDg1L3BhbnRoZXJzLW9wdGltaXN0aWMtYmFya292LXBsYXktZ2FtZS00LWVhc3Rlcm4tY29uZmVyZW5jZS1maW5hbHPSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uaGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzcxNjA4NS9wYW50aGVycy1vcHRpbWlzdGljLWJhcmtvdi1wbGF5LWdhbWUtNC1lYXN0ZXJuLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtZmluYWxzP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:52:00","The AL East is, hands down, the most competitive baseball division as the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles opened an important three-game series at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night. The O's entered the game three games behind the first-place Tampa Bay Rays, and the Yankees were three games behind Baltimore.  Yankees ace Gerrit Cole, who recorded his 2,000th career strikeout Tuesday night, was not at the top of the game, and exited with five runs allowed in five innings plus two batters. He walked three and struck out only two, tied for his fewest strikeouts as a Yankee. The Orioles took a 4-0 lead on Gunnar Henderson's fourth-inning home run.  The Yankees rallied against O's starter Kyle Bradish and knotted the game up at 4-4 in the fifth inning. Baltimore regained the lead a half inning later. The score remained 5-4 until the bottom of the ninth inning when reigning AL MVP Aaron Judge launched a game-tying home run against all-world closer Félix Bautista. To the action footage:  ""He's the best player in the world. I'd take him over anyone, any day,"" Yankees rookie shortstop Anthony Volpe said during an on-field interview after the game (per MLB.com).  The home run was Judge's 14th of the season and his eighth in his last nine games. Since returning from the injured list earlier this month, Judge is 18 for 49 (.367) with those eight home runs in 13 games. He's walked (12) nearly as much as he's struck out (15) too. Judge has picked up right where he left off last season when he swatted an American League record 62 home runs.  New York completed the comeback and won the game -- their fifth consecutive win -- on Volpe's walk-off sacrifice fly in the bottom of the tenth inning (NY 6, BAL 5 in 10 innings). The Yankees trailed 4-0 and 5-4 and saw stud relievers Yennier Cano and Bautista for three innings combined, yet they still managed to tie the game and then walk off with the win.  ""It's one of the best feelings I've ever had,"" Volpe said about the walk-off sacrifice fly -- his first career walk-off RBI -- during his on-field interview (per MLB.com).  Ace reliever Michael King retired six of the seven batters he faced -- including all three with the automatic runner at second base in the top of the tenth -- to give the Yankees offense a chance in the ninth and tenth innings. The bullpen and the offense picked up Cole, who still owns a 2.53 ERA after Tuesday's dud. He's been one of the best pitchers in the game this year.  The win improves the Yankees to 30-20 and drops the Orioles to 31-17. The first-place Rays got annihilated Tuesday to fall to 35-15. Tampa remains in first place and three games up on Baltimore, though the Yankees are now only five games back. It is the closest the Yankees have been to first place since April 22.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL3lhbmtlZXMtY29tZS1iYWNrLXZzLW9yaW9sZXMtdGhhbmtzLXRvLWFhcm9uLWp1ZGdlcy1nYW1lLXR5aW5nLWhvbWVyLWluLW5pbnRoLWFudGhvbnktdm9scGVzLXdhbGstb2ZmL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Those peaks, though, now have him in some ultra-rare company.  On Tuesday, with the season on the line, Tatum turned in a 33-point, 11-rebound, seven-assist performance in Boston's 116-99 win over the Heat.  It was the sixth time this postseason that Tatum has topped 30 points with 10-plus rebounds and five-plus assists in a game. ESPN Stats & Info provided some context on that accomplishment, noting that Tatum is tied for having the second-most such games in NBA postseason history.  LeBron James is the all-time leader with seven.  Jayson Tatum has 6 30-point, 10-rebound, 5-assist games this postseason, tied for 2nd-most in a single postseason all-time.

He scored 30 points in the clinching Game 6 against Atlanta, then scored 39 points in Game 1 against Philadelphia.

"game","2023-05-02","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T03:54:00","Key Moment  One might assume that an 18-0 run during the third quarter would need to be chosen as the Key Moment of Game 4. However, it was what happened after that 18-0 run that determined the outcome of the contest.  Boston’s 18-0 spurt turned a nine-point deficit at the 10:39 mark of the third quarter into a nine-point lead at the 6:24 mark. Miami did not fade, however, and the Celtics needed even more juice the rest of the way in order to log their first win of the series.  The Heat cut Boston’s lead back down to four on two occasions during the final five minutes of the third. The Celtics responded each time, first with five straight points, and then with six straight points.  Another response, possibly even more critical, arrived during the early minutes of the fourth quarter. Miami scored the first four points of the final period to pull back within five. Yet again, the Celtics responded – this time after a timeout by Joe Mazzulla.  Mazzulla called the timeout to get Jayson Tatum back into the game and that decision was monumental. Tatum immediately flashed to the center of Miami’s zone defense, caught an entry pass from Grant Williams, turned, and swished home a jumper from the free-throw line. That bucket bumped Boston’s lead back up to seven.  Miami then missed a 3-pointer on its ensuing possession and that’s all the C’s needed to take complete control of the game. Jaylen Brown threw down a loud slam just five seconds after that missed 3 and Boston went on to complete a 12-0 run to pull ahead by 17 with 7:25 remaining. That stretch broke the Heat’s will and deposited the victory into Boston’s back pocket.  There were plenty of comments following Game 3 that questioned Boston’s fortitude, and rightfully so. Those voices had better be just as loud following these consistent responses from the Celtics throughout the second half of Game 4.  Key Player  Jayson Tatum looked like Jayson Tatum again Tuesday night. And yes, that includes during the fourth quarter.  Tatum scored 11 of his game-high 33 points during the final frame of Game 4, and 25 overall during the second half. He finished the contest having made 14 of his 22 shots from the field, four of his eight 3-pointers, and one of his two free throw attempts. No other player in the game made more than nine shots.  The superstar wing also notched his 12th double-double in 17 games this postseason by hauling in a game-high 11 rebounds. Ten of those boards were captured at the defensive end – four more than any other player in the game.  So, he led the game in scoring. He led the game in rebounding. What else could he possibly have done? Oh, just led the game in assists and blocks as well.  Tatum dished out seven helpers on the night to lead all players. Five of those assists were dished out during the second half, compared to just one turnover. He also logged two blocks at the defensive end of the court to tie for the game’s top mark. That means Tatum led the game outright in points, rebounds and assists, and tied for the game high in blocks, all while shooting 64 percent from the field.  That, folks, is utterly ridiculous.  Box Score Nuggets  - Boston outscored Miami by 30 points from beyond the arc (54-24).  - Jayson Tatum tied or led the game outright in points (33), rebounds (11), assists (seven) and blocks (two).  - Tatum's 14 made field goals were five more than any other player.  - Caleb Martin led all reserves with 16 points.  - Grant Williams led Boston's bench with 14 points and six rebounds. He was a plus-15 in the plus/minus category.  - Al Horford stuffed the stat sheet with 12 points, seven rebounds, four assists and one blocked shot.  - Boston dished out 28 assists compared to just 10 turnovers.  - Jimmy Butler led Miami with 29 points.

"game","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T06:31:07","MIAMI — For a night, the Boston Celtics said no to becoming No. 151.  It’s not a rallying cry with much rhythm or magic to it — don’t expect to see that splashed across t-shirts laid out at every seat in TD Garden for Thursday’s Game 5 (8:30 ET, TNT) — but not becoming the NBA’s latest playoff sweep victim was as good as anything else the Celtics had Tuesday. For now, the number of teams in league history that lost a best-of-seven series after digging themselves a 3-0 hole remains frozen at 150.  No one ever has come back, but with their 116-99 victory at Kaseya Center, the Celtics still have a chance.  “We want to come back to Miami,” Boston’s Jaylen Brown said. “If that happens, I feel like we’ll feel good about ourselves.”  Boston’s goals have grown smaller, its vision more narrow given its ongoing predicament. “Unfinished Business?” That theme for the 2022-23 season of returning to the NBA Finals and this time winning the championship has been dialed back to just, y’know, winning one home game in the Eastern Conference Finals.  Still, as someone once bellowed on Boston’s basketball court some years ago, anything is possible. In the meantime, here are five takeaways from a game that, for a little longer, kept the Denver Nuggets’ dance card open for next week’s Finals.    1. The Celtics nearly waited too long  Down 3-0 in the series and by nine points early in the third quarter, Boston faced a now-or-never challenge. Miami had shooed them away like so many flies a couple times in the first half and, at 61-52, looked ready to start the clinching party.  That’s when Jayson Tatum hit a pair of 3-pointers, Derrick White hit another out of a timeout and the Celtics kept going. They scored 18 in a row to flip that deficit of nine points into a lead of nine. Defensively they stiffened, draining a little life out of the Heat and much fun out of the building. They moved the ball and, by that, moved the needle, never trailing again.  For the first time this series, they looked like the team that won 57 games in the regular season to earn the East’s No. 2 seed, the team that got past the Atlanta Hawks and Philadelphia 76ers to loom as Finals favorites until three consecutive meltdowns.  Word was the Celtics had a team gathering at a nearby Top Golf after their Monday film session. It was time better spent than making summer vacation plans.  “Just coming together, talking it out,” Brown said, “and like a lot of times when you get to this point down 3-0, you see locker rooms and teams start to go in the other direction. We want to make sure that we stayed together. We wanted to make sure that we looked each other in the eye and came out today and put our best foot forward.  “I’m proud of our group for doing that because you see teams with their back against the wall and you see they just collapse. You didn’t see that tonight.”  2. Calling timeouts: A+  One hundred and one games into a season/postseason might seem a little late to be handing out grades to a coach for something as simple as calling his timeouts wisely. But given Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla’s battle with that seemingly basic sideline tactic, it’s worth noting how well he did in this one.  Mazzulla — the former assistant who slid over one chair when Ime Udoka was suspended and ultimately fired for violating team policy with an improper office relationship — had been slow on the timeout trigger from the start. His preference to let his players figure their way out of jams was reminiscent of the great Phil Jackson’s patience with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, and later Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. But these Celtics are younger and less accomplished than those NBA legends, and the strategy seemed to fail as often as it worked, right through the first 18 games of the playoffs.  Twice in Game 4, though, Mazzulla was timely in getting a break. In the third quarter, he used one to bail out Brown from a pressured situation. In the fourth, he got Tatum back on the court after a couple ugly opening minutes as Miami crept within 88-83.  The first one saved a possession and got the Celtics revved up defensively. The second one got them moving again offensively. Together, they demonstrated good things that can come out of huddles, which too often have been conspicuous by their absences.  “Just wanted to make sure we got a good shot on that,” Mazzulla said of the third-quarter timeout. “I felt like the possessions before that didn’t go well defensively. Wanted to reset a little bit.”  Said Tatum of the break early in the fourth: “They was playing zone, and quite frankly we kind of struggled against the zone the first couple games. So it kind of had us stagnant. When I came back in, he just drew up a play to get some movement, finding open space and then make the right play. I shot the ball, and it went in.”  Simple stuff, but what happens on the sideline can make such a difference in what happens between the lines.  3. Another visit to Boston before booking Denver  Everywhere Heat coach Erik Spoelstra looked, he could find problems. Boston got out in transition better than it previously had in the series, with 18 fast-break points to Miami’s 10. The Celtics had more possessions thanks to having fewer turnovers. And after Boston shooters collectively made only 29% of their 3-pointers across the first three games, this time they had a breakthrough. The Celtics hit 18 of their 45 3-pointers (40%) with five players making three or more. Miami took 32, but made just eight.  Overall, the Heat coach bemoaned the lack of juice in his team’s offense.  “Played a little bit slower,” Spoelstra said. “And yeah, there wasn’t a lot of flow to the offense, and then they capitalize on that. Getting out in transition, which they have been trying to do. Speed this thing up a little bit and then they knock down some 3s.”  That was in the third quarter, after which Boston got more assertive and, in general, more familiar with the faces looking back from the mirror. Miami tried but couldn’t derail the visitors or fully find its own rhythm. In getting outscored by 15 in the third quarter, it missed 14 of its 22 shots. The fourth was worse, missing 12 of 18. Could be the rarefied air of holding that 3-0 lead threw off the south Florida team that embraces the underdog role.  “All year long,” Jimmy Butler said, “we’ve been better when we’ve had to do things the hard way.”  It just got a little bit harder.  4. Celtics’ “others” win this battle  Miami’s supporting cast has drawn loads of attention this series, due to their productivity and their back stories. Gabe Vincent, Caleb Martin, Max Strus and Duncan Robinson all went undrafted, all wound up on the Heat roster and all four played vital roles in the first three games. Their combined scoring: 61.3 points per game.  But it was Boston’s secondary stars and role players who got to shine Tuesday. Marcus Smart, Al Horford, Derrick White and Grant Williams combined for 53 points to the Miami four’s 44, providing just enough support for Tatum (33) and Brown (17). Williams’ contribution — 14 points in 29 minutes — was another marker of sorts given Mazzulla’s spotty use of him at various times this postseason.  “His professionalism is underrated,” Smart said. “We talk a lot about Grant, but we love Grant and we love everything he brings to this team.”  Williams, who took so much grief for “poking the bear” with Game 2’s head-bumping confrontation with Butler, got the bear good in the fourth quarter. Butler tried to get up a shot from the right baseline and Williams swatted it the instant it left his hands.  5. Forcing Game 5: Pride or hope?  The Celtics had talked tough at shootaround Tuesday morning. “Don’t let us get one,” Smart had said. “Don’t let us win tonight,” was Brown’s variation. At the time it seemed mostly to be a pep talk to themselves, some bravado to motivate themselves rather than intimidate Miami.  The question now is, were the Celtics just saving face with their performance Tuesday or did they find some answers? The Heat have no reason — yet — to be nervous and they looked it, with Butler and others smiling and yakking as the final moments ticked away. The Celtics are at least one more victory away from putting any pressure on the Heat.  And the history stuff isn’t comforting: Of the all teams that started a series down 3-0, 44 (29.3%) managed to force a fifth game. But only 11 (7.3%) made it to a Game 6 and only three (0.2%) were able to tie their series before getting eliminated anyway.  Still, Boston gets to play one more, at least, on its parquet floor. It can try, a bit earlier this time, to replicate what it pulled off in the semifinals against the Sixers – fend off elimination on the road, then win decisively at home.  And if all goes well enough for the Celtics, they can plant a seed in the Heat players’ minds about maybe, just maybe, becoming the first team to blow a 3-0 series lead. A 1-150 all-time mark would look and feel considerably different to these two crews.  * * *  Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(Evan Wheaton - MediaNews Group)  PHOENIXVILLE >> This isn’t a Phoenixville team that’s intimated by the odds against them.  Missing the Frontier division pennant for the first time in five years before playing up to two of the top baseball teams in District 1 Class 6A — 20 innings in three days to win the Pioneer Athletic Conference Final Four — the Phantoms have been dishing out lumps as much as they’ve taken them.  Against No. 11 Harriton in the opening round of the District 1-5A tournament, No. 6 Phoenixville marched to the same beat. After starting down 5-0 early, the Phantoms amassed 10 straight runs, never looking back in a 15-7 win at Kennedy Field on Monday.  FINAL — No. 6 Phoenixville 15, No. 11 Harriton 7 After being down 5-0 to start, PAC Champion Phoenixville rifles off 10 straight runs in part by a grand slam from Lleyton Coupe. Phoenixville will face No. 3 Strath Haven in the District 1-5A quarters Wednesday, time TBD. pic.twitter.com/FCpRmWV0sU — Evan Wheaton (@EvanWheaton) May 22, 2023  The win marked the first time the Phantoms (15-7) have won a district playoff game in 10 years and one day, their last being a 3A first-round victory, 9-6 over Chichester on May 21, 2013.  Phoenixville advances to the District 1-5A quarterfinals and will head to No. 3 Strath Haven Wednesday, time TBD.  “Everyone just wanted to win. We all stepped up,” Phantoms first baseman Lleyton Coupe said. “Everyone grinding all season, in the offseason, it all paid off today. This is the most runs we’ve scored in a long time, so we’re happy to be here now.”  Coupe provided a vast bulk of said runs with one swipe in the bottom of the second inning. Upon cutting into the deficit, 5-2 after back-to-back bases-loaded walks, Coupe put the barrel on a fastball and sent a four-run shot over the right fence to take what became a permanent lead, 6-5.  The senior went 3-for-3 with six RBIs and two runs scored. Coupe also walked twice, reaching base in every plate appearance.  “My first at-bat, I saw a heavy load of curveballs,” Coupe said. “The one I put up the middle (in the first inning) was a curveball, so I had a feeling I was going to get a fastball. Just happened to be in the middle where I like it, just turned and watched it go.”  Bot 2 | ‼️‼️HOLY HELL ‼️‼️ Another walk forces in a run, then Lleyton Coupe (@LleytonCoupe) hits a GRAND SLAM over the right fence! After starting down 5-0, Phoenixville now leads Harriton 6-5. Might be another long one here… pic.twitter.com/isfsJLlh1y — Evan Wheaton (@EvanWheaton) May 22, 2023  Reinvigorated with six straight runs and the lead, Phoenixville continued to pile on insurance in the bottom of the third. With the bases loaded, senior shortstop Wade Carruthers (2-for-5, run, two RBIs) ripped a line drive to center, bringing home two runs.  From there, junior catcher Nico Nattle knocked a two RBI double to go up 10-5. An RBI single from Elon commit Hudson Narke, another bases-loaded walk and a balk accounted for three more runs for the Phantoms over the fourth and fifth innings.  Coupe capped his club’s scoring in the fifth frame with a two RBI single to left field. Collectively, the Phantoms recorded 12 hits over five different arms from the Rams (9-8).  “That was a tone-setting, difference-making swing,” Phoenixville coach Geoff Thomas said on Coupe’s grand slam. “He had three hard-hit balls today. He was swinging the bat really well.”  Narke earned the win for the Phantoms with six strikeouts while working around nine hits and six runs over four innings of work. Finn Lamb, Charlie Belli, Henry Wheeler, Alex Johnson and Jack Ufberg all split mound duties for Harriton.  While it left 11 runners on base, Phoenixville loaded the bases five different times on the day, capitalizing on scoring situations with timely hits to balloon ahead.  “It’s motivational, it’s inspiring and it’s dealing with adversity, getting those opportunities,” Thomas said. “We’ve left runners on base, this year we’ve had games where we leave 10 or 12 runners on base, and that wasn’t the case today. We came up with timely hitting. Timely hitting is bringing runners in when they’re in scoring position.”  Wade Carruthers rips a line drive to center for two runs. Phoenixville 8, Harriton 5 https://t.co/1WuokKwFyE pic.twitter.com/GBHGdxsuYU — Evan Wheaton (@EvanWheaton) May 22, 2023  Following a scoreless first inning, the Rams opened the floodgates with five runs in the top of the second. Harriton had runners on the corners, the lead man being driven in by Zaden Mahrt with a base hit for the initial run of the game.  Harriton then loaded the bases and with two outs, Ross Brotherston — a junior who holds a .407 batting average, .529 OBP, .556 SLG and .1085 OPS — shelled out a triple to bring everyone home before scoring himself on a throwing error during the play to shoot up 5-0.  Brotherston ended his strong year of batting with a 4-for-4, three-RBI outing.  “Obviously we couldn’t sustain whatever it was that was working, but hats off to them,” Rams coach Scott Kurzinsky said. “They showed a lot of fight to come back in that same inning and put six up on us and that’s uncharacteristic of the way we’ve pitched all year. We just didn’t have any answers.”  Sitting on the cusp of the playoff bubble at the tail end of the regular season, Harriton won its final three games, each win needed for the club to clinch a postseason berth. The Rams took wins over Radnor (2-0), Conestoga (13-12) and Marple Newtown (5-2) — each and every inning crucial in keeping their playoff hopes alive.  “We came together as a group when we were 3-5 and talked about how we really need to flip the script, how we all need to be better starting with me,” Kurzinsky said. “And we were.They showed resilience to win six of the last eight games we played to get in the playoffs and put ourselves in a position like this.”  Leo Stein scored Bryce Siegel on a sacrifice fly in the top of the fourth inning to cut Harriton’s deceit, 10-6. Lamb added an RBI single in the seventh.  With its first PAC title since 2019 and first district win since 2013, Phoenixville is venturing into waters that haven’t been charted in quite some time for the program. But for every hole in the bottom of the boat, the Phantoms have patched them and sailed further.  “That was our goal this year,” Coupe said. “Win the PAC, survive and advance.”  Phoenixville 15, Harriton 7  Results Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 R H E Harriton 0 5 0 1 0 0 1 7 10 0 Phoenixville 0 6 4 1 4 0 — 15 12 3  Harriton Phoenixville ab r h bi ab r h bi Siegel 3 2 1 0 Narke 4 1 1 2 Wheeler 4 0 1 0 Marsh 3 1 0 1 Brunelli 0 1 0 0 Coupe 3 2 3 6 Ufberg 0 0 0 0 Carruthers 5 1 2 2 Brotherston 4 1 4 3 Nattle 3 0 2 2 Kozloff 0 0 0 0 Antonini 4 1 1 0 Stein 3 0 0 1 Cervino 0 0 0 0 Albright 2 0 0 0 Whitesel 0 0 0 0 Wayman 2 0 0 0 A.

"game","2023-03-12","Not Discerned","{""Wheeling"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T04:16:55","MIDDLEBOURNE – Wheeling Central was at its best during the recent W.Va. Class A Section I baseball tournament when its backs were to the wall. The Maroon Knights (16-14) reeled off five straight elimination-game victories to advance to the regional tournament.  Well, head coach Jason Rowe’s youthful squad finds itself in a similar situation following a 3-1 loss to Tyler Consolidated on Monday in Game 1 of the best-of-3 Region I series at the sun-baked, all-turf surface in Tyler County.  “Wheeling Central has a nice young ball club. They are well-coached and we expected a dogfight,” Tyler Consolidated head coach Robby Jones said. “We just needed to play our game. Make the routine plays and be aggressive when we get on base. We did that for the most part.”  Wheeling Central needs a victory in Game 2 today on Wheeling University’s home field at the J.B. Chambers I-470 Sports Complex in Elm Grove to force a winner-take-all game on Wednesday back in Middlebourne.  “We’ll come back. We play pretty well with our backs to the wall,” Rowe said. “We played pretty well, but when you commit an error and then hit a batter, it will come back to bite you, and it did.”  Luke Tiu, the Maroon Knights No. 9 hitter, continued his red-hot hitting as he drove an 0-1 pitch over the fence in left-center leading off the top of the third.  The lead didn’t last long as the Silver Knights (30-5) tallied three runs in the home half of the inning with one swing of the bat. Reese Davis reached on an error leading off and Owen Westbrook was hit by a Brayden Cover pitch. After the first out was recorded, winning pitcher Jayden Helmick’s infield single to the hole at short loaded the bases as Wheeling Central shortstop Payton Hildebrand made a diving stop to keep the ball in the infield.  On the very next pitch, Zade Billings launched a deep drive to left-center that resulted in a bases-clearing double and a 3-1 Silver Knights lead.  “We got some guys on base and Zade has been a bulldog all year,” Jones said of his starting catcher. “That was a huge swing for him.”  That would be enough support for Helmick, a senior, who escaped further trouble in the third. Brayden Cover singled with one out and was replaced by courtesy runner, Andy Bailer. After designated hitter Gary Hatfield walked, Seth Cover lined a drive that appeared to find the gap in left-center only to see Brody Seckman make a diving snag. He righted himself and fired a strike to second baseman Reese Davis covering the bag at second to double up Bailer and end the inning.  “That ball was never no more than eight feet off the ground,” Jones said while describing Seckman’s outstanding catch. “He then got to his feet and made a great throw to get the runner.  “Make no mistake, both of those starting pitchers battled their tails off,” Jones added. “One is a freshman (Cover) and the other is a senior (Helmick). We’re very aware of who they are.”  After striking out the side in the fourth, Helmick allowed a pair of two-out singles to Braxton Billick and Brayden Cover in the fifth before inducing an infield pop up that he gloved to snuff out that threat. Seth Cover led off the sixth with a single but Helmick set down the next six Maroon Knights for the complete game.  The righty threw 113 pitches, with 77 being strikes. He fanned five and only issued one free pass. He also had a pair of one-base hits.  The Cover brothers evenly divided four singles.  “Wheeling Central turned a pair of double plays, including a splendid diving grab of a suicide-squeeze bunt by catcher Koy Lipinski, who then tagged the runner. It also turned two to end the third after Billings’ clutch hit.  “Koy made an unbelievable play there,” Rowe allowed. “They had second and third with no outs and he makes that diving catch and turns it into a double play.  “We hit the ball hard several times, but it was right at them,” Rowe continued. “I told the kids to not hang their heads and have short memories. I’m confident they will respond.”  Rowe indicated he would hand the ball to Seth Cover today. Jones said Ty Walton would start for his team.  “The community came out and supported us tonight. They’ve been there all season and they showed up again tonight. We appreciate their support,”Jones said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NhbmRzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDIzLzA1L3R5bGVyLXRha2VzLWZpcnN0LWdhbWUtaW4tcmVnaW9uYWwtc2VyaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

These three board games hit the crowd-funding platform in as many days, but Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game arrived first on May 16. Since then, it's managed to outdo a target of $50K Canadian by around 16 times, coming to land at $798,829 in pledges as of publication. This was quickly followed by Monster Hunter World Iceborne from Steamforged (the team responsible for some of the best board games based on video games), which has outdone its £150,000 goal six times over - it currently has £957,642's worth in pledges. Finally, Apex Legends: The Board Game brought up the rear on May 18 and is sitting at £377,021 so far. That's roughly double its £195,429 goal. Clearly, there's an appetite for bringing the digital experience to your tabletop.  While each of these board games for adults are based on video game properties, they all take a slightly different approach in terms of adapting their source material. Rather than being a straight copy, Dead Cells leans hard into the 'die, level up, repeat' mentality of its inspiration with randomized board tiles that are different each time you tackle them, an emphasis on dying to level up your fighter, and alternate paths you won't be able to unlock until you've earned certain bonuses. It also introduces four new kinds of Beheaded as playable characters, each with their own unique abilities. You can check out the Kickstarter here.  (Image credit: Scorpion Masque)  Meanwhile, Iceborne throws in 'Turf Wars' (where rival monsters invade the board and cause chaos) to differentiate it from the previous Monster Hunter game. As I said in my preview, getting slapped about in Monster Hunter World Iceborne: The Board Game was the best thing I did all week - it's a fun new wrinkle to an already-good formula and genuinely shakes things up. You can see the campaign for yourself here.  Last but by no means least, Apex Legends tries to capture the team-based play of the video game with a ""highly competitive, intensely tactical"" system that's modular so can be upgraded through bonus terrain or characters. It's gone in for premium miniatures, too; each Legend comes with a diorama-based card holder that can also store the model and associated elements in a scene showcasing their powers. You can take a look at the Kickstarter page here.  Because all of these games are due to arrive in 2024 (between June and November), it's shaping up to be a bumper year for fans of tabletop gaming.

The Sentinel reveal trailer showcases a futuristic social FPS featuring cooperative play, and is being described by the developer as “the definitive social sandbox shooter” (via PCGamesN).  The demo footage shows off the first-person gameplay in action, with the player taking on what appears to be alien enemies set on a jungle-like planet. “Become a space viking and save humanity,” is one of the main selling points, giving fans an idea of what to expect from the FPS.

Game developer Kaleb Nekumanesh who is working on the project said on Twitter that the footage shown in the trailer “is about 4 months of development” and that the game won’t be an open-world game. Sentinel is also a “self-funded personal project at the moment.”  There are no details on a release window yet, as the project is very clearly still early in its development, as well as no word on platforms, although Nekumanesh isn’t ruling out Xbox platforms when asked by a Twitter user.

(WMTV) - With school about to get out, parents might be looking for ways to keep their kids reading and learning over the summer.  Carissa Christner, the Youth Services Librarian with the Madison Public Library explained a card game that makes summer reading fun for kids.  There are two types of cards—action and prize. After the player completes the action, they can get a prize card for instant gratification.  The first type of action card is a connection card.  “Relationships actually support reading,” Christner said. Connection cards encourage players to engage with others in their reading.  The other two types of action cards are challenge, which asks readers to put more effort into their reading and share card, which asks a question about reading and gives the player space to respond on the card.  Prize cards provide “different fun ways you can have fun with words,” according to Christner.  To get them, families can go to any Madison public library, or the dream bus and get a deck for free. Additionally, there is a Spanish version that is in printing and should come out in June.

"game","2023-11-12","22:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T15:22:15","Last November, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet were released for Nintendo Switch as the first so-called open-world Pokémon games. These are non-linear games in which players can freely explore the environment as they collect Pokémon characters.  Reviewers and gamers alike have generally agreed that the games succeeded in introducing changes that were long overdue such as free roaming, a less linear adventure and a large amount of collectables. But they also criticised the games’ appalling visuals and technical failures. These failures – known as “glitches” – are moments when the game fails to behave as intended. Instead of chomping on a sandwich, for example, a character might be seen munching thin air.  The original Pokémon games, Red and Blue (1996), had their fair share of glitches too. This included “MissingNo”, an unofficial critter that could be found by deliberately using glitches. But times have changed since the first games. Pokémon is now a global behemoth and must meet fans’ high expectations for visual quality.  In some ways, Scarlet and Violet’s many issues have become a blessing in disguise, however. They have fuelled an unexpected glitch-chasing frenzy.  This has contributed to the expansion of the franchise’s “headcanon”(something fans believe to be true about a franchise or character, despite a lack of evidence) and illustrated the creative potential of fan culture as players start to accept and even celebrate these glitches.  Many Pokémon fans are aware of Sinistea, for example, a ghost-type Pokémon from 2017 who is found lodging in a teacup. But in January, a few fans started to speculate and joke about whether the ghost Pokémon had been given a new form. This followed a viral Pokémon egg hatching video, recorded from the game and published on Reddit, which showed a phantom coffee cup randomly floating in the air .  While this error was due to a non-player character failing to load, fans immediately started to suggest names for the new creature, such as Caffiend, Coffantom and Sinisffee. Fan-made artworks imitating the official games were produced and a new “fakemon” was born.  As this shows, glitches aren’t simply destructive malfunctions, but also a starting point for the creation of new fan narratives.  Body horror in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet  Darker glitches have emerged too. A video recorded from the game showed a child being attacked by a Pokémon that had turned into a drill when they crossed the boundaries of the battlefield.  There was no gore, no screaming, but the contrast between the naïve, innocent tone of the Pokémon game’s universe and the violent narrative created by the recorded glitch made the video go viral.  This example is only one among many manifestations of body horror that have occurred since the release of the Scarlet and Violet games. Players have shared playthroughs showcasing avatars with spinning limbs, gigantic spaghetti-shaped bodies, or skeleton-like faces taking selfies.  As a queer game scholar I am fascinated by unorthodox and bizarre instances in gaming culture. I think that these glitches are pretty queer too.  Playing queerly means playing differently – whether it is to fail, experience “bad feelings”, be aroused or simply stray from mainstream gaming.  Queerness and horror have always shared a special relationship. Horror movies are often beloved by queer audiences, who frequently identify with the characters depicted and enjoy seeing narratives that were, and still are, missing from the mainstream film industry.  The body horror genre, with its obsession with “threatening” bodies, has resonated among the queer community. From Freaks (1932) to Titane (2021), body horror has come a long way from stigmatising to celebrating queer bodies.  And it has now found one of its most unexpected platforms – a globally successful, family-friendly digital game franchise.  ‘Gotta [glitch] ’em all’  Witnessing characters becoming hugely elongated while trying to ride their bike, losing the skin on their faces while attempting to take a selfie, or moving through hard surfaces without any explanation has become common in the world of Pokémon.  Videos of these glitches have sparked conversations that go beyond the game’s original material and established glitch sharing as a way for fans to hijack the franchise.  Pokémon has been trying to be more inclusive and has increasingly showcased body diversity among its characters. There are buff women, androgynous gym leaders and curvaceous dads.  The body horror glitches, however, might have unwillingly pushed the boundaries a bit too far. Players are now not only collecting pocket monsters, but monstrous bodies too.  Their awkward presence has provided a queer twist to the traditional Pokémon journey to “become the very best”. It has encouraged players to enjoy the game’s visible failures and share the visual feats of their transgressive avatars, in the hope of becoming the glitchiest player of them all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wb2tlbW9uLXNjYXJsZXQtYW5kLXZpb2xldC1ob3ctdGhlLWdhbWVzLWdsaXRjaGVzLWdhaW5lZC1hLWZhbmRvbS1vZi10aGVpci1vd24tMjAzNzE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Javier Báez hit a bases-clearing double in the 10th inning for his third hit of the night to lift the Detroit Tigers to an 8-5 victory over the Kansas City Royals in the opener of a three-game series Monday night.  “It's the best feeling in the world,” Báez said in an on-field interview after the game. “I'm just happy that I got good contact.”  Báez had three hits in the game, but the first two combined for an exit velocity of about 112 mph and didn't leave the infield. His third hit was a line drive over the left-fielder's head.  “He probably got the softest hits tonight and he probably got the hardest hit tonight,” Detroit manager AJ Hinch said. “I'll take them both.”  Matt Vierling had three hits, including a home run, and four RBI for the Tigers.  Alex Lange (2-0) earned the victory with two hitless innings of relief. Jose Cisnero picked up his first save.  “I think (Lange) was excellent tonight,” Hinch said. “We talk to him over and over about the back end of the game. He can't just wait on the last three outs and a clean inning all the time. These were clean innings, but he's going to need to be ready in the eighth. Tonight we needed him to pitch in a different part of the game.”  Scott Barlow (1-3) allowed Báez's winning hit and took the loss.  “(The bullpen) kept us in the game,"" Kansas City manager Matt Quatraro said. ""They didn’t give up a run until the 10th inning. So, we couldn’t have asked for anything more.”  Neither starter was effective. Detroit's Michael Lorenzen gave up five runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. Brady Singer allowed five runs and seven hits and four walks in 3 2/3 innings. Singer came into the game with a 6-0 record with a 2.44 ERA in 10 career starts against the Tigers.  Detroit batters walked 10 times, the first time the Tigers had eight or more walks in consecutive games since June 13-14, 2016.  The Tigers got three runs in the first inning without much solid contact. Zach McKinstry led off with a single in the hole at second. With one out, Báez singled over first base and Spencer Torkelson walked. Singer then walked Akil Baddoo on four pitches to send home the first run. Vierling lined a single through the hole at short for two more runs.  The Royals wasted no time in getting back into the game. Vinnie Pasquantino launched a 424-foot, two-run home run and Salvador Perez followed with a 419-foot shot to tie the score before Lorenzen recorded the first out. It was the first time this year the Royals hit back-to-back home runs.  Vierling then put the Tigers back in front with a two-run home run in the third, giving him four RBI on the night.  “I feel good (and) relaxed,” Vierling said. “Hitting is up and down sometimes. I feel like I'm seeing it well. I really like my approach right now. I'm just trying to stay with that as much as possible.”  Jackie Bradley Jr. hit his first homer as a Royal to tie the game in the fifth. Nicky Lopez tripled leading off the inning before Bradley hit it into the Tigers bullpen in left. Bradley snapped an 0-for-26 skid.  TRANSACTIONS:  Royals IF Nicky Lopez returned from rehab assignment at Triple-A Omaha and was reinstated from IL. He has been out since May 2 with an emergency appendectomy. In a corresponding move, IF/OF Hunter Dozier was designated for assignment. Dozier was hitting .183 with two home runs and nine RBI in 29 games this season.

"game","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Clermont"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T00:55:16","CLERMONT – The University Christian Christians’ softball team is a veteran group that features four seniors, of which three were on last year’s team that reached the state title game.  Meanwhile, the Foundation Academy Lions’ roster featured just one senior and one junior. The rest of Foundation Academy’s roster is made up of underclassmen – including the Lions pair of pitchers in freshmen Reagan Schirmer and Riley Winters.  And unfortunately for Foundation Academy, the lopsided difference in experience translated to a lopsided result on the scoreboard as University Christian cruised to a 11-0 win, sending the Christians to the Class 2A state championship game for the second year in a row.  Here’s how it happened.  Providence's Skyy Dixon wins double FHSAA 1A sprint titles to open state track meet  Third trip the charm? University Christian eyes FHSAA softball title in final four return  'Unfinished business': Baldwin softball ready for rematch in FHSAA state semifinals  University Christian ace Sophia Kardatzke hurls perfect game  No one at Clermont’s Legends Way Ballfields gasped in disbelief when No. 24 trotted out to the circle for University Christian.  Wearing No. 24 for the Christians is junior pitcher Sophia Kardatzke, who verbally committed to the University of South Carolina-Upstate in November.  And if they didn’t already, Spartans fans should find comfort in knowing what their pitching staff is getting in Kardatzke after Monday night’s semifinal performance.  Albeit a shortened game as University Christian run-ruled Foundation Academy in five innings, Kardatzke managed to fan 11 and kept the Lions’ lineup from ever plating a baserunner. Kardatzke’s perfect game was her second this postseason as she hurled another five-inning perfect game on May 10 as the Christians downed St. Joseph Academy 13-0.  As Monday’s game progressed, Kardatzke only seemed to get better as she struck out the side in both the fourth and fifth inning, putting a bookend to Foundation Academy’s season.  Christians’ offense follows suit with Kardatzke’s dominance  Where its pitcher left off, the University Christian lineup picked up.  After Kardatzke forced a groundout and tallied a pair of strikeouts in the top of the first inning, the Christians returned to their dugout, picked up their bats and got to work quick.  University Christian senior Macie Bourgholtzer led off the bottom of the first inning with a single up the left side and worked her way around to third thanks to an error by Foundation Academy’s sophomore shortstop Sophia Smith. A sac fly off the bat of Jahliyah Robinson would drive Bourgholtzer home for the opening run of the game.  Come the second inning, the Christians continued to attack the Lions’ young arms, stringing together a pair of no-out singles to plate a pair of runners for University Christian’s Alyssa Smith, who finished with a team-leading three RBIs on the evening.  The game was really blown open in the third and fourth innings as the University Christian lineup generated four and five-run frames to shut the door on Foundation Academy.  Five different University Christian hitters recorded two-hit performances, including Bourgholtzer, Kardatzke, Jaleigha Harris, Kate Dell'Alba and Elissa Murdock.  University Christian advances to Tuesday’s state final  Again, when the Christians take the field for Tuesday’s state championship game, it won’t be a first for a majority of the roster.  Winning a title, however, would be something none on the team have experienced.  Last season, University Christian fell to Orlando First Academy 8-2 in the Class 2A title tilt as the Royals tallied eight hits against Kardatzke, which is more than the junior pitcher has allowed in a game all season.  The Christians advanced to the state final scheduled for Tuesday night against Fort Myers Evangelical Christian.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qYWNrc29udmlsbGUuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9zb2Z0YmFsbC8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXNvZnRiYWxsLTIwMjMtdWMtc29waGlhLWthcmRhdHprZS1waXRjaGVzLXBlcmZlY3QtZ2FtZS83MDI0MzgzMDAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

That’s the same price as Lego’s other recent video game tribute to the Nintendo Entertainment System after last year’s price rise. In case the pricing and brick-count weren’t enough of an indicator, Lego has specified that this Pac-Man set is meant for people aged 18 and over.

In its most recent issue, Edge Magazine spoke to Netflix vice president and head of external games, Leanne Loombe, about their Stranger Things-oriented output. So far at least, Netflix has put out two games from the show: Stranger Things 1984 in 2017, and Stranger Things 3: The Game two years later in 2019.  ""As we build up the muscles to launch more games, and we learn more things, then we are naturally going to move into higher scope, more complex, AAA-type experiences, across both internal and external [studios],"" the Netflix executive told Edge.  ""We have IPs that we thing could work well in games, but then it's about really figuring out 'ok, what kind of game is that - how would that feel and play?'"" Loombe continued. ""You know, the Stranger Things games that we've got, for example, they're great games, but I don't think we've done the Stranger Things game yet - the one that is authentically connected to that universe and those characters that the fans love.""  Netflix's two Stranger Things games to date are both retro-inspired mobile games, and it's clear the company is aiming for something bigger in scale. A third Stranger Things game - Stranger Things VR - is set to launch later this year in 2023, putting the player in the shoes of villain Vecna for something decidedly different than their two offerings so far.  Aside from that though, Netflix looks to be stepping up its efforts to push into the video game space, with their biggest project yet set to be a AAA live-service shooter. It's not unreasonable to take Loombe's comments as an indication that a Stranger Things game in similar scale and scope could well be in development.

The Los Angels Angels are also .500 Over their last ten games and hold a two game lead in the AL West over the fourth place Seattle Mariners. The Oakland A’s are 20 games out of first and working on breaking the scale so 4th place is effectively last in the AL West.  Tanner Houck starts for Boston and brings with him a string of disappointments. Not terrible but disappointing. With the collapse of Corey Kluber, Houck has gained some protection for his claim on a rotation spot. Although Garrett Whitlock looms large and Nick Pivetta is lurking from the bullpen. There are positives: Houck’s 5.48 ERA is offset by a 4.09 FIP. Now that guy, 4.09 FIP guy, he’s a great option for the back end of the rotation. All things considered, Houck is giving innings: 5.0, 5.2, 6.0, 5.0, 7.0 over his last five starts. Just a little more around the edges and you’re looking at a solid contributor.  Jaime Barria is making his first start of the season. Not appearance, he’s got 10 of those already. While the righty made 11 starts as recently as 2021, last season he made just a since appearance as a starting pitcher. As an opener he makes some sense with 3 of his appearances this year lasting at least 3 innings. He’s faced double-digit batters four times in 2023. He can give some length. He’s the reverse of Houck in pitching metrics though. While Barria’s ERA is a tidy 1.96 his FIP sits at 3.51. That’s still good of course.

Planet of Lana wastes little time throwing players into the fire. As the young Lana, your small village, including someone close to you, has been abducted by alien machines. It’s up to you to find and free everyone, and you’re joined by an adorable (and pettable) cat-like companion named Mui. Watching tender and somber moments between the pair is a treat because everything looks so wonderful. From painterly grassy plains to postcard-worthy beachside vistas, several snapshots are worthy of being framed as art pieces. The majestic soundtrack sits high on my list of the year’s best, with the main theme, in particular, becoming a welcomed earworm that also has intriguing narrative significance.  The game delivers an adequately entertaining tale, and it’s tough not to smile at Lana and Mui’s cute, though limited, interactions. The more exciting world-building happens along the edges, primarily through collectible, easy-to-miss fragments of an illuminating wall carving. Is this Earth or another planet? What are the machines, and where did they come from? Planet of Lana leaves some answers vague, but the intrigue helped propel me forward even if I’m still drawing my own conclusions.  Lana’s deliberate, momentum-based movement feels fine but occasionally causes headaches, such as watching her slip over an edge after landing a big jump. Problem-solving involves the sometimes tedious task of moving objects into their correct positions and doing things in the proper order so that both characters can bypass obstacles. Mui’s superior agility means you’ll be commanding them to drop climbing ropes for Lana, activate distant switches, or lure away enemies. I just wish Mui didn’t halt after performing actions so I wouldn’t have to call them to my side constantly. Eventually, Mui and Lana can hijack animals’ minds or hack machines, respectively, to make them serve as platforms or weights for pressure-sensitive switches. These are cool abilities I wish the game utilized more often.  These traversal puzzles have some clever ideas, but they don’t evolve much or hit that next gear. You push objects, climb ropes, and crouch in tall grass to avoid patrolling machines for the bulk of the journey, albeit in moderately more elaborate ways. Some less recurring exercises break up this routine, such as manipulating the water level in lakes, but nothing I tackled truly wowed me, and I sometimes groaned when puzzles returned to the status quo. I solved a few obstacles on the first glace, and others can be disappointingly simple even deep into the game. Puzzle-solving may be middling, but Planet of Lana has a sprinkling of adrenaline-pumping moments. I got a kick out of a quick-time-event-driven race across the desert as your mount sprints through an armada of colossal marching machines.  While I would have liked gameplay to have more bite and variety, Planet of Lana is still an enjoyable and beautiful romp. The art direction and main jingle are likely the only things that will stick with me in the long run, but Lana and Mui’s journey is a competent rescue mission that doesn’t always soar as high as the machines pursuing them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vcmV2aWV3L3BsYW5ldC1vZi1sYW5hL2NoYXNpbmctcG90ZW50aWFs0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZWluZm9ybWVyLmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvcGxhbmV0LW9mLWxhbmEvY2hhc2luZy1wb3RlbnRpYWw_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2022-07-25","Not Discerned","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T21:47:00","An under-18 gamer, with support from a guardian, is suing Nintendo over the company’s in-game loot boxes that charged players real money for a slim chance at pretend advantage. The class action lawsuit was originally filed last month, but escalated to the federal system through California State Court last Wednesday, according to a report from Axios.    The suit claims that Nintendo engaged in deceptive and illegal practices through the in-game transactions it sold to players of the popular mobile racing game, Mario Kart Tour. By enticing players to pay actual money for chance-based video game rewards, the plaintiffs allege the company did something “immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, and/or substantially injurious to consumers.” Moreover, Nintendo’s actions were allegedly in violation of Washington state’s Consumer Protection Act, per the suit.  Advertisement  For years, Mario Kart Tour—a freemium offering popular among young gamers—employed an entirely luck-based system to entice users to roll the proverbial dice on in-game boosts. Pulling on a green “Spotlight Pipe”, known colloquially as a “gacha pipe,” would release new gliders, karts, or characters at random that could significantly improve a player’s in-game performance. Each “pull” cost five “Rubies” (about $3 USD). Such loot box features are often derided as predatory and companies have been widely criticized for them, especially in games that are marketed towards kids.  Nintendo discontinued the gacha pipe in October 2022, replacing the mechanism with a more straightforward, less gamble-y (though still paid) in-game store. Other gaming companies have also similarly dropped loot boxes in recent months.  Advertisement Advertisement  But before the Nintendo pipes were cut off, between 2021 and 2022, the new lawsuit states that the lead plaintiff—again, a minor—charged more than $170 on his dad’s credit card without permission through these Mario Kart Tour loot boxes. There are well-documented cases of players racking up much higher bills in comparable game set-ups, but still the player (and his dad) are probably right to be pissed off. Through Mario Kart Tour, Nintendo yielded an estimated $293 million between 2019 and 2022—according to a report from Games Industry.biz.  “Plaintiff almost never received any valuable reward from the Spotlight Pipes he had purchased during his time playing Mario Kart Tour and would not have made the amount of in-game purchases that he did had he known the true odds of his being able to obtain any reward from the Spotlight Pipe, or that he would not be allotted a refund,” noted the legal filing. Gizmodo reached out to Nintendo for comment, but did not receive a response as of publication time.  Advertisement  This is not the fist lawsuit filed against a video game company for sketchy in-game purchase systems. Google, Apple, Valve Corp., and others have all faced legal complaints for the promotion and creation of games that included microtransaction systems essentially indistinguishable from gambling. However in each of these cases so far, the tech companies have come out on top, according to an analysis from JD Supra. One lawsuit against Electronic Arts (EA games) claiming that loot boxes amounted to “unlawful gambling” was tossed out of court by a Canadian judge last month.  Gaming companies have also faced scrutiny and watchdog investigations worldwide for their loot box practices. In one notable win in the fight against manipulative in-game purchases, Epic Games—the maker of Fortnite—was forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, in part because of its methods of coercing young users to spend money.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ2l6bW9kby5jb20vbmludGVuZG8tbG9vdC1ib3gtbGF3c3VpdC1tYXJpby1rYXJ0LXRvdXItZ2FjaGEtZnJlZS1wbC0xODUwNDYyNjQx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A small rover drops down to the lunar surface and exits its pod, ready to explore and help to build a human habitat.  This is the crux of Roving Rovers, a game designed to simulate the design and use of lunar rovers for setting up a lunar colony.  Camryn Schriever, chief technical officer at Mini Mammoth Games, says the game’s been designed to get kids interested in space.  “You’ll be able to create your own colony of rovers using AI, and your own designs, to see how long people could potentially survive on the Moon with the project that you built,” says Schriever.  That interest certainly seems to be sparked: at the Australian Space Forum, where Cosmos spoke to Schriever, school students were crowding around the controllers to have a shot.  Born out of last year’s Australian Rover Challenge at the University of Adelaide, Mini Mammoth has been working with the Andy Thomas Space Centre, as well as the universities of Adelaide and Flinders, to develop the game.  While the rover designs can get quirky, they’re placed in a very realistic simulation.  “The landscape in this version of the project is taken from actual lunar topography,” says Schriever.  “NASA has height map scans of the moon – we’ve managed to take that and import it into our gamebuild.”  Next, the team is adding a simulation of the Shackleton Crater, at the Moon’s south pole: one of the most promising landing sites for a lunar colony.

The walls of the crater, meanwhile, enjoy near-permanent sunlight, making them prime candidates for solar panels.  But Shackleton Crater is not the best-mapped part of the Moon.

The Early Access release will include a new playable character, fresh character cosmetics, an enhanced Battle Pass, a lobby chatting system, and “tons” of updates based on player feedback.  “After three successful playtest events, we’re indebted to the thousands of players who took the time to share their thoughts on our project,” said MUMO Studio CEO and game director KiHoon Choi in a press release. “We’re incredibly proud of all the features and enhancements our development team has implemented over the last year, and we can’t wait to introduce DUBIUM to a broader audience. We’ll continue working very closely with the community as we update the game on the road to its 1.0 launch.”  Here is an overview of the game, via MUMO Studio:  DUBIUM‘s Early Access release includes plenty of new features for those gutsy enough to launch into outer space with treacherous fellow mercenaries. At launch, players will have the chance to unlock new cosmetics for characters, accessories, and gadgets, plus handy customizations for specialized character gear. To improve the experience for new players, MUMO Studio refined the player tutorial, alongside general enhancements such as updates to inventory management, AI responses, matchmaking, daily missions, loot, and more. MUMO Studio will also add a new playable character to the game’s roster of Frontiers. An ex-hunter with an expert knowledge of traps (not to mention a clinical case of germophobia and OCD), Archie Lang joins DUBIUM‘s crew at Early Access alongside its core members: Sobok Ee the ambitious diver, Jessica Fernandez the ex-soldier, Ryan Goldman the white collar psychopath, Zack Zhou the infamous hacker, and Sergei Tulinov the capricious former wrestler. DUBIUM is a five-player asymmetrical co-op game set in a near-future science-fiction universe. Five space-faring Frontiers must board a derelict space station and complete missions for their mercenary employer, Shadd Enterprise. The trick is, one of the Frontiers is working for Shadd’s biggest challenger, Blamane! Survive the Traitor while repairing vital systems then make your escape—either by working as a team or looking out for yourself. Defeating the Traitor just forces Blamane to compromise a different teammate, so trust no one! Survival holds the promise of a big payday and future space-gigs. As a nod to DUBIUM‘s Kickstarter origins, MUMO Studio is adding a flamboyant NPC(corpse to loot) who will share some words of wisdom from special backers.

I spent many hours in a school computer lab in the late 1980s traveling west across the Kansas prairie, crossing the Rocky Mountains and surviving dysentery while absolutely crushing the high score list.  First released as an Apple Arcade exclusive in 2021, Gameloft's newest ""Oregon Trail"" is now available on Steam, Nintendo Switch and the Microsoft Store, and there's a lot of game packed into the journey west.  The original was designed to be played in 45 minutes — about the length of a typical class. Making it to the Willamette Valley will take longer now, about five hours. The core aspect is the same, but added in are hundreds of random events and quests, along with new trails to travel, weekly challenges and a ton of replayability.  There's a rogue-like, randomized element to this game. At the start, you build a party by being offered one of three random characters, each of whom has a profession and two traits displayed, such as a Banker who is Wily and Optimistic or a Farmer who is Heroic and Hedonistic. You must pick one of the choices. Then you get three more choices for the next member, until the full party of four is made.  Completing side journeys and other trails can unlock more professions on future playthroughs. In total there are 13 classes, eight of which must be unlocked. (Carpenter for wagon repairs and Physician for better health are highly recommended).  Each character has a bevy of stats to maintain: health, morale, stamina and hygiene, along with traits in loyalty, attitude, composure and wit, and skills such as shooting, carpentry, wayfinding and medical. Lots of random events will occur, and there's usually some kind of skill check that allows for better chances of success. Wagon repair events are frequent, so a character with good carpentry skill is helpful, and medical events come up a lot, too (I had party members bitten by snakes five times in one trip).  A character's exact skills are unknown at the start, but knowledge of them is unlocked when they attempt to use those skills (haggling to get a better price reveals a character's Wit) or when the party shares stories at a campsite, getting to know each other.  Despite its educational nature, don't expect the trip to be an easy one. Even on normal difficulty, making the journey from Independence, Mo., with everyone intact and healthy is pretty hard, with crossing rivers right at the top of the hardest challenges. Always take the ferry if you can. I rarely got above a 60% chance of success to cross via fording or floating. My first attempt ended at the Snake River with everyone drowning.      [Video not showing up above? Click here to watch » arkansasonline.com/522trail/]      In a neat twist, though, my next party found a bit of their stuff the next time I went through.  There is an easy mode, if you want your trip to be more ""Little House on the Prairie"" and less Donner Party, and there's even a scenic mode where nothing bad happens at all. But speaking of the Donner Party, there is a scenario where you follow in that infamous party's footsteps to California.  ""The Oregon Trail"" also just released downloadable content (the first DLC in its 50-year history), called ""Cowboys and Critters,"" that adds the Chisholm Trail journey from Texas to Abilene, Kan.  One of the best improvements is the music. The 15-song, moody, alt-country soundtrack for this game is phenomenal. It even got its own vinyl release. I do wish the score paid a little more homage to the original tunes, but it's stellar nonetheless.  The art style is a blend of pixel art and 3D environments in a way that both resembles the original and elevates it. Other visual modes (such as monochrome green and black) are unlockable.  ""The Oregon Trail"" has just about everything going for it that I could want: a mixture of strategy, skill and luck, every journey unique, and lots of replayability. Even the weekly challenges become important, as they can help your party start with more money on the next journey. It's also optimized for hand-held gaming, such as the Switch, iOS devices or the Steam Deck console.

"game","2023-04-30","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T16:58:48","SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Florida Panthers arrived home having won each of the first two games of the Eastern Conference Final against the Carolina Hurricanes on the road. Now they have the opportunity to take a commanding lead in Game 3.  ""You have to continue to play your game, continue to pounce on them when that opportunity shows,"" Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk said. ""We're in a great spot right now. We would have taken that. And we earned it. But coming here, there's no sense in giving them life.""  Teams that have gone up 2-0 in a best-of-7 series in the semifinal round of the playoffs have gone on to win 90.7 percent of the time (78-8).  Teams that have gone up 3-0 in a playoff series have won the series 98 percent of the time (200-4), but the Hurricanes are not exactly handing over the reins to the Panthers. They know they can get back into the series, and that starts with Game 3 after two straight overtime losses in Games 1 and 2.  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  ""I don't think we've played our best game yet in this series,"" Hurricanes forward Sebastian Aho said. ""We've got room to improve and that's the main focus tonight. It's just come out here and get our best effort out.""  So do they need to change anything?  ""Big picture, no,"" Aho said. ""But there's little details in the game that we've got to be a little bit better at. When I say we haven't played our best game, it's not about effort or how hard we work. It's just about in certain moments being a little better, being a little sharper mentally. I believe it's going to turn those bounces in our favor.""  Here are 3 keys for Game 3:  1. Andersen returns for Hurricanes  Though it's clear that the Panthers are sticking with goalie Sergei Bobrovsky after incredible performances in the first two games of the series -- making 63 saves on 65 shots in Game 1 and 37 saves on 38 shots in Game 2 -- there is less certainty game to game for the Hurricanes.  Antti Raanta started Game 2 after Frederik Andersen played seven periods in Game 1, including four in overtime.  Andersen will start Game 3 for Carolina. He has made seven starts in the postseason, with a 1.65 goals-against average and .936 save percentage.  2. Keep the pressure on early  The Panthers faced this exact scenario in the Eastern Conference Second Round, coming home ahead 2-0 against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Instead of letting up and getting overconfident, they put the Maple Leafs on the brink of elimination with a 3-2 overtime win to go up 3-0. Although the Panthers lost Game 4, they were in a great position to win the series.  But they also know that the Hurricanes are going to come out strong early, like Carolina has historically done and as it did in Game 2. So putting the pressure on early could be crucial for the Panthers.  ""I think we have to have a better start,"" Tkachuk said. ""They had a really good start last game and had us on our heels for a little bit. We were able to weather that and 'Bob' made some big saves and allowed us to get to our game. … They're a great team over there, so expecting a push from them.""  3. Goals, goals, goals  Against Bobrovsky and the Panthers, the Hurricanes have scored only three goals in two games. And that's not enough to take back control of this series, which means the Hurricanes need to figure out how to score on Bobrovsky -- and fast. That won't be easy, since he hasn't given up more than two goals in seven games since he allowed three to the Boston Bruins in Game 7 of the first round on April 30.  ""I know it's a little bit cliché, but put a lot of pucks on him,"" Aho said. ""Go in front of him, make him find the pucks around you and obviously going to get those seconds and thirds and try to bang those home. Making it hard for him. But, goal-scoring wise, I'm not too worried.""

"game","2024-09-02","19:00:00","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T13:30:00","EA’s confirmation last week that its college football video game will return in 2024, 11 years after the last release of NCAA Football, marks a new era for sports video games and college sports.  For the first time, college players will be paid, with those who opt in receiving $500.  More from Sportico.com  Scroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT  The development comes as the National Labor Relations Board moved one step closer to finding that colleges, conferences and the NCAA are joint employers of college athletes. In that scenario, college athletes could unionize, collectively bargain terms of employment and negotiate group licensing deals with video-game publishers and other businesses.  Although the EA and NLRB developments are unrelated, they forecast a near-term future where college athletes appear in video games in the same vein as NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL players.  EA previously published college football and basketball games that contained the logos, colors and other intellectual property of the NCAA and colleges, with EA paying the NCAA and colleges to use those properties.  The games also contained the likenesses of players, but without those players’ names or consent and without paying them. In different legal actions, Ed O’Bannon, Sam Keller and Ryan Hart sued EA for violating their and other players’ right of publicity. Though varying by state law, this right generally forbids the commercial use of another person’s identity without their consent.  Advertisement  In those litigations, EA argued it was protected by the First Amendment. EA insisted that video games are like books and movies in expressing ideas and creating features distinctive to the medium, with player avatars interacting in a virtual world. The video game setting purportedly transforms a real athlete’s likeness into an avatar that has more to do with the talents of EA programmers than those of the real-life athlete.  Two federal appeals courts, the Ninth and Third Circuits, didn’t buy that argument. They emphasized EA tried to make the games as realistic as possible—recall EA’s “It’s in the game” tagline—and that EA went so far as to allow video-game users to upload rosters of real players’ names as a way of more closely linking their virtual world with the real one.  With O’Bannon, EA negotiated a settlement in 2014 wherein about 29,000 players who appeared in college football and college basketball video games were paid, on average, about $1,200. Depending on how many games featured them and how directly their likenesses were copied, some players got as much as $7,200.  By the mid-2010s, EA faced a conundrum moving forward. Even if EA wanted to pay college players for use of their likenesses, EA could not do so without causing those players to violate NCAA amateurism rules that, until the NIL era began in 2021, rendered players ineligible for exercising their right of publicity. The NCAA and colleges might have also refused to license their own IP if the video-game publisher negotiated with players.  Advertisement  Had the NCAA allowed NIL in the 1990s or 2000s, EA could have made games with real players, who would have been paid. It took the O’Bannon litigation and states adopting NIL statutes, along with the Supreme Court declaring in NCAA v. Alston that amateurism rules are subject to ordinary antitrust scrutiny, to force the NCAA to acquiesce on NIL.  EA’s return to college sports video gaming is designed to avoid potential legal headaches. Through a partnership with OneTeam Partners, EA will invite college players to contractually agree to appear in the game for $500. Players who don’t sign up will presumably be replaced by fictitious players.  It is lawful for EA to offer players, of varying fame and talents, a flat and non-negotiable rate. This approach is sometimes called a “contract of adhesion” or a “take it or leave it” deal. It is common—and typically lawful—in licensing, leasing and other types of transactions. EA can set the terms of its offer; no law compels EA to offer more than $500 or to bargain any terms.  EA also appears to be in good standing with antitrust law. Section 1 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal for competing businesses, such as NCAA member schools or teams in a pro league, to conspire in ways that unreasonably restrain competition; EA is not conspiring with other video-game publishers. Section 2 of the Sherman Act tackles monopolies; EA is merely offering one video game to consumers who can choose many others instead.  Advertisement  EA’s reliance on OneTeam is sensible since OnePartners can use its NIL expertise and industry presence to facilitate transactions with large numbers of players. It would likely be costly and inefficient for EA to attempt one-on-one player negotiations.  Unlike with games for pro leagues, EA also has no college athlete union in which to bargain. This is because, for now, college athletes are not recognized as employees and can thus not unionize.  However, an NLRB regional director in Los Angeles last week issued a complaint opining that USC, the Pac-12 and NCAA are joint employers of Trojan football and men’s and women’s basketball players. The issuance of a complaint doesn’t change the law, but it sets the table for a hearing before an administrative law judge on Nov. 7, 2023. The outcome of that hearing can be appealed to federal court.  If this multistep legal process concludes with the NCAA and conferences deemed joint employers, the ramifications would be profound.  Advertisement  The relevant federal labor law, the NLRA, doesn’t govern public universities, workers for whom are only employees and can only unionize if permitted by state law. But the NCAA and conferences are private entities and are governed by the NLRA. If the NCAA is a joint employer, the NCAA would be on the hook for college athletes, at least in certain sports, at potentially all NCAA member schools.  Those athletes could form a union which could in turn negotiate group licensing deals with EA, giving new meaning to “it’s in the game.”  Click here to read the full article.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lYS1jb2xsZWdlLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtcmV0dXJucy0xMzMwMDA2MzUuaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VhLWNvbGxlZ2UtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZS1yZXR1cm5zLTEzMzAwMDYzNS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advert 10  Earlier this month, Sony dropped its PS Plus games for Extra and Premium subscribers, and it’s fair to say that the May 2023 offerings have gone down rather well. For starters, the PS Plus games this month are said to save subscribers a whopping £600. Across all three subscription tiers, PS Plus May 2023 has brought in the likes of Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, GRID Legends, Chivalry II, Dishonored 2, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider to name a few. However, one game that has been a hot topic of discussion with subscribers on Reddit is a title that launched on PlayStation Plus, and that game is called Humanity.  Take a look at Humanity in action below.  Loading…  Advert 10  Developed by Tha Ltd, Humanity is a puzzle game set in the year 2156, and you play as a human named Landon that has turned into a dog. In Humanity, you must then guide swarms of humans through challenging levels filled with dangerous obstacles to safety. If I were to compare Humanity to something, I’d say it kind of looks like a cross between PSP puzzler Echochrome and the classic Lemmings.  “If you are looking for a great puzzle game, with some decently hard levels, and a somewhat straightforward Platinum, I would suggest you try out Humanity,” said Reddit user Feeling-Pumpkin opening up the discussion. “I just finished it and got platinum for it without any guide, and it really felt fulfilling. Also, the themes and story behind it is so good, please if you like puzzle games try this out.”  “Loving it at the moment but made the mistake of looking at the trophies before I finished the game. Story trophies aren't hidden so it spoiled the story for me,” replied FriedChicken10. “My GOTY so far, such an ingenious game!” said MewinMoose. “All in all a great game and an amazing experience, I really loved it,” added GirlFeetInMyTummy.  Advert 10  However, it seems that Humanity is not everyone’s cup of tea. User shawny_mcgee said, “Didn’t like it, uninstalled after a few levels. I can see the appeal for someone who really enjoys puzzle games but it's just not for me.” You can't win them all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWluZ2JpYmxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXBsdXMtbGF0ZXN0LWdhbWUtaGFpbGVkLWZ1bGZpbGxpbmctYW1hemluZy1leHBlcmllbmNlLTQ3NzcyMC0yMDIzMDUyMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And as it turns out, there's an official Mörk Borg comic.  To Hell and Galgenbeck by Polish cartoonist Lukasz Kowalczuk captures all the wild intensity of the live-fast-die-hard tabletop game in a package that feels like a fever dream version of a Saturday morning adventure cartoon. It releases a new two-page spread every week, some of which are mind-bending full-on double page spreads - all rendered in a blacklight poster-esque palette of black, pink, and yellow to match the sparse but engaging design of Mörk Borg's game manual.  ""I always wanted to make my mark on such IP (I HATE this kind of language, but what can I do?),"" jokes Kowalczuk in an official statement. ""So the opportunity to write and draw To Hell and Galgenbeck is groundbreaking for me.""  ""Mörk Borg is not a game with a typical setting and I don't have restrictions like 'You need to use this monster here.' What I have is support from the co-creator of the game - Johan Nohr (Stockholm Kartell) and editor Walton Wood (Liber Ludorum),"" he continues, explaining his working relationship with the game's creators.  ""Mörk Borg is not a nice corporate product. To Hell and Galgenback is not nice. Protagonists are ugly, world stinks, there is little hope for tomorrow and there are no colors besides black, white, pink and yellow.""  To Hell and Galgenbeck has published 18 pages across nine two-page spreads so far, with a new spread releasing every Thursday, and has a physical release in the works. As for Mörk Borg, a free, plaintext version of the game is available through the official website - and if you haven't played it, throw on some doom metal, pick up some dice, and prepare to lose your mind.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcmFkYXIuY29tL3RoZXJlcy1hbi1vZmZpY2lhbC1tb3JrLWJvcmctY29taWMtYW5kLWl0cy1qdXN0LWFzLW1ldGFsLWFzLXRoZS1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

New York has been incredibly strong defensively this season, too, allowing only 12 goals in 15 matches across all competitions.  Combined, both teams have six victories that have come by a 1-0 scoreline.

On Sunday, for the first time in 26 years, baseball was played at the historic stadium -- which was once a site of Negro League games -- by the New Jersey Jackals of the professional Frontier League.  The Jackals had played at Yogi Berra Stadium in Montclair, N.J. over the past 25 seasons. But going forward, Hinchliffe Stadium, now reopened after undergoing a $103 million renovation, will serve as the home stadium for the team.  On Friday, the franchise held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the reopening of the stadium.  ""Not many cities across the country can say they have a professional baseball team playing in a historic stadium,"" Paterson, N.J., Mayor Andre Sayegh said, according to News 12. ""A stadium that stands out because it was one of only two in the country that hosted negro league games when African-Americans were excluded from playing in baseball.""  Hinchliffe Stadium originally opened in 1932 and was the site of an abundance of baseball history. Negro League teams like the New York Black Yankees, New York Cubans and Newark Eagles all used Hinchliffe Stadium during the 1930s and 1940s. But eventually the stadium closed in 1997 after it fell into disrepair.  The Jackals, which as a member of the Frontier League is partnered with Major League Baseball, announced that they'd be moving back to Paterson in September 2022. Hinchliffe Stadium was originally supposed to host its first game on Saturday, but a rainout pushed back to the grand reopening to Sunday, when they defeated the Sussex County Miners 10-6.

Spencer Steer launched an early two-run homer and scored the winning run for the Reds. Ian Gibaut (4-1) struck out two in a hitless 10th to keep it tied.  “We grinded that one out,” Senzel said. “The goal was to just get it in the air, a groundball was no good there. He (Ryan Helsley) is so hard to hit. He’s one of the best in the game. He just left a pitch a little bit higher up than his previous pitch.”  Email newsletter signup  Paul DeJong homered and drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who had won 11 of 14 since a 10-24 start.  St. Louis had the bases loaded in the ninth and two runners aboard in the 10th, but failed to score.  “We had several opportunities, just couldn’t come up with some big hits,” manager Oliver Marmol said.  Steer began the bottom of the 10th as the automatic runner at second base. He advanced to third on a wild pitch by Helsley (2-3) and scored on Senzel’s deep fly to right field.  “The dirt-ball read by Spencer to get us to third made it tough on the defense,” Reds manager David Bell said. “Then Nick had a good at-bat there. Credit to the bullpen. So many guys came through to win the game.”  Cincinnati jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first on an RBI double by Matt McLain and an RBI single by Tyler Stephenson.  DeJong hit a three-run homer off rookie left-hander Brandon Williamson in the second. It was DeJong’s fourth homer in six games.  Williamson made his second career appearance after an impressive debut Tuesday at Coors Field when he retired 14 consecutive batters in a no-decision.  In the third, Steer’s two-run homer off left-hander Jordan Montgomery put the Reds back ahead.  “It’s tough to keep the ball in the park here,” Montgomery said. “I tried to keep them on the ground. Tonight was just grindy.”  Montgomery is winless in his past eight appearances.  “His pitch count was kind of up there tonight,” Marmol said. “Not the type of finish with his pitches. Didn’t look as crisp as he has.”  Pinch-hitter Lars Nootbaar tied it 4-all with an RBI double in the fifth.  The Reds took a 5-4 lead in the bottom half on a run-scoring groundout by Wil Myers. St. Louis tied it in the eighth when Nolan Gorman doubled to extend his career-best hitting streak to 12 games and scored on DeJong’s double.  IN MEMORIAM  The Reds held a moment of silence before the game to honor longtime Cardinals broadcaster Mike Shannon and St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Rick Hummel. Shannon died April 29. Hummel, who covered the Cardinals and Major League Baseball for five decades before retiring last year, died at his home on Saturday following a brief, aggressive illness.  The Reds also placed a rose at a seat in the press box for Hummel and Shannon. Marmol wore his No. 37 jersey without a hoodie in tribute to Hummel, who disliked it when managers were not in uniform.  “Once I got the phone call (about Hummel), I wanted to make sure I wore it,” Marmol said. “When we were struggling, he sent some encouraging texts. Super grateful for the time he spent with me.”  TRAINER’S ROOM  Reds: 1B Joey Votto (shoulder surgery) continues to take live batting practice but isn’t ready to resume his minor league rehab assignment. … RHP Connor Overton (right elbow strain) had a setback in his rehab and will undergo exploratory surgery on Tuesday.

"game","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T17:08:51","At this point, it's not a matter of if the Boston Celtics' season will end, but when.  That's the nature of the NBA playoffs, where no team in league history has overcome a 3-0 series deficit. The Celtics were aware of this fact entering Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals yet inexplicably laid an egg anyway, getting routed by the No. 8 seed Miami Heat 128-102 at Kaseya Center.  After Sunday's embarrassing loss, one question seemingly remains: How long will the Celtics delay the inevitable?  Will they show some fight by winning Game 4? Can they push this series to six or seven games? Or will they wave the white flag Tuesday night in Miami and get a head start on their offseason?  History tells us that Boston should win Game 4. The C's have been swept just four times in 102 seven-game series and haven't bowed out in four games since the 2015 playoffs, when they were swept by LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers.  Celtics    Have played in 102 previous 7-game series. They have been swept just 4 times    2015 - Cavaliers - (0-4)  2004 - Pacers - (0-4)  2003 - Nets - (0-4)  1983 - Bucks - (0-4)    so thereâs that — Boston Sports Info (@bostonsportsinf) May 22, 2023  Veteran big man Al Horford also struck an optimistic tone after Game 3, noting that his team shouldn't be intimidated by history.  ""We're not out yet,"" Horford told reporters in his postgame press conference. ""It is 3-0. I know what it looks like. I think I saw the other day, 0-149 or something like that. So, we’re not out yet. We’re still kicking. One of four teams that are still kicking.""  With due respect to Horford, though, Boston does have a track record of wilting in this situation. This is the seventh time the Celtics have trailed 3-0 in a series, and only twice in the previous six instances have they won Game 4. Here's a quick rundown of those six instances:  1967 second round vs. Philadelphia 76ers: Lost in five  1983 second round vs. Milwaukee Bucks: Lost in four  2003 second round vs. New Jersey Nets: Lost in four  2004 first round vs. Indiana Pacers: Lost in four  2013 first round vs. New York Knicks: Lost in six  2015 first round vs. Cleveland Cavaliers: Lost in four  Boston has never trailed 3-0 in an Eastern Conference Finals -- and certainly not to a No. 8 seed, which made history at the Celtics' expense Sunday night in a shocking blowout.  The Heat are the 1st 8 seed ever to win a playoff game by more than 25 points (seeding began in 1984). pic.twitter.com/PfermbmOq7 — ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) May 22, 2023  Prior to this series, the C's had been at their best with their backs against the wall. They rallied from a 3-2 series deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to win Game 6 on the road and triumph in Game 7 behind Jayson Tatum's 51-point masterpiece.  But this series feels different. Boston blew double-digit leads at home in both Game 1 and Game 2, then showcased a disturbing lack of effort in a gotta-have-it Game 3 that resulted in head coach Joe Mazzulla benching his starters for the entire fourth quarter.  ""I don't even know where to start,"" a shell-shocked Jaylen Brown said after the game. ""It's an obvious letdown. I feel like we let our fanbase, organization down. We let ourselves down. And it was collective. We can point fingers, but in reality, it was just embarrassing.""  The Celtics can save some face Tuesday night in Miami by rallying to win Game 4. If they bow out, it will be a long summer in Boston.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYm9zdG9uL2NlbHRpY3MvY2FuLWNlbHRpY3MtYXZvaWQtZWFzdC1maW5hbHMtc3dlZXAtdGhlaXItZ2FtZS00LXRyYWNrLXJlY29yZC1pc250LXByZXR0edIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYm9zdG9uL2NlbHRpY3MvY2FuLWNlbHRpY3MtYXZvaWQtZWFzdC1maW5hbHMtc3dlZXAtdGhlaXItZ2FtZS00LXRyYWNrLXJlY29yZC1pc250LXByZXR0eT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2021-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:04:15","Netflix's confirmation that Squid Game Season 2 will happen has led many to wonder when it will premiere on the streaming service.  The anticipation is high after a successful debut season for Squid Game on September 17, 2021, with the series now being the most-watched Netflix show of all time. This is on top of all the high praise from fans and critics since its arrival.  Ahead of Season 2, there have been many updates about the follow-up to Squid Game's highly-talked-about first season.  When Will Squid Game Season 2 Release?  Netflix  On June 12, 2022, Netflix released a short teaser to officially announce that Squid Game Season 2 is happening.  Alongside the announcement, Squid Game executive producer, director, and writer Hwang Dong-hyuk shared a heartfelt statement about the Season 2 renewal:  ""Thank you for watching and loving our show. And now, Gi-hun returns. The Front Man returns.  Season 2 is coming.  The man in the suit with ddakji might be back.  You’ll also be introduced to Young-hee’s boyfriend, Cheol-su. Join us once more for a whole new round.""  It remains to be seen when Squid Game Season 2 will premiere on Netflix.  However, in May 2021, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told Vanity Fair that he anticipates that the second season could premiere on Netflix ""by the end of 2023 or 2024.""  Hwang also revealed that he only has about ""three pages worth of ideas"" that he plans to turn into a script for Season 2 before teasing that there will be more games in the upcoming batch of episodes:  “Humanity is going to be put to a test through those games once again.”  The Squid Game creator also confirmed that Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae's lead character) is ""definitely"" coming back while the mysterious Front Man from the first round of games is also expected to return.  In February 2023, Seong Gi-hun actor Lee Jung-jae confirmed to allkpop that filming for Season will begin in the summer, noting that it will ""likely"" last for 10 months:  ""'Squid Game 2' will begin filming in the summer and the filming will likely last for about 10 months. We were working on Season 1 for about 10 months as well, but that was with delays caused by COVID-19.""  As the actor pointed out, the 10 months timeframe is the same as Season 1 but it included delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Squid Game lead star then teased that Season 2 will be ""bigger in scale,"" hinting that filming might end up being longer than Season 1:  ""But seeing as Season 2 will be bigger in scale, it will probably take longer to complete.""  Another factor that needs to be considered is the ongoing writers' strike of the Writers' Guild of America (WGA). It is unclear if or how Season 2 will be impacted by the events since Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk is a South Korean filmmaker and it is unknown if he's even part of the WGA.  If filming for Season 2 is impacted by the writers' strike, then the expected Summer 2023 filming start date could be delayed, thus pushing the predicted release date to late 2024 or early 2025.  What Is the Story of Squid Game Season 2?  Squid Game Season 1 finished in an open-ended way, teasing many storytelling opportunities for Season 2. To recap, the season ended with Gi-hun turning back and not getting on the plane to the United States, indicating that he might return to the games.  Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter in October 2021, Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk acknowledged Season 1's ending, but he noted that it served as a ""good closure"" for the whole story:  ""It’s true that season one ended in an open-ended way, but I actually thought that this could be good closure for the whole story, too. Season one ends with Gi-hun turning back and not getting on the plane to the States. And that was, in fact, my way of communicating the message that you should not be dragged along by the competitive flow of society, but that you should start thinking about who has created the whole system — and whether there is some potential for you to turn back and face it.""  The creator also teased that he wanted to explore the Front Man's storyline with his brother in Season 2:  ""But there are some other stories in the series that have not been addressed. For example, the story of the police officer and the story of his brother, the Front Man. So if I end up creating season two, I’d like to explore that storyline — what is going on between those two brothers?""  Hwang also mentioned that he would like to focus on the story of the game's recruiter and Gi-hun's arc:  ""And then I could also go into the story of that recruiter in the suit who plays the game of ddakji with Gi-hun and gives him the card in the first episode. And, of course, we could go with Gi-hun’s story as he turns back, and explore more about how he’s going to navigate through his reckoning with the people who are designing the games. So, I don’t know yet, but I’ll just say there are a lot of possibilities out there for season two storylines.""  Looking ahead, Hwang spoke with Korean broadcaster KBS, via Korea Times, to confirm that he's already in talks with Netflix about developing Squid Game Season 3:  ""I'm in talks with Netflix over Season 2 as well as Season 3. We will come to a conclusion any time soon.""  As it stands, the future of the Squid Game franchise is brighter than ever.  Squid Game Season 1 is streaming on Netflix.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlyZWN0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3NxdWlkLWdhbWUtc2Vhc29uLTItbmV0ZmxpeC1yZWxlYXNlLWVwaXNvZGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-06-08","21:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T20:57:06","Summer Game Fest is almost upon us, kicking off with a live showcase before splintering into a ""season"" of disparate publisher events in the absence of E3. But first that showcase, which is now confirmed to be two hours in length, and featuring at least a couple of ""pretty big"" things.  Summer Game Fest gets underway on 8th June, with a live show consisting of premieres, gameplay demos, and announcements. That's pretty much as far as details went in previous teases, but now, in an interview on the Epic Games Store, show host and producer Geoff Keighley has now shared a little more about what to expect from the format.  Alongside its now confirmed two-hour duration, Keighley suggests Summer Game Fest live will be a little more laidback compared to the bombastic Game Awards, offering a ""chance to talk to the developers and showcase games and give a little bit more context around games"". While the exact line-up still appears to be in flux, Keighley does say he expects the Summer Game Fest live show to feature three or four things that are ""pretty big for this audience.""  Watch on YouTube Newscast: After Redfall's launch woes, where next for Xbox?  ""As I always say with these shows, one or two games kind of makes the entire difference,"" he explained. ""As the producer, it's challenging because sometimes you have those games, sometimes you don't, sometimes you think you have them and they drop out or change.""  Beyond the live show, individual publishers have started confirming their own events running under the Summer Game Fest banner. Xbox, for instance, airs its showcase on 11th June, with Bethesda's Starfield Direct set to run straight after, and Ubisoft takes to the stage on 12th June.  In total, Summer Game Fest will feature links with over 40 ""partners"" in some capacity, including big names like PlayStation, Xbox, Capcom, Sega, CD Projekt, Bandai Namco, EA, Epic Games, Netflix, Activision, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and Warner Bros.  Sony, however, is setting its stall out early, well before the start of Summer Game Fest, with a one-hour PlayStation Showcase airing this Wednesday, 24th May, from 9pm BST. It'll focus on PS5 and PSVR2 games from PlayStation Studios, third-party partners, and indie creators.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvc3VtbWVyLWdhbWVzLWZlc3QtbGl2ZS1zaG93LXdpbGwtZmVhdHVyZS10aHJlZS1vci1mb3VyLXByZXR0eS1iaWctdGhpbmdz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T23:03:00","Every major item of the 2023 NFL offseason has now been checked off: free agency, the draft, and schedule release. Everyone has a fairly clear view of what their favorite team will look like entering the 2023 season, barring a few roster cuts and veteran pick-ups in August just before another year begins. All that's left for the football world is to wait and dream about what could unfold in 2023. With that in mind, here's a look at all 32 teams' most anticipated matchup of the upcoming season. Teams are listed in alphabetical order with stakes varying from revenge games to playoff seeding implications as well as good old fashioned bragging rights.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 17 at Philadelphia Eagles  Jalen Hurts PHI • QB • #1 CMP% 66.5 YDs 3701 TD 22 INT 6 YD/Att 8.05 View Profile  Between face-of-the-franchise quarterback Kyler Murray likely not being ready for the start of the 2023 season after undergoing knee surgery to repair a torn ACL and meniscus and their top defensive leader, safety Budda Baker, demanding a trade in the event the Cardinals don't make him the highest paid player at his position, there isn't exactly a ton of excitement for their upcoming season. It's a clear rebuild with a new head coach in Jonathan Gannon and a new general manager in Monti Ossenfort in charge, but the tail end of their season could a little more entertaining.  Since Murray could be out for as long as the first half of the season, that limits the options for their most anticipated game to the back-end of their slate. Their journey to the East Coast to face Gannon's former employer, the defending NFC Champion Eagles, in their penultimate game of the season will serve as a nice measuring stick for how far the Cardinals have to go to get back to contention. A delicious subplot is Gannon being back in front of the Philadelphia media, a group he left some critical, parting words for on his way out west.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 12 vs. New Orleans Saints  Derek Carr NO • QB • #4 CMP% 60.8 YDs 3522 TD 24 INT 14 YD/Att 7.02 View Profile  The Falcons and the Saints have one of the most petty rivalries in the entire NFL, constantly trading barbs back and forth over social media. Saints defensive lineman Cameron Jordan even expressed ""sadness"" when Falcons legend Matt Ryan left to join the Indianapolis Colts a year ago because that meant Jordan couldn't sack him anymore.  Week 12 serves as these rivals' first crack at each other in 2023, and an additional layer was added when Atlanta hired the Saints' co-defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen to be their new DC. New Saints quarterback Derek Carr and new Falcons rookie running back Bijan Robinson also insert additional intrigue as potential difference makers who could tilt the wide open NFC South in their respective team's favor.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 2 at Cincinnati Bengals  Joe Burrow CIN • QB • #9 CMP% 68.3 YDs 4475 TD 35 INT 12 YD/Att 7.38 View Profile  With MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson back in the fold for the Ravens after they made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, excitement can resume for this franchise. The Ravens haven't always prioritized pass-catchers or passing entirely in their offense, but they went out of their way to change that this offseason. The team hired a new offensive coordinator in Todd Monken, a coach with NFL OC experience who spent the last two years calling players for the back-to-back national champion Georgia Bulldogs, and they allocated some significant resources in free agency (signing Odell Beckham Jr. to a fully-guaranteed $15 million deal) and the draft (selecting Boston College wide receiver Zay Flowers 22nd overall) to elevate the passing game.  Given that pivot in a different direction, the anticipation will be high to see how those additions affect Baltimore's offense early on. Week 1 against the Houston Texans is a nice tune-up before they play their first of two matchups against the back-to-back AFC North champion Bengals. Seeing what the Ravens' new-look offense can do against the class of their division will be a thrilling early-season showdown.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 9 at Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday Night Football)  The Bills have been one of the NFL's most dominant teams across the last three regular seasons, leading the league in points per game (29.4) and points allowed per game (19.4) in that span. However, they have also continually bumped their head on a golden ceiling in the postseason, losing to the two teams to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl across the last three years in the Chiefs and Bengals. The Bengals were their latest wall as the Bills fell 27-10 at home in the AFC divisional round to end their promising 2022 campaign.  Their offense completely fizzled out when they needed it most, so Buffalo prioritized upgrades to help quarterback Josh Allen in the 2023 NFL Draft, selecting Utah tight end Dalton Kincaid 25th overall (first round) and Florida guard O'Cyrus Torrence 59th (second round) early. Testing out their upgraded offense against the Bengals' retooled defense will serve as a pivotal game in the race for the AFC's top playoff seed.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 at Atlanta Falcons  Nearly everything about the Panthers is new in 2023 with the exception of their defensive starting lineup. Frank Reich is in town as the Panthers head coach, and the Panthers traded up from the ninth overall pick to the first overall pick to secure Alabama quarterback Bryce Young in the 2023 NFL Draft. His entire supporting cast besides 2021 second-round pick receiver Terrace Marshall are fresh faces in Carolina after the team brought back a new running back (Miles Sanders), two new wide receivers (Adam Thielen and DJ Chark), and a new tight end (Hayden Hurst) from the free agency market.  Even though general manager Scott Fitterer said veteran quarterback signee Andy Dalton could start in Week 1 over Young, odds are the guy they sent a haul of picks plus wide receiver DJ Moore to the Chicago Bears in exchange for will be their starting quarterback. This makes their first game of the season must-see TV because the NFL world, not just Panthers fans, will be intrigued to see how the diminutive first overall pick fares to begin his pro career. In an NFC South where any of the four teams could win with Tom Brady now retired, this divisional clash could play a large factor into who ends up atop their standings at the end of the season.  Cincinnati Bengals  Most anticipated matchup: Week 17 at Kansas City Chiefs  Patrick Mahomes KC • QB • #15 CMP% 67.1 YDs 5250 TD 41 INT 12 YD/Att 8.1 View Profile  This has been the AFC Championship Game matchup in each of the last two seasons with the Bengals winning in the 2021 seasons and the Chiefs winning this past season. 2022 NFL and Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and Bengals Pro Bowl quarterback Joe Burrow both lead offenses with some of the best playmakers in the league.  The NFL doesn't need to do much promotion for this one because Bengals-Chiefs could end up as perhaps the best game of the regular season as well as the AFC Championship Game matchup for the third straight year.  Chicago Bears  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 vs. Green Bay Packers  Aaron Jones GB • RB • #33 Att 213 Yds 1121 TD 2 FL 3 View Profile  The Bears have more hope entering the 2023 NFL season than they have entering any year since 2019. They overhauled their last-ranked scoring defense (27.2 points per game) with the signings of linebackers Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards, and they finally acquired a No. 1 receiver for quarterback Justin Fields: D.J. Moore. The 26-year-old wideout came over as part of the return package for Chicago giving the Panthers the No. 1 overall draft pick in the 2023 draft.  Another reason for the Bears' renewed optimism is their ""owner"" Aaron Rodgers is no longer a Packer, so they won't have to face the quarterback who went 25-5 against them twice a year anymore. However, if they allow new Green Bay starter Jordan Love to walk out of Soldier Field victorious in his first game as the Packers' full-time quarterback, that excitement could dwindle quickly.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 vs. Cincinnati Bengals  The Browns, for whatever odd reason, have dominated Joe Burrow in his Bengals' career, winning four of five matchups. However, the one loss was Cleveland quarterback Deshaun Watson's first game in the Battle of Ohio, a 23-10 defeat in Week 14 last season. Watson was noticeably rusty after about a year-and-a-half off from playing in the NFL because of his legal issues centered around allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  Expectations are high for the passer the Browns handed a five-year, $230 million fully-guaranteed contract, and Cleveland's splintered fanbase could become even more negative in a hurry if Watson doesn't put up a good show against the back-to-back AFC North champions.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 2 vs. New York Jets    Aaron Rodgers NYJ • QB • #8 CMP% 64.6 YDs 3695 TD 26 INT 12 YD/Att 6.82 View Profile  In case you weren't aware, Cowboys' bogeyman Aaron Rodgers is now the quarterback of the New York Jets. His move from the Packers to the Jets creates another matchup between the four-time NFL MVP and the Cowboys that wouldn't have happened in 2023 were he still a Packer. Instead, the Silver and Blue get to face a quarterback who has won eight of his 10 starts against the franchise while throwing 18 touchdowns to only two interceptions in those games. It will be a significant early-season test for Dan Quinn's defense, going from facing Daniel Jones in Week 1 to Rodgers in Week 2.  He led the Packers to a 31-28 overtime victory in Week 10 last season after trailing 28-14 entering the fourth quarter, with a broken thumb on his throwing hand. This marked the first time in Cowboys franchise history (since 1960) that Dallas suffered defeat when they possessed a lead of 14 or more points entering the fourth quarter. Rodgers completed 14 of his 20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns, dropping Dallas' record to 195-1 in such situations.  Rodgers is also responsible for ending two of the Cowboys' best seasons of the 21st century in the playoffs, the 2014 and 2016 campaigns. There's nothing Dallas' fans and head coach Mike McCarthy -- once Rodgers' play-caller, confidant, and head coach while in Green Bay -- would enjoy more in the regular season then toppling Rodgers in what will likely be their final matchup with the future first-ballot Hall of Famer.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 6 at Kansas City Chiefs (Thursday Night Football)  The Broncos pulled Sean Payton out of the Fox Sports television studios and onto their sideline in 2023 for one reason: to fix Russell Wilson. The nine-time Pro Bowler posted career-lows in completion percentage (60.5%), passing touchdowns (15) and passer rating (84.4) in his first season in Denver while the Seattle Seahawks reached the postseason with his former backup Geno Smith playing like a top-five quarterback. No one could have anticipated that being the Year 1 outcome after the blockbuster trade to make him a Bronco.  With a return to health for multiple playmakers, wide receiver Tim Patrick and running back Javonte Williams (both recovering from torn ACLs), and Payton providing Wilson with some much-needed guidance, this season could be his last chance to prove he's the long-term answer in Denver. The Broncos signed backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham to a two-year, $10 million contract, a hefty deal for a No. 2 quarterback. Wilson needs to show the franchise can be a contender with him at the controls, and no better way to do that than to go toe-to-toe with Patrick Mahomes and the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs in prime time.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 at Kansas City Chiefs (Season Kickoff Game)  The Lions are the 2023 offseason's ""it"" team. They are currently the odds-on favorite to win the NFC North (+120) via Caesars Sportsbook, and their +2500 odds to win the Super Bowl are their second-shortest preseason odds in the last 25 years. The NFL even included them in the 2023 season opener against the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs!  Detroit won eight of its final 10 games in 2022, which included eliminating Aaron Rodgers and the Packers from playoff contention in the final game of the regular season on ""Sunday Night Football."" Quarterback Jared Goff's resurgence helped power a top-five scoring offense (26.6 points per game, fifth-best in NFL) as he led the entire league in touchdown to interception ratio, 29 touchdowns to only seven interceptions. Goff closed out the season on fire, throwing 15 touchdowns and no interceptions in the Lions' final nine games. His 324 consecutive passes without an interception mark the longest such streak in franchise history. A win or strong showing with the whole football world watching could set the tone for the Lions' best season of the 21st century.  Green Bay Packers  Most anticipated matchup: Week 17 at Minnesota Vikings (Sunday Night Football)  Justin Jefferson MIN • WR • #18 TAR 184 REC 128 REC YDs 1809 REC TD 8 FL 0 View Profile  Jordan Love's time as the Packers starting quarterback has arrived, creating plenty of anticipation and the excitement that comes of the mystery box of a sparingly-played 24-year-old, former first-round pick passer. While seeing him in Week 1 against the Bears will be intriguing since it's his first game running the show, it's not the Packers most-anticipated game. Head coach Matt LaFleur is a perfect 8-0 against the Bears since becoming Green Bay's head coach in 2019.  The Packers top rival in the NFC North these days is the Vikings, the 2022 division champions. The two teams split their matchups last season with the home team winning each time rather easily. Their second of two games in 2023 stands as the Packers' best game because Love will have gone through the bulk of his first regular season as the starter, and both teams could be fighting for postseason spots. A more experienced Love in prime time to close out the 2023 calendar year against a hated rival, this is Green Bay's most anticipated game.  Houston Texans  Most anticipated matchup: Week 2 vs. Indianapolis Colts  The Texans appear to have a plan for the first time in a while. Their hiring of San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator and former Texans linebacker DeMeco Ryans to be their new head coach in addition to drafting Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud second overall and Alabama defensive end Will Anderson Jr. third overall in the 2023 NFL Draft displays a clear direction of the vision they have for the team going forward.  Their first game of the season against Lamar Jackson and the Ravens likely won't be a fair fight given Baltimore was a playoff team even without Jackson at the end of the year in 2022 while Houston went 3-13-1. Week 2 will be their first true opportunity to prove they made the right choices early on in their rebuilding process when they face their division rival Colts. The juxtaposition between the two franchises will be one to keep an eye for years to come as Houston chose the more polished Stroud over the more physically-gifted Anthony Richardson, whom the Colts selected fourth overall in the 2023 NFL Draft.  Stroud versus Richardson could be a quarterback matchup that could define the AFC South for years to come.  Indianapolis Colts  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 vs. Jacksonville Jaguars  Trevor Lawrence JAC • QB • #16 CMP% 66.3 YDs 4113 TD 25 INT 8 YD/Att 7.04 View Profile  Speaking of Anthony Richardson, his NFL debut will be much-anticipated, especially since it comes against the reigning AFC South champion Jaguars. His cannon of an arm and dynamic dual-threat abilities could revitalize an offense that allowed running back Jonathan Taylor to lead the league in rushing back in 2021. If Richardson and the Colts can take care of the football and Taylor gets back to dominating opposing front seven's again, this game could be the start of an explosive rookie year for the 2023 NFL Draft's quarterback with the highest ceiling.  Jacksonville Jaguars  Most anticipated matchup: Week 2 vs. Kansas City Chiefs  The Jaguars made the incredible leap from having consecutive first overall draft picks to making the playoffs as AFC South champions in 2022. They even overcame a historic 27-0 deficit against the Los Angeles Chargers to win their first playoff game since the 2017 season. Now comes the really hard part: making the leap from a team that regularly reaches the postseason to an AFC contender.  There's no better measuring stick of course than the 2022 NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and the Super Bowl champion Chiefs, their Week 2 opponent. The two teams played a competitive playoff game in the AFC divisional round playoff game last season with a late fumble by wide receiver Jamal Agnew dooming Jacksonville to a 27-20 defeat. Another crack at the champs will be the Jaguars most exciting game on their 2023 slate.  Kansas City Chiefs  Most anticipated matchup: Week 4 at New York Jets (Sunday Night Football)  A year ago, some in the NFL media world were throwing dirt on the Chiefs, saying the rest of their AFC West competition (the Chargers, Las Vegas Raiders, and Broncos) improved enough to overtake them while they regressed after losing in the AFC Championship Game to the Bengals and All-Pro wide receiver Tyreek Hill departing to the Miami Dolphins. No one is making that mistake again this offseason, but the addition of Aaron Rodgers to the Jets created another potential road block for Kansas City in the AFC.  Patrick Mahomes, the reigning NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP, has stated multiple times throughout his career that Rodgers was his football idol, and this game represents the first time they will be playing against each other in a game. Mahomes missed the first opportunity in 2019 with an injury while Rodgers missed the second chance in 2021 when he tested positive for COVID-19. A battle between the Jets' top-five defense and Mahomes while Rodgers showcases how high he can lift New York's young playmakers is one of the best games on the league's 2023 slate.  Las Vegas Raiders  Most anticipated matchup: Week 16 at Kansas City Chiefs (Christmas Day)  The Super Bowl champion Chiefs are the seven-time defending AFC West champions. Every other AFC West team's most anticipated game is bound to be them until they're knocked off. Week 16 is the second of two regular season matchups, and it comes with much of the country watching on Christmas Day. With their first battle coming a month earlier in Week 12, it will be fascinating to see what late-season adjustments the two rivals can come up with in that short time.  If the Jimmy Garoppolo-led Raiders could come away with a win here, their final two games at the Colts and home against the Broncos could position them for a run at the postseason.  Los Angeles Chargers  Most anticipated matchup: Week 18 vs. Kansas City Chiefs  Both games between the Chargers and the Chiefs last season were three-point, edge-of-your-seat thrillers. Both were won by the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs. This game serves as both teams' regular season finale, and this game could hold plenty of playoff implications.  Justin Herbert versus Patrick Mahomes is also must-see TV, and with this game right before the playoffs, get your popcorn ready.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 3 at Cincinnati Bengals (Monday Night Football)  It's a Super Bowl LVI rematch! The Rams triumphed in a back-and-forth 23-20, last-gasp victory to conclude the 2021 season, but since then they've struggled mightily. Their 5-12 record in 2022 was the worst ever by a defending Super Bowl champion, but the good news is a lot of last season had to due with injuries that will be healed by Week 1 for their top contributors: quarterback Matthew Stafford (neck/concussion, missed eight games), wide receiver Cooper Kupp (ankle, missed eight games), and defensive lineman Aaron Donald (ankle, missed six games).  This game marks a strong, early-season test of whether or not 2022 was a blip or a sign of more doom and gloom to come.  Miami Dolphins  Most anticipated matchup: Week 9 vs. Kansas City Chiefs (in Frankfurt, Germany)  The Tyreek Hill revenge game is finally here! The All-Pro wide receiver spent the entire 2022 offseason talking trash about how Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was ""the most accurate quarterback in the NFL"" after Hill won a Super Bowl and put up humongous numbers with Patrick Mahomes. Both players had career-highs without the other in 2022 with Hill's 1,710 receiving yards (the second-most in the NFL behind Offensive Player of the Year Justin Jefferson) and Mahomes' league-leading 5,250 passing yards.  If Tagovailoa can remain upright and healthy entering this matchup after martial arts training this offseason to help with his concussions issue, this could be one of the best games of the 2023 season.  Minnesota Vikings  Most anticipated matchup: Week 2 at Philadelphia Eagles (Thursday Night Football)  The Vikings got embarrassed last season in prime time in this situation, on the road at the Eagles, losing 24-7. Kirk Cousins threw three interceptions, and Justin Jefferson was held to under 50 yards (six receptions for 48 yards) for the first of only six times. After their deflating opening round home playoff loss against the New York Giants, this prime-time clash with the defending NFC champions presents them the early opportunity to show they can punch above their weight class early in Year 2 under head coach Kevin O'Connell.  How Cousins performs in this game could also be a nice data point for the Vikings as he enters a contract year.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 3 at New York Jets  The Jets will be another nice litmus test for the Patriots after opening with the NFC champion Eagles and the division rival Dolphins. After a couple games, quarterback Mac Jones entering Week 3 against Robert Saleh and the Jets' top-five scoring defense (18.6 points per game allowed, fourth-best in NFL last season) will provide new offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien the opportunity to put a lot on his quarterback's plate against 2022 Defensive Rookie of the Year Sauce Gardner and 2022 First-Team All-Pro Quinnen Williams.  On the other side of the ball, Aaron Rodgers now being the one throwing to Garrett Wilson and handing off to Breece Hall presents a brand new calculus for head coach Bill Belichick and his defense that allowed a combined 20 points against New York's offense in their two meetings last season. Rodgers and Bill Belichick have split their four battles with Rodgers winning the last one in Week 4 in 2022, a 27-24 overtime victory for the Packers at Lambeau Field. Per CBS Sports' Tyler Sullivan, Rodgers has a completion percentage of 57% against Belichick's Patriots defenses, the second-lowest for Rodgers against any team in his Hall of Fame career. This game could mark the start of some regular, fun back-and-forth between two of the best at what they do in NFL history between Belichick and Rodgers.  New Orleans Saints  Most anticipated matchup: Week 12 at Atlanta Falcons  As mentioned earlier, the Saints and Falcons have one of the most petty rivalries in the entire NFL, constantly trading barbs back and forth over social media, and Week 12 serves as these rivals' first crack at each other in 2023.  The rivalry runs so deep that the same game is the most anticipated one on each team's schedule. We'll see if new Saints quarterback Derek Carr and new Falcons rookie running back Bijan Robinson can be difference-makers in the NFC South race.  New York Giants  Most anticipated matchup: Week 16 at Philadelphia Eagles (Christmas Day)  Week 16 is the first of two matchups between the Giants and Eagles, a team that stomped the G-Men in prime time 38-7 in the NFC divisional round last season. The Giants have improved their offense with the additions of center John Michael Schmitz, their second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, wide receiver Jalin Hyatt, the 2022 Biletnikoff Award winner who was their third-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and Pro Bowl tight end Darren Waller.  However the big question remains: can Daniel Jones be the guy to lift them past the Eagles to greater heights? The four-year, $160 million contract general manager Joe Schoen gave the quarterback this offseason means the Giants certainly think so. This game provides a nice opportunity to see how far New York has come in this regard.  New York Jets  Most anticipated matchup: Week 1 vs. Buffalo Bills (Monday Night Football)  Josh Allen BUF • QB • #17 CMP% 63.3 YDs 4283 TD 35 INT 14 YD/Att 7.55 View Profile  All season long in 2022, the Jets were left thinking: what would this team look like if we had a capable quarterback paired with our young offense and top-five scoring defense? Week 1 provides this answer in Aaron Rodgers' Jets debut on ""Monday Night Football"" against Josh Allen and the three-time defending AFC East champions.  After spending months salivating over the idea of Rodgers as a Jet, this game represents the immense joy Gang Green fans will feel when Rodgers runs out of the tunnel at MetLife Stadium in prime time as their starting quarterback. Going up against the class of their division right away will reveal how much time New York needs to come together on offense after importing not only Rodgers but also former Packers Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb plus former Kansas City Chief wideout Mecole Hardman. This game will be a night Jets fans will remember for years to come.  Philadelphia Eagles  Most anticipated matchup: Week 11 at Kansas City Chiefs (Monday Night Football)  Super Bowl LVII between Philadelphia and Kansas City was an instant classic as Patrick Mahomes' Chiefs did just enough to hold off NFL MVP runner-up Jalen Hurts' Eagles in a 38-35 nail-biter. A matchup of the league's top two MVP finishers from the previous season leading two of the best rosters in the NFL? It doesn't get much better than that, especially for an Eagles team thirsty for revenge.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 18 at Baltimore Ravens  Lamar Jackson BAL • QB • #8 CMP% 62.3 YDs 2242 TD 17 INT 7 YD/Att 6.88 View Profile  The Steelers were in the thick of the AFC playoff hunt until the very end last season in quarterback Kenny Pickett's rookie year, and given head coach Mike Tomlin's track record, there's no reason why that wouldn't be the case in 2023. The Steelers have patched up their biggest weakness, the offensive line, with the signing of former Eagles guard Isaac Seumalo and the first-round selection of Georgia offensive lineman Broderick Jones 14th overall.  Both Pickett and the Ravens' Lamar Jackson have improved supporting casts in 2023, so this battle for one of the AFC's seven playoff spots will be a thrilling way to close out the 2023 season.  San Francisco 49ers  Most anticipated matchup: Week 13 at Philadelphia Eagles  The 49ers have maintained all offseason that they would have toppled the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game last season if Brock Purdy didn't suffer a first-half elbow injury. Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk called Philadelphia ""extremely lucky"" and wide receiver Deebo Samuel guaranteed a different outcome if Purdy didn't get hurt. Fast forward to Week 13 of the 2023 season, the 49ers hopefully have the opportunity to back their claims up with health at the quarterback position. This game has likely been circled on everyone's calendars in the 49ers' franchise since the schedule was revealed. Another layer to this rivalry was added when San Francisco swiped former Eagles defensive tackle Javon Hargrave on a four-year, $84 million contract.  The amount of trash-talking and high-level play between the two 2022 NFC finalists will be a sight to behold.  Seattle Seahawks  Most anticipated matchup: Week 12 vs San Francisco 49ers (Thanksgiving Day)  The 49ers are the team standing in the Seahawks' way in terms of climbing up the NFC standings and making noise in the playoffs. Seattle dropped all three games against the 49ers last season including a deflating 41-23 season-ending defeat in the NFC wild-card round.  The Seahawks were able to stockpile some nice talent in the draft, coming away with Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon (fifth overall pick) and Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba (20th overall pick) in Round 1 while reinforcing their backfield behind Kenneth Walker III with UCLA's Zach Charbonnet (52nd overall pick) in Round 2. Defensively, they had enough cap space to get tougher up front with the signings of Broncos defensive end Dre'Mont Jones (three years, $51 million) and defensive tackle Jarran Reed (two years, $9 million) thanks to quarterback Geno Smith to a three-year, $75 million deal, well below the going rate for NFL starters at the position these days.  Week 12 marks their first matchup in a three-week span in 2023, and the prime-time showdown will reveal if the NFC West hierarchy is set to change in 2023.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 3 vs. Philadelphia Eagles (Monday Night Football)  The Buccaneers are a team primed to fall in Year 1 of Tom Brady's real retirement. They averaged 76.9 rushing yards per game in 2022, the fewest in the entire league, causing their one-dimensional offense to average 18.4 points per game (25th in the NFL). That was with Tom Brady at quarterback. In 2023, Tampa Bay enters with a quarterback competition between Baker Mayfield and 2021 second round pick Kyle Trask, who has played in one NFL game, and former Rams backup John Wolford. Top pass rusher Shaq Barrett is coming off a torn Achilles and may experience some rust in his return to football. The Buccaneers are a team primed to struggle after not having much cap room to add reinforcements in free agency.  However, when analyzing their schedule, Week 3 against the Eagles stands out as their marquee game. Monday Night Football in a rematch of the 2021 NFC wild-card round. That day the Buccaneers quickly dispatched of the run-heavy, pre-A.J. Brown Eagles 31-15. Now, the tables are turned with Brady retired, and the Eagles entering the game as NFC Champions. This game will interesting in that it could mark one of the last times Baker Mayfield enters a game as an NFL team's starting quarterback, should the 2023 season go south.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 18 vs. Jacksonville Jaguars  Titans head coach Mike Vrabel almost always has his team in contention for a spot in the playoffs with the exception of last year's cratering after injuries to their offensive line and quarterback Ryan Tannehill were too much to overcome. While their pass-catching group still leaves much to be desired, the Titans did a nice job patching up their offensive line after signing former Eagles first-round pick offensive tackle in free agency and selecting Northwestern offensive lineman Peter Skoronski 11th overall in the 2023 NFL Draft.  They also came away with a nice complementary runner alongside Derrick Henry in Tulane's Tyjae Spears, a third round pick. With a better offensive line, a healthier Tannehill, and a backfield with some depth, Tennessee could easily be in the playoff mix at the end of the year with the Colts and Texans starting over at quarterback. That makes this game between the last two AFC South champions one to highlight. Oh and on the off chance the Titans are out of it in Week 18, there's a good chance second-round pick Will Levis, who was once thought to be a top-five pick, will be getting some of his first NFL game reps.  Most anticipated matchup: Week 12 at Dallas Cowboys (Thanksgiving Day)  Dak Prescott DAL • QB • #4 CMP% 66.2 YDs 2860 TD 23 INT 15 YD/Att 7.26 View Profile  The Commanders split their two meetings with the Cowboys a year ago with each team winning by double-digits at home. Washington's 26-6 win in Week 18 was the solid NFL debut for 2022 fifth-round pick quarterback Sam Howell. He completed 11-of-19 passes for 169 yards, a touchdown and an interception.  The 2023 edition of the Commanders should be improved with former second-overall draft pick Chase Young shaking off the rust from a torn ACL, Howell having more experience, the shoring up of their secondary by selecting Mississippi State cornerback Emmanuel Forbes (first round) and Illinois cornerback Jartavius Martin (second round) with their first two draft picks, and the hiring of former Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy as their new OC and associate head coach. Their first matchup against the Cowboys, one of the NFC's top three teams from a year ago, will be telling about the direction the franchise is headed in Year 1 post-Daniel Snyder.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25mbC9uZXdzLzIwMjMtbmZsLXNjaGVkdWxlLWV2ZXJ5LXRlYW1zLW1vc3QtYW50aWNpcGF0ZWQtZ2FtZS1pbmNsdWRpbmctcGF0cmljay1tYWhvbWVzLXZzLXR5cmVlay1oaWxsLWluLWdlcm1hbnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Panthers coach Paul Maurice told WQAM in Miami he thought the center might return to Game 3 and is hopeful the injury isn't long term.  ""We don't think it's anything too sinister, so he'll come in and get worked on real hard today and worked on real hard tomorrow,"" Maurice said Tuesday. ""We'll have a better idea after we see him today where he's at, but I would say I'm more on the optimistic side right now.""  The Panthers have a 3-0 lead in the series and can advance to the Stanley Cup Final with a win in Game 4 on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, CBC, SN, TVAS).  Barkov did not play the final 7:04 of the first following a hip check from Hurricanes forward Jack Drury on his final shift. There was no update on his condition after the game.  ""He's at a Bar Mitzvah. Yeah, that's what we'll go with,"" Maurice said. ""Bar Mitzvah, and he didn't want to disappoint the kids.""  Barkov, who is Panthers captain, has 12 points (four goals, eight assists) in 15 games in the Stanley Cup Playoffs to help Florida reach the conference final for the first time since 1996. He had two goals and an assist in the first two games of this best-of-7 series, including a highlight-reel backhand goal in the second period of a 2-1 overtime victory in Game 2 on Saturday.  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  Barkov finished second in scoring for Florida during the regular season with 78 points (23 goals, 55 assists) in 68 games.

This game was a matchup not seen in the quarter-finals but would have been taped immediately following the first; it’s hard to make a prediction because there is definitely going to be some spillover momentum for James and Andrew from the first game of the episode.

"game","2023-05-20","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T07:00:00","I have a complicated relationship with mobile gaming. I get a little too obsessed with whatever I start playing, only to get bored of the game after a few days and never launch it again. But it seems that one Apple Arcade app has successfully broken the cycle with an action-adventure title that has kept me continuously engaged by merging two of my favorite things: Lego and Star Wars.  Lego Star Wars: Castaways from Gameloft first launched in 2021, but it only landed on my radar a couple of weeks ago. The game takes place on an island planet designed entirely of Lego bricks, where you and other online players can level up and explore, or participate in small side quests by request of the locals. Otherwise, you spend your time transporting your character to iconic Star Wars scenes to repair corrupted simulations.  These in-game missions have the feel of other Lego Star Wars games such as Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, which I play occasionally on my Nintendo Switch. You shoot at random objects to collect coins (called databits), take down enemies, and revive as many times as you need to proceed. In the starfighter simulations, you fly through battle scenes to destroy TIE fighters and blow up targets. My favorite, obviously, is the Death Star trench run.  Yet Castaways offers a fresh way to revisit hallmark moments from the movies. By placing battle droids on an Imperial ship, I get to enjoy a mixed-up Star Wars universe you can’t find in any other game. Fixing the corrupted simulations means there is something where it shouldn’t be in the timeline, and it’s up to you to make things right to preserve history.  (Image credit: Future)  Along the way, there are plenty of easter eggs and hidden corners in the island. Despite having little to do with the main mission, I often found myself building sand castles, racing micro-fighters, chatting with the locals, shaking Lego bricks out of palm trees and kicking back on the beach.  I often found myself building sand castles, racing micro-fighters, chatting with the locals, shaking Lego bricks out of palm trees and kicking back on the beach.  What’s more, in other Lego Star Wars games, you’re more or less supposed to play as iconic characters. In Castaways, you’re at liberty to create your own mini-figure. Using coins I collected in the simulation missions, I upgraded my character — Vera Vordoc — with new helmets, outfits and more.  After playing for a few weeks now (mostly on long commutes) I’ve grown to feel a sense of escape on the island, plus a sense of belonging as I’ve leveled up to access conversations with more of the locals. It’s a world I look forward to jumping back into, even if I only have time for one mission.  The controls on the large screen of my iPhone 14 Pro Max are manageable, though if I were to play on my iPad or Apple TV, I’d probably look to get a real gaming controller. Since this is an Apple Arcade game, I’m able to pick up wherever I’ve left off between all my connected Apple devices.  Lego Star Wars: Castaways is free to Apple Arcade subscribers ($5/month or $50/year), and is part of a library of more than 200 games that can be played on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV. In fact, 20 new games were recently added to Arcade , which is why I’ve been more eager to explore the membership-based gaming service. There are definitely some hidden gems like Castaways to enjoy, so if you haven’t taken advantage of the free month trial yet, there’s no better time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvdGhpcy1pcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWdhbWUteW91LW5lZWQtdG8tc3RhcnQtcGxheWluZy1lc3BlY2lhbGx5LWlmLXlvdS1sb3ZlLXN0YXItd2Fyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(0:23)  CLEVELAND -- Will Brennan only tried to hit the ball. What happened after that wasn't by design.  The rookie Cleveland Guardians outfielder hit a hard grounder that accidentally killed a bird wandering on the infield grass during the second inning of Monday night's 3-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox.  With none out and a runner at first base, Brennan, a left-handed hitter, went the other way with a 92.6 mph fastball from Chicago's Jesse Scholtens. The liner connected with a small bird that had wandered into a dangerous place.  The ball, clocked at 100.1 mph, sent the bird flying, and when Brennan got to first, he put his hands on his helmet and grimaced. Umpires called time, allowing a member of the grounds crew to remove the dead bird with a shovel.  Following the game, Brennan posted an apology on Twitter.  ""I truly am sorry @peta and bird enthusiasts,"" Brennan wrote. ""An unfortunate sacrifice.""  It's the second time in a week that a major league player has unintentionally killed a bird.  Last week, Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Zac Gallen unintentionally struck and killed a bird while warming up in the outfield before a game against the Oakland Athletics. Gallen threw a curveball that hit the bird in midflight.  Gallen's shot brought to mind Arizona Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson, who famously obliterated a bird that flew in front of the plate during one of the left-hander's fastballs in a 2001 spring training game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21sYi9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzExMDQ2L2d1YXJkaWFucy1icmVubmFuLWFjY2lkZW50YWxseS1raWxscy1iaXJkLWxpbmVy0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWxiL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc3MTEwNDYvZ3VhcmRpYW5zLWJyZW5uYW4tYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWtpbGxzLWJpcmQtbGluZXI_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Montreal"", ""Quebec"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-22T15:35:03","Indie sports titles rarely find success in the market, but this roguelite hockey game Tape to Tape is a welcome exception. Marketing expert Chris Zukowski has broken down how small studio Excellent Rectangle managed to find a perfect niche.  What makes Tape to Tape special?  Last week, Zukowski wrote a deep analysis of Tape To Tape on his How To Market A Game blog. The game came out in Early Access on May 3, and here are some key metrics as of May 14:  34,020 — units sold in the first eight days;  8% — share of returns;  $635,674 — gross revenue;  53,000 — number of wishlists at launch (another 58k were collected after launch);  41:1 — sales to review ratio;  91% — share of positive reviews (as of May 22).  Sports games are often considered a bad choice for indie devs for many reasons. The genre is dominated by big AAA franchises, plus smaller creators just don’t have the resources to acquire a license to official leagues or tournaments.  However, Excellent Rectangle decided to take the fast-paced “vertical” gameplay of NHL 94 and combine it with the complex mechanics of roguelike hits of recent years (see Slay the Spire). “NHL 94 struck the perfect gameplay balance which is so hard to achieve in a sports game,” Tape to Tape programmer Jean-Nicolas Fortin told Zukowski.  So the idea was to make a game that would be both fun, easy to learn and deep gameplay-wise. “The roguelike meta game adds deep systems that encourage long play sessions,” Zukowski explained, adding, “Canadians love hockey, people love Roguelikes, and Steam players love DEEP DEEP gameplay.”  Tape to Tape marketing  In Spring 2021, Excellent Rectangle started posting on Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok. The latter helped the team get a lot of playtesters. And almost all social media posts dedicated to the game are focused on gameplay and core mechanics.  In August 2021, the studio launched a Steam page, but the wishlist rate was low. So in February 2022, they participated in the 2022 Games From Quebec festival dedicated to local game developers. As Zukowski pointed out, it is a great idea to partner with Valve and organize such events if you “live in a region that has several games that have made over a million dollars.”  In May 2022, Excellent Rectangle successfully raised CA$ 46,711 on Kickstater, exceeding their initial goal of CA$20,000. It brought them over 7,000 wishlists.  The studio also kept making posts on Reddit, and some of them reached a non-hockey audience that was interested in the unusual concept of Tape to Tape.  In February 2023, the team took part in the Steam Next Fest, which earned them over 27,000 wishlists.  The spike in wishlist activity between February 18 and March 1 happened thanks to the Steam Next Fest  Popular streamer Northernlion also helped a lot, with his first let’s play video on Tape to Tape reaching over 280,000 views. In fact, he loved the game so much that he has already made six videos about it since launch.  Excellent Rectangle started paid ads in the two weeks leading up to the Early Access launch. But the return on them wasn’t great, so the most hype was created using a Next Fest, social media posts, and Northernlion support.  After the EA launch, Tape to Tape was invited to get the Steam Popup, a special feature that Valve offers for selected games. This is basically a free ad from the platform that shows your project to millions of users.  According to Zukowski, Valve picks titles for the popup by looking at their numbers, including the way wishlists convert into sales: “If your conversions are good (you make a bunch of money) and your reviews are good, Valve puts your game in the popup.”  More details, including information about the design of Tape To Tape demo and comments from its creators, can be found in the full post.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXdvcmxkb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvdGFwZS10by10YXBlLXJldmVudWUtbWFya2V0aW5nLXN0ZWFtLWhvY2tleS1nYW1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-02-03","Not Discerned","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T00:15:00","Over the weekend a small controversy erupted in board game circles when rumours began circulating that Quackalope, one of the scene’s more popular YouTube review channels, had supposedly ‘blackmailed’ the publisher of a game they had been covering over a series of videos.    Things blew up so quickly that the publisher in question, Into The Unknown, not only felt compelled to issue a statement, but included their correspondence with Quackalope’s Jesse Anderson in full along with it, just so everyone was in possession of the entire conversation.    Advertisement  The emails, which you can read below, detail a months-long negotiation between the two over Anderson’s proposed payment for a series of videos covering (read: promoting) Into The Unknown’s new game Aeon Trespass. Basically, Anderson tells Into The Unknown that he has already gone and recorded a ton of footage of the game, but has had trouble with the rules and would like to shoot new clips. With someone from Into The Unknown there to help. And be paid $7500 for it, or he’ll just release the old videos.  Besides the questionable approach taken by Anderson—it’s also strange they played so much without contacting the company first, and that a team of professionals struggled so much with the rules—the main thing the emails help illustrate is something even more worthy of discussion: the ease with which board game creators and publishers are able to shape coverage of their games, which is a widespread practice in the industry. I’m sorry in advance, there’s about to be a lot of text to get through here, but it’s important to see the correspondence in its entirety to fully understand what’s going on here, starting with an email from Quackalope’s Jesse Anderson:  From: Jesse Anderson  Advertisement  Sent: Thursday, January 19, 2023 8:23 AM Subject: ATO | Coverage Hey Marcin, We have recived and showcased Aeon Trespass: Odyssey on the channel earlier this month! We are thrilled to have it in hand and despretly want to dive into it!  Advertisement  We got 10k views and 750+ liikes on our Unboxing Video! I wanted to reach out to see if we could work together on some upcoming coverage. We have a growing team of 4 and it is very hard for us to dive into a full campaign game. Not only do we need to learn & play tens or hundreds of hours of content - we also have to film and produce content for the channel. With Oathsworn last year we were able to provide them with a wide range of content over a few months by establishing a contract for the first wave of media. This allowed myself and the team to learn, play through, and produce videos on the initial sessions. Following those contracts we continued to produce aditional media. Oathsworn was featured on many of our Top 10s of year simply due to us being able to spend time with it. I want to propose a similar agreement with your team.  Advertisement  I am requesting that you sponser the inital coverage of ATO so we can get into the game and give our/your community some highly produced gameplays. We would point our audince to your Pre-order page and let people know where to pick up ATO and KF! Outside of that we will produce supporting vidoes for your community (Rules, Strategy Guides, Top 10s & more). We would schedule a call with you to learn the rules and make sure we get everything accurate during our sessions. We noramly charge $2,500 per video. My proposal is a 5 video sponsorship at $1,500 each. Totaling $7,500 for a full run of media and marketing push. These videos can be Gameplays, Tips & Tricks, Strategy Guies, Previews (for a PM push) and more.  Advertisement  Let me know your thoughts. Looking forward to working with you. Best Jesse  Next is a reply two weeks later from Into the Unknown’s Marcin Wełnicki:  Fri, Feb 3, 2023 at 9:10 AM  Advertisement  Hey Jesse!  We were very happy to watch your unboxing of the game, and are excited by the prospect of working with you on some further coverage of Aeon Trespass: Odyssey. Apologies for the late reply, but we’ve been swept away by ATO’s success and plans for 2023 and beyond! I’m attaching Bartek, our PM, to this conversation. He will provide you with any further details and be in touch with you on behalf of ITU. $1,500 is still a bit steep compared to the market average, but nothing we couldn’t work with - at the end of the day it all depends on what the video is, how it’s put together and what the return in viewership is! We could do a ‘pilot’ and go from there!  Advertisement  However, I do have some questions though: 1. Do you have specific content/video subjects in mind? We’d suggest some discussions of the basic essentials to get to grips with the game, some coverage of ‘How to Survive the World of Aeon Trespass’, a discussion of the extra challenges certain Primordials pose, useful gear and Titan combinations, and so on. Any other ideas? Some fresh perspective? 2. Roughly, how long would the runtime be on each video? 3. How much post-process effects/editing do you imagine versus the more straight-up vlog style?  Advertisement  4. As this would be sponsored content, how does the authorization process work with you? We do have some specific guidelines for sponsored content. 5. How detailed are the feedback statistics of viewership you provide (referrals, outgoing traffic)? 6. Do you incorporate calls to action or page-linking (like visit their website at XXXX”) 7. What the turnaround on a video? 8. Can we schedule video drops for specific days etc?  Advertisement  I think this covers some of the basics! I’d much appreciate your thoughts on these!  Here is Jesse’s reply to that email:  Hey Marcin & Bartek, Thank you for getting back to us. I would love to have a conversation with you about all the specifics (this might be best done over zoom?). Long story short, we would love to work with you. However, we did invite a patreon member of ours down the studio for a enier week to film and play as much ATO as possible. We have put about 50 hours into learning, tabling and recording content at the moment.  Advertisement  However, our experience as a group was quite frustrating overall. We struggle with the rules, finding cards throughout the decks, and tracking all the moving parts of ATO. At the same time, we desperately wanted to play through the campaign- it seems like an amazing experience for someone who is solely focused on the title and not worried about filming videos where the community can pick apart any rules mistakes. One of the benefits of working with a publisher is having a direct line of communication/help with more complicated games. If we are able to move forward we would need one of two things. Either a designer/developer who is willing and able to oversee the gameplay videos (we have a private live stream system) that would allow us to get everything as accurate as possible. Or, we would love to extend an invite for you to come and film with us in Cleveland Ohio, for a week. If we are working in collaboration with you we would scrap the footage we have already recorded (since we want to be as accurate as possible). If we decide to work independently, we will likely not invest more time beyond the 50 hours of content and 8 videos we have recorded. Let me know your thoughts and if you want to set up a call.  Advertisement  1- We are open to ideas and content that would support the community. Rules, tips and tricks, gameplay, etc. 2-That depends on the video and what would work best for the channel. Rules videos should be as short as possible, Gameplay should be as long as the session requires, etc. 3- Our content would be fully edited like all of the produced content on our channel. 4- We can certainly go over the guidelines you have. Ultimately, we will try to follow them - with the context that it is our channel & audience without specifics.  Advertisement  . Hard to know 5- We don’t track data like click through links. We do have one of the biggest channels in the game industry with more engagement - especially around titles like ATO. Our audience is your marketplace. 6- We place a top link in the description and are happy to do a call to action. 7- We would want to get everything produced in the next month or so and then released over a few months. 8- We can plan specific days to post.  Advertisement  Looking forward to talking more! - Jesse  Marcin’s reply:  Hey Jesse! Thanks for getting back to us on a short notice!  Advertisement  I am very sorry you’re having a hard time learning the rules, up until now we have only heard positive player feedback from the Learn to Play learning experience, especially with the step by step Out of the Box guide we’ve put out. The game is getting stellar reviews:) We can of course support you by answering any rules questions, however we have no capacity to delegate anyone for an extended period of time (and ‘real time at that!), to say nothing of sending an employee half across the world to the US for a week!:) Thank you for the detailed answers, everything checks out! As for our guidelines, it’s basic stuff of paid content: the coverage should be strictly positive, there should be no direct or prolonged comparisons to other games (you kept coming back to KDM in the unboxing video, which would be a no-no) in favor of focusing on ATO and so on. Imagine, if you’ve struggled with the rules, a lot of the content you’ve already created could be unusable. Either way, we’d love to see what you had problems with, to both answer any questions and to create better games in the future, so if you can send the footage to us, even uncut, I could have someone watch it over the next few weeks! Or... if you feel re-recording content might be too time consuming, we might skip this ATO altogether and swiftly move towards the future! With the critical and commercial success of ATO, things have accelerated at ITU, and we’ve got several projects moving forward at the same time, including Twelve Sins of Herakles, a standalone AT game that takes what we did with ATO and streamlines and enhanced it even further. That’s coming sooner than anyone expects, and the limited demo content might be much more digestible to you than the enormous sprawl of ATO. It would be a chance for you to be there at ground zero too.  Advertisement  Beyond that we also have the shrouded in mystery V3... Let us pick your brain on this! Best, Marcin  Advertisement  Jesse’s reply:  Hey Marcin Can we get a meeting set up to discuss the logistics? I would be happy to collect a set of questions and bring someone back down to the studio to film a series of supporting media for you all at Into the Unknown. I am also very interested in your future content and would like to work closer with you & the team going forward. Since your games are so ambitious, I want to get everything as accurate as possible. If we establish a working relationship, we can edit and film within your guidelines. Not producing directly critical or review based media, not comparing your titles to others like KDM, etc.  Advertisement  I would certainly want at least one member of the team to observe a live session so we can double check any rules questions we might have while recording (this would take about 3-4 hours of a team member’s time). So here is my proposal. Let’s set up a meeting. Collaborate on some media coverage/supporting coverage for ATO. Then, let’s figure out a working relationship moving forward. This way we can produce media our audience wants, cover your games accurately, and help you continue to build a titan of a publishing house! Let me know your thoughts and a time that works for you to chat.  Advertisement  Now replying on March 31, 2023 is Into the Unknown’s Bartek Odorowicz:  Hello Jesse, Sorry for the late reply. We’ve been a bit decimated by flu and Marcin has now been away for a bit longer. I am writing on his behalf as we would like to get back to our conversation:) We would definitely be interested in at least one video, mostly dedicated to your impressions of playing the tutorial (described in the Learn to Play booklet) and at least a few more days of the campaign (we would recommend you to reach the day 7 of 80 days campaign). This should familiarise you with the most important mechanics of the game and show the multithreaded nature of the story (it is heavily scripted in the tutorial, so it’s worth continuing it to see how the story unfolds). We could support you with one staff member who could answer your questions or assist with one playthrough. It would be great to have such a video ready for the beginning of May. Do you have a space in your schedule for it? I think it would be no problem to agree on a price as well :)  Advertisement  If you would like to, we can also have a call next week. Best regards, Bartek  To which Jesse replies, saying that they’re just going to go and publish the pre-existing material anyway:  Advertisement  Hey Bartek, It is good to hear from you guys. I am sorry that the flu has gotten to you and that Marcin has been away. It has been a month and a half since I have heard from your team and our audience has been asking repeatedly for ATO content. Since I hadn’t heard back from you, I made the decision to start posting the ATO content I had already filmed. We have 4 gameplays, a KDM Vs ATO review, a confirmation bias review (one all positive/one all negative) and a few other smaller videos. I hope you enjoy the content and look forward to working together in the future. All the best,  Advertisement  Jesse  The final email released was sent on April 14, again by Bartek, who says:  Hello Jesse, Thanks for your answer. That is understandable. We had (and still have, actually) a very busy time (the campaign is coming!), which caused some communication delays. Of course we are open to cooperate on future projects.  Advertisement  Okay then, so we are waiting for your opinion on ATO :) Very curious about this! Best, Bartek  Accompanying the release of the emails was a statement released by Wełnicki, in which he summarises their discussions then wonders at the end what these kind of offers and relationship would mean for a smaller, more vulnerable games studio. It’s a long read, but it’s got a lot to talk about, since it covers not only the emails between the two parties but also how they relate to the wider board game creator economy as well:  Advertisement  Hello, this is Into the Unknown Studio. In response to the recent developments we have the following statement. First off, we’d like to say that everyone is entitled to their subjective opinion about a game, especially when it comes to consumer products. We do not censor content, and we do not argue with critics and reviews. We try to learn something from them, good or bad. We have no problem with Mr. Anderson’s opinion about ATO. Second, we also have no problem with the idea of sponsored ad content. We use Facebook/Meta and Reddit Ad tools regularly, we also collaborate with content creators on things like rules videos, summaries or playthroughs. January 19th this year, we were contacted by Mr. Jesse Anderson (Quackalope) with a proposition of creating paid content for us. Mr. Anderson suggested doing 5 videos for the total cost of $7500, saying it was discounted from $12500.  Advertisement  Though we were lukewarm on the prospect - especially with a price tag of $7500, which we did not feel was warranted - we asked for further details, clearly stating this would be considered by us as paid sponsored content, basically an ad. We also mentioned our reservations about the price. Two weeks later, on February 3rd, Mr. Anderson responded, answering our questions, but also mentioning that he has already purportedly put 50 hours into the game, and produced content for it, finding the game ‘quite frustrating’, struggling with rules, finding cards, tracking things. He suggested we should either get a developer to live stream with him or send one to Ohio, US, to oversee the material over the course of a week. In such a case, Mr. Anderson assured, they “would scrap the footage we have already recorded”. He also warned, that, if “we decide to work independently, we will likely not invest more time beyond the 50 hours of content and 8 videos we have recorded.” This really changed the tone of the conversation for us. At this point we really didn’t want to go into any collaboration with Mr. Anderson. However, at this point we felt pushed to a wall. ‘Quackalope’ was the biggest boardgaming channel with a lot of sway. Their coverage of our previous campaign had a noticeable impact on our KS result. We thought about how to get out of this situation. Few days later, we’ve sent another e-mail, delineating rules for paid content, lamenting that Mr. Anderson found the game frustrating, asking for more details on what he found wrong with the game, as well as wanting to see the raw footage that Mr. Anderson had shot. We also proposed forgoing ATO coverage whatsoever (I had a hard time imagining the cooperation, seeing his disdain for the game) and moving to TSOH, which was being designed with critical feedback in mind - more streamlined, player- friendly, with less overhead, all the things Mr. Anderson quoted as being frustrating. A week later, Mr. Anderson sent us an e-mail, but failed to respond to most of our questions or suggestion: he did not provide any raw footage nor gameplay notes, doubling down on reshooting the ATO material.  Advertisement  At this point, we broke off communication, hoping this would go away. At the end of March, our Development Project Manager reached out for a possible first impressions video of the Learn to Play. Mr. Anderson responded, saying it was too late, and that he would proceed with the original footage -including some gameplay, a positive video, a negative video, a KDM vs ATO and some more. There was nothing to add at this point, so we thanked Mr. Anderson and finalized our communications. In the days before the campaign, Mr. Anderson released videos which we assume are those mentioned as recorded before. Each of those videos mentions he reached out to us for sponsorship, but got no answer. At the end of this week, he released two additional videos, one supposedly praising the game, the other calling it ‘the most unplayable game he has ever played’. In that second video, Mr. Anderson openly talks to us, the developer of the game, again offering his services to consult on game design. On Friday, I’ve made an offhand comment about the subject. None of this is something I would normally mention, we even posted Mr. Anderson’s coverage among the others, in our Update, unprompted. However, seeing repeated comments from our backers, I could not shrug off the feeling that if we were in a different position, less known, without a game on the market to defend itself, basically your first time KS creators, this would have had a dramatic impact on our company, games and employees. Sincerely,  Advertisement  Marcin Wełnicki CEO at Into the Unknown Studio  Anderson has also issued a statement, and adds he will address the situation in full during a stream on June 12:  Hello, Jesse here.  Advertisement  As some of you know I am out of the country at the moment (in Israel studying in a Yeshiva). I just got back online from Shabbat and I am doing my best to engage / respond with the limited equipment I have on hand (One IPad). I fly home in a week and Shira and I get married in a week and half. TLDR: We did not and have never asked a publisher to pay us in order to prevent the channel posting critical or negative content. I will do a Live stream the week of JUNE 12th, once I am back in Cleveland, hanging out and answering any questions the community has. We certainly work with publishers. We have made no attempt to hide this, we cover a range of new games, kickstarter projects, inid titles, and old classics. This takes time-in some situations we charge for our time, never our opinion. To the best of our ability we label, link, and verababy declare any and all relationships we have with publishers when we cover their projects. From just being friendly or receiving a game for free all the way to paid or sponsored content. We have addressed this in the past and we are always reviewing our approach. We will continue to do so. I reached out to into the Unknown after filming my unboxing and before filming any of the content we have posted. I reached out asking if they were interested in working with us leading up to the next campaign. I offered a package of videos 5+ and requested rules guidance and support. They did not respond for over a month. My goal in reaching out was to secure the resources needed to allow us to dive into ATO fully. My suggestion was a series of highly produced gameplay videos and supporting content (how to play, rules clarifications, strategy guides) all with the publisher’s guide and support. No review content. I indicated that we hoped we would enjoy the game and keep covering it in future videos for free.  Advertisement  Over that month we invited an independent fan to come learn, teach, and play the game. We wanted to play ATO, the community was asking for coverage, and so we figured out how to make that happen. We spent over a week producing these videos. A few weeks after filming content, ATO reached out indicating they were interested in working with us. They had some stipulations (All coverage needed to be positive, no sponsored coverage could compare ATO to another game such as KDM, and we needed to get rules correct, however they would be unable to provide in-depth rules guidence or support.) We emailed back and forth a few times. I explained that we had already filmed a series of videos and struggled with the rules and gameplay. We wanted to love ATO and clarified that if we played or filmed anything more we would need their help getting everything accurate. They were not available to help us beyond emailing back and forth. Into the Unknown offered to work with us on future upcoming projects and were willing to do at least one video on ATO. After considering the opportunity to build a relationship with a growing publisher in the space and the risk of missing out on future coverage-we declined this offer and let them know we had edited and were going to post our collection of previously recorded videos. In this last email I told them that these videos included the 4 gameplays, 2 reviews, and a direct KDM comparison video. All of these videos were filmed before having any back and forth communication with Into the Unknown. Into the Unknown was not asked to pay us to keep these videos from going public.  Advertisement  Into the Unknown was never shown these videos prior to them being posted. Into the Unknown was invited to collaborate with us so we could bring as much accurate coverage to the channel as possible-not so that we give them a positive review. I will be doing a public live stream the week of June 12th (once I am home). I am happy to engage and answer any questions then. We do our absolute best to provide entertaining, informed, and honest coverage. We will keep doing this. - Jesse  Advertisement  Like I said, I don’t see anything specifically incriminating here, even if the circumstances surrouding this conversation in particular are extreme (which is why they’ve been released for everyone to see). What I do see, however, is even more interesting: not just the finer details of sponsored content, like prices (which in this case appears higher than usual) and scope, but the fact that everyone is just so open and cool with it.  Let’s be clear: there is no way to remain objective about a game if you’re being paid by the people who make it. You can try and say that you are—like Anderson does here, when he says “we charge for our time, never our opinion”—but you’re entirely compromised the second you accept that money, as Anderson also says when he writes “Our audience is your marketplace”. If you’re covering a game and getting directly paid for it, you’re not “creating content”, you’re making an ad. Even if it’s just an unboxing or a playthrough, that’s an ad.  So are ALL board game creators doing this? Absolutely not! Many are, including some big names, but I don’t want to derail this post by specifically listing them, nor do I want to say that every board game video you see on YouTube is paid for. There are loads of truly independent and talented creators out there, and this Reddit post does a good job of listing most of the bigger ones.  My problem here isn’t that this proposed arrangement is somehow revelatory. This is common practice in board games media, and has been widely known, even by fans, for some time. My issue here, and what I think is worth talking about given the publication of such precise dollar values and pitches, is the question of who, exactly, does this kind of content serve? What are viewers and fans actually getting out of something like this?    Advertisement  I get that board games and video games aren’t like-for-like industries, let alone mediums, and so my frustrations here might just come from the fact I’m one of the few people who work astride both. Another problem might be that content creators more interested in hype and community are just a part of the critical landscape of video game coverage, whereas when it comes to board games they’re overwhelmingly the most popular and prominent voices (with some rare exceptions, like the excellent Dicebreaker and community behemoth BGG).  This sucks! I think board games, and their players, deserve better! Crews like Shut Up & Sit Down, who are mostly funded by their Patreon , should be the rule, not the exception. I don’t buy arguments like “well who else is going to pay us if not publishers”—the most common defence in these situations, since popular board game channels number in the tens of thousands of subscribers, not millions—I think anyone who is passing any kind of supposedly independent coverage onto an audience has a responsibility to be doing so without it being labelled advertorial.  That doesn’t even need to extend to reviews, because if you start accepting money directly from publishers, how is your audience supposed to know where the buck quite literally stops? Even if a channel is clearly marking which content is directly sponsored and which isn’t, if they’re in the practice of taking money directly from—and even working alongside—board game publishers, then they are compromised, no matter how nice and honest their videos may be.    And they are nice, and that’s what perhaps sucks the most about this! I know board game YouTubers, I watch board game YouTubers, and they are almost to a fault some of the sweetest, most likeable people on the platform. There is nothing malicious in their actions, nobody is actively trying to deceive anyone, the vast majority of channels are doing what they love and doing things by the book.  Advertisement  But that doesn’t change the end result. Years of coziness between publishers and the people filming their games has resulted in a community where the lines between advertising and coverage have become so blurred that email exchanges like the one above can take place, include the words “the coverage should be strictly positive” and nobody thought it was a bad idea putting that out in the public record.  Board games are, despite some recent setbacks, a booming industry with a bright future. And as the medium expands and matures, its audience deserve more coverage that respects that.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va290YWt1LmNvbS9ib2FyZC1nYW1lLXNwb25zb3JlZC1jb250ZW50LWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LXlvdXR1YmUtc3RyZWFtLTE4NTA0NTk4NjnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2019-07-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T17:07:44","The video game console wars is a never-ending topic that sees fans of Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo debate endlessly about why their favorite piece of hardware is better than others. Not to mention how much more detailed the debate becomes when PC fans enter the discussion.  But, what makes a console truly the best? Is it technology? Is it sales? Is it a lifecycle? Well, sales and technology are always changing, and lifecycle is usually determined by when a developer wants to stop publishing releases on that platform. Still, all three are viable and arguably the top three criteria when it comes to determining the best of the best alongside keeping things in context.  What does a chatbot like ChatGPT think though? Does it lean one way and prefer an Xbox over an iteration of the PlayStation? Or perhaps ChatGPT loves the handheld capability of the Nintendo Switch?  We asked ChatGPT: what is the best video game console of all time based on the aforementioned criteria. Also, keep in mind the chatbot will remind users that it doesn’t possess personal opinions or preferences. Here’s what it had to say:  “Based on the criteria… the PlayStation 2 (PS2) is often considered one of the best video game consoles of all time. Here’s why: Technology: The PS2, released in 2000, was a significant technological advancement at the time. It featured a powerful processor, DVD playback capability, and the ability to render highly detailed 3D graphics. The console introduced innovations like the DualShock 2 controller, which added analog buttons and improved vibration feedback.  Sales: The PS2 remains the best-selling video game console of all time, with over 155 million units sold worldwide. Its popularity was fueled by a diverse library of games, multimedia capabilities, and its backward compatibility with the original PlayStation games, making it an attractive option for a wide range of gamers.  Longevity: The PS2 enjoyed an exceptionally long life cycle, spanning over a decade. It continued to receive support from game developers and publishers long after its successors, the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, were released. This extended lifespan allowed the console to accumulate an extensive library of games and cement its position in gaming history.  AI Selects the Best Video Game Console of All Time  Obviously, technology has far surpassed the PS2, but sales and longevity are hard to top. To this day, no other console has yet to match the numbers the PS2 did. Not to mention, developers just kept releasing versions of games on the PS2 long after successors had been released. Such is the case still for PS4 and Xbox One platforms, but not to the level the PS2 received releases.  The PS2 was such a dominant force during its era. The exclusives it had, one could argue, were unmatched across any era:  God of War Series  Shadow of the Colossus  Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty  Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater  Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec  ICO  Those are just a few of the titles that helped define what ChatGPT considers to be the best video game console of all time. You might not agree with it, but that’s what the chatbot has determined. Time to take the video game console wars to new battlegrounds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwdHJpZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9hc2tlZC1haS1iZXN0LXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtY29uc29sZS10aW1lLWFuc3dlci1zaG91bGRudC1zdXJwcmlzZS1hbnlvbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T04:57:00","Despite the Lakers' best efforts and all the competitive juices they could muster, the Denver Nuggets again made more critical plays down the stretch to win Game 4 113-111 and end the Lakers season in the Western Conference Finals.  While the Nuggets are deserved victors and had multiple strong performances to push them over the top, the Lakers, who inserted Dennis Schröder and Rui Hachimura into the starting lineup for this last stand of a game, battled hard all night and put themselves in a strong position to extend this series and send things back to Denver.  Lebron James set the tone early for L.A., attacking the paint with determined post ups while also locking in on his jumper, scoring effectively inside and from behind the arc. Considering the heights he has been able to reach this season, it feels strange to call this a throwback performance from James, but he was able to access a level he’s rarely had to go to these playoffs and it was a sight to see.  LeBron would score 31 of his 40 points in the first half, with Denver having few answers for the level of force he played with when getting downhill and his ability to create shots and score through contact. LeBron would also finish the night with 10 rebounds and nine assists, barely missing a triple-double in what was truly a special performance in which he played nearly the entire 48 minutes after only sitting out the final four seconds of the first half.  The sheer number of minutes LeBron played, combined with level of effort and energy he gave partially explains the overall flow of his performance and the general challenges he faced to create the same quality looks as the game wore on. This was especially true down the stretch where, as the 4th quarter wound down on the team's final two possessions, the Lakers twice put the ball in LeBron's hands with opportunities to tie the game as the shot and then game clock were under five seconds, but both times he was unable to get a clean look off, leaving the Nuggets victorious.  Of course, LeBron was not alone in showing that level of competitive edge and desire to push the series forward. Austin Reaves played another strong floor game, hitting six of his 11 shots from the floor to score 17 points to go along with two rebounds and three assists. Much like LeBron, Austin attacked downhill and tested the Nuggets' defensive paint both in isolation and working the pick-and-roll to try to create good offense in his nearly 41 minutes of action.  Beyond LeBron and Reaves, Anthony Davis had a mostly strong night with what was also an uneven offensive performance. AD scored 21 points, but did so on 6-15 shooting, never truly cracking the code on a Nuggets defense intent on playing off him and trying to disrupt his shot in the paint with quick reach ins and smart challenges once AD showed the ball. Davis had particular trouble finding his range in the 3rd quarter, which doubled as the time when the Nuggets fought back and turned their 15 point halftime deficit into a five point lead heading into the 4th quarter.  In that final frame, however, AD did his best to help keep the Lakers attached and in position to win, scoring 10 points while going perfect from the field (3-3) and the foul line (4-4) while grabbing three of his 14 rebounds and blocking one of his three shots in the 4th quarter.  Ultimately, though, it just was not enough. Denver proved themselves the better team with the duo of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray carrying them when they needed it most, but also getting at least one excellent role-player performance to put them over the top. This game that game came from Aaron Gordon, who scored 22 points to go along with six rebounds and five assists while shooting 9-14 from the field (and 3-5 on three pointers).  Add this to the typically stellar play of Jokic, who had another triple-double with 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists, and Murray (25 points on 10-18 shooting), and the Nuggets were simply too strong, too together, and too diversified a team where every player showed capable of filling their respective role at the highest level. Which is why they are moving on as a deserved NBA Finals team.  And so, the Lakers season has come to an end, but they have nothing to hang their heads over. The team that started 2-10 on the season, dealt with injuries to their superstars that cost them huge chunks of the season, and remade their roster at the trade deadline, came together in the final stretch of the regular season to finish 43-39, get into the playoffs as a 7th seed after winning a play-in game, and then advance to the Western Conference Finals.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbGFrZXJzL25ld3MvZ2FtZS00LWxvc3MtZW5kcy1sYWtlcnMtc2Vhc29uLXNlbmRzLW51Z2dldHMtdG8tdGhlLWZpbmFscy0wNS0yMi0yM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sometimes they’re small, squashing a few last-minute bugs, but other times, they’re massive and nigh essential to enjoying the adventure before you.  However, Day One patches draw criticism from players excited to jump into the action, only to be left watching a download bar fill up. Some players with slower internet or limited access might be left waiting for hours, if not days, depending on download speeds. During my Final Fantasy XVI cover story trip, I asked the team about its March accomplishment of going gold and what the team was working on now.  To my surprise, developer Creative Business Unit III isn’t working on a day one patch, a revelation that continues to become rarer with each new release in games. Director Hiroshi Takai gave me a few reasons as to why.  Final Fantasy XVI Director Hiroshi Takai Final Fantasy XVI Director Hiroshi Takai  The first is that the team is confident in its final build of Final Fantasy XVI. The second is that he and producer Naoki Yoshida (and the rest of the CBUIII team) believe the game should be ready to go at launch, recognizing that not everyone has access to the internet needed to download a day one patch in light of Final Fantasy XVI’s global simultaneous release. So as of right now, we won’t be downloading a big patch on June 22 when the game hits PlayStation 5.  However, Takai notes that CBUIII is testing the game daily and searching for bugs, and things could change as a result, but right now, like in the days of old Final Fantasy, this entry should work entirely as expected out of the box.

The resolution passed with approval votes from 24 owners, the minimum required to enact a new rule, and will be in effect on a trial basis for the 2023 season only. If no Thursday night games are flexed, the resolution will carry over to the 2024 season.  An earlier version of the proposal was tabled at the league meetings in March with strong opposition from New York Giants owner John Mara, who called it ""abusive"" to fans whose schedules would be disrupted.  The resolution will allow the league to flip a Sunday afternoon game into Thursday night and move the originally scheduled game to Sunday afternoon during Weeks 13 through 17. The NFL must file notice no later than 28 days before the game, an increase of nearly two weeks from the earlier proposal. No team will be required to flex to a Thursday night game more than one time, and the maximum number of Thursday night games will remain two per team.  The NFL said the Thursday night flex option can be applied no more than two times during the season.  The games scheduled for Thursday night in Weeks 13-17 are:  The NFL now has flex options for all of its prime-time games, having previously added a flex option for a window of ""Monday Night Football"" games this season. It has had the authority to flex ""Sunday Night Football"" games since 2006.  Hans Schroeder, the NFL's executive vice president and chief operating officer of NFL Media, noted that the league has averaged 1.8 flexed games per season on its Sunday night programming over that span. Brian Rolapp, chief media and business officer, said that Thursday night flexes are ""not something we expect to be commonplace.""  Mara said in March that the league needed to prioritize fans who buy tickets to games and could face significant changes to travel plans if a Thursday game was flipped to Sunday or vice versa.  Mara, asked Monday about the flex proposal passing, said, ""I stand by my comments in March. I still feel the same way.""  Those who supported the resolution have noted that the NFL also has a responsibility to prioritize fans who watch games only on television.  ""This should show our fans and the media industry that we'll do everything we can to make streaming on Thursday nights successful,"" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said.  Mara was one of eight owners who voted against the resolution despite the increase of required notice from 15 to 28 days. Other teams that voted against the resolution, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter, were the Jets, Green Bay Packers, Chicago Bears, Raiders, Detroit Lions, Cincinnati Bengals and Steelers.  ""We're going to have an even higher bar for Monday night and an even higher bar for Thursday night about the type of game we think would merit real consideration for flexing,"" Schroeder said.

According to unnamed sources speaking to Kotaku, the Star Wars title is the unspecified ""large game"" that Ubisoft recently disclosed would be released during the company's current fiscal year that ends on March 31, 2024.  It is one of several games set for release during that period, the others being Assassin's Creed Mirage, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Rainbow Six Mobile, Skull and Bones, The Crew Motorfest, The Division Resurgence, and XDefiant.  Ubisoft's Star Wars game is reportedly in development under the codename Project Helix. Julian Gerighty, the director on The Division and The Division 2, is the creative director.  According to Kotaku, Ubisoft's Star Wars game will feature ""some form of interplanetary space travel"" and that ""hopes are high internally"" that it could become Ubisoft's first non-Assassin's Creed hit game in a while. The same sources said a release during the current fiscal year is ""probably too ambitious"" and that it will actually launch in the following fiscal year (April 1, 2024 - March 31, 2025).  A spokesperson for Ubisoft told GameSpot, ""We don't comment on rumors or speculation.""  Ubisoft has faced some tough financial times of late. The company recently announced that it is trying to find $200 million in cost savings over the next couple of years through canceling games and layoffs, among other initiatives.  Ubisoft presumably has plenty of games in the works that could be considered ""large,"" so if it's not Star Wars, it could be something else. In any event, Ubisoft management said on an earnings call that it will have more news to share about its upcoming release slate during Ubisoft Forward in June.  Gerighty previously said that 2023 will be a ""huge year"" for the team, but this doesn't necessarily mean the game is going to launch this year.  Ubisoft's new Star Wars game is a ""story-driven, open-world experience within the Star Wars galaxy that will also utilize the studio's cutting-edge technology and advancements, including the Snowdrop engine,"" according to the publisher. No other details have been announced, but again, the game could be shown during Ubisoft Forward on June 12.  In other Ubisoft news, the company recently announced plans to ramp up its Assassin's Creed development team sizes, from 2,000 to about 2,800 in the coming years.  Ubisoft's Star Wars game is not the only new Star Wars game in development. Disney reportedly wants two Star Wars games per year, and some of the other games in the works now include Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream and a Star Wars FPS from Respawn.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy91Ymlzb2Z0cy1vcGVuLXdvcmxkLXN0YXItd2Fycy1nYW1lLWNvdWxkLWxhdW5jaC1pbi0yMDI0LXJlcG9ydC1zYXlzLzExMDAtNjUxNDQzNi_SAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1lc3BvdC5jb20vYW1wLWFydGljbGVzL3ViaXNvZnRzLW9wZW4td29ybGQtc3Rhci13YXJzLWdhbWUtY291bGQtbGF1bmNoLWluLTIwMjQtcmVwb3J0LXNheXMvMTEwMC02NTE0NDM2Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WTVD) -- The Carolina Hurricanes lost 1-0 in a vitally important Game 3 of the NHL Eastern Conference Finals.  This loss puts the Canes in an extremely dire situation in the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs. The team must now win four games in a row, or else the season is over.  Panthers Goalie Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 32 shots for his first career playoff shutout, Sam Reinhart scored a power-play goal midway through the second period and the Florida Panthers moved one win away from a most improbable trip to the Stanley Cup Final.  Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Bennett had the assists on the Reinhart goal for Florida, which now leads the Eastern Conference final 3-0. The Panthers haven't played for the Stanley Cup since 1996, but can clinch a trip to the title round with a win in Game 4 on Wednesday.  This marks the 205th time that a team has taken a 3-0 series lead in NHL playoff history. Of the first 204, 200 went on to win the series. The Panthers are 2-0 when taking the first three games of a series; the Hurricanes are 0-5 when dropping the first three.  It wasn't a perfect night for Florida, however: Captain Aleksander Barkov left with about 7 minutes left in the first period with a lower-body injury and did not return, even though the team listed him as questionable.  Bobrovsky got the shutout in his 58th playoff start. He is now 10-1 in his last 11 appearances and has been almost perfect in the last eight games.  Going back to Game 1 of Round 2 against Toronto, Bobrovsky has not allowed more than two goals in any contest, with 296 saves on 309 shots.  Frederik Andersen stopped 16 shots for Carolina. The Hurricanes pulled him with 3:22 left, desperate for the tying goal, barely even managed to test Bobrovsky the rest of the way.  It was the first East final game in the Panthers' current arena - the franchise's only other time going this deep into the playoffs was 1996, when it played in Miami at a building that was demolished long ago.  It also likely was the first time that they played with the Wanamaker Trophy in attendance. Newly crowned PGA champion Brooks Koepka - a South Florida native and Panthers fan - put on a jersey and brought the big silver cup to the game.  The crowd roared when they saw him displaying the trophy he won Sunday. Of course, there is another silver trophy that Panthers fans would prefer seeing someone in their jersey hoisting before too long. And the eighth-seeded Panthers are only five wins away now, tantalizingly close to the trip to the final - a trip that few could have seen coming after barely making the playoffs and then having to get past a record-setting Boston team in Round 1 and Toronto in Round 2.  A pair of overtime wins in Carolina, with Tkachuk getting the winner both nights, and the win Monday now have Florida on the brink of June hockey.

"game","2023-05-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:21:46","You shower before, and then head into the water, where you paddle out and wait. There is a skill to reading the waves and finding the right one, and there is much floating involved in the process. When the water finally unfurls, you get your board moving in the right direction, get yourself on your feet, and find a way to catch the shape of water and take your run.  It's an intriguing sport. There is immense preparation, it seems, and dedication to the craft. First, you have to get the board to the beach and get it prepared. Most bring it in a truck or SUV, but there are some who have a rack on their bike and simply roll up like that. Then, there is the wetsuit, a medieval creation that seems impossible to get in and out of.  We were in California for my daughter's graduation over the weekend (Hi, Meredith) and we spent a few mornings watching the surfers.  The Stars have put in so much work to be ready for a shining moment or two. They have had to embrace the details of preparation that come with almost 100 games played this year. They have been diligent in getting themselves into the right position. And they have had to perform when the ""wave"" comes. You're not always sure when that moment will arrive, so each player has been challenged to rely on their experience and their gut.  If you do it the right way, you could be a hero forever. If you read it wrong, or your hands don't do what your mind tells them, then it could be a painful memory for years to come.  Game 2 was a frustrating day at the beach. The Stars did so many things right. They did the work, got the board into the water, and seemed all set to pull off the most gnarly ride possible. Not unlike in Game 6 vs. Minnesota or Game 7 vs. Seattle, the Stars were playing their best hockey. They were so detailed, so smart, so efficient. They had taken the energy out of the Golden Knights and seemed prepared to even the series at 1-1. That would have been huge, because the Stars would have then had a best-of-five series with three games at home, and a ton of momentum to go with it.  Let's just say the tide would have been perfect.  But in just a couple of shifts, the team wiped out. They read the situation wrong . . . or their hands and feet didn't do what they were told to do . . . or they just lost their poise.  It happens, especially at this time of year.  With the Stanley Cup Playoffs down to four teams, the level of play has increased. Vegas is better than Seattle, just as Seattle was better than Minnesota. It means the Stars have to be better. That didn't happen in Game 1, and Dallas still pushed the game to overtime. It didn't happen for the Golden Knights in Game 2, but they found a way to win it late.  But there are many good lessons from these two games for Dallas. You don't have to be perfect. There is an art to this battle of skills, where timing is everything and you can take advantage of a good opportunity. It's when the surfer reads the water right, jumps on their board and allows their experience and preparation to take over.  When you look at the 15 games played so far, there have been a ton of good rides. Jason Robertson, Esa Lindell, and Jake Oettinger have all been challenged and each bounced back. And now it's time for Ryan Suter to do the same.  The 38-year-old defenseman has been very good in this postseason. For all the critics out there, Suter has been a big part of the success for the 2022-23 Stars. He is second on the team in time on ice, eighth in SAT (shot attempts at even strength when a player is on the ice), third in blocked shots, and fifth in hits. Suter has been a steadying force for a group of defensemen who have had their ups and downs.  So now he needs to get back to doing that.  The coaches believe he can. It's one of the reasons they play him so much and in so many key situations. His teammates believe in him and the guess is he believes in himself too. You don't get to almost 1,500 NHL games without some sort of athletic confidence or inner fire.  But the last four or five minutes of Game 2 really made things difficult for the Stars. There is a real ""must-win"" feeling to these next two games at American Airlines Center. If Dallas gets down 3-0 or even 3-1 in the series, the odds say it will be difficult to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. But if they hold service on home ice, it will create a whole new series.  And honestly, that's not a huge ask for this team. They have done it before, winning three straight against Minnesota and putting together consecutive wins against Seattle.  Now, they must reset and do it again.  ""It's not unfamiliar territory for us,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said on Monday. ""We've faced a lot of things, including straight out elimination, so I don't think we're overwhelmed by the situation. I think there's some really good building blocks in the last game that we have to take and put in place. You've just got to grind out one win and then the series looks different.""  And since you never know when the next big wave is going to come, you have to at least get out there and be ready for it.

"game","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:25:00","Sam Reinhart takes a Matthew Tkachuk pass and ramps it up and over the goalie to put the Panthers up 1-0. (0:57)  SUNRISE, Fla. -- The Carolina Hurricanes are on the ropes after dropping Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Florida Panthers 1-0 on Monday.  A sensational 32-save performance from Panthers goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky -- in the first postseason shutout of his career -- did most of the damage in Carolina's loss, which put the Hurricanes in a 3-0 hole. Still, the defeat didn't come without some controversy.  The Hurricanes trailed 1-0 late in the third period when forward Sam Reinhart -- who scored the game's only goal on a second-period power play -- appeared to high stick Carolina defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere in the face. That was right before Panthers defenseman Marc Staal put a puck in Carolina's empty net that would have given the Panthers a 2-0 lead with less than two minutes remaining in regulation.  Upon review, it was judged that a whistle blew before Staal's shot entered the net, but there was no penalty assessed on Reinhart for the play on Gostisbehere. Play continued, and Carolina ultimately recorded its third straight loss.  Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said after the game he wasn't thrilled with the lack of a call going in Carolina's favor.  ""It's tough for me. I could go on all day on that,"" he said. ""We got [called for] three knickknack penalties on sticks to the hand. ... Especially when they stop the play [after Gostisbehere was hit]. I don't understand that. You stop it because you saw a high stick. Why are you stopping the play then? I don't know. No explanation, just move on.""  That's all the Hurricanes can do. Brind'Amour lamented that Carolina didn't convert its lone power play of the game, and its general struggles scoring on Bobrovsky in the series. Through three games, Hurricanes forwards have failed to produce one even-strength goal, and Carolina has been outscored 6-3.  ""How are you not frustrated?"" Brind'Amour said. ""There's times when you lose and you're frustrated because you got beat, but if feels like we're losing but we're not really getting beat, and that's where it gets frustrating.""  Florida has now won 10 of its past 11 playoff games and can advance to the franchise's first Stanley Cup Final since 1996 with a win over Carolina in Game 4 on Wednesday.  The Panthers came through with Monday's victory despite being short-handed. Captain Aleksander Barkov left with 7:04 to play in the first period after what looked like an innocuous hip check from Hurricanes forward Jack Drury. He was ruled questionable to return with a lower-body injury.  Florida coach Paul Maurice provided no update on Barkov's status after the game.  Losing Barkov would pose a challenge. The team's top center had four goals and 12 points in 14 postseason tilts before Game 3. The All-Star is also one of the Panthers' best faceoff forwards. He had two goals and an assist in the first two games against Carolina.  In Barkov's absence, Eetu Luostarinen moved up to center Florida's top line. The Panthers had trouble generating much offense in the second and third periods, putting only 17 shots total -- and seven through the final 40 minutes -- on Carolina netminder Frederik Andersen and going 1-for-4 on their power-play chances.  If Bobrovsky continues to stone Carolina the way he has, though, it might not matter how the Panthers line up offensively. Bobrovsky has a .978 save percentage in the series thus far, and it will take a full team effort from Carolina in Game 4 on Wednesday to stay alive and take the matchup back to the Canes' home ice.  ""It's been three games,"" Brind'Amour said. ""You can't do much more. We like how we're playing, clearly. It's just we've got to find a way to put one in.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzExMjg1L2ZydXN0cmF0ZWQtaHVycmljYW5lcy1sYW1lbnQtbWlzc2VkLWNhbGxzLWdhbWUtMy1sb3Nz0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmhsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc3MTEyODUvZnJ1c3RyYXRlZC1odXJyaWNhbmVzLWxhbWVudC1taXNzZWQtY2FsbHMtZ2FtZS0zLWxvc3M_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:05:59","Finally, another Star Trek video game has beamed down. While we’re always busy with Star Trek Online, we’ve finally got a new narrative adventure game. Star Trek: Resurgence launches this week. It immerses players into the Star Trek universe with shuttle piloting, phaser fights, tricorder scanning, stealth, and more. However, how does the game hold up? Our Star Trek: Resurgence Review dives into the gameplay and story of this brand-new game.  This is a SPOILER-FREE Star Trek: Resurgence Review. Dramatic Labs developed Star Trek: Resurgence, a narrative adventure game featuring dialogue choices, relationship building, and exploration. The game excels at putting players into the Star Trek universe, very close to the end of Star Trek: The Next Generation’s storyline. Releasing on May 23rs, 2023, the game is available on PC via Epic Games, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S.  The Story of Star Trek: Resurgence  You expect the story to be good since Star Trek: Resurgence is a narrative adventure game. Thankfully, the storyline of Resurgence feels like it was taken straight out of the Star Trek universe. You will recognise some characters if you read the IDW Publishing prequel comic. That being said, you don’t need to read the comic to understand the game’s story. This is the best way to handle storylines like this. Additional media can expand upon the story, but reading is not required. Still, I recommend the comic.  As this is a spoiler-free review, I will only mention what has been publically shown off. For example, we know Spock plays a role in this game. He fits into the game as Ambassador Spock, and it goes as well as expected. Resurgence does a fantastic job of introducing the crew members of the U.S.S Resolute as well as both playable characters. You can play as the new First Officer, Jara Rydek, and Petty Officer, Carter Diaz.  The story of Resurgence is your typical Star Trek one. I think where part of this game excels is the story of the characters. While yes, we are blasting off and investigating the latest crisis, there is still time to chat about how we feel. It’s typical Star Trek at the end of the day. We learn more about the characters we are going to be playing with. For example, Captain Solano has a model train in his ready room. Picking it up as the playable character of Jara informs us that she was aware of the Captain’s interest in trains. Perfect, some fantastic character development in less than 30 seconds.  Star Trek lore fans will love this game, in all honesty. There are many references and easter eggs either hidden or in plain sight. As a big starship fan, arriving at the first Starbase was a joy to watch for a cinematic. Seeing ships like the Steamrunner-class flying by is amazing.  Resurgence Engineering Gameplay  Star Trek Gameplay Is Always Hit Or Miss  Creating gameplay for a Star Trek game can always be hit or miss. Star Trek isn’t HALO or Call of Duty. Therefore, too much shooting isn’t needed. Thankfully, Star Trek: Resurgence expands the gameplay offerings of a traditional Trek game by offering multiple ways to play. One moment you are having casual and inspiring conversations. Next, you are replacing key components of a Starfleet shuttle. Resurgence does a fantastic job of showing you key Star Trek roles in new gameplay ways. You’re not just running around shooting things.  The game does an understandable amount of handholding at the beginning. I was initially concerned about this. However, eventually, the game lets you take the reigns a bit more freely. For example, you are guided on reinstalling a shuttlecraft component at the start of the game. I think where Star Trek: Resurgence stands out is immersing players in both sides of Starfleet. The command deck and the Lower Decks. This fits very well because we’ve recently had the Star Trek: Lower Decks show. Stepping onto the hull of our starship to see shuttles flying around and a nearby Excelsior-class starship is fantastic.  Of course, one of the core parts of Star Trek is exploring Strange New Worlds. While writing my Star Trek: Resurgence Review, I was playing the game and stopped and looked at the world around me. These locations had clearly been designed carefully as if the developers themselves beamed down and took a look.  Conversations Are Key  One element that this type of game excels within the Star Trek Universe is conversations. Tell Tale-type games were well known for allowing players to choose conversation options. Here with Resurgence, we find ourselves doing the same. Like Star Trek, our choices weigh on others and can determine certain responses. It’s fantastic for a Star Trek game to take this route. I’m sure we’ve all watched at least one Star Trek episode and thought we could have done or handled something differently.  Immediately upon having an important discussion between Rydek and Solano, you can see how your conversation topics will reflect how the game goes. The Captain appears to be hiding something. Therefore, as the player, you can be polite or challenge the captain. These sorts of conversations are something we’ve seen in Star Trek before. We all remember the likes of Riker occasionally challenging Jean-Luc Picard.  Graphics Lost In Transmission  I’ve got to be critical of the graphics, both from a general visual point of view and a technical one. Playing this game on PC appears it has been ported from console to computer. For example, some common graphic options in 2023 are missing from the game. On the build I played while writing this Star Trek: Resurgence Review, there was no 4k screen resolution option. The game’s frame rate appeared to drop when complex scenes were loaded or you attempted to change settings. The maximum resolution on the PC was 2048 x 1536.  Overall, this is not a big-budget game. There is nothing wrong with that. I don’t think we’ll ever get a big-budget game like EA and Respawn’s Star Wars: JEDI Survivor. However, some of the graphics do feel slightly lost. For example, walking around the U.S.S Reslute is great as you’re thrown back into Star Trek: The Next Generation. But, with that being said, you do notice clipping and issues with loading the textures of the ship in multiple instances. Additionally, characters stand out a bit too much from the background.  I will admit fiddling with the graphics did produce some better results. For example, loading into the game and reloading a few times seemed to have caused less graphic clipping on the decks of the Resolute. However, some characters still stood out a little too much. But with that being said, Star Trek: Resurgence has captured the much-loved graphic style of Star Trek, especially for this era of the Star Trek universe. For example, the graphics of tools and deck schematics are all like those taken from the Trek series and movies.  The Star Trek Game We Needed  With the rise of modern Star Trek, video games have been expected. While I still wait for a proper Mass Effect-style game, Star Trek: Resurgence also scratches the need for proper Star Trek games. However, that is not to say that long-standing games like Star Trek Online are not what we have been wanting. Rather put, a game like Star Trek: Resurgence allows Trekkies to immerse themselves into the Star Trek universe properly. As mentioned, the gameplay options are really what excels with this game.  Having meaningful conversations, discussing the finer points of life and spacewalking on the hull of your spaceship. This is fantastic and really throws you right into the Star Trek universe without holding back. While yes, I have my gripes about the technical issues, the game is hands down a proper Star Trek game worth playing. If you want to jump into a brand new Star Trek storyline, you will want to pick up this game. Over the coming weeks, we’ll explore more of Star Trek: Resurgence. Catch our dedicated breakdown of the U.S.S Resolute’s starship class very soon.  Releasing on May 23rd, 2023, the game is available on PC via Epic Games, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S.

"game","2023-05-23","03:00:00","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T21:01:39","LAS VEGAS -- Ivan Barbashev started thinking after the Vegas Golden Knights won Game 2 on Sunday about four years ago, when he won the Stanley Cup with the St. Louis Blues, what that team was like, what made it successful, what worked so well and why.  That's when the forward realized what has been in front of him all along.  These Golden Knights, who lead the Dallas Stars 2-0 in the best-of-7 Western Conference Final because of two overtime wins on goals by Brett Howden in Game 1 and Chandler Stephenson in Game 2, have a lot of the same traits as those champion Blues from 2019.  ""I see a lot of the similarities,"" Barbashev said Monday. ""First of all, this team wants to win and every night we play, there's always somebody else who is going to step up. You see in these playoffs, especially going into overtime, (Michael) Amadio scored a goal (in overtime against the Winnipeg Jets in the first round), Howden, 'Stevie.' It's always somebody else that is going to step up and we have really been trying to make it hard for the other team to play against us, especially in our building. I go back to 2019 and that was the same thing.""  What Barbashev also needs to remember is in 2019, the Blues had a 2-0 lead in the first round against the Jets and needed six games to win the series because they lost Games 3 and 4. They were also down in each of their next three series against the Stars, San Jose Sharks and Boston Bruins, and came back to win.  [RELATED: Complete Golden Knights vs. Stars series coverage]  Ironically, seven players from the Stars that season are playing them in this series against Vegas: Forwards Jamie Benn, Radek Faksa, Roope Hintz and Tyler Seguin, and defensemen Joel Hanley, Miro Heiskanen and Esa Lindell. The Sharks were coached by current Dallas coach Peter DeBoer and had Stars forward Joe Pavelski. The Bruins were coached by current Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy.  Two years later in 2021, the Golden Knights were down 2-0 against the Colorado Avalanche in the second round but won the next four games.  The point is there's a lot of experience in this series and everybody knows what happens in Game 3 at American Airlines Center in Dallas on Tuesday (8 p.m. ET; ESPN, ESPN+, CBC, SN, TVAS) could be drastically different from what happened in Games 1 and 2 here.  ""If you guys remember the first year [for the Golden Knights], no one thought we were going to win against Winnipeg in the semifinals and we won,"" Vegas forward Jonathan Marchessault said. ""We thought that we hit our stride there and we won the first game in the [Stanley Cup] Final, and then we lose four in a row (to the Washington Capitals). There's so much more work to do.  ""I don't want to think too far ahead. I think it's one of those things that kind of slipped away from us that year. I know that I learned from my mistakes from that year. You want to take it one game at a time. I don't want to think too far ahead. Right now, my head is in Game 3 in Dallas.""  Cassidy told a similar story of his first experience in the playoffs as a coach 20 years ago.  ""I was in Washington (in 2003), we were up 2-0 against Tampa and we lost the next four,"" he said. ""So, for me, I know how quickly it can change and I'm sure these guys have been through some of those types of experience. We've won nothing. We've got a 2-0 lead. We're halfway there. We know we have to be a lot better.""  It's perfect for Cassidy and his coaching staff that the Golden Knights won the way they did Sunday.  They won 3-2 with Stephenson scored 1:12 into overtime, but were not happy with how they played for at least the first 50 minutes of the game, when they were stifled in the neutral zone and made to look slow.  ""The previous series were 1-1 (after two games) and in both of those against Winnipeg and Edmonton, we had a poor game and that's why it was 1-1,"" Cassidy said. ""Yesterday, I didn't think we were on top of our game, but the difference between yesterday and the losses we had in earlier series against the other opponents is we were able to stick around. I think we recognized we weren't at our best so let's not let it get too far away until we can get to our game, if we can ever get to our game.""  They did in the third period. Marchessault scored with 2:22 left because a strong forecheck led to a highlight-reel goal, and Stephenson got it done quickly in overtime.  But it's not as if the Golden Knights are coming into Game 3 riding the high of a perfect game, feeling invincible, like they can do no wrong.  They've won four games in a row and have done so by being, as Cassidy said, ""imperfect.""  Experience tells them they will have to be better in Dallas, where the Stars have won three in a row and are 5-2 in the playoffs.  Vegas is 4-1 on the road after going 26-7-8 in the regular season.  ""We've got a lot of guys in that room that know what it takes and know that being up 2-0 this series is still far from over,"" Vegas captain Mark Stone said. ""We know [the Stars] are going to bring their best game in Game 3 and if we don't do the same, we're not going to like the result.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5obC5jb20vbmV3cy92ZWdhcy1uZWVkcy1iZXR0ZXItZWZmb3J0LWluLWdhbWUtMy12cy1kYWxsYXMvYy0zNDQ1MjA4ODTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:21:32","MIAMI — No NBA team ever has climbed all the way out of a 3-0 hole to prevail in a best-of-seven playoff series. One-hundred-forty-nine have found themselves in position to try, and all 149 have failed.  Then again, no NBA postseason ever has featured two sweeps in the conference finals. As a result of Miami’s 128-102 drubbing of the Boston Celtics at Kaseya Center Sunday in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat and the Denver Nuggets both are up 3-0, on the brink of bilateral broomings.  So there still is hope for a little we-never-have-seen-that-before basketball history to be made in the next couple days. When the insiders and pundits start debating which of the beleaguered — the Los Angeles Lakers or the Celtics — is more likely not to get swept, you know their respective opponents are firmly in control, playing at impressive levels and not inclined to suffer letdowns that would qualify in any way as serious.  For the record, only three of the aforementioned 149 teams that trailed 3-0 managed to even tie their series, forcing a Game 7. The Knicks rallied enough against the Rochester Royals in the 1951 Finals to do it, Denver in 1994 recovered to push Utah to the brink in their West semifinals series and, in 2003, Portland fell behind 3-0 but forced Dallas to the limit before succumbing.  The closest the league ever has come to having two sweeps in the conference finals — covering all postseasons with the 16-team format — was in 2015. Cleveland and Golden State raced to 3-0 marks against Atlanta and Houston, respectively. But while the Cavaliers swept the Hawks, the Warriors needed an extra game to polish off the Rockets.  That might not be much, but it’s something for the Lakers and the Celtics to show up for in their Game 4s.  Meanwhile, here are five takeaways from the Heat’s Game 3 victory, a performance so thoroughly dominant over Boston that it might have counted as two.    1. The Celtics’ heart needs a paddling  While the rest of us were wondering just where Boston’s collective heart was Sunday, its players and coaches weren’t puzzled at all. That’s because Miami reached in, grabbed hold and pulled it right out of their chests in the third quarter last night.  Granted the winners won’t actually show the no-longer beating organ to the Celtics until Tuesday or whenever exactly Miami wraps this surprisingly lopsided series. But the end is near, as evidenced by all that the Celtics haven’t bothered or been able to do so far.  They opened at home, heavily favored over the East’s No. 8 seed, and lost both. Then they faced essentially a “must win” situation in Game 3 — the whole NBA world knows that 3-0 is a historically impossible series deficit — and turned in one of the worst showings in the storied Boston franchise’s long playoff history.  Even trying to turn what normally would be a negative, playing on the road, into a positive — Boston came in 12-6 in away games over the past two springs — fell sadly short.  Player after player said afterward that the Game 3 egg they laid was on them. But that didn’t stop coach Joe Mazzulla from sounding like a guy issuing a steely decline when asked if he wanted a blindfold for what comes next.  “I just didn’t have them ready to play,” Mazzulla said several times. “Right now, they have a mentality and we don’t.”  One step away from the Finals, there scarcely could be a worse admission at a worse time, but that’s where it stands.  Frankly, it shouldn’t be on Mazzulla to do all the heavy lifting, not with proven veterans and talented stars up and down his roster. But several established NBA coaches have been fired for less dramatic fizzles than Boston’s. Anything less than a complete comeback — that’s right, becoming that very special first of 150 teams to actually climb out of their postseason graves — would start the Celtics’ 2023-24 season with an insurmountable elephant in the room.  2. Miami’s killer non-Bs  That was Miami coach Erik Spoelstra’s term for his team’s “others,” as in fellows not named Butler or Bam. Spoelstra long ago got tired of being asked about the likes of Gabe Vincent, Duncan Robinson, Caleb Martin and Max Strus all going undrafted before they turned various toeholds in the league into vital roster spots for the Heat.  To label them forever for the scrambles that got them here seemed undignified. Yeah, “non-Bs” is better.  They were better than Boston Sunday. Vincent scored a career-high 29 points, hitting 11 of 14 shots and six of his nine 3-pointers. All by himself, he outscored Celtics stars Jayson Tatum (14 points) and Jaylen Brown (12). Yet Vincent had plenty of help, with Robinson scoring 22 and Martin 18.  Those three combined to take 36 shots for Miami, double the number put up by Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. And it was good.  “Jimmy and Bam are both fueling that,” the Heat coach said. “They are just infusing those guys with confidence.  “Y’know, we talk about it all the time. You want to breathe life into other guys, and ultimately enjoy someone else’s success, but that takes great emotional stability. … You’re seeing some of the role players really grow and be able to expand their games. That only happens if your star players really want that.”  With Tyler Herro (hand surgery) and Victor Oladipo (knee surgery) both out, the emergence of additional threats — more of a revival in Robinson’s case — makes Miami’s offense much more ready for basketball in June.  3. Boston’s non-killer Js  Anyone who has second-guessed the folks who voted Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid as the NBA’s 2023 Kia Most Valuable Player — based on the Sixers’ flop from a 3-2 edge in the East semifinals and Embiid’s rather ordinary performance — might want to send some of that vitriol Tatum’s and Brown’s way.  The former finished fourth in that MVP balloting and was named All-NBA first team. The latter wasn’t far behind, snagging a second team All-NBA spot. But throughout the league and even in Boston, folks are wondering if the two are overrated in general or simply flopping at the most embarrassing time.  Brown actually used that word, though in general terms, for what he and his teammates did — more precisely, didn’t do — in Game 3. “I don’t even know where to start,” he said. “An obvious letdown. I feel like we let our fan base, organization down, we let ourselves down, and it was collective. We could point fingers, but in reality, it was just embarrassing.”  After three games of this series, the two Celtics have shot a combined 7-for-40 on 3-pointers, including 1-for-14 Sunday. They have taken 116 shots to score their 128 points, they’re shooting 41.4% overall and they have a total of 21 assists to 23 turnovers.  Sure, Tatum and Brown are the first two orders of business on Miami’s defensive to-do list. But it’s more than that. Brown has slipped and slid at times as if on skaters. Tatum, normally so smooth, has seemed more than once in need of an oil can when going up for shots.  “Tonight was tough,” Tatum said. “I think from the beginning of the game, we were turning the ball over. We didn’t shoot the ball well. They shot the ball extremely well. Just kind of felt like we never recovered, honestly.”  Malcolm Brogdon, the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year and yet another Boston “B,” sputtered along with a scoreless 0-for-6. Still, the burden falls most of all on the two young stars, a status that might get dinged over a cranky Celtics summer.  Tatum shared Sunday that he deleted the Twitter app from his phone at the start of the playoffs. Might want to keep it that way right up to training camp.  4. Going 3-point crazy  That has dual meaning to this point. Miami has been out-of-character good from the arc so far, sinking 19 of 35 in Game 3 and 44 of 92 overall. That’s a staggering 47.8% for a team that hit only 34.4% during the regular season, when it ranked 27th in its accuracy. The Heat also ranked 17th in 3-pointers made per game (12.0), compared to 14.7 now.  At the other end of this spectrum, Boston leaned on 3-point prowess for much of its season success. Mazzulla, despite his taciturn demeanor, focuses more on offense than on defense and wants to see the Celtics let it fly. That worked from October into April, when they took and made the second-most threes in the league, making them at a 37.7% clip.  In these three games? They have made 31 3-pointers, 13 fewer than the Heat, and shot them at 29.2% pace. Which is why it was so confounding for them to keep jacking them up Sunday, 11 for 42 (26.2%) by the end. Yes, the score got out of hand, but they seemed unwilling to force things along two points at a time.  5. Yes, they have to play Game 4  It will seem like a formality if Boston doesn’t show up with more energy and more effort, especially on the defensive end. Its lethargy — particularly after giving up a 28-7 Miami run through the heart of the third quarter — had the Heat’s attackers looking like San Antonio’s “beautiful basketball” crew of 2014 for how they moved the ball and shared the Game 3 shot chart.  Can the Celtics force Miami to go back to Boston with them for a Game 5? Not from the looks of it at this point. And even if they mustered the will to try, the real question is, will the Heat allow it? Miami has a chance not just to return to the Finals for the first time since the locked-down Orlando bubble in 2020. It could earn itself a full week off before Game 1 of the championship round starts on June 1.  * * *  Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

"game","2013-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Redmond"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:00:00","With a secondhand solar panel, a battery and a Raspberry Pi minicomputer, indie game developer Kara Stone got the server powering her games running for just a few hundred dollars. When people point out that cloudy days could leave the server unpowered and her games inaccessible, Stone says that's part of the point.  ""We can't expect everything to be constantly available to us 24-7, and it's OK that things are temporarily up and then down,"" Stone said.  To further reduce its carbon impact, her next game, Known Mysteries, uses highly compressed video footage to shrink its data footprint. In stark contrast to the ultra-high-definition images found in today's top-tier games, the visuals are as fuzzy as videos from old Encarta CD encyclopedias. Unlike modern big-budget titles, which often top 100GB, an early version of her game was just 200MB in size — intentionally constrained game design, resulting in lower impact on the climate.  Stone is one of a growing number of game developers taking climate responsibility into their own hands. The gaming industry has been slow to recognize that creating and playing video games consumes a lot of energy and produces emissions — which contributes to climate change. Advocates for more sustainable game development argue video games must reduce their impact on the planet.  And while the video game industry is paying more attention to sustainability, only a portion of gaming companies release climate impact data. Even fewer account for how much energy is used by gamers around the world.  Read more: After Climate Change, What Does a 'Livable Future' Look Like?  Adam Berry/Getty Images  A cruise liner sinking itself  By conservative estimates, the $184 billion video game industry consumes a similar amount of energy and produces a comparable amount of emissions as the global film industry — or that of the European country of Slovenia, says Australian academic-turned-consultant Ben Abraham. Abraham's 2020 book, Digital Games After Climate Change, is one of the handful of thorough investigations of how the video game industry's emissions impact the planet.  Abraham broadly estimates the gaming industry produced between 3 million and 15 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2020 to create video games. That includes energy bought from local grids and used to keep the lights on and computers powered as developers make games.  Abraham's estimate doesn't account for a wide range of other activities, from making consoles and computer hardware to shipping games to players (or powering servers for them to download digitally) to flying developers and executives out for business meetings and conferences.  We can get one window into the sheer scale of these emissions from one of the world's largest game studios, Ubisoft. Of the company's annual carbon footprint (which was 148 kilotons of carbon dioxide in 2021), only 5% to 10% is from the company's direct operations. The remaining emissions break down to around 10% to 15% to distribute games over networks and into retail stores, 40% for producing gaming devices and 40% for player use, including the energy used to power PCs and consoles  ""Anything less than that, you are basically committing to destroying the planet."" Ben Abraham  Microsoft estimates that the average gamer with a high-performance gaming device consumes 72 kilograms of carbon dioxide annually. In the US alone, gamers generate 24 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, according to a Project Drawdown report.  Game makers aren't ignorant of what's happening. Some of the biggest companies have set sustainability targets. Late last year, Abraham released a report focusing on the 33 largest publishers and studios in the industry that have set net-zero emissions goals. He found that 10 have ambitious plans to reach the milestone before 2030, including tech giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google, but also Ubisoft, Tencent and Riot Games. Sony has set a net-zero goal of 2040, while Activision Blizzard, Bandai Namco, Konami and Sega have set theirs for 2050 — the bare minimum, Abraham said.  ""Anything less than that, you are basically committing to destroying the planet,"" Abraham said.  Each of these companies has a different strategy for getting to net-zero emissions, including offsetting, or buying green energy credits to ""cancel out"" what's consumed in fossil fuel energy, a tactic seen by critics as a form of greenwashing.  Read more: The Green Revolution Is Being Held Back by Red Tape  Paras Griffin/Getty Images  Righting the ship  Every year, tens of thousands of game developers converge on San Francisco to meet at the Game Developers Conference. They swap business cards and meet over potential partnerships in between panel presentations where peers share contacts and lessons learned in the brutal, competitive world of game development. At this year's GDC in late March, hidden in the packed schedule of hundreds of events were a handful dedicated to climate change.  The most high-profile event was Microsoft's showcase for a new software toolkit. Named the Xbox Developer Sustainability Toolkit, it guided developers to clean up their games' performance, which can result in more effective energy consumption. Microsoft has also implemented a number of updates allowing players more control over the energy consumption of their home consoles.  Given how performance and visuals tend to be fetishized by players (and games media), the competitive logic is to maximize at all costs. But shifting player attitudes in favor of climate-saving efforts has opened a door for Microsoft to find a way to reduce player-side emissions by empowering developers to improve efficiency in their games.  ""It's the first time that game developers have ever had real-time energy and emissions measurement tools in their hands,"" Trista Patterson, Microsoft's director of sustainability, told CNET. Patterson assumed the role after co-founding Playing for the Planet, an alliance of games companies that have made sustainability pledges.  The testing kit works like this: Devs can run through a game in progress, play a segment while watching the energy use and dive straight into the code from there.  ""It's the first time that game developers have ever had real-time energy and emissions measurement tools in their hands."" Trista Patterson  Microsoft had Halo Infinite developers use the Sustainability Dev Kit to look for energy savings, and they discovered that lowering resolution and frames-per-second in areas players would least notice, like pause screens and menus, could save up to 55% of power without players noticing.  Microsoft is making the kit available to developers working on games outside PC and Xbox. When Xbox met with producers at Ubisoft to talk about the Sustainability Dev Kit, ideas were kicked around about future eco-modes in games to help lower consumers' monthly energy bills and spotlight games' low emissions to appeal to conservation-minded gamers, Patterson said.  Given Patterson's experience at Playing for the Planet, it's no surprise that she sees the possibility for the industry to unite and save itself. Gaming ""is a wonderful artistic medium able to create alternative ways of looking at a problem,"" Patterson said. Preserving games keeps alive a creative and joyful outlet for many, which is crucial in dark times, Patterson said.  ""Play is the antidote of doom,"" Patterson said.  Of the console makers, Microsoft is most focused on climate-related energy — or at least has made the most headlines doing so. As CNET Science Editor Jackson Ryan noted, giving players an optional software toggle probably won't save much energy and seems like more of a PR stunt. Yet the company has given players options to reduce their own footprint, like with its new Xbox controllers made of recycled materials.  That's still more deliberate action than platform holders like Sony and Nintendo. Both companies release corporate social responsibility reports that outline their respective actions toward sustainability. Nintendo, for instance, has a list of conservation regulations in countries where it operates that it complies with, but no clear overall strategy to reduce emissions.  ""Reducing our environmental impact is one of our four global CSR priority areas and will continue as we work to advance these initiatives,"" read an official statement provided to CNET by Nintendo.  Sony, on the other hand, has pledged to use 100% renewable energy in its internal operations by 2030. The company also aims to reach carbon neutrality across its entire operation by 2040, which includes making products and shipping them through supply chains, but it's unclear if Sony also includes player emissions in this calculus.  Read more: How These 24-Ton Bricks Could Fix a Huge Renewable Energy Problem  Bloomberg/Getty Images  At the Games Developers Conference, conversations and community  At GDC 2023, Sam Barrett, chief of Youth and Advocacy for the UN Environment Programme, explained to a couple dozen attendees how the gaming industry crowd could be taking additional steps at their companies to combat climate change. Barrett spoke for the Playing for the Planet Alliance, a collection of 40 game studios and publishers that pledge to reduce emissions.  Barrett led the crowd, most of whom were game developers, in an exercise tracking how sustainable their workplace is via a 10-step survey (available online here). But he was careful not to shame those in the audience whose workplaces haven't yet taken any steps.  ""If we set the bar so high that people don't feel it's for them, it becomes an elite community,"" Barrett said. ""We want to create a general community where nobody feels judged for where they're at on this journey, and people are supportive and collaborative to help them go further, faster.""  The Alliance's impact is slow but growing. Per its 2022 annual report, 64% of its members are seeking net-zero carbon or carbon neutrality, and its sustainability-themes-in-games Green Game Jam celebrated 2.5 million trees being planted in the real world thanks to member games, as well as a climate march in Ubisoft's Riders Republic game.  That's too slow for some in the audience, like Patrick Prax, associate professor at Uppsala University in Sweden.  ""I think the games industry maybe hasn't understood yet how serious the situation is or how much needs to be done,"" Prax said during an interview with CNET at the GDC.  The gaming industry is still ahead of others that haven't even started to look at their contributions to climate change, Prax said, but if the United Nations' guidance is to fundamentally rewrite how our society works to combat climate change, we won't get there quickly enough by fixing frame rates.  Prax has a definitive list of problems that need solving.  ""I think the games industry maybe hasn't understood yet how serious the situation is or how much needs to be done."" Patrick Prax  There's emissions, but there's also the components required to make consoles and PCs themselves. Coltan, an ore found in smartphones and games consoles, is widely reported to be mined by child slaves in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Pushing the full responsibility on players to lower emissions won't work — it has to come from systemic change at the source of emissions. Like every industry feeling public pressure, gaming has two options, Prax posits: come up with solutions internally or face legislated regulations.  Legislation isn't the best solution, as it can take years to pass or be stonewalled, but there also hasn't been much of a push for video game companies to agree on industrywide emissions rules, either voluntary or mandated.  If the gaming industry needs to shift, so too does gaming and media culture. That includes softening player standards for bleeding-edge graphics. If studios and publishers are stepping up, games journalism can too, Prax said — perhaps by mentioning the energy cost to run games in their reviews.  Players shouldn't be left out of the equation entirely, Prax said, and it could help to make it clear how much energy they're using in real time. Some of his students at Uppsala University pitched interface icons telling players how efficient their console or PC was while playing.  Developers shifting the industry from within  Arnaud Fayolle was a Ubisoft developer who riled up his coworkers into forming pro-climate internal company interest groups until his employer created a climate-focused advocacy job for him. At the GDC, Fayolle gave a presentation explaining how attendees can use stories or mechanics that highlight climate issues. If players grapple with dwindling resources and fossil fuel energy sources with polluting consequences in games, maybe that'll sink into their reality too.  The video game industry can take the lead by making content that educates players; content that motivates them to take action and adopt pro-environmental behaviors, Fayolle said. ""In game design terms, we call this a positive reinforcement loop.""  Despite differing opinions, Prax, Fayolle and many others attended a pair of roundtables held by the International Game Developers Association Climate Special Interest Group, a community of gaming industry professionals, academics and researchers.  Nominally existing in an online Discord with around 800 members, the IGDA Climate SIG strategizes about how to rally the gaming industry from within and without. Gathered in person at the GDC, leaders of the SIG lined the chairs of the roundtable discussions to listen to how climate change is affecting gaming studios worldwide.  ""In order for us to continue making and playing the games we love, our business operations have to evolve, the way we think about our content and our players needs to evolve and meet the needs that we need to be prepared for,"" said Paula Angela Escuadra, a leader in the IGDA Climate SIG who is also a senior user experience strategist for cloud gaming at Xbox Game Studios.  In the absence of industrywide standards and resources regarding climate change in the workplace, the members of the Climate SIG have made their own Environmental Game Design Playbook to walk developers through greening their industry. From research, they identified four ways to predict how favorable someone is to combating climate change: knowledge of climate issues, pro-environmental attitude, confidence to make change and hope. By and large, developers who join the SIG probably have the first two, but are stuck on the third, Escuadra said.  ""In order for us to continue making and playing the games we love, our business operations have to evolve."" Paula Angela Escuadra  Baking climate concerns into games seems like a bummer in a hobby players turn to for escapism, but it isn't new — games have had climate-related plots and settings since the 1980s, because games are a reflection of what we see in the world. Modern indie games like I Was A Teenage Exocolonist engage with explicit themes of capitalism-induced climate destruction, but even mainstream blockbusters like Horizon Zero Dawn and Gears of War integrate climate change-related civilization collapse in their narratives.  ""The long-term vision is that sustainability becomes integrated in every aspect of game development,"" Escuadra said. ""How every game developer wants to define that is up to them, and we're here just to make it a little bit easier and measurable.""  Reflecting on climate realities also keys in on something unique to games — the inspiring power of making change while we play. This is the power that game developers have, Escuadra said: to create new worlds with major existential threats and put players in positions where they can build the tools to tackle them — and then try again if they fail.  ""That safety is so important, and it's safety that we don't have in the real world,"" Escuadra said. ""If we're able to just bring a little bit of that into the real world, the amount of things that we can do without people being so afraid of failing is incredible.""  It's no surprise that Kara Stone is a member of the IGDA Climate SIG, and her solar server project embodies its ideals. She's one of many game developers finding her own way to lower her game's carbon footprint and even move away from reliance on fossil fuels.  ""There's different possibilities for the aesthetics of [your game], the actual design, the production, how it's distributed,"" Stone said. ""There's so many different ways that can be done, which I think is amazing.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvZ2FtaW5nL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3RoZS12aWRlby1nYW1lLWluZHVzdHJ5LWlzLXNsb3dseS13YWtpbmctdXAtdG8tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By feeding assets like the combative orcs of World of Warcraft, the macabre dungeons of Diablo and the vivacious heroes of Overwatch into the machine, Blizzard can effortlessly produce concept art for new ideas.  Because generative artificial intelligence creates art faster than any human can, studios like Blizzard, a division of Activision Blizzard, are hopeful that the technology can cut out some design and development drudgery and make the creation of video games more fun.  Blizzard’s chief design officer, Allen Adham, told employees about the initiative last month in an email that was obtained by The New York Times. Its internal tool is called Blizzard Diffusion, a riff on Stable Diffusion, one of the popular image generators that enables anyone to turn text into art.  “Prepare to be amazed,” Adham wrote, adding, “We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvYXJ0cy9ibGl6emFyZC1kaWZmdXNpb24tYWktdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","1996-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Bodenheim"", ""RheinlandPalatinate"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-22T17:30:00","Stage Fright Not all video-game levels are created easily. Illustration: Diego Patiño  Video games are natural predators. In the earliest incarnation of the art — the arcade cabinets scattered across movie-theater lobbies and dentist waiting rooms in the ’70s and ’80s — you’d exchange a quarter for three lives and a dream. A few minutes later, once those ghosts claimed Pac-Man’s soul, or after Jumpman tripped over one too many of Donkey Kong’s barrels, you were sent back to your mother, tail between your legs, in hopes that she had a bit more spare change left in her purse. This was the business model; video games attempted to separate kids from their allowances as efficiently as possible, which was most easily accomplished through the blunt force of difficulty.  The modern home console-based games industry is almost unrecognizable compared to those early days. Extra lives are no longer stingily meted out between checkpoints, an easy mode is usually only a toggle away, and generally speaking publishers are more interested in immersing us in a story rather than humbling us with our inadequacies. And yet, even now, gamers have a grudging appreciation for a really tough level. They may not be as common as they were in the old days, when there was a direct financial incentive in thwarting players, but plenty of studios still crank up the meters to 11, eager to break our thumbs in two. In fact, with the mainstream success of games like Elden Ring and Returnal, difficulty seems to be coming back into fashion. We’re here to celebrate the tradition and hopefully get some closure on our collective anguish.  There are so many different ways to create a hard level. This list contains resource-draining RPG grinds, uncompromising tactical grids, mind-melting adventure-game puzzles, and the sort of quicksilver, arcade-y gauntlets that require a speedrunner’s acumen. (It does not contain, we want to note, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which came out too recently for us to confidently make a determination about whether any of its challenges warrant a spot. We reserve the right to add it at a later date.) We only looked at console and/or PC games released in the U.S. — meaning no arcade games (unless they were ported to a console) and no mobile-first games — and we created a few rules to guide our selections: ➼ The Flappy Bird Rule: Levels have a clear beginning and end.  ➼ The Open-World Rule: As game styles evolve, so do level styles. Side quests can be levels; discrete sections of a map can be levels (as long as they follow the Flappy Bird Rule.)  ➼ The ’90s Disney Games Rule: Intended audience matters. If a game was targeting young kids, how difficult was this level to that particular cohort?  In general, we attempted to weigh a given level’s difficulty relative to the rest of the game and relative to other games in its genre. Each level’s difficulty was considered in the context of when the game was released — How hard was this when it came out? — since subsequent accumulation of knowledge, online resources, simplified rereleases, and better technology have made some of these stages more manageable over time. The impact of technology was taken into account, too: The difficulty of some games on the list was compounded by the inadequate controllers of their era.  Preference was given to levels that are honorable with their difficulty; a good, satisfying hard, rather than “Are we sure this isn’t a bug?” hard. This was tougher to suss out when reflecting on gaming’s Cretaceous period, specifically the death traps that tormented us on the NES. Is Battletoads a well-designed game? That’s a question we could spend another 20,000 words trying to answer. Enjoy the list, and please tread carefully and stay hydrated if you tackle any of these levels yourself.  100.  Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow (1996; Game Boy)  Photo: Game Freak  When Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue — the first entries in the creature-catching franchise — came to the U.S. from Japan in 1998, gamers couldn’t just Google the best strategies, especially when it came to how best to use different types of Pokémon against each other. Instead, as players traveled around trying to “catch ’em all,” they had to learn which Pokémon were most effective in battle against other types. Some matchups are fairly intuitive: Water, as you might expect, beats Fire. Others, such as Bug beating Psychic, relied entirely on trial and error.  It was in this information vacuum that Lavender Town proved to be such a huge challenge. The spectral Pokémon Gastly and Haunter, which populate the spooky tower, are impossible to even fight without first completing a side quest in a different town. Then, once you are able to battle them, it’s still notably difficult. These part-Ghost, part-Poison types have unintuitive weaknesses (especially since one of them, Ghost type itself, is extremely rare and there are no good damaging-Ghost moves in the game). Would-be Pokémon masters used up all their potions while battling their way up a maze-like tower. And then you had to fight your hated rival, again, at the top. Lavender Town might not hold up as an especially difficult level a couple decades later, when resources such as Bulbapedia contain all the type matchups a player needs. But our desperate memories will haunt us forever.  99.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Demonware  No Russian became controversial the moment footage of the level leaked a month ahead of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s November 2009 release. Taken out of context, it appeared that players would be joining up with terrorists to gun down innocent civilians in a Moscow airport. In context, as everyone discovered when they got their hands on the game … that’s more or less exactly what happens.  When the level arrives early in MW2, you’re in the perspective of one of the game’s five player characters, the CIA agent Joseph Allen. He’s assigned to go undercover and infiltrate a terrorist group in order to gain the trust of Vladimir Makarov, the group’s leader and the game’s main antagonist. You can’t reveal your true identity, even as you watch Makarov’s men massacre scores of helpless people at the airport.  It’s hard to play, for reasons that have nothing to do with mechanics; tellingly, the game offers the option to skip the mission entirely. Plenty of mainstream games ask you to make difficult, emotionally devastating choices. The Mass Effect series is full of them, often leading to no-win scenarios. Life Is Strange ends with a decision to either sacrifice the girl you love or let your entire town be destroyed. (See also Valkyria Chronicles 4’s Mission 16 below.) But in No Russian, you have no agency. No matter what you do, you can’t stop the devastation. If you try to take out the terrorists, you fail the mission and have to start all over again. In the end, you’re left feeling emotionally spent, and the sacrifice doesn’t even matter: You’re found out, Allen is killed, and you simply continue the story as one of the other four characters. All of that death and sacrifice was for nothing. It might be the most apt statement Call of Duty has ever made about war.  98.  Sifu (2022; PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows)  The cinematic beat-em-up Sifu, which was inspired by martial-arts movies, has an intriguing premise: Each time you die while battling through the game’s five levels, you’re revived — but your character has aged a few years. Eventually you reach old age, and your next death will be your last, sending you back to the beginning of the game to start all over again. It’s a neat mechanic, if an occasionally frustrating one — especially since Sifu’s second level, The Club, unleashes such a dramatic difficulty spike that you’ll be lucky to finish it with only a smattering of gray hairs and wrinkles.  The Club opens in furious style, a brawl on the dance floor accompanied by composer Howie Lee’s pummeling soundtrack. From there, the game throws an ever-escalating series of opponents at you: Two gigantic henchmen guarding the backstage entrance; a pack of bruising cage fighters; a pair of staff-wielding martial artists; to cap it off, a showdown with the dojo master himself. The Club is so difficult compared to Sifu’s first level that, in the week after the game’s release, it was reported that only a third of players made it through. How many other second levels can lay claim to having driven away the majority of its player base?  97.  Top Gun (1987; NES)  Photo: Konami  Dogfighting in Konami’s adaptation of Top Gun wasn’t very difficult: Bogeys moved slowly in the combat flight simulator, enemy missile lock-ons were easy to dodge, and your F-14 Tomcat plane came loaded with 40 (40!) missiles. Even so, most players never reached the later levels because most players ended up slamming their jet into the ocean while attempting to land.  The primary objective in each of the game’s four missions is to fight off enemy planes before destroying a variety of large targets. Along the way, however, players were required to perform a pair of similar maneuvers: refueling your F-14 in mid-air, then landing on an aircraft carrier following the completion of a mission. Both tasks require you to keep your plane relatively flat while following onscreen guidance about how to adjust your speed and flight path. Problem is the directions are frenetic and require precision that is at odds with the NES controller’s capabilities. Landing on the carrier is especially difficult because the pixelated screen gives no real indication that you’re actually on a good flight path: You could be making an approach with no warnings and still hit the ocean. It turns out that the secret is ignoring the game’s urgent directives and making only small course corrections. But it’s still tricky to pull off even once, much less the three times necessary to beat the game.  96.  Silent Hill 3 (2003; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Konami  Each game in the third-person survival horror series Silent Hill takes place in the titular small town, home to a mysterious cult that seeks to revive a malevolent deity. Gameplay involves elements of combat, exploration, and puzzles, the last of which are some of the best designed — and toughest — in gaming thanks to a randomness that involves, say, tugging on a hanging corpse to find a key to unlock a set of handcuffs. Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3 mercifully enable players to toggle the difficulty settings on the puzzles, and no brainteaser embodies the jump in complexity when going from easy to hard quite like Silent Hill 3’s Shakespeare Anthology Puzzle.  The set-up is that the game’s protagonist, Heather, comes across a pile of books at the mall bookstore, and has to put them in the correct order in order to continue. On easier difficulties, it’s a straightforward mission — you don’t even get a riddle to decipher. But on Hard, you need both an ear for wordplay and working knowledge of Shakespeare. One line reads, “The first words at thy left hand: a false lunacy, a madly dancing man. Hearing unhearable words, drawn to a beloved’s grave and there, mayhap, true madness at last.” (If you’re stumped, it’s telling you to line up the assembled Shakespeare anthologies with Hamlet to the far left.) It’s a puzzle so difficult, there’s room for error built into the solution: you can still get the answer right even if you mix up the books in the middle.  95.  Psychonauts (2005; PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox)  Photo: Double Fine  The final level of Psychonauts, a 3-D platformer in which a psychic boy named Raz helps people overcome various mental obstacles by jumping inside their heads, had such a reputation for being punishing that the developers made it substantially easier in later rereleases. The game’s stages are based around Raz entering the minds of people or things to resolve their fantastically analogized trauma — for instance, in the Lungfishopolis level, the game takes you inside the head of a fish boss that you’ve just defeated, leading you to better understand her motivations as you help fix her problems.  That approach builds to the final act, Meat Circus, which combines Raz’s recollections of his childhood as a traveling circus performer with the upsetting memories that antagonist Coach Oleander harbors of his father’s butcher shop. The result is a horrifying mash-up of flesh and clowns for you to navigate. A lot of the challenge comes from things outside your control: an escort mission with a dumb child named Oly who has finite health and knife-throwers you need to manipulate into attacking certain spots. Then there’s a stretch of precision platforming with little room for error, lives that slip away as you miss jumps, and few checkpoints. Later versions admitted it was too tough by changing all of that: increasing Oly’s health substantially, slowing down the knife-throwers, adding checkpoints, and no longer taking lives from deaths by falling. Even with all those changes, Psychonauts was always more beloved for its writing, characters, and imaginative design than its somewhat floaty gameplay, and Meat Circus is where that was felt most acutely.  94.  Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII (2007; PSP)  Final Fantasy fans had mixed feelings about the FFVII spinoff Crisis Core at the time of its release. It plays out on a much smaller scale than the original, and has a major shift in gameplay away from the series’ turn-based “Active Time Battle” system to entirely real-time combat. (It didn’t help that Crisis Core focuses on Zack, a minor character in the original game whom many players found annoying.) Nevertheless, it’s a high point in the PSP library and a solid enough action RPG with much of the game spent fighting various enemies as Zack searches for a missing soldier. If that’s all it involved, that would be just fine. But one level in particular presents a wrinkle that distinguishes Crisis Core in the decades-long franchise.  About halfway through the game, players visit the town of Modeoheim and are tasked with infiltrating a warehouse, ditching the real-time combat mechanic for yet another entirely new one: stealth. The resulting mission is a jarring departure and almost aggressively unfun: It requires precise moves and methodical hiding and advancing in a game otherwise built around a fast-paced combat system that you only just learned. Compounding the difficulty is the fact that every time Zack gets busted, you have to start over. The enemy guards have a helpfully limited line of sight, though you still have to memorize their movements to move through the level without being spotted. In that moment, it briefly ceases to be enjoyable and instead becomes a chore.  93.  Super Metroid (1994; SNES)  Photo: Nintendo  A theme that will emerge over the course of the following 92 entries is: Water levels are unreasonable. It’s a reputation that Maridia, the penultimate level of Super Metroid, certainly helped reinforce. Like its predecessors, Super Metroid is a side-scrolling, exploration-based adventure, requiring players to unlock power-ups in order to advance through intricate 2-D landscapes. Maridia is a twisty, almost entirely underwater location, in which you’ll have to battle deadly aliens and environmental pitfalls such as underwater quicksand in order to reach the armored boss Draygon.  The watery domain all but requires players to have the Gravity Suit, which allows you to move more freely in water, but you need to pick it up in the previous zone before arriving in Maridia. Without it, the level is almost completely unnavigable, especially considering its scale: This was the kind of vast, sprawling zone that inspired players to bust out the graph paper and start making physical maps of the game. Given that Super Metroid is known for its convoluted maps featuring hidden areas and complex design, it’s no small feat to conquer what the official player’s guide calls “the most devious map in all the game.”  92.  BioShock (2007; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: 2K Games  BioShock, the 2007 first-person shooter about a now-dystopian underwater utopia, is a game about the illusion of choice — both in its heavy-handed social commentary and in its meta-commentary on video games as a medium. So it’s only fitting that the game’s hardest level, Olympus Heights, set in a formerly wealthy district of upscale apartments that your hero Jack must venture through, is one in which your ability to choose gets compromised.  The level, which comes right before you confront the final boss, would be difficult enough with just its first challenge: Jack’s ally–cum–puppet master Frank Fontaine triggers a program that gradually drains your health. However, once you find the antidote to restore Jack’s strength, your Plasmids go haywire. You’ve spent the game learning how to use these superhuman abilities, selecting which one would be most useful in any given situation: Enemies congregating in ankle-deep water? Shoot ’em with electricity. Big Daddy roaming around getting in the way? Hypnotize him to fight for you. But after you take the antidote, your powers begin changing every 30 seconds, randomly cycling through every possible Plasmid, including ones you never wasted resources learning because they didn’t seem all that useful to you. (How helpful is a swarm of bees, really?) Seems frustrating and unfair? It is!  91.  Dead Space (2008; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Motive Studio  Dead Space is a survival-horror FPS set on a mining ship that has been taken over by undead monsters. The player character, Isaac Clarke, must battle an array of gory creatures known as Necromorphs — and of all the many horrors you encounter aboard the USG Ishimura, few are more difficult than the Hunters. They’re huge and regenerate limbs, making them exhausting to fight. You can’t take one on with only weapons and brute force — you have to use your environment to your advantage.  The Hunters show up first in Chapter 5 but prove to be a bigger challenge in Chapter 10 (called End of Days). In the earlier chapter, you’ll only have to avoid a released Hunter; in this one, you’ll have to figure out how to kill it. The pressure is on as you traverse the level, hoping to stay out of the monster’s way. It’s only once you get to an escape shuttle and its powerful engine blasts that you’re able to defeat the creature, but it takes some tricky maneuvering to lure it into the line of fire.  90.  Final Fantasy Tactics (1997; PlayStation)  Photo: Square  Final Fantasy Tactics turned a generation of console gamers onto strategy RPGs with its winding tale of palace intrigue set in the turbulent medieval world of Ivalice (a backdrop the series would later revisit for Final Fantasy XII) and simple, addictive, lightning-fast combat first explored by director Yasumi Matsuno with the Ogre Battle games on Super Famicom. After XII sparked a tidal wave of interest in JRPGs, Tactics brought Matsuno’s innovations to a much wider base of players than Ogre Battle could, forcing gamers who might’ve missed out on tentpole-tactical titles like Fire Emblem to factor spatial awareness into combat over a series of inspired maps and traps.  Golgorand Execution Site is a textbook damsel-in-distress mission on the surface: You hear word of a plot to murder a princess, and you quickly find yourself fooled by impostors counting on you to charge in to save the day. It’s considered one of the game’s most difficult battles, largely because of how outnumbered you are. Surrounded by a crew of knights, archers, and pesky time mages led by the dark knight Gafgarion, whose harsh ranged attacks make him a danger to you anywhere in the cramped map, your party is tasked with defeating the architect of the ruse and killing everyone on site. The smart play is to have a thief steal Gafgarion’s sword; he’s useless without it. Even if you pull this off, you still need to watch your ass.  89.  Valkyria Chronicles 4 (2018; Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Sega  The Valkyria Chronicles take place in a supernatural, alternate-history version of World War II, uniquely combining RPG, strategy, and third-person shooter gameplay. While the games in the franchise have never been easy, Mission 16 from VC4 stands out for the haunting nature of its difficulty.  The basic gameplay of the stage is tricky enough with whiteout weather conditions reducing your field of vision — though from a technical standpoint, there are more challenging levels in the series. What makes Mission 16 so punishing is that it’s a suicide mission for two characters — and after spending dozens of hours getting attached to your team, you must now choose a member of your squad to be one of the sacrificed parties.  88.  Katamari Damacy (2004; PlayStation 2)  Katamari Damacy is generally an easygoing, colorful, and happy game (about destroying the world to appease the King of All Cosmos, a.k.a. your blithely pompous dad, by rolling a sticky ball around a house, town, and eventually the whole world, picking up assorted detritus until he declares the ball big enough to become a star). Most of the levels are straightforward, as you just need to keep rolling indiscriminately, picking up everything in sight, in order to get bigger. But, a pair of levels, Make Taurus and Make Ursa Major, are outright frustrating.  In both, you’re tasked with rolling up just one of the titular animals — a cow or a bear, respectively. The larger the animal, the better your score, and the smaller the chance of your dad mocking you. The best way to beat the Make Taurus level, for example, is by rolling up the giant Holy Cow statue — but you have to make sure you don’t accidentally pick up anything that could also qualify as a cow: a smaller cow statue, an actual calf, or even something that’s cow colored. It’s incredibly tricky to perfect, since the level is, naturally, populated with tons of cow-adjacent materials.  87.  Assassin’s Creed III (2012; PlayStation 3, Wii U, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Ubisoft Montreal  The third installment in long-running action-adventure series Assassin’s Creed has plenty of high points. Set during the American Revolution, Assassin’s Creed 3 expanded the series’ gameplay by introducing naval missions and beefing up the recruitment system, which enabled players to enlist Colonial citizens to serve the assassins’ cause by liberating their districts. But it was also notoriously buggy at the time of its release in 2012, with one section toward the end of the game proving to be particularly maddening: chasing General Charles Lee, a member of the rival Templar Order, through the streets of Boston.  The most difficult of the game’s chase missions, you have to keep pace with Lee while avoiding or taking out other Templars along the way. He gets a massive head start, and this mission was one of the sections of the game that felt unfinished. It was full of bugs — at one point Lee could glitch through the floor — and even a seemingly perfect run could lead to inexplicable failure and a return to the beginning of the level. The chase was so aggravating that it was later patched to tone down its difficulty.  86.  Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest (2015; Nintendo 3DS)  Photo: Nintendo  There are many turn-based strategy battle games, but the stakes are always higher in Nintendo’s long-running Fire Emblem franchise because of the permadeath mechanic: When the units you’re directing around a battlefield — characters with distinct personalities who you come to care for — die, they don’t come back when you start the next level. They’re dead dead.  Conquest, the harder of the twin games that made up 2015’s Fire Emblem Fates (Birthright is for chumps), has one level fairly early in the game that makes keeping all your warrior friends alive especially challenging. Your army is defending a port, and you must survive an onslaught from the enemy forces for ten turns. Their attack is powerful, but thankfully the docks create natural bottlenecks that help you manage the assault. Then, on the seventh turn, one of the enemy leaders uses a magical ability to dry up all the water, and all those sword- and ax-wielding enemies can make a beeline right for your suddenly exposed and vulnerable forces. Unhappy Reunion is hard, yes, especially if you’re unwilling to let a single ally die — but it’s also considered one of the best levels in the whole franchise.  85.  Doom (2016; PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: id Softward  The 2016 reboot Doom understood what made the original, a groundbreaking 1993 first-person shooter about demons invading Mars, so great: As Marty Stratton, an executive producer on the new game, aptly put it, Doom is about “badass demons, big effing guns, and moving really fast,” and the reboot lived up to that ethos. Over the course of the game’s rollicking 13-level campaign, players progressively gain access to an arsenal that includes the shotgun, the pulse rifle, the BFG (that’s Big Fucking Gun), and the rocket launcher, all in the service of transforming the armies of hell into a fine, mushy paste.  You’ll need everything in that arsenal in the game’s final level, Argent D’Nur, which just about fills the screen with every enemy variety in Doom lore. As with everything else in the series, success is measured by a pure DPS (damage per second) check. You can only come out on top if you’re dealing more damage, at a higher rate, than all of the punishment you’re absorbing.  84.  Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994; Sega Genesis)  Levels in the 2-D Sonic games are most enjoyable when you’re zooming over and through their side-scrolling platforms at top speed, collecting rings and defeating enemies with a parkour-like flow. Lest we get too much of a good thing, the second zone of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 strips away that sensation and brings your momentum to a halt by plunging you into a series of underwater sections.  Aquatic levels can be frustrating in any platformer for the ways they alter the game’s physics, but that effect is especially pronounced when it’s the game’s titular hedgehog being slowed down. What’s worse, Sonic drowns before too long if he doesn’t come up for air or find a bubble, and the notorious music cue that accelerates as his doom creeps closer amps up the stress.  But perhaps the most enduring challenge associated with Hydrocity Zone isn’t even in the level itself: it’s figuring out whether the name is pronounced like “velocity” or “Hydro City.”  83.  Gunstar Heroes (1993; Sega Genesis)  Photo: Treasure  When Cuphead (see No. 73) was released in 2017, fans immediately clocked it as having been influenced by the 1993 Sega Genesis co-op run-and-gun platformer Gunstar Heroes, where a series of one-on-one fights are key to the experience. Cuphead’s memorable (and very hard) King Dice boss fight, for instance, was clearly based on the infamous and most difficult level in Gunstar Heroes: Black Dice’s Palace.  In this stage, players arrive at the palace and encounter a giant Monopoly-ish game board. In order to proceed, they must take turns throwing a big die that determines how many squares they should move. Most of the spaces players land on lead to an enemy encounter — a boss battle, an obstacle course — but a few will grant you a handful of items if you’re lucky. Especially punishing are the space near the end that sends you back to the start and the “no gun” space, which leads to a fight where you can — as you may have inferred — only use punches. Chance is the real killer of the Dice Palace: Since you’re at the mercy of random number generation, which determines how many encounters you have to face, your resources will undoubtedly be drained along the way to the boss.  82.  VVVVVV (2010; Mac, Windows)  Photo: Terry Cavanagh  VVVVVV is a platformer without any jumping. Instead, to make your way through the aggressively lo-fi eight-bit indie, you navigate by reversing gravity: Tap the spacebar and your little pixelated space cadet will flip polarities and cement himself to the ceiling. Developer Terry Cavanagh takes that mechanic to its logical endpoint in a bonus level called, appropriately, Doing Things the Hard Way.  The stage sends you careering up and down through a long, narrow tunnel that’s full of tight squeezes and hairpin turns with spikes jutting out of the walls. Get too close to the side and you’re dead. The rest of VVVVVV is pleasant, charming, and reasonably approachable, but Cavanagh kept this devilish challenge deep within his code, almost as if to remind us how mean he could be if he tried. Case in point: At one moment during your attempts to survive the level, an inscription at the bottom of the screen reads, “Your bitter tears are delicious.”  81.  Final Fantasy X (2001; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Square Enix  The Thunder Plains segment of Final Fantasy X (the first in the franchise to feature fully 3-D environments and the new Conditional Turn-Based Battle system) comes about halfway through the game and is appropriately ominous: As player character Tidus leads his team of adventurers through a dark, barren field on their quest to find and destroy a monster called Sin, lightning begins to strike, often and without warning. If it hits you, it’ll push you back and damage your health.  You can dodge the strike with a well-timed press of the X button, but your window of opportunity is small — and if you accidentally press it too early, you’re all but guaranteed to get hit by the next bolt anyway as you scramble to recover. It’s the lightning’s combination of unpredictability and persistence that makes the Thunder Plains one of the most aggravating areas in the entire Final Fantasy series. It’s mercifully a relatively brief challenge — unless you’re a sadistic completionist who wants to try dodging 200 lightning bolts in order to earn a special item.  80.  BioShock Infinite (2013; Linux, Max, PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: 2K Games  BioShock Infinite left behind the underwater setting of the first two games and brought players to a city hidden high in the sky. The location opened up the potential for myriad new challenges and items: among them, overhead rails you can use to zip across the clouds, zeppelins from which enemies can shoot down at you, and a giant mechanical construct called Songbird that stalks your character, Booker, as he attempts to rescue the hostage Elizabeth. By the time you reach the game’s final fight, you need to know how to harness each of those elements to your advantage.  Command Deck hits you with an overwhelming assault unlike anything you’ve faced in the game, with an army of heavily armored machines, soldiers wielding RPGs, and cannon-equipped gunships. You’ll have to zip from rail to rail to take out the enemies and avoid their fire, while commanding the now-allied Songbird to attack the zeppelins circling above. Not only does the battle require juggling more mechanical elements than any preceding part of the game (this is your first time working with Songbird rather than hiding from it); it also requires a ton of trial and error when it comes to timing your attacks. You can figure out the enemies’ pattern if you pay close attention — but that’s a big “if” considering the chaos surrounding you.  79.  GoldenEye 007 (1997; Nintendo 64)  You don’t need one of Q’s gadgets to make GoldenEye’s Train stage manageable. You just need something more nimble than a Nintendo 64 controller. The stage is the most literally linear level in the blockbuster first-person shooter: You make your way from one end of a Russian train to the other, taking out enemy operatives along the way. But what turned out to be the level’s biggest obstacle was not the soldiers confronting you — it was the Nintendo 64’s controller and its single analog stick.  With no way to efficiently adjust the camera — and thus, a player’s perspective — the simple act of aiming your gun became a slow, arduous, easily exploitable task. That limitation is especially pronounced in Train’s tight corridors: Open a door, and a pack of Russian soldiers immediately open fire. The lack of controller precision left so many players bleeding out on the floor, as the crosshair of Bond’s gun moved far too slow to actually keep up with the horde of gunmen shooting back at you. If you still bear the psychological scars of repeated Train failures, you owe it to yourself to jump back into GoldenEye with a mouse and keyboard to get some closure.  78.  Bayonetta (2009; PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)  Photo: PlatinumGames  Bayonetta is rightfully beloved for being a gleefully ridiculous and raunchy game about a sexy shape-shifting witch who uses her hair to summon demons. Throughout the adventure, you’re mostly subjected to hack-and-slash sequences and boss fights, which are a blast — right up until you arrive at the eighth chapter of the game.  Named Route 666, that stage suddenly requires you to drive … while still being bombarded by enemies. You’d better get the hang of fighting behind the wheel quickly, because soon you’ll be met with several Quick Time Events where you need to press buttons with precise timing in order to proceed down the road. It’s an abrupt shift in gameplay, one that feels bizarrely out of place.  77.  Rain World (2017; Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows)  Photo: Videocult  “Unfun and unfair” is how one Reddit post characterized Unfortunate Development, the optional subregion that functions as a shortcut in the Five Pebbles region of survival platformer Rain World. In the game, you play as a slugcat, an adorable creature who must rely on smarts and agility in order to avoid becoming a larger, scarier creature’s next meal. At many points during your journey through a vast postapocalyptic megacity, you will feel helpless, as the game gives you almost no guidance on how to survive. Relatable.  That sense of vulnerability is felt most acutely in Unfortunate Development, an area that has riled up fans for years. The level combines unwieldy zero-gravity platforming — a mechanic exclusive to the region — with the new nightmarish threat of gigantic daddy longlegs covering nearly every surface. The beauty of Unfortunate Development is not only how it intensifies the game’s abrasive design but the way losing gravity makes a city you were beginning to feel at home in feel utterly alien again.  76.  Beat Saber (2019; PlayStation 4, Windows)  Rhythm games often feature one or two songs that are head and shoulders above the rest in terms of difficulty, such as Guitar Hero’s infamous “Through the Fire and Flames.” For the VR music game Beat Saber, in which you use a pair of glowing sabers to cut blocks to a beat, that level is “Ghost,” a frenetically paced track from Japanese electronica artist Camellia. Mastering the song requires an uncommon level of arm stamina, precise timing, and, hopefully, a physical space free of breakable objects and/or passersby. Multiple difficult, high-BPM tracks have been added to the game in recent releases, but none yet have dethroned “Ghost.”  75.  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003; Windows, Xbox)  Photo: Aspyr  Knights of the Old Republic is the greatest Star Wars game ever made thanks to its intricate storytelling (including one of the best plot twists in gaming history) and accessible RPG gameplay. Even the game’s finale is satisfyingly challenging, putting a fun spin on several classic tropes. It’s common for RPG climaxes to take place in corrupted castles or foreboding lairs, but Knights of the Old Republic’s ending has an especially epic setting: Our Jedi turncoat must delve into the coolest Death Star facsimile ever dreamt up.  The Star Forge is, essentially, an end-game dungeon filled to the brim with trash mobs guarding the game’s final boss, Darth Malak. You explore its titanic Sith architecture as an elite cadre of lightsaber-wielding combatants chip away at your health potions and party integrity. Meanwhile, Darth Malak bides his time before a final showdown — a duel that will test even the most Force-adept player. He’s a grueling challenge, but the choice the player must make afterward is a big part of why the Star Forge and game as a whole are classics: Knights allows you, after all your pain and strife, to opt in to the Dark Side and become the ultimate villain.  74.  God Hand (2006; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Clover Studio  God Hand is a beat-’em-up that tasks you with fighting the simplest of henchman and toughest of demons, all of whom are relentlessly pursuing you and your all-powerful God Hand. In order to succeed, you need to rely on a knowledge of combos rather than your ability to mash buttons until something hits. The levels are essentially interchangeable besides the boss fights, which helps explain why the game has achieved something of a cult favorite “so bad it’s good” status.  Nevertheless, the game’s stage 8-1, Death Shudder, ramps up the difficulty by forcing you to strategize before you start punching. Playing God Hand is about managing the enemies on each level and knowing when to run into a group and when to get out. This stage puts that skill right at the forefront with room after room of multiple enemies. If you think you can handle fighting three guys at once, you might finish them off just to come across about a dozen more. It gets overwhelming — fast.  73.  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (2008; PlayStation 3)  Photo: Kojima Productions  Snake, the super-spy protagonist of the Metal Gear games, is back where the legend began. Shadow Moses Island, the location of an attempted armed revolt against the United States in the first game, is back, rendered in beautiful HD and teeming with malevolent spider mechs that are more than willing to blow the cardboard box right off your back. Designer Hideo Kojima lays the nostalgia on heavy throughout all of Solid Snake’s last ride in Metal Gear Solid 4, but the most sentimental of all the fan service packs a hefty challenge with a squadron of snipers ready to stop America’s greatest special agent right in his tracks.  The majority of Metal Gear Solid 4 feels like an extended cutscene with some interactive pizzazz — a swan song for Solid Snake that does not threaten our reflexes. But then, all of a sudden, we’re transported back to a vintage PlayStation adventure, embodying the franchise’s stated values of stealth, espionage, and action. You’ll need all three if you wish to survive the raving, carnivorous mechs patrolling the campus. We love a level that makes us seriously consider if we were simply better gamers when we first explored this island all the way back in 1998.  72.  Cuphead (2017; Windows, Xbox One)  The notoriously punishing run-and-gun throwback Cuphead is best known for its outstanding boss encounters, but the game is more than capable of breaking your soul during the normal course of play. Funhouse Frazzle, which pops up toward the end of the game, is the most dastardly of the game’s levels.  Our hero must bounce between hallucinatory gravity wells to dodge a cavalcade of eccentric enemies. (Evil tubas? Evil jack-in-the-boxes? Evil checkerboards? All there.) Many of the platforms contain a cartoony treadmill, slowly imperiling players as they tend to the many foes that want them dead. It’s all capped off with a nervy mini-boss — a living wall with two mouths that spit deadly toy cars out at you — whom you can only defeat by fighting half the battle upside down.  71.  Braid (2009; Linux, Mac, PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Number None  Braid was a pioneer for indie games, a subversive platformer that turned many of the tropes and expectations set by the Super Mario series on their heads. Rather than straightforward, linear levels with relatively consistent mechanics, Braid introduces time manipulation, essentially allowing you to rewind your actions. It’s a nifty innovation that the game builds on, introducing new time-based mechanics in each world.  No level illustrates their potential for maddeningly simple challenges better than World 4-4: Hunt! The flow of time in World 4 depends on player movement, meaning if you move left, time will reverse and bring enemies you have already killed back to life. In Hunt! you have to defeat every foe to clear the level, but you’ll have to kill them all while moving from left to right to avoid them respawning. That’s much more difficult than it sounds thanks to the course’s multi-tiered layout and cruel twist: The ladder to reach the upper levels is all the way to the right.  70.  Dance Dance Revolution X2 (2010; Arcade, PlayStation 2)  Photo: Konami  Dance Dance Revolution is a video game, yes, but it’s also a full-body workout. The arcade staple requires players to do something that approximates dancing — move their feet around a set of arrows on the ground — according to on-screen instructions and in time with the music. The faster and more complex the track, the harder it is to keep up, and no song in the DDR franchise asks more of dancers than X2’s “Valkyrie Dimension.”  There’s a moment about 25 seconds in where the song’s BPM speeds up by about 470 beats and the screen in front of you explodes with neon directional arrows guiding your footsteps. The difficulty spike would be hilarious if there was time to catch your breath. It’s at this point where most Dance Dance Revolution players tap out and select something more agreeable. (“Castles in the Sky” is a lovely time.)  69.  Fallout: New Vegas (2010; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox One)  Deathclaws are the scourge of the Fallout series. They’re gigantic, deadly, and frankly terrifying creatures — genetically engineered chameleons that look like a miniature Godzilla mixed with a Balrog. Mercifully, they are rare compared to the mutants or ghouls you’ll find throughout the RPG series’ postapocalyptic landscape, but when you see one in the distance or hear a shriek, it puts a lump in your throat.  The Dead Wind Cavern location in Fallout: New Vegas might as well be a Deathclaw resort. Just entering the area will send at least a couple your way — more than you’ve had to contend with anywhere else in the game. If you manage to defeat them and go deeper, you may come across the Legendary Deathclaw, which deals up to twice as much damage and possesses twice the health. Or it may come across you, since it can attack without warning. Until you’re armed with really powerful weapons (or a companion you don’t mind sacrificing,) Dead Wind Cavern is best avoided.  68.  Half-Life 2 (2004; Mac, Linux, Windows)  Photo: Valve Corporation  The Half-Life series blends elements of first-person shooting, puzzles, and scripted storytelling, but at one point in Half-Life 2, it briefly becomes a tower-defense game — the sort where the player needs to protect a base from an onslaught of enemies. Playing as the physicist turned alien fighter Gordon Freeman, you find yourself in an old municipal prison called Nova Prospekt with alien forces bearing down on your location.  Your only recourse? To hunker down, set up a network of turrets, and fend off the enemies as they arrive. It’s a complete inversion from the rest of the game’s mechanics. While Half-Life 2 isn’t a stealth game, its enemies typically have to be alerted to your presence, whether it’s by gunfire or by your entering their line of sight. Here, though, everyone knows exactly where you are, and your only option is to fight them off from a single spot you’re praying is defensible until you exhaust their forces and can make it out.  67.  Banjo-Kazooie (1998; Nintendo 64)  Photo: Nintendo  Few platforming environments are more pernicious than the dreaded desert level. Gobi’s Valley pops up midway through Banjo-Kazooie’s adventure, and it’s best remembered for the deadly quicksand that seems to emanate out in every direction. Banjo-Kazooie burdened us with a surprisingly complex kit of abilities for a humble N64 game; Banjo can fly, he can fire eggs like a machine gun, he can jump in a pair of rain boots and stride across poison, lava, or bone-chilling water.  For the Valley, though, the game asked us to use everything in our disposal to gather all of the collectable puzzle pieces and unlock the inner sanctum of the evil witch, Gruntilda. Not only did the deadly desert require mastery of all Banjo’s abilities, you had to do it while battling a fiddly, hard-to-orient camera that the N64’s single analog stick just wasn’t equipped to control. Now that we’re used to cameras in 3-D games that actually function as intended, Banjo-Kazooie’s feels even worse. Gobi’s Valley might have frustrated you as a child, but it will absolutely enrage you as an adult.  66.  Elden Ring (2022; PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X)  Photo: FromSoftware  Open-world action RPG Elden Ring is known as one of developer FromSoftware and creator Hidetaka Miyazaki’s easier, more accessible games, but if this is their floor, the floor is still literally lava (or a Lake of Rot). Its isolated area Crumbling Farum Azula exists both out of time and far afield from the landmasses where most of the game’s action takes place. You can only reach it as you near the endgame, after burning the massive, sacred Erdtree, which lit up the entire sky.  Crumbling Farum Azula is, then, essentially your damnation for the greatest sin in the game — a labyrinthine, floating agglomeration of dilapidated castles populated by super-strong ghostly knights, eagles with blades on their claws, werewolf-like demons, and ancient dragons. Navigating it requires finding routes between these floating islands, often while getting targeted with lightning strikes from afar and fighting common enemies that are just as tough as the bosses found earlier in the game. At any point you are likely to lose your way, endure a surprise attack, or fall to your death. The mandatory boss is Maliketh the Black Blade, a relentless beast-like knight who is plated in black armor and capable of leaping high above the player character to land strikes. He’s tough. (And if he’s not enough, you can go back in time and face an even bigger, optional enemy, the two-headed dragon named Placidusax, in the same area.)  65.  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017; Nintendo Switch)  Photo: Eiji Aonuma  The “naked run” is a beloved, long-standing dare: Can you successfully play as a character without relying on any of his special armor or clothing? Funny, yes, but it’s also a true challenge, one that’s delighted gamers (and their audiences) for years. Then in 2017, Breath of the Wild took the tradition and baked it right into one of the game’s quests.  By the time you reach Eventide Island, you’ve likely built up an impressive — or at least adequate — collection of weapons and armor as you’ve explored Breath of the Wild’s open world. Once you reach its shores, however, all of your supplies are taken away, leaving you vulnerable to the enemies patrolling the area. You’ll need to fight them off with assorted detritus while you collect orbs to place in altars around the island, which will return your items and reveal a shrine that will heal you up and grant a 300-rupee payout. It’s tough, though like all of the game’s shrine quests, it’s optional, just like facing Calamity Ganon in only your undies.  64.  Celeste (2018; Linux, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Matt Makes Games Inc.  Celeste is a beautiful, emotional platformer about a woman named Madeline who decides to climb the abandoned, spooky Celeste Mountain, but don’t let the gentle soundtrack and soft pastel graphics trick you into thinking it doesn’t squarely belong in the masocore genre of incredibly hard titles. It’s kinder than many other games of its ilk, offering an Assist Mode that allows you to toggle off certain features to make passing levels easier. But even with mode turned on, getting past Celestial Resort is a real challenge.  Set in a ghostly hotel, the game’s third level represents a significant difficulty jump from the first two. The map is darker and more labyrinthine than previous stages with treacherous new challenges like locked blocks and fuzzy tendrils that spawn black sludge as you walk over them. Then you get to the game’s first mini-boss, the hotel manager, who transforms into a giant ghost head and begins chasing you in what becomes a frantic race to the end of the level.  63.  Super Mario 64 (1996; Nintendo 64)  Photo: Nintendo  It’s been noted that water levels get a bad rap, but their frozen cousins, the ice levels, may be worse. The slightest touch of the joystick sends you slipping and sliding about, usually toward an inconvenient cliff or other imperiling feature.  Cool, Cool Mountain, the frosty fourth stage of N64 classic Super Mario 64, is full of tasks that are formidable when you possess limited mobility control: carrying a screaming baby penguin down the mountain, leading a rolling snowball down the same mountain (without getting crushed), jumping off the mountain and floating to a hidden ledge below. But the most maddening element is the Big Penguin race, in which you must beat a Big Penguin down an ice ramp. Whoever decided that races should be a staple of ice levels is a sadist.  62.  Xenogears (1998; PlayStation)  Photo: Square  The cult-favorite JRPG Xenogears seeded ideas that went on to flower in the impressive verticality and seamless world traversal of the recent Xenoblade Chronicles games — and the imperfect, embryonic 1998-ness of the first game is never more noticeable than in the Tower of Babel. The late-game stage saddles players with a platforming exercise in which the protagonist’s imprecise jumping ability and the game’s stiff encounter rate sync up to create a nightmare dungeon.  Before it was possible to save scum your way to the top, an unexpected battle at a point where you needed to jump could easily send you plummeting back to the ground floor. If you’re familiar with the story from the Book of Genesis where mortals unite to build a tower to heaven, and the punishment for their arrogance is the shattering of their shared tongue into disparate languages, you might appreciate the irony in naming this area, where Xenogears flies too close to the sun and its mechanics begin to work against it, in its honor.  61.  World of Warcraft (2004; Mac, Windows)  Photo: Blizzard Entertainment  World of Warcraft remains the blueprint for MMORPGs — a gorgeously rendered fantasy realm that can house thousands of players at a time. And after nearly two decades of existence, veteran WoW players traditionally point to the game’s second expansion, 2007’s The Burning Crusade, as being the peak of its difficulty. A primary reason for that reputation is its heroic dungeons, which demanded a level of coordination that most pick-up groups of dungeoneers could never muster.  The most grueling of those Burning Crusade dungeons is the Arcatraz, an intergalactic Blood Elf prison, featuring a final barrage of enemies that will leave even the most competent players out of mana and in dire straits. And that’s even before the last boss spawns! The lesson: Never instigate a jailbreak in the Warcraft universe, no matter how good the loot might be.  60.  Kid Chameleon (1992; Sega Genesis)  Kid Chameleon lacked the franchise-spawning charm of its ’90s platformer peers Mario or Sonic, but the game carved out a distinct legacy by being memorably weird and hard. Playing as a kid trapped in a VR world, the game’s twist on otherwise standard platforming is that you have to collect masks that give you a variety of special abilities: A horned mask lets you charge up attacks, for example, while one shaped like a helmet gives you a hoverboard.  So you bounce around, collecting those masks — but almost none of them will help you in Kid Chameleon’s most notorious level, the Bloody Swamp. A meat-grinder wall of death steadily advancing from the left sets a relentless pace as you attempt to navigate the stage’s many obstacles. The real killer is the abundance of bouncy rubber blocks arranged in tunnels so that that one poorly placed jump will send you ping-ponging to your doom.  The Bloody Swamp is so loathed among the game’s more than 100 levels that the most common advice from players about how to handle it is to simply avoid it entirely and take another path, rather than let the level chew through all your accumulated lives and end your run entirely.  59.  Control (2019; PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: 505 Games  The action-adventure game Control, which follows Jesse, the director of a shadowy government agency, as she investigates paranormal phenomena, is known for two things: weirdly gorgeous yet unsettling visuals and crazy-hard bosses. You’ll find both in the side quest Self Reflection, in which Jesse must access a hidden dimension within a mirror and fight a twisted version of herself. It boils down to a puzzle and a boss battle, and both are out-and-out tough.  In order to access the reflected space within the mirror, you must position six shutters correctly, using only their reflections to angle them perfectly. How long this takes you depends entirely on your spatial reasoning skills. Once you open the correct shutters, you can walk through the mirror, where you’ll meet Jesse’s doppelgänger, named esseJ. She’ll use your own weapons and abilities against you — only she’s better, stronger, and faster. Defeating her requires taking the time to figure out your own weaknesses.  58.  Silent Hill 2 (2001; PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox)  Photo: Konami  In Silent Hill 2, one of the most moodily atmospheric survival-horror games ever made, you play as a character searching for his dead wife in a town full of supernatural monsters and cryptic puzzles. Sometimes the puzzles are trickier to contend with than the monsters. We noted above (No. 96) that the Silent Hill franchise’s adjustable puzzle difficulties can change the course of a playthrough. The second game hits you with an example of this relatively early in its gameplay as you explore the Blue Creek Apartments. You have to arrange three coins with different faces — a woman, a snake, and an old man — in the correct order.  On easier difficulties, the game basically tells you what to do. (“To the right is the lady. To the left is the old one. In the center crawls the other.”) But on Hard mode — and, beyond that, on the Extra Riddle difficulty — the inscriptions grow more poetically intricate, adding layers of dense, figurative language to the clues. (One stanza reads “For the gravest of sinners / His place be appointed / And if he be lucky / May his soul be anointed.”) Those challenges are best left to only the most committed of puzzle solvers.  57.  Kingdom Hearts 2: Final Mix (2005; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Square Enix  The Kingdom Hearts series is a strange beast. An action RPG that teams up original character Sora with Disney/Pixar and Square Enix characters for epic fights and exploration across a galaxy of Disney-themed worlds, it’s the kind of mash-up that was catnip for mid-aughts nerds. One of the series’ most enduring traditions is releasing remastered editions that tweak and add content to the original games, ratcheting up the magicky, stat-heavy combat with increased challenges and new boss fights. Usually, the remixes were loads more difficult than the base game.  Kingdom Hearts 2: Final Mix is the prime example of this spike. The biggest new challenge in Final Mix, the Cavern of Remembrance, is an endgame zone filled with the most powerful enemies the game has thrown at you. The level also involves difficult platforming that requires several of Sora’s abilities to be leveled up to the max, and if that weren’t enough, there are 13 boss battles, presenting quite the gauntlet to complete.  56.  Tony Hawk Pro Skater (1999; PlayStation)  The first title in Tony Hawk’s beloved skateboarding-game franchise, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, is an exercise in chaining tricks. You do your best to keep a combo going, stringing wall rides, grinds, and ollies together in an attempt to boost your score ever higher. At the same time, you’re asked to complete certain objectives — collecting items such as videotapes or the letters S-K-A-T-E — in each course.  One of those maps is infinitely more aggravating than the rest: Downhill Jam. Unlike most levels in the game, Downhill Jam, living up to its name, featured one long, linear downward slope. It’s remarkably complicated to effectively chain combos and rack up a high score when you lack the ability to control your velocity, making the game’s own milestones excruciating to achieve. Some players appreciated the challenge, while others couldn’t wait to return to the (much flatter) mall.  55.  Hollow Knight (2017; Linux, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Team Cherry  If you play enough of the Metroidvania game Hollow Knight, you’ll get intimately familiar with what it takes to win: twitchy button mashing, internalizing the attack patterns of enemy insects across a 2-D battlefield, and an attuned sense of when to dodge and when to slash with your knight’s trusty, swordlike Nail. Success in Hollow Knight rides on paying close attention to your environment and timing your actions accordingly. What makes the Deepnest — one area of Hollow Knight’s vast map — a giant pain is that it shrouds much of the screen in utter darkness.  Within the Deepnest, villainous critters — the spiderlike ​​Corpse Creeper, the pustulating Bluggsac, the armor-plated Stalking Devout, to name a few — lurk not from the side of the screen but emerge unexpectedly out of the shadows right in front of you. When you go deep enough, one enemy, Nosk, who is designed to look almost exactly like the protagonist, mysteriously runs away at first, staying just offscreen, avoiding you until you unwittingly enter his hunting ground. It’s a boss fight that feels much like the whole area: The true test is keeping calm in the darkness.  54.  Crypt of the Necrodancer (2015; Linux, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Brace Yourself Games  Crypt of the Necrodancer is a unique little title. Part rhythm game, part roguelike, and part dungeon-crawler, it requires players to combine the skills needed for all three genres. You have to defeat various enemies throughout the dungeon, but you must land your attacks and movements to the timing of the music. The learning curve is so high that the first of the game’s four zones is its hardest, despite enemies getting progressively stronger as you move forward.  Zone 1 doesn’t just require getting through to the end — you need to figure out both the game’s rhythm and its strategy of moving in time to the music as enemies do the same. Miss a beat and your action fails, leaving you sure to get hit by a monster if you’re in their path. After Zone 1, the rest is easy (well, easier), because at least you understand what you have to do, even if your fingers don’t always cooperate.  53.  Super Mario Kart (1992; SNES)  Every entry in the Mario Kart series has climaxed with a unique Rainbow Road, the most challenging course of the final racing circuit, but the original set a difficulty bar that still stands. The Super Mario Kart version of the track is surrounded by black void, with no guard rails, making any slip off the track a punishing fall into blackness, losing you precious seconds as you are picked up and placed back on the road. Route-wise, the track is all 90-degree turns, and the looming enemy Thwomps send you spinning out regardless of whether they crush you directly or land a glancing blow. While no iteration of Rainbow Road is easy, the original endures for a reason.  52.  Crash Bandicoot (1996; PlayStation)  Photo: Naughty Dog  The Crash Bandicoot series was a major PlayStation exclusive back in the late ’90s with the mouthy title character serving as an edgier alternative to Nintendo’s Mario. While the game wasn’t the hardest of N64 platformers, the 23rd level memorably blindsided players with an array of unexpected challenges.  High Road is a pain for a few reasons. It changes up the basic gameplay format, moving from the game’s typical side-scrolling to a third-person view. Owing to the stage’s setting high in the clouds, there’s a fogginess that partially obscures your range of sight. The rickety suspension bridge that serves as the namesake high road is full of traps and enemies, or it’s outright incomplete in places. And as was so often the case in the ’80s and ’90s, the PS1’s controls weren’t precise enough for a level that requires such careful movement.  51.  The Lion King (1994; Sega Genesis, SNES)  Oh look, a tie-in for The Lion King! Surely that’s easy! Nope, not in the SNES days. Can’t Wait to Be King is the second level in one of Disney’s cruelest video-game adaptations, a side-scroller where you pilot Simba along the journey toward his rightful place on Pride Rock and also watch the prodigal cub die many many times.  The charming-seeming stage has Simba interacting with a variety of animal friends as he makes his way across the savanna, but in practice it’s both a janky gauntlet level and a needlessly arcane puzzle section. While there are many challenging facets to the stage, the pure, undistilled agony of it can be boiled down to one double-jump off the back of an ostrich: Your timing has to be so accurate that there is absolutely no room for error. Hesitate a millisecond, and your lion cub will go crashing to the ground. This will happen to you over, and over, and over. Oh, the irony of Can’t Wait to Be King being based on the most joyous sequence in the film.  50.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012; PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows)  Photo: Feral Interactive  A remake of the classic 1994 strategy game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown sees you controlling the titular elite paramilitary force during an alien invasion, moving your commandos across the screen like pieces on an intergalactic chessboard. In the final level in XCOM’s campaign, Temple Ship, you board a humongous, Enterprise-size mobile city to slay the leader of the alien forces. Here, your elite Earth defense force must contend with the most powerful enemies in the game.  The nature of XCOM’s combat system, which gives each attack a percentage chance of succeeding based on various factors like your cover and range, basically guarantees that all of your warfighting efforts will come down to a few nervy dice rolls. If a sniper bolt hits, that’s a victory. If it doesn’t? Then you’re in a world of pain. Temple Ship is a ridiculous level — so much so that the sequel to Enemy Unknown, XCOM 2, effectively retconned the mission out of existence. But players of Enemy Unknown? They’ll never forget.  49.  Left 4 Dead 2 (2009; Mac, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Valve Corporation  The sequel to cooperative survival horror game Left 4 Dead features a new cast of zombie-apocalypse survivors. Over the course of five campaigns, your team must escape a variety of infected enemies while trying to evacuate the area.  Each of the campaigns has its own challenges, but the fourth one, Hard Rain, has two elements that separate it from the rest: hard rain, which distorts your vision and hearing, and the Witch. You’ll have to fight her, and the battle will be nasty: She’s extremely fast and can incapacitate you in an instant if you don’t attack first. But unlike other enemies in the game, the Witch doesn’t sneak up on you. Rather, she sings a sorrowful song to let you know she’s near. That might sound like a useful warning, but it just instills a growing sense of dread. Once you hear her coming, she’s almost unavoidable.  48.  Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (1996; Nintendo 64, Windows)  In The Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Hoth wasn’t exactly a victory for the Rebel Alliance. The rebels lost a lot of fighters, as well as their base, and were forced to flee in a hurry. Perhaps LucasArts was trying to re-create that feeling of despair and hopelessness when making players relive that icy planet in the Nintendo 64 classic shooter Shadows of the Empire. All-original Lucas-approved Star Wars stories were huge deals in 1996, and Shadow was extra special in that it told the first canon story taking place between Empire and Return of the Jedi. It’s noteworthy, then, that this widely detested level almost kept the game from shipping owing to its absurd difficulty.  In the game’s opening level, your protagonist, Dash Rendar, joins the defense of Hoth. Just like in the movie, your best tactic is to bring down the oncoming AT-ATs by wrapping a tow cable around their legs and pulling tight. While the game prompts you when to attach the cable, there’s no tutorial on how to actually wrap it. You’ll have to pilot your speeder at the exact right velocity and angle or risk losing your cable and having to start over. It turns out that’s a lot more difficult when you’re not an actual Jedi.  47.  Star Fox 64 (1997; Nintendo 64)  Photo: Nintendo 64  Star Fox 64 is a short game, if you know what you’re doing — a practiced player can get from the opening level on planet Corneria to the showdown with final boss Andross in under an hour, navigating your fox’s jetlike starship through linear fights that span a solar system under attack by evil monkeys (don’t overthink it). But depending on the path you take through the game’s fictional solar system, you might encounter one formidable obstacle: Solar, the fiery planet.  The mission on Solar is called Out of the Frying Pan for good reason: The planet’s surface, an endless ocean of molten lava, is so hot that your ship takes constant damage. You have to continuously collect health pickups just to survive the proximity. The level culminates in a boss fight with Vulcain, a burning-hot bioweapon that can smack you right out of the sky — which would be tough enough if you weren’t already in bad shape from traversing all that lava.  46.  Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Eidos Interactive and Warner Bros.  Batman: Arkham Asylum is a brilliant action-adventure game with top-tier voice acting, bone-crunching combat, and a fantastic plot. The caped crusader must track the Joker through the infamous sanitarium, facing several members of his rogues’ gallery along the way. While most of the game’s levels feature high ceilings and open locations Bats can grapple to when overwhelmed, there’s one area where the linear, claustrophobic layout creates a scary-hard environment: Killer Croc’s sewer lair.  Once in that space, you’re the prey, hunted by a mutant monster whose existence has been teased throughout the game. Your job is to collect the six spores hidden in the area and to do it slowly: If you run too fast or make any false moves, Croc will jump out of the water and attack and possibly break the floorboards you’re running along, requiring you to use a Bat-line to get across the area. It makes for an incredibly tense experience in a game and a franchise where Batman is used to having the upper hand.  45.  Dishonored 2 (2016; PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Arkane Studios  In Dishonored 2, you play as an assassin in a steampunk dystopia who must rely on quick-witted stealth in order to either avoid or engage the encroaching, all-seeing security state. Building on its predecessor Dishonored’s emphasis on player choice, each environment in the sequel can be completed with any number of creative solutions that either kill or spare your opponents. The Clockwork Mansion, a location in which the walls and overall floor plan change and fold away once you pull the right levers, is an especially challenging episode, and its central mission is to assassinate a character named Jindosh, the clockmaker who built the place.  It’s possible to complete the mission without Jindosh ever learning your identity, or you can face him head on in a sword-fighting showdown. You can also choose not to kill him, instead wiping his memory. But either way you’ll have to find him first within the mansion’s shifting architecture. His estate is guarded by hulking, plated-steel automatons. As soon as one of those machines is on your tail, it’s a swift game over. The deeper you go, the more the mansion shifts before your feet: Stairs pleat up from the floors out of nowhere, trap doors open into a frightening, shadowy dungeon, and pulling the wrong lever could kill you.  44.  Maniac Mansion (1987; Apple II, Commodore 64)  Photo: Lucasarts  The ’90s were a golden age of adventure games, and no one did them better than LucasArts. But before the studio gave us beloved classics like The Secret of Monkey Island and Sam & Max Hit the Road, there was 1987’s Maniac Mansion, a brutally unforgiving point-and-click adventure about saving your girlfriend from a mad scientist with red herrings, permadeath, and an abundance of dead ends.  These raised stakes created an atmosphere of tension uncharacteristic of the genre, and one of the nerviest parts is a sequence where the player needs to steal a pet hamster from the scientist’s son, Weird Ed. Doing so requires a series of perfectly choreographed events: ringing the doorbell so Ed goes to the front door, sneaking into his room while he’s gone, and stealing the hamster before he gets back. It’s worth the effort, since you come away with a keycard Ed hid behind his hamster — plus if Ed catches you sneaking around the mansion later on, you can return the hamster to him, turning him from foe to friend. (Or you always have the option to stick that hamster in the microwave.)  43.  Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998; Nintendo 64)  Photo: Nintendo  The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a beloved classic of the N64 era, but the game’s notorious Water Temple is a mainstay in “frustrating level” discussions. You can see its direct influence in Breath of the Wild’s Divine Beasts, where manipulating the superstructure of the dungeon itself is the primary puzzle. In this case, you’re tasked with raising and lowering the water level in order to access different areas.  Ocarina of Time was the first 3-D Zelda game, and some of the Water Temple’s difficulty was a product of players’ inexperience with navigating 3-D space. But the game’s designers tacitly acknowledged that the stage was perhaps a little too obtuse when they added explanatory signage in the 3-DS remaster. They also fixed one of the great aggravations of the level: needing to go into the pause menu and manually swap on and off the metal boots you need to access flooded areas.  Design grievances aside, the level delivers a memorable mid-boss fight against Dark Link, one that’s a real head-scratcher as you figure out how to bypass your own doppelgänger’s defenses.  42.  Super Mario Bros 3 (1988; NES)  The Mario games generally got easier and more player-friendly following Super Mario Bros. 3, which makes this 1988 release the most difficult of the legendary 2-D Mario platformers. Its final zone, World 8, built toward the series’ hardest non-optional level: 8-3, or the World 8 Fortress. The stage is a marvel of complex design.  Right away, you’re beset by unforgiving enemies, including spinning Roto-Discs, unkillable Dry Bones, and bubbles that jump out from the lava. But the real challenge is the level’s maze structure — it’s essentially a giant door puzzle. You’ll come across doors on nearly every screen, some of which lead to secret rooms or shortcuts, while others send you backward. You have to keep trying them until you find the right one, all while avoiding getting crushed by a Thwomp or falling into the lava. It’s tough, but owing to the consistent mechanics and enemy patterns, it never seems unfair.  41.  Dead Cells (2018; Linux, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Motion Twin  Where traditional roguelikes are slow and strategic, Motion Twin’s spin on the genre, Dead Cells, is defined by quick, slick movement and reactive combat. The first few levels are straightforward, complete with bonus rewards for speed that encourages the player to take advantage of the game’s velocity and play as fast as possible. Then the game’s first unlockable alternative level, the Toxic Sewers, brings that momentum to an abrupt halt.  Long, open straightaways are replaced with labyrinthine verticality and tight tunnels. There are worms that leave behind clusters of explosive eggs after dying, pools of toxic goo that punish overusing the satisfying ground-pound technique off every cliff, and surprise scorpions emerging from the ground at inopportune moments. Once you’ve internalized all of its threats, the Toxic Sewers aren’t as deadly as later stages, but it can humble cocky new players as they begin to unlock Dead Cells’s branching levels.  40.  Jak 2 (2003; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Mass Media Games  “Knock out that ship!”  That simple directive begins one of the most notoriously tough missions of the Jak and Daxter platformer franchise: facing down swarms of airborne robot enemies attempting to kill our two heroes as they intercept a shipment of the game’s precious substance, “eco.” While everywhere else in the game you’ve mainly relied on your trusty Morph Gun for combat, here you man a gun turret and pray it’ll be enough to destroy the oncoming horde.  It’s a powerful weapon, but it also makes you a sitting duck compared to enemies that can pitch, roll, and dodge through the skies, not to mention circle around you and take easy shots at your machine. After you shoot down dozens of robots in the initial phase, you have to leap from platform to platform, and to another gun turret, to take on the aforementioned large ship itself. It has gun turrets of its own, by the way.  39.  Destiny (2014; PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One)  Photo: Radical Entertainment  Destiny players are used to new challenges. As a living game with frequent expansions, the online multiplayer franchise is constantly adding new missions to keep players on their toes. The most anticipated of those expansions, which are also its toughest, are the raids: six-person missions with legendary bosses and no objective markers telling you what to do.  Developer Bungie perfected the Destiny raid with King’s Fall, which arrived via the “Taken King” expansion in the shooter-looter’s second year. King’s Fall presented Destiny players with what remain the greatest challenges seen in the game: The six players had to defeat the Warpriest (who can only be damaged after players coordinate stepping on separate floor plates), complete grueling platforming challenges, uncover well-hidden secrets, and, ultimately, defeat Oryx, an ancient wormgod with unimaginable powers. A fireteam that isn’t perfectly in sync has no hope of triumphing. The raid is so beloved, it was recently added to Destiny 2 in one of the sequel’s expansions.  38.  Bloodborne (2015; PlayStation 4)  For as difficult as FromSoftware’s games are known to be, the studio’s post-release downloadable content often winds up being even tougher. Bloodborne’s Fishing Hamlet area from its Old Hunters DLC is an eldritch beast, a dilapidated town full of monsters eager to kill you. Replete with explosive traps, hulking mutated Shark-Giants, spear-wielding fishermen waiting in ambush, and Bloodborne’s characteristic muted colors and dark atmosphere, the Fishing Hamlet tests your patience as much as it does your skill.  Unlike other sections of the game, running through it isn’t an option, as there are too many swarms of enemies squirreled away in too many hiding places that you have to traverse. Engaging one enemy at a time, 300 style, like you can in other areas of the game, won’t work either. Instead, you have to take it methodically, maneuvering your camera around as many of its nooks and crannies as you can and timing your strikes accordingly, fighting for every forward step. At the end of the Fishing Hamlet, you’ll face the final boss of the DLC (and more or less the whole game), the Orphan of Kos — the emaciated scion of an ancient god — who’s known for his ragged shrieks, fast strikes, and firing icky bits of exploding placenta. Once you’ve gotten him to about half his health, he’ll call upon his dead mother to zap you with a flood of lightning and proceed to get even more aggressive.  37.  Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link (1987; NES)  Photo: Nintendo  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is one of the weirder anomalies in Nintendo canon. It’s an action platformer, something Zelda never was before and hasn’t really been since, and it culminates in one of the most ambitious levels of the NES era. The game was split evenly between a traditional top-down vantage point and side-scrolling dungeon crawls, which would never be seen again in a Zelda game. That makes Adventure of Link a cult favorite or an acquired taste.  The game’s final stage, the Great Palace, houses the Triforce of Courage, but to reach it you must navigate multiple floors of nervy combat encounters, vast lava lakes, collapsing bridges, and enemies that test the limits of Link’s limited arsenal. Good luck in particular against the relentless, dagger-chucking Blue Knight. Survive all the steps along the way and you’ll have to contend with the level’s final bosses: a fireball-spewing Thunderbird and, most memorably, an evil version of the hero himself, Link’s Shadow.  36.  Final Fantasy 6 (1994; SNES)  Photo: Square  Final Fantasy 6, the last mainline FF game to debut on a Nintendo console, paved the way for the hard sci-fi Übermensch stories driving Final Fantasy 7 and 8, the series’s early Playstation successes. Before the villainous Shinra corporation siphoned Mako energy out of the city of Midgar in FF7, FF6 big bad Kefka carried out an elaborate plot to play his allies and enemies against each other and bend the powers of magic and technology to his own designs. He’s one of the greatest video-game villains of all time, a petulant prick who gets the job done as disrespectfully as he can manage. This earns him a detail of fans, which your party encounters in the Cultist Tower.  You can only use magic in the tower, and the enemies are all high-powered mages who reflect your spells back at you. You can’t run from random encounters (although you can bring a character who doesn’t set them off), so if you didn’t show up with a party of high-powered mages of your own, who are able to reflect the enemies’ spells back at them, you die. And if you don’t have Ultima, the non-elemental nuke spell that evades the Reflect status, you die. And if you don’t have Reraise, the crucial automatic-revival spell, you die.  Once you get to the top of the tower — easily one of the more obnoxious dungeon designs in a Final Fantasy game, a near-endless vertical staircase ascent broken up only by harrowing fights, chests stuffed with incredible loot, and confusing puzzle elements — there’s a final knife twist: The Cultist Tower only allows you to exit the way you entered, at ground level, after fighting your way back down.  35.  Halo (2001; Xbox)  Photo: Xbox Game Studios  The mainline Halo games — first-person shooters set in a distant future where cybernetically enhanced supersoldiers defend humanity against an alien force called the Covenant — typically land squarely in the hard sci-fi genre. But in the seventh level of the original game’s ten-part campaign, our hero Master Chief is whisked away into an ancient intergalactic mausoleum, where Halo briefly tries its hand at survival horror.  The Flood is the shorthand name given to an infectious parasite that threatens to swallow up the universe. These enemies function as a relentless tide of zombified organic matter, slamming against your defenses until you finally crack. While the Flood appear earlier in the game in smaller numbers, the Library is teeming with the foul creatures, and you’re asked to dump an army’s worth of ammunition into an endlessly replicating legion of them. After an hour or so, an unspoken rule is agreed upon by those gathered around the Xbox: One more death, and we’re playing something else.  34.  Five Nights at Freddy’s (2014; Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, Xbox One)  Photo: Illumix  The first game in the survival-horror series Five Nights at Freddy’s is a tense, well-paced experiment combining childlike nostalgia and exact micromanaging. It’s the latter that makes Night 6 — the first bonus night in your job as security guard at a pizzeria named Freddy’s — so tough. You’ve spent the game learning how to defend yourself from the possessed animatronics that roam around the Chuck E. Cheese–like restaurant at night, and in Night 6 they’re at their most active.  Holed up in your security booth, you’re able to watch camera feeds to track each creature’s movement, flip on hallway lights, and lock your door. But each of those actions uses electricity; if you exhaust your power, the cameras cut out, the lights turn off, and the doors open, leaving you with no way to know if an animatronic is approaching — and giving you no way to protect yourself. Balance is key as you listen for distinct noises, learn the characters’ patterns, and manage your anxiety. One slip-up and the animatronics will hit you with a jump scare, raising your blood pressure and sending you back to the beginning of the night.  33.  Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble (1996; SNES)  Photo: Nintendo  Through the combined efforts of your dual protagonists, the agile Dixie and strong Kiddy Kong, you can get through most levels in SNES platformer Donkey Kong Country 3 pretty quickly. It’s tempting to similarly career through Lightning Lookout, a level in the game’s seventh’s world, but players learn quickly that this one requires some actual strategy.  As anticipated by the level’s title, the tip of a lightning bolt appears overhead while you move through the stage, giving you a split second to avoid being electrocuted when it strikes. It’s simple enough in concept, but completing the level requires highly precise timing. The Donkey Kong Country games aren’t known for being easy, but as you play them, you can generally memorize the patterns of environments and obstacles. Lightning Lookout’s signature weather hazard, though, is unpredictable. You can’t rely on muscle memory to help you. You just have to slow down and pay attention.  32.  Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004; PlayStation 2, Windows, Xbox)  Photo: Rockstar North  The Grand Theft Auto games have been known for their vibrant worlds, incredible characters, and sublime immersiveness, but they’ve never been recognized for the fidelity of their controls. For a game all about stealing cars, the vehicles themselves have never been all that easy to pilot, which can make some missions, ones that would be difficult even with precision handling, seem downright sadistic.  The worst offender in the series is Wrong Side of the Tracks — a relatively early chapter of the story in San Andreas and the first major difficulty spike. You’re tasked with driving a motorcycle parallel to a moving train so one of your fellow criminals can get a clean shot at a posse of bandits who decided to take up residence on top of the front carriage. All it takes is one goofy turn to be punted back to the opening cutscene, and considering you’ll also be contending with oncoming traffic, rugged terrain, and the general squirreliness of the analog stick, Wrong Side of the Tracks gets out of hand quickly.  31.  Driver (1999; PlayStation)  The PS1 action-driving game Driver was notable for its 3-D world, which was still a novelty at the time of release, but how many players actually got to experience that innovation? Whatever challenges awaited in Driver’s world paled in comparison to the game’s opening tutorial, which, for some reason, was significantly more difficult than anything that followed. The training stage required you to complete a checklist of driving moves — a 360 turn, a slalom, etc. — in a parking garage. With a comically short time limit and without hitting any of the garage’s columns or other cars. All together, the tutorial generated all the joy of an actual driver’s test.  30.  Gears of War (2006; Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Xbox Game Studios  Gears of War helped popularize “cover shooters” — games where you stop frequently to duck behind walls, cars, and other obstacles before popping out to shoot enemies. But the original Gears, released in 2006, didn’t completely stick to this format. It featured one level that deviated meaningfully from the core gameplay. And just as with Route 666 above, it’s a driving level shoehorned into an otherwise combat-focused game.  In Burnt Rubber, which comes near the end of Act 2, you take control of a hard-to-maneuver tanklike vehicle equipped with a “UV ray turret” with which you have to shoot down flocks of flying batlike enemies before they reach you. You have to stop driving the car to use the turret, all the while listening to repetitive guidance dialogue that gets more annoying as you repeat the level over and over. It’s tedious, frustrating, and, on higher difficulties, takes a lot of patience to complete.  29.  Rayman (1995; Atari Jaguar, PlayStation, Sega Saturn)  The first Rayman game, which launched in 1995, is a deceptively difficult platformer. You wouldn’t know it from the early levels with their bright colors, upbeat music, and flowery scenery lulling you into a false sense of security. But shortly after, the limbless hero reaches the second world, Band Land, and suddenly things are different.  Allegro Presto, the music-themed Band Land’s second level, is the game’s hardest for its sheer number of obstacles. The stage is littered with spiky music notes, there are horns blowing you every which way, and you’ll have to jump across tiny slivers of disappearing clouds. Even the platforms themselves are really slippery — and Rayman used lives, not save points, so if you die too many times, you’ll have to start your entire run over.  28.  God of War (2005; PlayStation 2)  Photo: Sony Interactive Entertainment  The original God of War is mostly a hack-and-slash adventure. As the Spartan warrior Kratos, you swing your Blades of Chaos around, cutting through any enemies that get in your way. But things change once the titular deity, Ares, kills Kratos halfway through the game, sending him to the Underworld. At that point the game shifts into a platformer — and Path of Hades stands out for how difficult that shift proves to be.  You have to quickly adjust to platforming as you jump up and around pillars of bony spikes, all while being pursued by hordes of the undead. The most stressful part of this level is the series of rotating columns covered in blades, which you have to climb to reach the exit. Touch a blade and you’ll take damage and drop to the bottom, which starts the climb all over again. God of War is a tough game in general, but trying to escape the Underworld after falling to your death dozens of times makes you long for the standard gameplay.  27.  Into the Breach (2018; Mac, Nintendo Switch, Windows)  Photo: Subset Games  Into the Breach is a turn-based strategy game about making the best of a bad situation. Your small squadron of mechs, here from the future to defend Earth against an army of giant insectoid monsters, have limited resources and manpower. That reality is at its bleakest in the closing chapter of the campaign. Each level is essentially a puzzle, requiring you to figure out how to deploy your squad in such a way that maximizes your strengths and minimizes collateral damage.  In the final level, your goal is to hold out long enough for a bomb, planted at the core of the invader’s hive, to detonate and destroy the threat for good. This is where Into the Breach takes the gloves off and sends in an enemy force that’s much too large to handle without suffering several casualties. You’ll be bound, broken, and out of ammo by the final turn; hopefully you’re also ahead.  26.  Super Mario World (1990; SNES)  Photo: Nintendo  Don’t let the fun ’80s slang fool you: Super Mario World’s Special Zone is tough. It’s meant as a reward/challenge for those obsessive players who managed to find the secret levels hidden throughout the SNES platformer’s map, and it lives up to that promise. Each of the area’s eight levels brings the pain with surprise floods, treacherous ice platforms, and screens packed with enemies. But those challenges have nothing on the fraught airway of Tubular.  After jumping your way across a series of pipes, the level is one long stretch of sky. It’s too big to fly across with a cape feather; the only option is to catch power balloons and float. But the skies are full of enemies, including the most annoying guys in the game: Confused Chuck and Passin’ Chuck, who bombard you with footballs and baseballs, respectively. If I wanted to be pelted with sports equipment, I would go outside.  25.  Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy (2017; Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows)  Photo: Bennett Foddy  In a sense, the strange, surreal platformer Getting Over It With Bennett Foddy doesn’t have levels. It’s just one long, hard slog up a mountain.  … Using only a hammer to hoist yourself up.  … While sitting naked in a cauldron.  But according to our rules, a level need only have a beginning and an end. Getting Over It certainly has a beginning, and — if you’re really really, really persistent — an end. For the first ten minutes or so, you’ll be greeted by oddly soothing commentary from Foddy himself. But after that it’s just you, and the mountain, and physics. Foddy said he created this game “for a certain kind of person. To hurt them.” If you are that kind of person, you may well spend hours trying to haul yourself to the top of the mountain, starting over at the bottom each time you fall. The rest of us will give it 45 minutes before deciding, Okay, fuck this.  24.  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007; PlayStation 3, Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Infinity Ward  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare marked a watershed moment for the long-running first-person-shooter franchise. While the previous three games were set during World War II, Modern Warfare brought the game into the present day, kicking off a spinoff series and firmly establishing it as a global commercial force. It also delivered one of the most daunting levels in the series. One of the quintessential gaming experiences is cranking up the difficulty on CoD 4 to Veteran, jumping into the campaign epilogue, and continuously dying in pursuit of one of the Xbox 360’s most infamous achievements: “Skydive to safety on Veteran difficulty.”  In Mile High Club, you play as an operative sent into a commercial airplane that’s filled to the brim with terrorist hijackers. You’ll only beat the level once you fight your way to the back of the plane, dodge a hail of gunfire and grenades, and assassinate the ringleader who’s holding a man hostage before parachuting out of a hull breach to safety. All of this must be accomplished in under two minutes — and if you haven’t been on an airplane in a minute, there’s not a lot of cover on a 747.  23.  Disney’s Aladdin (1993; SNES)  Photo: Virgin Games USA  An experienced player can finish Super Nintendo’s Aladdin platform game in a couple hours. That might come as a surprise to anyone who grew up with the console, and its suite of ’90s Disney adaptations, and who most likely remember this particular game for the number of times they were smashed by a boulder, or engulfed by a wave of suffocating gold, or blindsided by a rock wall during their dramatic escape from the Cave of Wonders. In the movie, Aladdin and his carpet made it look so easy. Not the case when we’re at the controls.  In this, the game’s fifth level, your magic carpet needs to squeeze through an increasingly cramped cave network while at max acceleration. Success requires carpet pilots to memorize every hairpin turn if they hope to reach the safety of the desert sky. Aladdin’s Carpet Ride is vintage 2-D derangement in its purest form. Disney movies encouraged us to dream; Disney games demanded that we suffer.  22.  Super Hexagon (2012; Android, Blackberry, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows)  Designer Terry Cavanagh’s (see also: VVVVVV above) minimalist, rhythm-based geometric action game tasks players with navigating a tiny triangle through closing walls and collapsing kaleidoscopic spaces. It’s a simple concept that gets out of hand: the game’s final stage of difficulty, Hyper Hexagonest, presents a nearly insurmountable challenge.  Beating it requires players to survive for just 60 seconds, but for even the most devoted Super Hexagon players, that could take weeks of practice. The rhythm is ratcheted up to a breakneck speed; you’ll have to frantically spin your poor triangle around the screen in order to avoid hitting a wall and starting all over. Completing this challenge unlocks the game’s endless mode, The Final Hexagon — where you can play without limits or time constraints — and earns you considerable gamer cred.  21.  Super Monkey Ball 2 (2002; GameCube)  Photo: Other Ocean Interactive  The Super Monkey Ball series has a simple, Marble Madness–esque premise: You steer monkeys in balls as they roll around treacherous obstacle courses, attempting to reach the end of the course before time runs out. Great idea, no notes, though the developers at Sega took the concept a bit too far with the Invisible course in Super Monkey Ball 2.  The level is made up of the word “INVISIBLE” spelled out in all caps and turned on its side so you roll over the face of the letters. Challenge is huge chunks of each letter are indeed invisible, and rolling off the edge means starting over from the beginning. Unless you are very, very lucky, the only way to clear this course is through tedious trial and error — especially since you only get a quick glimpse at the route before the tiles disappear, leaving you to guess at which gaps in the track can be rolled over.  20.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1989; NES)  Photo: Konami  This list has reiterated many times over the unique cruelty of water levels, and Dam from the NES’s action-platformer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles earns special distinction as the worst of them all. In the 1989 game’s second level, the turtles swim through an aquatic labyrinth filled with electric seaweed, violent currents, and booby traps, requiring the player to control their character with a hitherto unseen deftness to keep him unscathed. The goal is to find and defuse a network of hidden bombs in under two minutes and 20 seconds.  The problem — not counting the fiddly physics associated with being submerged — is that the bomb locations are nonlinear, and the level doesn’t give you enough time to find them all if you don’t know exactly where to go. Your only option is to try and fail over and over again, gradually learning where they’re all placed and how to most effectively reach them. It added up to one of the most memorably agonizing levels of all time, one that discouraged even TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman. Hey, that counts as a legacy.  19.  Donkey Kong (1981; Arcade, Atari, GameBoy, NES)  Photo: Nintendo  Vintage arcade games were typically designed with a specific difficulty curve in mind: A player blows through the first level or two, then gets stuck on a boss or a particularly nasty vehicle section, enabling the game to feast on the quarters of stymied patrons. Donkey Kong was not like that. The game that established two of Nintendo’s most famous mascots — the namesake ape and Jumpman, a hero in red overalls who would later get a catchier rebranding — was explicitly antagonistic from the very first screen.  In Stage 1 of Donkey Kong, randomized barrels begin tumbling down the stage’s ladders as soon as you sink your quarter into the machine (or, later, boot up the Atari). You’ll need to jump over those barrels to reach the top and save your girlfriend from Donkey Kong’s clutches, but that’s easier said than done when they’re coming fast and furious with no discernible pattern. It remains one of the hardest levels created under the Mario brand, a title Donkey Kong has been defending for more than 40 years.  18.  Fez (2012; Windows, Xbox 360)  Photo: Phil Fish  For its first several hours, indie game Fez plays like a cute puzzle platformer with a fun, psychedelic mechanic that lets the player bend the landscapes from 2-D to 3-D as they navigate the world. The experience is colorful and interesting, but it seems shallow at first blush. Then you stumble across what’s been dubbed by fans the Rosetta Stone Room, which contains a fox, a dog, and a series of glyphs, and all that changes.  Observant players may eventually divine that those glyphs translate to the teaching sentence, “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” which contains every letter in the English alphabet. And once you have that information, you’ll be able to decode the reams of script permeating Fez’s universe, including flavor dialogue from NPCs, optional puzzles, and art that builds out the world’s mythology. Few games put so much trust in a player’s intuition. It’s easy to finish your time with Fez without ever comprehending the finer recesses of the Rosetta Stone Room. That’s what makes it a classic.  17.  Super Mario 3D World (2013; Wii U)  Photo: Nintendo  The secret level at the end of Super Mario 3D World’s optional hidden zone is the toughest course to appear in an official Mario game. Even unlocking the course is no small feat: To do so, you have to fully complete every other level in the game with every character.  Once there your goal, like any Mario level, is to make your way across the stage to reach the flag at the end. But there’s no room for error here: Platforms flip back and forth in improbable patterns, dumping anyone without pinpoint jumping accuracy into the abyss below. It requires mastery of the game’s moveset with precision timing that can take hours of practice. Even tackling this level with characters other than Mario, which grants access to abilities like hovering and higher jumps, only helps a little bit. Outside of fan-made gimmick levels, conquering Champion’s Road is the ultimate Mario challenge.  16.  Hades (Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Windows)  Photo: Supergiant Games  The genius of roguelites, which are roguelikes with progression elements, is that each run through the dungeon makes you better. That boss you thought was impossible to beat during your first 15-to-20 go-rounds becomes a piece of cake on your 200th. But where Hades, a roguelite in which you play as the son of Hades trying to escape the underworld, sets itself apart is in the postgame content, which could be considered where the game actually starts. After finally killing Hades and unlocking the endgame, you emerge again in the underworld. You’re free to head back out and keep hacking and slashing your way to the surface, but in order to earn more rewards you’ll have to choose harder and harder conditions.  The most frustratingly punishing of those conditions is Heightened Security. It adds +400 damage to traps and magma, which means you can be one-shotted for a silly mistake like stepping backward into a lava pool while trying to avoid an enemy’s attack. It’s the kind of unsatisfying death that leaves you kicking yourself for your carelessness, when you should be focusing on getting back out there to kill your dad again.  15.  Ghosts ’n’ Goblins (1985; Arcade, Commodore 64, NES)  The average play session of classic run-and-gun platformer Ghosts ’n’ Goblins is probably somewhere around 15 seconds, making the game’s first level, Graveyard, the hardes","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaGFyZGVzdC12aWRlby1nYW1lLWxldmVscy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, per Miami based sportscaster Andy Slater with 640 AM, American Airlines (which provides those flights) is also providing a one time, non-stop flight for A&M fans from Easterwood on September 8 to Miami in order for them to see the Aggies take on the Hurricanes. Slater also reported that rhere will also be a return flight on September 10.  The Aggies and Canes are playing one of the most anticipated non conference contests of the 2023 football season that is a rematch of the game between the two teams from last season. A&M came into the 2022 season ranked in the top ten but lost the week before their game at Kyle Field with the Canes to unranked Appalachian State at home. Moving on from starting quarterback Haynes King to backup and LSU transfer Max Johnson was one distraction the Aggies had going into the game but another popped up the day of the contest when A&M suspended four players for violating team rules.  Although A&M's offense continued to struggle in the game, the defense stepped up versus the Canes and quarterback Tyler Van Dyke (who was getting some Heisman Trophy buzz) kept the Aggies in control for most of the contest. Miami had just three field goals going into their last drive of the game and the defense held them off on a last ditch drive to secure a 17-9 win. At the time, it seemed like a must win outing for the Aggies but things continued to go south afterwards for them. The Canes had their own problems as well as they lost to an unranked Middle Tennessee State team (also at home much like the Aggies' defeat at the hands of the Mountaineers).  As result, it's anticipated not due to the fact that it will be a matchup of two top 25 programs but rather an early indication of how well each team rebounds from identical 5-7 records last season. Both teams have had to re-tool their programs for different reasons and with different methodologies. The Aggies had to elevate a number of players from their top ranked 2022 recruiting class (per the 247 Sports Composite) into the starting lineup due to injuries with some of them such as former five star quarterback Conner Weigman now playing key roles. On the other hand, Miami hit the NCAA transfer portal hard by bringing in 15 players from various programs to upgrade their roster.  In addition, both head coaches, Jimbo Fisher at A&M and Mario Cristobal at Miami, are under the gun due to their respective seasons even though Fisher has nearly a decade remaining on his deal and Cristobal was wooed away from Oregon.

Pace University (N.Y.) scored 10 goals in the first quarter and never looked back en route to a 19-9 victory. The Setters (21-2 overall) blitzed WCU (22-1) with eight straight goals to open the game before the Golden Rams could even get off a shot.  West Chester had only two possessions in the first 12 minutes of the contest and both ended in unforced turnovers. Pace won the first 10 draw controls of the clash.  Senior goaltender Jess Gorr (Bishop Shanahan) did what she could to keep West Chester in the game, but it was nowhere near enough to halt the Setter’s momentum. Gorr made five saves during Pace’s opening run and finished the outing with 10 saves.  West Chester mustered just two shots and committed six turnovers in the first 15 minutes and that took the Rams out of the game. Sophomore Keri Barnett ended the 13-goal run by Pace in the second quarter with an individual effort at 7:53. Lindsay Monigle made it back-to-back tallies at the 5:42 mark, before Pace added a pair right before halftime to take a 15-2 advantage into the locker room.  West Chester mounted its comeback in the fourth quarter, getting the margin under 10 and stopping the running clock. The Rams scored five straight times in the second half to get within eight at 15-7. But, Pace scored its first goal of the second half at 11:16 to stop the bleeding.  Junior Hannah Stanislawczyk cut the deficit in half with 10:17 left to continue her goal-scoring streak and push it to 45 straight. She finished with two goals in the game.  Monigle led West Chester with three goals and three assists. She concludes her stellar career with 299 career points, which is sixth all-time at the school.  NOTES: West Chester was playing in its 11th Division II national championship game and falls to 2-9 all-time in that game … the 11 appearances in the title game breaks a tie with Adelphi (N.Y.) for the most championship game appearances … West Chester’s 22 wins on the year tied the NCAA Division II record for most in a single season … the 18 goals allowed are the most by a team in an NCAA Tournament game … the nine goals scored by the Golden Rams was the lowest total of the season … West Chester’s Stanislawczyk, Monigle and Gillian Peters were named to the All-Tournament Team following the game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bG9jYWwuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvd2VzdC1jaGVzdGVycy1iaWQtZm9yLXBlcmZlY3Qtc2Vhc29uLW5hdGlvbmFsLWNyb3duLWZhbGxzLW9uZS1nYW1lLXNoedIBcWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bG9jYWwuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvd2VzdC1jaGVzdGVycy1iaWQtZm9yLXBlcmZlY3Qtc2Vhc29uLW5hdGlvbmFsLWNyb3duLWZhbGxzLW9uZS1nYW1lLXNoeS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T21:17:21","LOS ANGELES — The bad ole’ days for this Los Angeles Lakers season are far behind them, rendered irrelevant first with a series of trades to remake the Lakers on the fly and secondly with wins against the Memphis Grizzlies and Warriors in the first two rounds of the playoffs.  The last-second 3 from Indiana, the blown call in Boston, the missed free throws in Philadelphia, the load management no-shows and the no-spacing nightmares all erased by a surge of competence that put them here, Saturday night, hosting a game in the Western Conference finals.  But even though those moments are forgotten, the scars from them are still here, visible in the heavy legs, the heaving chests and the flat jump shots and the rimmed-out free throws.  They’ve climbed to get to these Western Conference finals, a trip that started with a sprint through the final 25 games of the season to worm their way into the postseason.  Now facing their conference’s best team, the past has come to collect.  It wasn’t that they weren’t willing to fight. They had repeated chances to give up, to call it and move on to the unspoken fate that awaits all NBA teams that trail 3-0.  But Saturday, with the season essentially on the line, the Lakers simply couldn’t climb anymore.  Despite coming back to lead in the fourth quarter, the Lakers got flattened by another Denver run that put their season on the brink of finality, the Nuggets winning 119-108.  The Lakers will try to avoid elimination Monday at Crypto.com Arena. No team in NBA history has ever come back from being down 3-0 in a series.  “Difficult but not impossible,” coach Darvin Ham said of the Lakers’ situation.  Anthony Davis had 28 points and 18 rebounds, LeBron James had 23 points and 12 assists and Austin Reaves added 23 points. Jamal Murray had 37 points for Denver and Nikola Jokic added 24.  “It’s not over,” Davis said.  It’ll take unprecedented history, though, to keep this going.  After the Lakers got outscored by nine in the fourth, the team is staring at a set of problems they haven’t been able to solve in any meaningful way for more than moments.  When the Lakers have guarded Murray, Jokic has hurt them. When they’ve managed to slow both, former Laker Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Michael Porter Jr. or Bruce Brown have delivered the dagger.  “I think they are just… they are big. They are very physical. They are fast,” Rui Hachimura said. “So you know, those are things hard on us right now. We have just got to try and win the next game.”  Hachimura scored 13 off the bench, but the Lakers’ other key role players were nowhere near effective enough.  Dennis Schroder scored only five points as he tried to hound Murray. Jarred Vanderbilt had only two points and for the third straight game D’Angelo Russell struggled, making only one shot in eight attempts.  “All good looks. All good looks. He just has to remain aggressive,” Ham said of Russell. “All good looks.”  They need to start falling because the Lakers’ tank looks empty.  “This chase is heavy,” Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea narrated over a hype video that played with 3:48 left. No one knew it better than the Lakers, who spent all season chasing only to have to do it again in Game 3.  Needing a fast start, the Lakers stumbled from the tip. By the time the last of the courtside celebrities filled into their seats, they were down 10, Murray picking up right where he last left off.  After torching the Lakers for 23 points in the decisive fourth quarter of Game 2, Murray scored 17 points in the first Saturday, hitting eight of his first 10 shots to immediately send the Lakers into scramble mode.  “He got off scorching,” Ham said.  Jokic, the two-time MVP, didn’t even make a basket until four minutes into the second quarter, but by then, the Lakers were already moving full speed to try and recover.  The Lakers trailed by as many as 14 in the first half before they began to chip away. Reaves and Davis carried the offense while the Lakers defense turned the faucet off on everyone but Murray, who scored 30 in the first half.  “Once he gets going,” James said. “It’s hard to turn him off.”  The Lakers fought back to tie the game in the third quarter and inched ahead to lead by one on three different occasions, with Denver answering loudest after the Lakers went up 94-93.  The Nuggets, who turned a three-point deficit into a 12-point lead in Game 2, hit the Lakers with a 13-0 run in the fourth Saturday to leave the Lakers behind.  “That was the game,” James said.  It might be the series. It might be the season.  Maybe, the Lakers are primed for history — who better than a 13th-place team that spent most of the season staring up at .500 clinging to the slim hope of the postseason.  “Climbing uphill basically all season to get to this point, and it’s the same thing here,” Davis said. “You know, obviously it’s a steeper climb being down 0-3. But we are going to keep taking it one game at a time and try to get better and come out with a win on Monday.”  They’ll try and recover Sunday — “refill their cups” as Ham has said throughout the season. After wins, after losses, the Lakers have always managed to do it. They did it through trades, through losing.  So belief is still there.  “I mean, it should be. I hope so,” James said. “I can’t speak for the guys right now because I don’t know what’s going on through all their minds right now. But I still do.”  The past has to be the place where it comes from. Because from what the Lakers and James have seen through three games this series, there’s not much hope here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL2xha2Vycy1vbi1lZGdlLW9mLXByZWNpcGljZS1hZnRlci1nYW1lLTMtbG9zcy10by1udWdnZXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:07:00","Shohei Ohtani finishes his outing strong by striking out the side in the top of the sixth to rack up nine strikeouts.  ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Anytime that Shohei Ohtani is on the mound, the Los Angeles Angels are confident they can come out with a win.  Ohtani struck out nine in six innings and Mickey Moniak delivered his second big hit of the series with a two-run double in the seventh as the Angels defeated the Minnesota Twins 4-2 on Sunday.  Alex Kirilloff homered and Carlos Correa had an RBI double for the Twins, who dropped four of six on their Southern California road trip.  Ohtani did not get a decision despite allowing only one run and two hits. It was the fourth time in 10 starts this season the two-way superstar has had nine or more strikeouts.  “It was a really good one today,” Angels manager Phil Nevin said. “He's got five wins and kept us in every game. He's given up some runs when we've taken the lead but he seems to have got us to the finish line with us having that lead. He knows when to dial it back for sure.”  The Angels improved to 8-2 when Ohtani starts and took a three-game series for the first time since early May. Ohtani leads the majors with a .142 opponent batting average and is third in strikeouts with 80.  Ohtani threw 99 pitches against the Twins. Of his 62 strikes, 22 were whiffs, which tied his season high.  “Getting the swings and misses are huge and better than having them fouled off. So I’m making my pitches and that's a good sign,” Ohtani said through an interpreter.  Moniak, who had a tying triple Friday night, delivered a two-run double in the seventh to give the Angels a 3-1 advantage. Pinch-hitter Matt Thaiss drew a leadoff walk to chase starter Pablo López (2-3) and Zach Neto followed with a double to right off Jorge López to set it up for Moniak.  Moniak also nearly robbed Kirilloff of a home run in the eighth. He tried to make a diving catch into the left-field stands on Kirilloff’s solo shot down the line, but the ball popped out of his glove.  “I'll take the game-winning hit all day,” Moniak said. “It's good to get a series win on a day game.”  Chris Devenski (2-0) got the win and Carlos Estévez picked up his 12th save.  Correa got the Twins’ first hit in the third inning. His double to right-center drove in Joey Gallo, who got aboard with a two-out walk.  The Angels evened it in the fourth. Hunter Renfroe and Jared Walsh opened the inning with base hits before Gio Urshela’s sacrifice fly brought home Renfroe.  AL Central-leading Minnesota was competitive in every game on the trip against the Dodgers and Angels, but all its losses came in late innings.  “When you lose a handful of close ballgames that you either had the lead in or you had clear opportunities — several clear opportunities — and don’t capitalize, it’s a hard one to swallow,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “We’re on the verge of playing complete baseball games but we’re not there yet.”  RETURN TO FORM?  Sunday's outing was more in line with what Ohtani showed at the start of the season, when he allowed only two earned runs and eight hits in his first five starts.  The right-hander was 2-1 in his last four outings, but had given up 17 runs and 18 hits, including eight home runs.  “I was trying to control the home runs and not make them feel comfortable at the plate. I was trying to make sure they were not taking good swings,” Ohtani said about Sunday's outing.  The only thing Ohtani wasn't pleased about was his three walks and also a hit batter.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Twins: DH Byron Buxton got the day off after he exited Saturday's game due to right leg tightness.

Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board game is being developed with the official sign-on of developers Motion Twin and Evil Empire studios.  ""We can tell that the designers had played Dead Cells and that they weren't interested in simply doing a carbon copy,"" said studio Motion Twin. Dead Cells was first released in 2017 and has been a perennial roguelite hit ever since, even attracting such high-profile crossovers as Castlevania.  The board game is designed by a pretty all-star cast in French studio Kaedama, made up of design quartet Antoine Bauza (7 Wonders), Corentin Lebrat (Draftosaurus), Ludovic Maublanc (Cyclades), and Théo Rivière (The Loop). They're all people I'd trust to design it alone, let alone together. It'll be published by Le Scorpion Masqué, which is also the publisher of the quite-popular Decrpypto and 2022's Turing Machine.  Perhaps most promising is the language and marketing around this thing. It's not a grasping pile of fancy miniatures and tacked-on expansions right out of the gate—as so many board game adaptations are: Clearly designed to be maximum value extractors upon your wallet. It's just a clear base game, one miniature and fancy tokens included in a deluxe version, all card driven and ready to play.  Everyone's got their action cards to use, their upgrades and mutations to buy, and that's it. It's also not promising to replicate Dead Cells on the tabletop, more to make a faithful adaptation based on what Dead Cells is. It at least sounds like the kind of functional and reserved core design I'd expect from this team.  A session of the board game will take around 45 minutes and play 1-4 people. You can actually play it now for free, including in solo mode, over on board game site Tabletopia.  In short? On the surface it at least looks like an all-star cast of designers are heading up a promising, no-gimmicks board game adaptation. You can find Dead Cells: The Rogue-Lite Board Game on Kickstarter, and you can demo it for free on Tabletopia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3RoZS1kZWFkLWNlbGxzLWJvYXJkLWdhbWUtaXMtb2ZmLXRvLWEtcHJvbWlzaW5nLWNyb3dkZnVuZGluZy1zdGFydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-07-26","10:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T14:30:00","ChatGPT has flipped the business world upside down, and suddenly it seems that every company is talking about artificial intelligence (AI). The implications of the new generative AI tech are vast, but there's also a lot of hype in the market -- some AI stocks have jumped by more than 100% this year.  However, if you're looking for an under-the-radar option in AI, you may want to take a closer look at Appian (APPN 4.87%). The cloud software company is best known as a provider of low-code technology. It offers an integrated product suite that allows enterprises to improve and automate their digital workflows.  Appian's software suite already includes robotic process automation, a similar technology to AI that automates repetitive tasks. Now, the software company is taking a step forward with new AI products.  Appian and AI  CEO Matt Calkins laid out his company's approach to AI in the company's latest earnings report, describing an emerging split between public and private AI.  As Calkins sees it, public AI tools like ChatGPT have gotten the lion's share of the attention in the last six months, but there's a problem. Many companies don't want to send their data to OpenAI or Microsoft, where they have no control over how it's used.  Many of Appian's customers, including the federal government and large banks, handle sensitive information, and some of them may also face legal restrictions on how they process customer data. They don't want to train an algorithm that their competitors could use; they want customized AI solutions that have been designed specifically for them.  In other words, they want a private AI, and that's where Appian sees a huge opportunity. Its technology, called data fabric, gives it the ability to assemble large data sets that can then be used to train private AI algorithms to service its customers.  At its recent Appian World conference, the company unveiled a number of new AI capabilities, including AI Skill Designer, a low-code way to deploy custom machine-learning models, and it has made an OpenAI/ChatGPT generative AI skill extension available on the Appian app marketplace.  It's also launching a new AI product called Process HQ, which will make its process mining solution much faster to deploy using AI tools.  Will Appian launch a chatbot?  While the company didn't discuss any plans for a chatbot, the response to ChatGPT has shown how popular the chat interface is when applied to AI. It would seem to be a good fit for both public and private AI since enterprises need a seamless way to communicate to take advantage of AI, much as everyday ChatGPT users do.  Still, investors should also be mindful not to focus too narrowly on chat when it comes to AI stocks since the applications of generative AI go well beyond the chat feature.  Appian's aim to use AI to automate tasks for its customers and allow them to be more productive should add more value to its product suite.  Is Appian a buy?  The software stock is down sharply from its peak in 2020. It has trended with the broader software sector, which has been hit hard by the bear market as valuations have collapsed and growth rates in the industry have slowed.  However, Appian has delivered a steady performance along the way, posting 31% cloud subscription revenue growth in the first quarter. The company continues to lose money, but said it would trim its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss margin to within 10% by the second half of the year.  If it can show meaningful improvement on the bottom line and gain traction in its AI initiatives, the stock could have a lot of upside potential.  Keep your eye on the Process HQ rollout this year and the company's other AI investments. Appian could be a hidden winner in artificial intelligence with its focus on private AI.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2dldC1haGVhZC1vZi10aGUtZ2FtZS13aGljaC1zdG9jay1jb3VsZC11bnZlaWwtYS1jL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Brooke Otto doubled off the left field wall to score Mariana Torres in the fourth inning, extending McNeese’s lead to 4-0.  The Cowgirls stretched the lead to 6-0 in the fifth. Emily Phillips walked with the bases loaded to score Reyna. Torres followed with a sacrifice fly to score Gomez.  McNeese forced a deciding game with a 1-0 win earlier in the day. Poncho produced the game’s only win with a towering home run to center field.  Whitney Tate made it hold up, throwing a complete game shutout. Washington loaded the bases in the bottom of the seventh, but Tate induced a game-ending grounder.  Tate allowed eight hits and two walks while striking out two.  UL-Lafayette advanced by beating LSU twice Sunday. The Cajuns won the opening game 7-4, then nearly blew a 6-0 lead in the second game before rallying for a 9-8 win by scoring two runs in the top of the seventh inning.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- — Willy Adames, Rowdy Tellez and William Contreras homered, and the Milwaukee Brewers avoided a three-game sweep by beating the major league-leading Tampa Bay Rays 6-4 on Sunday.  Tampa Bay (34-14) dropped to 21-4 at Tropicana Field, the second-best 25-game home record since 1901 behind the 1978 Boston Red Sox at 22-3.  The Rays did have their lead in the tough AL East drop to 2 1/2 games over Baltimore, which beat Toronto 8-3 in 11 innings.  Adames, on the second anniversary of his trade from the Rays to the Brewers, hit a solo homer off opener Jalen Beeks in the second, and Tellez hit a fourth-inning, two-run drive against Cooper Criswell (0-1).  “This game really, almost, encourages ups and downs because you get results thrown at you every single day” Brewers manager Craig Counsell said of Adames. “We love to be around people that don't get affected by it, and that's what Willy is really good at. That smile that we see everyday is a reason to feel good no matter what's going on.”  Freddy Peralta (5-3) gave up three runs and five hits over six innings as the NL Central-leading Brewers (25-21) stopped a three-game skid. Devin Williams, the third Milwaukee reliever, pitched 1 1/3 innings for his seventh save in as many chances.  Josh Lowe had a three-run homer, three hits and four RBI for the Rays, whose 91 home runs lead the major leagues.  Owen Miller extended his career-best hitting streak to 13 games with a leadoff single and scored on Contreras’ homer off Cooper Criswell (0-1) during a three-run fifth that put the Brewers ahead 6-3.  Adames, who has a team-best 59 homers and 181 RBI since joining the Brewers, playful mimicked Rays' slugger Randy Arozarena's folded arms pose after going deep, which drew a smile from the left fielder.  “He had said earlier today that he was going to hit a home run and then he was going do the pose and I didn’t believe him,” Arozarena said through a translator. ""But obviously he hit a home run and just posed.""  Arozarena and Harold Ramírez drew one-out walks in the fourth from Peralta, and Lowe tied the score 3-3 with his home run.  Arozarena was hit on the pinky finger by a Peter Strzelecki pitch in the eighth but remained in the game. He stole second and came home on Lowe's single for a 6-4 lead.  “It's OK, ” Arozarena said.  Williams replaced Strzelecki with two on and two outs, and after walking Manuel Margot got a nice play from Miller, who fielded Isaac Paredes' grounder behind third and threw to second for a forceout.  It was Williams' first appearance since a five-out save Tuesday at St. Louis.  Criswell, recalled from Triple-A Durham before the game when reliever Ryan Thompson was optioned, allowed five runs and eight hits on 4 2/3 innings.  Tampa Bay's Yandy Díaz doubled in the seventh and has a career-best 14-game hitting streak.  SPECIAL DELIVERY  Mexico's Secretary of Foreign Affiars. Marcelo Ebrard, presented Arozarena with his 2023 World Baseball Classic all-tournament team award and threw a ceremonal first pitch to him. Ebrard helped Arozarena gain citizenship in Mexico after the outfielder defected from Cuba in 2015.

The White Sox, having won the first two games of this series, now feel this as thoroughly as any Royals fan. Entering this series the White Sox were a mere two games ahead of the Royals for the AL Central basement. They now have a comfortable four-game lead as they head into the series finale.  For their part, the Royals have decided to give Carlos Hernández another start. Hernández had been relegated to bullpen duty full time entering this season, but after injuries and ineffectiveness and a large number of strong outings, he got a chance to start against the Padres in Wednesday’s series finale. He pitched two scoreless innings which means he’s ready to go again today. It is unclear to me how long he’ll be allowed to pitch this time, but considering the dire state of the rotation I imagine they’re going to have to try stretching him out.  The White Sox, on the other hand, will ask veteran Lance Lynn to take the ball for them. The 36-year-old veteran is in his third season with Chicago but has struggled mightily to the tune of a 6.66 ERA. His .360 BABIP and 4.76 FIP suggest he’s had some bad luck, but still hasn’t pitched particularly well. He started against the Royals on May 10 and took the loss while allowing seven runs in only five innings. Kansas City will hope for similar results today.

"game","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Bluffdale"", ""Utah"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T03:02:06","Estimated read time: 5-6 minutes  BLUFFDALE — When soccer coach Eric Adams meets with his players, they come prepared. They've watched videos of their performances, analyzing their technique and their position on the field.  Oh, and they're all between the ages of 9 and 10.  Copper Mountain Soccer Club, based out of Bluffdale, Herriman, Riverton and South Jordan, has been using Trace technology for a little over a year to level up its players.  Trace is at the forefront of new artificial intelligence video technology that films games and then culls each player's performance into a highlight reel. Instead of rewatching an entire 90-minute soccer game, players and coaches can study the few minutes that are relevant to each player's development in the sport.  ""You want to celebrate your wins with your kids. You want to learn together from the losses. And Trace fixes that by automatically editing highlights for you,"" said David Lokshin, Trace founder and CEO. ""So instead of having to rewatch the full game … you just binge on the content.""  It may seem surprising that such young athletes are already using AI technology to improve their game. Lokshin said 45% of the coaches who signed up for Trace in April lead teams ages 11 or younger, some as young as 4 years old.  But Adams said using AI in his coaching has been instrumental in helping his players learn the structure of the game, see the progress they're making and visualize their position on the field. Drone footage allows players to see where they fit on the team and solve problems with spacing and movement.  Promotional video shows how Trace tracks each player on the pitch, providing downloadable video highlights and other data throughout the game. (Photo: Trace)  Renata Lawson, coaching director at Copper Mountain, said she loves how using AI in sports allows players to do more self-teaching.  ""The older they get, the more they understand and the more they can learn on their own,"" said Lawson, who coaches youth athletes ages 13 and older. ""But they have to have the proper tools, and Trace makes it possible for them to do that.""  In one-on-one training sessions, Adams shows his players footage to put them back in the moment of the game. He then asks them what their thought process was and to analyze how their decisions affected the rest of the game.  ""A lot of it is player-driven. It's getting them to actually have a little bit of reflection time as to how they played, rather than just that immediate feeling,"" Adams said. ""It allows that dialogue to occur in a much more structured environment that's actually fun for them. That's where the learning really happens.""  Adams said his athletes can't wait to watch their footage after each game, which keeps them engaged in the learning process involved in becoming better soccer players. They watch their highlight reels and come to him with specific questions and insights based on their performances.  Lawson also noted how much better a player's comprehension of his/her strengths and weaknesses becomes after watching their own performance.  ""When they're watching those moments back-to-back, they start to recognize their own patterns,"" Lawson said. ""It becomes more apparent to them without any instruction involved at all.""  Tracing it back  Lokshin never meant for his technology to evolve into a company. He started using code in 2010 to edit GoPro footage taken while skiing and surfing.  ""Once you have your own GoPro footage edited for you, you realize, 'Oh my gosh, what if my entire life was like this?'"" Lokshin said. ""And that was really the genesis of Trace.""  The tech company, based in Austin, Texas, started around four years after Lokshin first started editing his own video footage. Trace now offers video editing for soccer, baseball and softball, with technology to incorporate additional sports in development.  Lokshin's video technology originally used sensors attached to each player to help AI figure out how to distinguish between teammates. Now, it uses a form of AI called computer vision, that helps the program identify and differentiate between individuals on its own.  'A really exciting time'  Lawson thinks the way teams recruit players will change as AI begins to play a larger role in sports. Instead of traveling to get exposure to national teams, or making sure college scouts are present during important games, players can now clip highlights to send to recruiters.  Adams believes AI will also be crucial for players who get injured but still want to keep up with the cognitive aspects of their sport. Virtual reality drills and exercises, even just done for a few minutes a day, can keep them from falling behind.  Once you have your own GoPro footage edited for you, you realize, 'Oh my gosh, what if my entire life was like this? – David Lokshin, Trace founder  AI will also help coaches continue to track metrics and measure how many of their goals they are meeting on a regular basis, Adams said.  ""Kids and parents typically see wins and losses as the only metric, and there's so much more to it than that in sports,"" Adams said.  Lokshin sees only positives when it comes to the future of AI in sports. He pointed out that most concerns with the development of AI come down to the generative aspect of it, whereas using video in sports is about mining data, not creating it.  ""What I think that the future holds is that you don't have to do any of that editing. You don't even have to do any of that filming. The content just reaches you,"" Lokshin said.  A 2023 survey by Trace found that 61% of clubs plan to use more video next season. Additionally, 50% of club directors say that all clubs will be filming their games by 2025 and 38% of clubs expect even noncompetitive youth teams to use video.  ""We're at this breaking point where AI is going to make getting the highlights that you care about really, really easy, and that's going to be a watershed moment for people,"" Lokshin said. ""It's a really exciting time.""  ×  Photos  Most recent Artificial Intelligence stories","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtzbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81MDY0NjE3OS9ob3ctYWktaXMtY2hhbmdpbmctdGhlLWdhbWUtaW4teW91dGgtc3BvcnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Per B/R's Chris Haynes, Lakers head coach Darvin Ham said center Mo Bamba is set to return from the ankle injury that has kept him sidelined since the team's first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies.  Bamba has been forced to sit out nine straight playoff games, and he returns to find Los Angeles facing a 3-0 deficit in the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers lost Game 3 to the Nuggets on their home floor at Crypto.com Arena on Saturday night.  Bamba was acquired by Los Angeles in a deal with the Orlando Magic at this season's trade deadline. The 25-year-old appeared in just nine regular-season games for the Lakers and averaged 3.7 points and 4.6 rebounds in 9.8 minutes per game.  The return of Bamba would provide Los Angeles with another option to try to defend Nuggets star big man Nikola Jokic. The two-time MVP is averaging 27.0 points, 14.7 rebounds and 11.3 assists in the conference finals while shooting 52.6 percent from the field and 45.5 percent from three-point range.  While slowing down Jokic is a top priority for the Lakers, they've also had no answer for point guard Jamal Murray, who is dominating the series with an average of 35.0 points per game. The 26-year-old appears to be extra motivated to avenge Denver's loss to Los Angeles in the 2020 Western Conference Finals.  The Lakers are hoping to become the first team in NBA history to make its way back from a 3-0 series deficit. However, that is a tall task against a talented Nuggets team, even with the return of Bamba.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDc2ODI2LWxha2Vycy1uZXdzLW1vLWJhbWJhLXNldC10by1yZXR1cm4tZm9yLWdhbWUtNC12cy1udWdnZXRzLWFmdGVyLWFua2xlLWluanVyedIBiAFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwNzY4MjYtbGFrZXJzLW5ld3MtbW8tYmFtYmEtc2V0LXRvLXJldHVybi1mb3ItZ2FtZS00LXZzLW51Z2dldHMtYWZ0ZXItYW5rbGUtaW5qdXJ5LmFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Phoenix welcomed Griner with a fitting introduction and ovation for their superstar center.  Griner took a moment to soak it in.  “There may have been a little dust in my eye,” Griner said. “It was emotional in the back. Just hearing and seeing some of the clips and then coming out…Part of the process of healing is just kind of letting it out…I got choked up a little bit. Tried to hide it but you caught it.”  As Mercury head coach Vanessa Nygaard has repeatedly said – “it’s a miracle” that the former MVP candidate is back playing basketball since being wrongfully detained in Russia for nearly 300 days.  Ambassador Roger Carstens, the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs who played a big role in getting Griner back to the US, was at the game in support of her.  “On a personal level, I was sitting there crying with Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman from Texas,” Carstens said. “It was a very emotional moment for both of us…where the team sits in Washington, D.C., we knew that this day was going to come. We knew it was going to be hard…what we saw today was exactly how I pictured it. BG home. Cherelle [Griner] cheering her on. BG’s family in the crowd and BG back on the court doing what she does best, and that’s playing basketball.”  Brittney Griner stopped her postgame press conference to embrace Ambassador Roger Carstens.

That momentum ignited a solid start from the Mercury, but the Sky responded by following their leader, Kahleah Copper (15 points, five rebounds).  While Griner is the one working her way back to full-go, through the first two games, it’s actually the rest of the team that needs to catch up with her.  She followed up an 18-point, four-block performance in the first game by dropping 27 points (9-13 FG) to go along with 10 boards and four blocks in the home opener.  “Just getting back into it,” Griner said. “Going hard. Teammates believing in me. Supporting me. Means a lot. In that preseason game, my defense was horrible…that was my big focus. That’s effort.”  Turnovers continued to be an issue (19) for PHX, as well as getting outscored in the paint 36-28.  “A couple of those are – I don’t want to say anything so I won’t get fined – offensive fouls,” head coach Vanessa Nygaard said. “Working the timing…I think it will take a little bit of time but there will be a lot of focus placed on that because that number’s still way too high…in a close game like this, take away five of those turnovers…it would be a big difference for us.”  It’s also the second game in a row Phoenix gave up 11 offensive boards.  Diana Taurasi had a frustrating outing, grinding out 16 points on 5 of 17 shooting as well as a technical in the third quarter.  In her first game of the season coming back from a left knee injury, sharpshooter Sophie Cunningham (2 points, 0-3 FG, 19 minutes) had trouble finding her spots within the game’s flow.  “Overall, we got to get better at execution,” Nygaard said. “Second game of the year and we have a lot of work to do…Sophie will be there. She’s gonna fight and work. I look forward to having a better performance from everybody on Thursday.”  Despite a fourth quarter surge by the Mercury, Chicago escaped Phoenix with a 75-69 win.  “We did some great executing coming out of timeouts, not there at the very end, but we did a great job on that,” Nygaard said. “We got some important stops. Defensively, we had a lot of great effort in the second half.”  “Trying to tighten up the small things,” Griner said. “Not rushing. Just trying to find the best option. I think we definitely need to come out like that. We can’t wait. This league is so good. We can’t wait until the second half to tighten it up because at that point you’re really in an uphill battle.”  Griner and the Mercury will be back in front of the home crowd on Thursday as they face the Lynx at 7 pm.

Yankees manager Aaron Boone and Reds manager David Bell were ejected in the first and eighth innings, respectively.  Boone and Bell are the first opposing managers to be ejected in the same game this season. The matchup might've been a perfect storm for the two of them. Boone has the most managerial ejections over the past three seasons, while Bell has the second-most, according to ESPN Stats & Info.  Boone managed to get booted before noon, a rare feat. And while it was his 29th career ejection, it was his first to come so early in the day. The ejection came in the bottom of the first inning, when a dropped foul ball from Yankees right fielder Jake Bauers was deemed to be a fair fly ball after a replay review.  Boone's frustration didn't seem to come from the call but as a result of the umpires' allowing the Reds' Jonathan India to score from first base on the play.  Bauers fell on a sliding attempt to catch the ball, which first-base umpire Nestor Ceja signaled was a foul when India was rounding second base. Bauers didn't rush to throw home and get India because he rightfully assumed the play was dead.  Then the Reds successfully challenged the play.  To the surprise of Bauers and Boone, crew chief Brian O’Nora announced that the fly ball from Spencer Steer was fair for a double, and India was awarded home plate.  A run is a run ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ pic.twitter.com/USmrzST7rC — Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) May 21, 2023  Boone quickly jumped out of the dugout to argue, and O’Nora was equally quick to kick him out.  It was a somewhat predictable development, as managers are meant to receive automatic ejections for arguing replay review decisions.

It was the only run the right-hander gave up as he struck out five in 4⅔ innings.  The Yankees took the lead in the fifth when Harrison Bader hit a two-run homer off Hunter Greene. Gleyber Torres added a solo home run in the sixth.  In the bottom of the eighth, Bell took issue with an apparent quick pitch from the Yankees' Wandy Peralta.

The Israeli team missed a number of chances in the first half at the Diego Maradona Stadium, where they played in front of a crowd of 7,500 spectators.

Italy raced to a 3-0 lead in the Group D match, opening in the 11th minute when midfielder Matteo Pratti shot from close range. Italy doubled its lead after Brazil goalkeeper Mycael failed to stop a cross and left the ball for a clear header by midfielder Cesare Casadei in the 27th. Casadei added a third in the 35th from the spot.  Brazil regrouped and scored two goals through striker Marcos Leonardo, the first in the 72nd and the second with a header in the 87th, but it was too little too late.  Senegal was stunned early by Japan in its Group C match in La Plata. Striker Kuryu Matsuki scored in the 15th and that allowed the Japanese to sit back.

"game","2023-09-01","10:00:00","{""Knoxville"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T14:51:20","What do you see as the most dangerous game on the Dawgs’ schedule this fall? Looking ahead to a season where Kirby Smart’s eighth Georgia team is likely to be favored every regular-season game, fans are left wondering which opponent might provide the Bulldogs with an unexpectedly tough time.  I put that question to family, friends and UGA fans on social media this past week, and the results turned out just as I’d expected: Most Dawgs fans I heard from think the trip to Knoxville to face the Tennessee Vols is likely to be the toughest on the regular-season schedule, though South Carolina’s early season visit to Athens drew a surprising number of mentions. Meanwhile, my brother Tim sees no dangerous game at all on the schedule. “The Dawgs have more talent than any team we play,” he said. “If we avoid injuries and we play every game with aggression, like the natty, we’ll pretty much roll through the season. If I had to choose, I guess it would be Tennessee, but I don’t think the Vols will be as good this year. They lost too many of their playmakers.” Of course, the odds heavily are against a preseason exercise like this one actually managing to predict the toughest games of a season. I mean, last summer the opener against Oregon had some folks nervous, and, after that, everyone figured the biggest obstacle would be Tennessee, which came into Sanford Stadium ranked No. 1 and riding the usual wave of media hype that pops up any time a Vols team shows that it’s not terrible. HYOSUB SHIN / AJC , Dawgnation However, as it turned out, the Dawgs took care of UT pretty handily. (I know Vols fans like to credit the Athens crowd as a big factor in that win — seven false starts! — and the UT die-hards promise that Georgia will face likewise this year. But, somehow, the Dawgs prevailed the last time they visited Knoxville, so … yeah.) Meanwhile, who would have predicted that the Dawgs’ toughest regular-season game last year would be against Missouri? OK, I’m sure someone did, because even a mediocre SEC team usually has enough talent to play the Dawgs close for at least three quarters. Plus, there’s that whole “trap game” thing, where a highly rated team facing a lesser opponent gets caught flat-footed.  Actually, last season seemed to find the Dawgs’ minds on something else during several of the games in which they were an overwhelming favorite. And my daughter Olivia, who’s been following UGA football her entire life, expects that to happen again. “There will be a game this season where we should roll, but we will scrape through by the skin of our teeth,” she said. Curtis Compton / Curtis.Compton@ajc.com , Dawgnation Thankfully, though, Smart has accrued so much talent with his elite recruiting that, even when they fiddled around for two or three quarters last season, his team prevailed — and, ultimately, ran the table. That certainly doesn’t appear likely to change any time soon. As I said, the most frequently cited choice for most dangerous game on the schedule this year is the final regular-season conference game, the Nov. 18 bout with the Vols in Knoxville. If Tennessee and its up-tempo offense live up to their billing in the program’s third season under head coach Josh Heupel, this game could decide who will represent the SEC East (which will go away after this year) in the conference championship game. Quarterback Hendon Hooker and star receiver Jaylin Hyatt are gone, though. Hooker’s likely successor, Joe Milton, showed promise in the Vols’ win over Clemson in the Orange Bowl, but there’s a 5-star freshman, Nico Iamaleava, waiting in the wings. Ole Miss Athletics , Dawgnation  Of the betting odds released so far for the 2023 Dawgs, this one has the closest spread, with Georgia favored by 7.5 points. (All the other preseason point spreads have the Dawgs favored by double digits.) My buddy Scott Peacocke sees Tennessee as “the only dangerous game” on the schedule. “That’s not to say they can’t possibly lose to another team — a la South Carolina in 2019,” he said, but “no other team can stay within two touchdowns of our talent.” Joel Provano, with whom Scott and I text during UGA games, agreed. “Tennessee should be the only real challenge, unless we suffer a meltdown at quarterback, and I don’t see that happening. Carson Beck should be solid at worst, and that’s good enough to get to Atlanta. If he’s significantly better than that, we may be looking at a threepeat.” Retired sportscaster Bill Hartman pegged the Vols as the most dangerous game “only because it is at Knoxville,” and Darrell Huckaby also pointed to Tennessee, though he added: “I don’t like the way everyone assumes wins against the others.” (Yes, he’s a longtime Georgia fan.) Of course, as I pointed out earlier, conventional wisdom about Georgia’s toughest regular-season game was wrong last year, and, considering the vagaries of college football, that could be the case again this coming season. Perry McIntyre , Dawgnation  So, let’s take a brief run through the rest of the schedule to see which opponent might prove to be this year’s Mizzou. As noted earlier, South Carolina, the conference opener for Georgia on Sept. 16, also drew quite a few mentions as a potentially dangerous game, despite it being played in Athens and the Dawgs being a 24-point favorite. As former All-America UGA safety Bill Krug pointed out, the Gamecocks could be “a tough match,” because they are one of the few teams “that have a veteran QB returning.” That quarterback is Spencer Rattler, who finished last season looking a lot better than when his team got hammered 48-7 by Georgia early on. The Gamecocks staged a couple of big upsets over Tennessee and Clemson late in the 2022 season, and appear to be trending upward under head coach Shane Beamer, a former UGA staffer. UGA fan Mark Symms also sees the Border Bash as an early season trap game. “Coach Beamer has his team believing they can beat any team,” Mark said. “We had better watch out when playing them. They are going to play hard and tough. I won’t be surprised if they are ahead at the half. We will need another intense Kirby halftime speech to put a W at the end. There’s no doubt we have better players. But the game is tied up at the opening kickoff. ... We need to shut down their offense from the beginning and watch out for the trickeration.” Stuart Townsend agreed: “USC has a great coach, and I truly believe they’re on the way up.” The next most-mentioned worrisome opponent on the Dawgs’ schedule was Ole Miss. Georgia is a 19.5-point favorite over the Rebel-Black Bear-Landsharks, who most likely will be led by returning QB Jaxson Dart, though it could be Oklahoma State transfer Spencer Sanders. Ole Miss also has productive running back Quinshon Judkins, and had a lot of players coming and going via the portal in the offseason, so, at this point, they’re a bit of a mystery.  Jason Getz / Jason.Getz@ajc.com , Dawgnation However, I get the impression the main reason some UGA fans are wary of Ole Miss is the possibility of brattish head coach Lane Kiffin pulling some trick out of his sleeve. There’s also Kentucky, which played Georgia close last year in a 16-6 loss, prompting Smart to say afterward that, sometimes, “you gotta win ugly.” Will Levis is gone at QB for UK, but North Carolina State transfer Devin Leary, a sixth-year senior, is a proven passing threat, though he’s coming off a season-ending injury. And, instead of a freezing, windy day in Lexington, the game will be Between the Hedges, where the Dawgs are 24-point favorites to beat the Wildcats. The annual hate-fest in Jacksonville sometimes proves to be closer than expected, but Georgia’s a 21.5-point favorite there, and with the Gators having to replace Anthony Richardson at quarterback (Wisconsin transfer Graham Mertz is the likely pick), that one doesn’t look too threatening. UGA fan Dusty Carnes, meanwhile, believes that if the Dawgs “can stay healthy, focused and humble,” nobody can beat them. But, he added, if he had to pick a most dangerous game, Georgia playing “at Auburn, and with a new starting QB and his first true road game, that would be it.” You never can say never in the SEC, but the Dawgs, who won 42-10 last year, are an 18.5-point favorite on the Plains. And you can’t count out Missouri, which put a scare into the Dawgs last season in a 26-22 game where Georgia played its worst football of the season and didn’t take the lead in the game until there was only 3:12 left to play. As for the rest of the schedule, despite Georgia fooling around last year with Kent State before finally winning 39-22, I couldn’t find anyone who thinks Football Championship Subdivision school UT Martin or UAB of the American Athletic Conference are a threat to the Dawgs. But I did have one fan each peg Ball State of the Mid-American Conference and SEC doormat Vanderbilt as potential trap games, though I wonder whether those might have been tongue-in-cheek replies. Finally, one of the reassuring things about having another UGA football season on the horizon is knowing that, when it comes to them Dawgs, some things never change. My brother Jonathan always predicts an undefeated national championship season (he finally got it last year!). And, as any listener to the Bulldogs radio network knows, Jeff Dantzler always has one overwhelming concern about any season: beating the Jackets. Last year, the Trade School capitalized on an unexpectedly slow start by the Dawgs in Athens to make things close for a half, before falling 37-14. So, Jeff’s entirely expected answer to my query this year was: “Gotta beat Tek.” Jason Getz , Dawgnation ‘UGA ATHLETICS IN YOUR TOWN’ My friend Jason Hasty of the Hargrett Library in Athens is taking some of the UGA athletics artifacts in their archive on the road to public libraries around the state again this summer, starting this week.

They have posted 6-2 and 6-5 wins in 10 innings at Toronto and they can sweep this series this afternoon at Rogers Centre.  In the 2018 season, the Orioles went 0-10 at Rogers Centre and that was not even against a winning Toronto team. While the Orioles went 47-115 that year, Toronto was 73-89.  This has just been a tough place for the Orioles to win over the years and today Baltimore (30-16) begins to play five games ahead of Toronto (25-21) in the standings.  The O’s win Saturday was another comeback win as Ryan O’Hearn’s three-run homer in the eighth tied the game at 5-5 and Félix Bautista fanned five over the last two innings to get the win. Baltimore starter Grayson Rodriguez allowed two runs and four hits over five innings. And O’s starters have allowed nine hits and three runs in 12 innings this series. The O’s offense has scored 12 runs, hitting five homers this weekend.  The Orioles did not pick up their 30th win until Game 68 last year on June 19 when the club was 30-38.  Baltimore has won four of five, eight of 11, 13 of 20 and 21 of the last 30 games. They have wrapped up another series win after Saturday’s victory and are 11-3-1 in 15 series, going 6-2 in road series.  The Orioles got homers from Cedric Mullins and O’Hearn yesterday and have hit seven home runs the last three games, 13 in the previous six and 15 in their past eight games.  The Orioles are 8-6 in AL East games, going 6-2 in their past eight. Toronto is 5-11 in division games, going 1-9 in the last 10 with records in that span of 0-4 vs. Boston, 1-3 against the Yankees and 0-2 against the Orioles.  Right-hander Dean Kremer (5-1, 4.94 ERA) gets today’s start, his 10th of the season. Over 47 1/3 innings he has allowed 54 hits with 13 walks and 36 strikeouts. He has a 1.415 WHIP, a 2.5 walk rate, and a 6.8 strikeout rate and the Orioles are 6-3 in his games.  Kremer gave up 11 homers in 125 1/3 innings in 2022 for a 0.8 home run rate, which is 1.5 this season with eight homers allowed on the year.  Kremer has won his past three starts, going 3-0 with a 2.04 ERA, allowing four runs in 17 2/3 innings. In that span, he allowed a .242 average and .589 OPS. Over his past six starts, Kremer is 5-1 with a 3.34 ERA.  Right-hander Kevin Gausman (2-3, 3.27 ERA) will make his 10th start for the home team.

TORONTO -- — Cedric Mullins got five hits, Austin Hays drove in the decisive run in the 11th inning and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 8-3 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.  Mullins had three RBI and Hays reached base four times for the Orioles, who scored five runs in the 11th to win for the fifth time in six games and secure their third sweep of 2023.  “This was huge,” Mullins said. “We had a couple of battles in this series and we were able to come out on top. It’s a huge confidence boost going into New York.”  It was Baltimore’s first three-game sweep in Toronto since April 2005. The Orioles hadn’t swept an AL East opponent in a three-game series since doing it at Boston in early April 2021.  “The AL East is a difficult division,” Mullins said. “For us to pull a sweep off today just kind of shows where we are as a team.”  Mullins singled, stole second and scored in the third. He singled in the fifth and doubled in the seventh. He hit an RBI single in the 10th and then drove in two runs with a double in the 11th.  “He’s just playing an unbelievable brand of baseball right now, on both sides,” Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said.  Baltimore took a 3-2 lead in the top of the 10th when Mullins hit a first-pitch single off Nate Pearson to score automatic runner Jorge Mateo from second base.  Toronto tied it in the bottom half against Austin Voth when Whit Merrifield’s single brought home pinch-runner Daulton Varsho.  Right-hander Mike Baumann (3-0) replaced Voth and immediately picked off Merrifield at first base.  Hays broke the tie with a one-out single off Yimi Garcia (1-2) in the 11th, and pinch-hitter Terrin Vavra added a two-run single for the Orioles.  Those who remained in the sellout crowd of 41,643 booed after Mullins chased Garcia with a two-run double.  Toronto’s Matt Chapman hit a solo home run and had two RBI but the struggling Blue Jays lost for the sixth time in their past seven.  “The effort is there, the results are not,” manager John Schneider said. “You hate going through stretches like this.”  Blue Jays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier made the defensive play of the game, a sensational leaping catch at the wall in left-center to retire Gunnar Henderson for the first out of the fourth.  Chapman opened the scoring with a leadoff drive in the second, his sixth. The homer was his first since April 18 at Houston.  Baltimore took the lead with two runs in the third but Toronto tied it in the seventh when Chapman hit a bases-loaded sacrifice fly off Mychal Givens.  Givens was making his first appearance of the season after being activated off the injured list before the game. The right-hander struck out Merrifield to keep it tied.  Facing his former team for the third time, Blue Jays right-hander Kevin Gausman allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings. Gausman threw a season-high 115 pitches. He walked two and struck out four.  Orioles right-hander Dean Kremer allowed one run and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out seven.  Cionel Perez replaced Kremer after Alejandro’s Kirk’s one-out single put runners at first and second in the sixth. Pinch-hitter Danny Jansen walked to load the bases but Perez got Kiermaier to ground into a double play, one of three for the Orioles.  “We played really well defensively today,” Hyde said.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Orioles: Baltimore activated Givens (left knee) off the 15-day injured list and optioned LHP Cole Irvin to Triple-A Norfolk.

In a moment of déjà vu with a major twist, Sanchez was started behind the plate for the home team in a Sunday afternoon MLB game in New York.  Two days after he was called up from Triple-A by the Mets, the former Yankees slugger got the nod to catch Max Scherzer and bat eighth in the lineup for the first game of a doubleheader against the Guardians, going 1-for-3 with a sac fly in the Mets’ 5-4 comeback win.  “It feels good to be back here in New York after all those years,” Sánchez said through an interpreter before not playing in Friday’s series-opener. “It’s a different team, but it’s still the same city, so it’s exciting to be here.”  Sanchez was an All-Star in 2017 and 2019 but his career spiraled from there, leading to a trade to the Twins after the 2021 season.  He was released upon request from the Giants organization earlier this month without getting out of Triple-A.  His last MLB at-bat was on Oct. 5, 2022.  Rookie Francisco Alvarez has emerged as the Mets’ starting catcher with Omar Narvaez (strained calf) and Tomas Nido (dry eye syndrome) on the injured list.  But teams rarely use the same catcher in both ends of a doubleheader, which meant Saturday’s rainout essentially guaranteed that Sanchez would start one of Sunday’s games at Citi Field.  Mets manager Buck Showalter said “a lot of factors” went into determining which game Sanchez would start but declined to reveal any specifics.  Gary Sanchez will make his Mets debut in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Guardians on Sunday. Jason Szenes for the NY Post  “I don’t like Gary waiting around too long,” Showalter said. “You don’t want to get too far away from catching. Like I said, it would shake out. This is the way we are going to go today. We’ll see what the future holds.”  Scherzer and Sanchez did all the normal pregame planning to eliminate the need for too many mound visits, but Showalter was most interested in what happens “on the fly” when there is a deviation in the plan.  “A little different today because Gary hasn’t caught him,” Showalter said.  Scherzer pitched six shutout innings before the bullpen coughed up a three-run lead in the eighth.  Gary Sanchez in the Mets dugout during a game against the Guardians on May 19, 2023. Jason Szenes for the NY Post  Sanchez was a career .111 hitter with one home run and five RBI in 12 games at his new home ballpark entering Sunday.  But he was swinging a hot bat for the Mets’ Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse, compiling a 1.014 OPS in 37 plate appearances since May 9.  “As long as I’m healthy,” Sanchez said, “I can do a lot of good things.”  Sanchez actually is getting a second chance to make a first impression on New York.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2dhcnktc2FuY2hlei1tYWtpbmctbWV0cy1kZWJ1dC1pbi1nYW1lLTEtb2YtZG91YmxlaGVhZGVyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2dhcnktc2FuY2hlei1tYWtpbmctbWV0cy1kZWJ1dC1pbi1nYW1lLTEtb2YtZG91YmxlaGVhZGVyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Those that haven't purchased the game are in luck, as the title has gotten a heavy discount on the Epic Games Store. Through June 15th, the base game has been discounted to just $19.99, which is a 60% discount. That's pretty good on its own, but the deal is made all the sweeter thanks to the current Epic Coupon, which drops eligible purchases down an extra 25%. That knocks LEGO Star Wars down to just $14.99! The coupon can be claimed right here, while the game can be purchased right here.  As its name implies, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga spans the nine films that make up the Skywalker Saga, leaving out Solo: A Star Wars Story and Rogue One. Players start the game having access to the first movie in each trilogy: The Phantom Menace, A New Hope, and The Force Awakens. Players can start them in any order they choose, and subsequent movies in each trilogy are unlocked as each one is completed. While the base game does not include content based on films or shows outside the Skywalker Saga, there have been several DLC packs released for the game, including The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, Clone Wars, and more.  In addition to the base game being discounted, all of the DLC is currently marked down, as well. Unfortunately, the DLC only offers new playable characters. That means that players should not expect any additional story content or missions. There have been rumors about a possible expansion or whole LEGO game based on The Mandalorian, but nothing official has been revealed just yet. For now, Star Wars fans will have to settle for the current content, but thankfully The Skywalker Saga offers a whole lot to do for players that have yet to experience it!

Seager had a two-run homer for the second straight day, scoring three times and also singling. He returned Wednesday after missing 31 games with a strained hamstring.  Texas scored 31 runs in the sweep, its most in a three-game series since 2018 against Minnesota. At 29-17 the Rangers are 12 games over .500 for the first time since finishing 2016 at 95-67. They have outscored opponents 297-189, the largest run difference through 46 games in franchise history, topping 90 in 2012.  “This lineup’s really good,” Seager said. “It’s contagious. Everyone wants to keep passing the baton and moving.  Josh Jung put Texas ahead in the second against Connor Seabold (1-1) with his ninth homer, a solo drive that tied the Los Angeles Dodgers’ James Outman for the rookie lead.  Leody Taveras hit a three-run double just inside the left-field line as the Rangers opened an 11-0 lead in the fifth. Texas leads the major leagues in runs per game (6.46) and double-digit games (12).  Marcus Semien also had three RBI. Josh Smith homered in a two-run eighth inning off Alan Trejo, a second baseman making his second mound appearance this season.  Andrew Heaney (3-3) won for the first time in five starts since April 22, allowing one run — unearned — and six hits in six innings.  Seabold allowed five runs and five hits in 3 2/3 innings. He made his fourth consecutive start, promoted from the bullpen because three starters are on the injured list.  Matt Carasiti, called up from Triple-A Albuquerque before the game for his first big league appearance since 2019, gave up six runs in the fifth on five hits and three walks.  SHORT HOPS  Nine of Jung’s last 21 hits have been for extra bases. … Rockies LF Jurickson Profar went 2 for 5, extending his on-base streak to 29 games. … Colorado is 0-24 when trailing after seven innings. … Trejo has given up homers in each of his two pitching appearances this season.  SEEN THIS MOVIE  The Rockies failed to score off Heaney in the second inning after loading the bases with none out. That happened Saturday in the first inning against Jon Gray.  “Eerily similar,” Rockies manager Bud Black said.  “It’s a case of really good pitchers having that ability to raise their game when they need to,” Texas manager Bruce Bochy said.  Heaney accomplished the same thing last weekend at Oakland, both times closing the inning with a pitcher-to-catcher-to-first base double play.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Rockies: RHP Dinelson Lamet (lower back stiffness) pitched four perfect innings with four strikeouts for Albuquerque on Saturday night and is being considered for a spot in Colorado’s rotation.

Since our road was dirt-packed with little traffic for long periods of time, we used it like a playground. Well, a playground without swings or slides. More like a long-deserted sandbox with no cat clumps.  Someone came up with a game suitable for anyone who could ride a bicycle. Today, it would probably be comparable to a G-rated version of ""Jackass: The Movie."" Before I explain the rules of the game, I have two disclaimers. One: Do not try this at home! Other than offering up an earnest prayer, I don’t have a single connection in this town to get me out of a legal jam.  Two: In no way am I making fun of the disabled. Many of my relatives are mentally or physically handicapped and some don’t even know it. I am pretty sure I know who I am today. Who knows about tomorrow? I have been told I am not right in the head. Does that mean I am left in the head? Do I need to get out of my head? Maybe get more into my head? Or am I in need of a full head examination as some have suggested?  On to the game. We blindfold a bicycle rider while the others would give simple directions to go left, right or straight to guide the rider from hitting the mailbox or crashing into the ditch. Despite being a good sport, Mom stuck to being a spectator after the earlier ditch dive on our mini bike. Good thing, Mom would have creamed our mailbox, of that I’m sure.  We stacked empty soup cans in a pyramid and took turns knocking them over with another can. First one to get them to all fall over won. I don’t remember winning anything but bragging rights. Another game was rolling tube socks into balls and firing them at each other with the lights off in the basement, using flashlights to illuminate moving targets. Kind of like a nifty thrifty Nerf-style toy.  One year, my dad made a pair of wooden stilts. It took a lot of practice to master walking with them. The elevated viewpoint was neat but it wasn’t so much fun tumbling from it. We shot BB guns at various things. I always liked to hear the ping, ping sound when a BB hit a tin can. I remember a few BB’s that lodged where they should not have. Oops and sorry.  We had beautiful willow trees in our backyard. Besides providing great shade in the summer, the trees became a little jungle for me. Before nature kicked in, I swung like Tarzan from the long, strong branches. I would have said I swung like Jane but something tells me she was never a swinger. Besides, I probably resembled the monkey more than Jane at that age; all arms and legs. I do think my Tarzan yell at the time would have rivaled Carol Burnett’s.  Although Larry and I prefer to be outside, we do love our tech gadgets. While packing for our northern vacation last fall, I was matching chargers to everything that would need charging. Thank heavens for label makers and reclosable, plastic bags. I still messed them up. Much to my dismay(?), I forgot to pack the charger for the Kindle tablet we play Scrabble on. Larry and I have friendly competitions. We keep tabs on winning streaks and top scores. I sincerely hope Larry doesn’t think I purposely forgot the Kindle charger to try and thwart him encroaching on my 8-game winning streak. I pinkie swear, I would never, ever stoop that low. I’m only 5-foot, 2-inches tall. Stooping any lower is basically useless.  Rita Zorn is a wife, mother, grandmother and lifetime Monroe County resident.

As it stands now, Denver leads Los Angeles in the best-of-seven series 3-0. One more victory and the Nuggets will make franchise history with their first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals.

London Entertainment / SplashNews  Back in the day, Nicholson attending a Lakers game would not make for much of a headline, as the now-retired iconic actor has been a super-fan seen courtside for decades. However, he has largely been out of the public eye for some time after stepping away from his Hollywood career, which in turn gave way to speculation about his health.  Perhaps that is the reason he is once again been a fixture at the Crypto.com Arena as the Lakers have made an impressive run in the post-season after a mediocre regular season.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:51:00","              May 21 - Here's a combination of disturbing facts to ponder before Sunday's game against the Boston Red Sox if you are a fan of the spiraling San Diego Padres.  Padres starting pitchers have given up four or more runs in four straight games and six of the past seven. The Padres have scored a total of 10 runs in those four games, all losses. They have dropped eight of their past nine and 11 of their past 12.  Now, here's the silver lining.  On Monday, in his most recent start, right-hander Michael Wacha allowed one hit in seven shutout innings. He issued one walk with 11 strikeouts. And he didn't allow a hit until Kansas City's Michael Massey -- the last hitter Wacha faced -- opened the eighth with a line-drive single to right ending the no-hit bid.  On Sunday, Wacha (4-1, 4.06 ERA) starts the finale of a disastrous Padres homestand against a Boston team for which he was 11-2 last season with a 3.32 ERA in 23 starts.  And as if to rub salt in the wounds, the Red Sox will counter with 37-year-old right-hander Corey Kluber (2-5, 6.41).  Kluber was originally a fourth-round draft pick of the Padres in 2007 and quickly became a top prospect. But on July 31, 2010, the Padres sent Kluber to Cleveland in a three-way trade that brought outfielder Ryan Ludwick to San Diego. Kluber won two Cy Young Awards with Cleveland. Ludwick hit .228 with 17 homers and 90 RBIs in 160 games with the Padres.  Padres fans still talk about the Kluber-for-Ludwig trade. Maybe a Wacha win Sunday would reduce some of the sting of 2010 as well as the latest loss of 2023, a 4-2 decision to the Red Sox on Saturday. A three-run home run in the second inning by Enmanuel Valdez off Padres starter Joe Musgrove was all the offense Boston would need.  ""Joe made one bad pitch and it beat us,"" Padres manager Bob Melvin said Saturday night after the team's slide escalated.  The Padres had only three hits Saturday. They were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position and are 0-9 for the two games against Boston, lowering their MLB-worst RISP average for the season to .191.  They did have two homers Saturday as Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr. hit solo shots. But Padres infielders Ha-Seong Kim and Jake Cronenworth both failed to make tags. Although the plays were ruled outs, both were reversed on appeals by Boston manager Alex Cora -- and both runners scored, accounting for half the Boston runs.  Now it's Sunday and the Padres are facing a sweep and a potential 1-5 homestand. Overall, they are 11-15 at home.  For Kluber, the Padres offensive woes represent an opportunity to turn a corner. Over his three starts in May, Kluber has given up 10 runs on 19 hits and seven walks in 15 1/3 innings for a 5.87 ERA.  ""His command wasn't sharp, there was a lot of traffic, but he battled and gave us five innings,"" Cora said after Kluber's most recent start against the Cardinals last Sunday, a 9-1 loss.  For Wacha and Kluber, it's the ninth start of the season for each. Wacha has worked 44 1/3 innings and the Padres are 6-2 when he pitches. Kluber has worked 39 1/3 innings and the Red Sox are 3-5 in his starts.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9wYWRyZXMtbG9vay1zYWx2YWdlLWZpbmFsLWdhbWUtaG9tZXN0YW5kLXZzLXJlZC1zb3gtMjAyMy0wNS0yMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T13:35:04","Notre Dame’s fingerprints have been all over the WNBA in recent years. It appears that won’t change any time soon.  On Friday, the WNBA opened up its season with six games between the 12 teams. There were nine performances between Friday and Saturday of 20+ points, and three of those — Dallas Wings guard Arike Ogunbowale (27), Las Vegas Aces guard Jackie Young (23) and Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd (22)— belonged to former Irish stars. No other school had more than one player on that list.  Unsurprisingly, Ogunbowale got off to a red-hot start for the Wings on Saturday, putting up 20 first-half points against the Atlanta Dream in Dallas. The Wings won, 85-78. Ogunbowale’s 19.7 points per game last season was tied for third in the WNBA with former Irish guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, who is currently with the Phoenix Mercury.  Young tied Kelsey Plum for the point title for the Aces on Saturday, as Las Vegas dominated a new-look Storm team, 105-64. The former No. 1 overall pick was the league’s Most Improved Player last year and helped lead the Aces to the franchise’s first championship.  In Seattle, the keys to the 2023 car are in Loyd’s hands. The 29-year-old veteran is now tasked with running a Storm offense devoid of Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart. Loyd averaged 16.3 points per game last season, which ranked 10th in the W. Look for that mark to increase over the course of this year.  In addition to Ogunbowale, Young and Loyd, seven other former Notre Dame players made opening day rosters at the next level. Only UConn has put more women on active WNBA squads.

"game","2023-05-24","Not Discerned","{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T19:56:10","RALEIGH, N.C. -- Sebastian Aho and Martin Necas sat at the podium one after the other at PNC Arena on Sunday and talked about how although the goals aren't coming, they don't need to do much different against the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final.  Carolina will hit the road for Game 3 at FLA Live Arena on Monday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, CBC, SN, TVAS) trailing 2-0 in the best-of-7 series following consecutive overtime heartbreakers, losing 3-2 in a quadruple overtime marathon in Game 1, and 2-1 just 1:51 into the first overtime in Game 2.  Of the Hurricanes' three total goals in the 10-plus periods of play, only one has been scored at 5-on-5.  ""I think that the effort has been there. It's not that,"" Aho said. ""We all worked our tails off and, especially last night, we definitely had enough to create more than one goal and kind of take the game over. But, obviously, they're a good team. They have a good goalie. We just have to keep finding ways to score more goals, but at the same time, we want to stick with what we want to do and keep them off the scoreboard.  ""It's not like they've been dominating us or any of that.""  Aho is correct. The Panthers did not dominate the first two games, but they made the big plays when they needed to be made, and many of them came from their top players.  Matthew Tkachuk scored the overtime goal in each of the first two games, and Aleksander Barkov has three points (two goals, one assist). Then there's goalie Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 63 saves in Game 1 before following up that effort with 37 in Game 2.  The Hurricanes controlled play for stretches in each game, including outshooting the Panthers 18-1 in the opening 11:31 of Game 2. But they had only a 1-0 lead to show for it, courtesy of a redirection from Jalen Chatfield off a centering pass from Aho at 1:43.  ""We had some chances both games,"" Necas said. ""There was a lot of chances that we didn't score on. … We've got to get more to the net and once you get one, then you feel a little more relaxed and then maybe you have a chance and you do something else. Then, if you don't score, you've just got to stay relaxed even though it's 2-0 for them and just got to play our game.""  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  Necas, who had NHL career highs in goals (28), assists (43) and points (71) during the regular season, has seven points (four goals, three assists) in 13 Stanley Cup Playoff games, including a power-play assist in Game 1 against Florida. Aho, who led the Hurricanes with 36 goals and was second with 67 points, has one goal in his past seven playoff games but has two assists against the Panthers.  Seth Jarvis and Stefan Noesen, who each has a goal and an assist, are the only other Hurricanes players with more than one point in the series.  ""It's a hard-fought series,"" Aho said. ""There's not much going on. Especially 5-on-5, there's not a lot of scoring chances either way. So, whenever you get your chance, you want to try to bury it.""  Jordan Staal is usually a reliable shutdown center against top offensive players, such as New York Islanders forward Mathew Barzal in the first round and New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes in the second round, but his line with Teuvo Teravainen and Necas has had trouble containing Barkov. In addition to scoring a highlight-reel backhand goal that tied the game 1-1 in the second period of Game 2, the 6-foot-3, 215-pound center has been a force controlling the puck at both ends of the ice.  Even the usually reliable defense pair of Jaccob Slavin and Brent Burns has had its troubles. They both combined on the turnover that led to Tkachuk's winning goal in Game 1, and on Tkachuk's winning power-play goal in Game 2, Slavin's stick got stuck in the bottom of Burn's skate while they were battling with Barkov in the right corner, which essentially took both out of the play.  ""It's a lot of little things,"" Necas said. ""I feel like both games could've [gone] either way. They've been a little better in the overtimes, and now we've just got to focus on the next one.""  The Panthers will have last change at home the next two games, so the Hurricanes won't have control of the matchups. Although Carolina coach Rob Brind'Amour said they'll consider some tweaks, he didn't sound like he wanted to do anything as substantial as shuffling his line combinations.  ""There's obviously things we can be better at, but it was good enough to win (two games),"" Brind'Amour said. ""It could've easily gone that way and we'd won two, you [wouldn't want to make big changes]. You have to be careful not to try to blow everything up and think it's not working.""  Teams that have taken a 2-0 lead in the semifinal round of the playoffs have gone on to win the best-of-7 series 90.7 percent (78-8) of the time. Teams that take a 3-0 lead in any best-of-7 series have gone on to win 98 percent (200-4) of the time, so the Hurricanes' margin for error is essentially gone.  Whatever approach they take in Game 3 needs to produce a victory.  ""That's the only thing we're thinking right now, just go out there tomorrow and play our best game and win a hockey game,"" Aho said. ""That's the main the goal and, obviously, that's what we'll be focused on doing.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5obC5jb20vbmV3cy9jYXJvbGluYS1zdGlja2luZy10by1nYW1lLXBsYW4tYWhlYWQtb2YtZ2FtZS0zLXZzLWZsb3JpZGEvYy0zNDQ1MDE3OTI_dGlkPTM0NDMzNDY1MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It has been subjected to countless delays, any gameplay released has been underwhelming, and reportedly, there’s a noose hanging around the project that has been put there courtesy of the Singaporean government.  Recently, a short series of images were leaked on Reddit, with the poster claiming that they reveal ‘the current state’ of Skull and Bones, Ubisoft’s teetering, live-service pirate epic. It has been five months since fresh gameplay was broadcasted by Ubisoft, and once again, it seems like the game could be delayed – or a cancellation agreement could be agreed.  Skull and Bones Needs to Sink  At this point, it seems bizarre to believe that Skull and Bones will ever be released, and if it is, there are almost no expectations that it’ll launch in any kind of a decent state. It has been in development for several years, and in that time, almost nobody – critics, fans, or otherwise – has had anything hopeful to say about the game.  Reportedly, the Skull and Bones project is only being kept alive because of an old deal between Ubisoft Singapore and the Singaporean government.  In the latest images to allegedly leak from inside the project, Skull and Bones kind of looks exactly like it did in the most recent gameplay updates, posted back in January 2023. It doesn’t seem as though huge leaps are being made, which was to be expected.  Recently, Ubisoft decided to triple down on its resources for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, hiring hundreds of developers to come into the fold and put a huge focus on what can be considered its flagship franchise. As far as we know, there’s nothing new being introduced to push Skull and Bones past the finish line.  People were tired of Skull and Bone years ago – now they’re just completely exhausted with it. Even if it does launch, we can’t see there being much support for the game past keeping the lights on, and the reception will almost certainly be completely underwhelming.

Game Summary: The Oklahoma City Dodgers closed out Sunday afternoon’s game with three unanswered runs, including scoring the winning run on a wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth inning, in a 5-4 walk-off win against the Sugar Land Space Cowboys at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. The Dodgers (33-12) trailed, 4-2, heading into the bottom of the eighth inning before Devin Mann sent a two-run homer out to left field to tie the score, 4-4. After a scoreless top of the ninth inning, the Dodgers drew three consecutive walks to load the bases with no outs in the bottom of the frame. After the next two batters were retired and with Patrick Mazeika at the plate, a wild pitch by Sugar Land pitcher Austin Davis allowed Ryan Ward to score the game-winning run from third base. Sugar Land (18-26) took the first lead of the day on a solo home run by Luke Berryhill in the second inning. The Dodgers grabbed the lead in the bottom of the inning when Mazeika lined a two-run double into center field for a 2-1 advantage. A solo home run by Marty Costes in the third inning tied the score, 2-2, before Pedro León’s RBI double in the sixth inning and Rylan Bannon’s solo homer in the eighth inning gave the Space Cowboys a 4-2 lead.  Of Note:  -The Dodgers secured their sixth walk-off win of the season through 21 home games, as well as their second walk-off win of the series against Sugar Land (also May 16)…It was OKC’s 10th last at-bat win of the season through 45 games and the team now has nine wins when trailing after seven innings and five wins when tied after eight innings.  -The Dodgers improved to 14-2 in one-run games and to 20-3 in games decided by two runs or less. Seven of the last eight games have been decided by one or two runs.  -OKC has now trailed at some point in 23 of their 33 total victories this season as well as in each of their last six wins and in 13 of their last 15 wins. The Dodgers have won 13 times after trailing by at least two runs.  -The Dodgers lead the PCL with a 33-12 record and OKC’s 33 wins through 45 games are the most by an OKC team through 45 games in the Bricktown era (since 1998). No other OKC team since 1998 has had fewer than 14 losses through 45 games…They have won 11 of the last 12 games and 12 of the last 14 games.  -Patrick Mazeika and Drew Avans recorded multi-hit games for OKC. Mazeika went 2-for-4 with a double and two RBI, while Avans went 2-for-3 with two walks. Avans has now hit safely in eight straight games for his longest hitting streak of the season and the longest active streak by an OKC player (10x32).  - Devin Mann’s two-run homer in the eighth inning tied the score, 4-4, and was OKC’s first home run in a four-game span. It was Mann’s second homer in his last five games after he hit a game-tying two-run homer in the eighth inning May 14 in Round Rock…Mann extended his on-base streak to 13 games — the longest current on-base streak by an OKC player.  -Pitcher Michael Grove opened a Major League Rehab Assignment Sunday. The right-hander pitched 4.1 innings, allowing two runs on solo home runs over 4.1 innings with three total hits, one walk and seven strikeouts. He faced 17 batters and threw 64 pitches, including 41 strikes and retired the last seven batters he faced. He suffered a right groin strain April 20 during a game with the Los Angeles Dodgers at the Chicago Cubs to land on the Dodgers’ Injured List. He was slated to be OKC’s Opening Day starter before being recalled to Los Angeles March 30 to replace injured pitcher Ryan Pepiot on the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Opening Day roster. He made four starts with Los Angeles in April, gong 0-1 with an 8.44 ERA over 16.0 innings with seven walks and 14 strikeouts.  -The Dodgers won the six-game series against Sugar Land, 5-1, winning at least five games in a series for the fourth time this season. The Dodgers have won seven of their eight total series to start the season. Sunday was Sugar Land’s 12th and final game at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark of the 2023 regular season.

The Bison will look to extend the best-of-three series when they face the Black Knights in game two on Monday.  The Black Knights posted 19 hits, including eight during a 10-run bottom of the third and four during an 8-run bottom of the seventh. The Bison racked up double-digit hits as well but left 13 runners stranded, including three in the top of the sixth and three more in the top of the seventh.  Jacob Corson put together a 3-for-4 day at the plate and broke the scoring open with a solo home run in the top of the first inning. Sean Keys also homered for the Bison and walked twice. Army sent three over the fence and finished the day with five doubles.  Army's Matthew Ronnenbaum received the win after going 5.2 innings and allowing nine hits and all five Bison runs. Bucknell used five arms, with freshman Hadley Maxwell going 3.2 innings over the middle portions of the game and holding Army off the board over three frames.  After Army evened the score at 1-1 in the bottom of the second inning, Bucknell regained the lead with its best offensive showing in the top of the third. With one away, Anthony Sherwin , Corson and Grant Voytovich all singled in succession, and Tyler Dunn drove in Corson on a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1 in favor of the Orange & Blue.  The Black Knights' bats came alive in the bottom half of the third, as they opened the frame with six consecutive hits before Will Greer entered the game and interrupted the barrage with a strikeout for Bucknell's first out. Army continued, however, as another runner was walked in, a single up the middle scored two more, and a grand slam pushed the lead to 11-3. Maxwell then entered, and the Bison defense turned a double play to end the inning.  Keys' two-run homer in the top of the fifth got Bucknell back in striking distance, but they were the final runs the Bison would score on Sunday.  The Black Knights capitalized on four walks and three Bucknell errors in the bottom of the seventh and added a pair of doubles to make it a 19-5 game, and they added one more home run the following inning.  Monday's game 2 is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. and will be broadcast on ESPN+. Bucknell defeated Army 13-3 in the second game of the 2022 Patriot League Championship Series after dropping the first.

Read more  Football changed Doug Macauley’s life back in the 1960s.  After its three-year hiatus, the Philadelphia All-Star football game will continue to do the same for today’s players, Macauley hopes.  “The goal is to turn it into one of the best all-star games in the country,” Macauley, president of the game’s executive committee, said Saturday inside a garage adjacent to the Northeast High School football field.  “The game was started in 1975 and the whole mission was to showcase the talents of the city and help kids possibly get a look from college coaches, and many have gotten scholarships.”  Advertisement  Saturday’s game at Northeast High marked the first city all-star game since 2019. The pandemic and its aftermath had scuttled subsequent seasons.  The Public League won this year’s rain-soaked installment, 38-30, at Northeast.  Lincoln’s Khani Knight was named offensive MVP on the Pub side. The 6-foot-2, 175-pound quarterback and defensive back intercepted two passes, including one for a touchdown.  Mastery Charter North’s Quintine Wright earned defensive MVP honors, while, in defeat, Non-Public players Jamir Robertson and Eric Gardner earned offensive and defensive MVPs, representing Roman Catholic and Archbishop Wood, respectively.  In years past, current NFL players such as Jihad Ward (Bok Tech) and Teair Tart (West Philadelphia) used recognition or motivation from the all-star game to earn college opportunities.  There was no all-star game in 1966 when Macauley graduated from Northeast, but someone opened a door that helped Macauley play college football at Tulsa.  » READ MORE: Archbishop Wood tight end Markus Dixon follows the standard set by Kyle Pitts  Team managers had once mistakenly told Macauley he had been cut from Northeast’s team until his coach, Charles Martin, for whom Northeast’s field is now named, told Macauley he had better return to practice.  “He took me under his wing after that,” Macauley said. “He took me to practices, camps — everywhere.”  Creating opportunities for others is what motivated Macauley when the executive committee met last summer to plan this year’s game.  Macauley said they knew the game’s legacy would face challenges after missing several seasons.  A 2019 scandal involving allegations of embezzlement against the committee’s former president, Brian Fluck, likely didn’t help the game’s brand.  Macauley, though, said he and Cliff Hubbard, the former longtime Roxborough football coach and one-time executive director of athletics for the school district of Philadelphia, always planned to revive the game.  » READ MORE: Roman Catholic’s Jamir Robertson has earned a football scholarship. Could boxing also be in his future?  Hubbard and Macauley were close friends who spoke weekly until Hubbard unexpectedly died in August.  Macauley spoke at the funeral and said the committee created a scholarship in Hubbard’s memory that could be awarded to an all-star player each year.  “I’m excited,” Macauley said of seeing their work come to fruition. “It’s always been our goal. Most of us played the game, coached the game, or evolved it somehow. We feel football brings people together from all walks of life.”  In order to organize this year’s game, though, Macauley and the committee also had to bring sponsors together.  Local businessman Mike Crawford, who owns the apparel company Holla Athletics, stepped in again.  Crawford, who represented Mastbaum for the Pub all-stars in 1997, helped rescue the 2019 game by donating free jerseys when the committee was hamstrung financially. His son, Mike Crawford III, also played in the 2017 game after starring at Imhotep.  SAFR helmets and Independence Blue Cross were among the other sponsors who made the game possible this season, Macauley said.  The future, he added, will require more support from sponsors, the city, and others.  » READ MORE: Roman Catholic’s Austin Ramsey is a big lineman with room to develop as he prepares for a future at Kentucky  Former area standout and current Buffalo Bills lineman Ryan Bates, who nearly quit football for good before starring at Archbishop Wood and Penn State, Macauley said, is expected to support the game. Macauley hopes the game’s other alumni will follow.  “Many of our (committee) guys are retired,” Macauley said. “To be honest it takes a lot of legwork, and a lot of our legs are tired. We’re trying to get some of the younger guys involved to maintain the game and take it to another level.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zcG9ydHMvcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLWFsbC1zdGFyLWZvb3RiYWxsLWdhbWUtMjAyMzA1MjEuaHRtbNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC1zcG9ydHMvcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLWFsbC1zdGFyLWZvb3RiYWxsLWdhbWUtMjAyMzA1MjEuaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-09-10","Not Discerned","{""Houston"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T10:10:00","HOUSTON -- — Houston catcher Martín Maldonado wasn't sure what to expect from Framber Valdez in Sunday's start after what he called a “crazy” warmup in the bullpen.  “His warmup wasn't normal for him,” Maldonado said. “He was doing some stuff where ... (I) was like, ‘What is that?'”  Turns out he had nothing to worry about.  Valdez pitched a four-hitter to lead the Astros to a 2-0 victory over the Oakland Athletics to complete a three-game sweep.  “He was masterful,” Houston manager Dusty Baker said.  Valdez (4-4) struck out seven without a walk, twirling a gem to bounce back after allowing seven hits and four runs in a season-low four innings in his last start. It’s his second complete game shutout, the fifth complete game of his career and first since Sept. 12 at Detroit.  He gave up a double to the speedy Esteury Ruiz with two outs in the sixth before retiring the next seven batters before Nick Allen singled to start the ninth. But he sat down the next three batters to close it out.  “That’s just Framber being Framber, pitching deep into the game,” Maldonado said. “He’s a guy that finds a way to get it done.”  It’s the third time Oakland has been shut out in the last 10 games and seventh time overall this season.  “Vintage Framber,” Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said. “A lot of ground balls. His sinker played today. It was down in the zone. The breaking ball off that lane is tough to pick up. We battled, we just couldn’t get to him.”  The victory extends Houston’s season-long winning streak to seven games, which is the longest active streak in the majors.  Baker thought Valdez's big game might have meant more to him after he struggled in his previous start, but the left-hander said he wasn't thinking about that.  “I’m a positive person,” he said in Spanish through a translator. “I try to go out there every single outing and just look at it almost like my debut, like this is my first time pitching. I really don’t think too much of the past and just try to go out there and work hard to try to get a good outing.”  Jose Altuve hit an RBI single in the fifth inning in his third game back after sitting out all season after breaking his right thumb in the World Baseball Classic. Yordan Alvarez scored on a wild pitch that made it 2-0 in the sixth.  Ruiz had Oakland’s only extra-base hit and added to his MLB lead by stealing his 24th base this season as the Athletics lost their fourth straight.  The Athletics are an MLB-worst 10-38, which is the worst record in franchise history after 48 game, and are on pace to finish 34-128.  James Kaprielian (0-4) allowed three hits and a run — both season lows — with four walks in five innings to remain winless this season.  “I thought Kap did a great job,” Kotsay said. “He gave us five innings. Overall, I think the stuff was good. The slider had some depth today. He got some punchouts. A few walks mixed in, but he hadn’t pitched in eight days.”  Kaprielian had walked four batters but hadn’t allowed a hit until Jake Meyers singled on a grounder to third to start the fifth. There was one out in the inning when Martín Maldonado singled to left field.  Altuve then laced a single to right field to score Meyers and put the Astros up 1-0. Ramon Laureano made a nice throw on the play to get Maldonado out at second before Kaprielian retired Alex Bregman to end the inning.  Ruiz doubled on a line drive to shallow left field with two outs in the sixth inning. He was initially called out at second, but the Athletics challenged the call, and it was overturned.  He stole third base but was left stranded when Valdez struck out Brett Rooker.  Alvarez doubled to start Houston’s sixth before José Abreu walked. Kyle Tucker grounded into a force out that left Abreu out at second and sent Alvarez to third.  Second baseman Jordan Diaz robbed Jeremy Peña of a hit with a leaping catch before Tucker stole second base. Sam Moll then bounced a breaking ball in the dirt for a wild pitch and Alvarez slid home just ahead of the tag to make it 2-0.  Maldonado doubled in the seventh before Altuve walked. Sam Long relieved Lucas Erceg with one out and walked Alvarez to load the bases. But Abreu grounded into a doubled play to end the inning.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Athletics: OF Seth Brown (left oblique) is scheduled to join the team in Seattle on Monday where it will decide if he’s ready to return. Brown, who was injured April 8, went 5 for 13 in four rehabilitation games in the minors. … LHP Ken Waldichuk was progressing Sunday after leaving Friday’s start in the sixth inning with a mild left calf strain. Kotsay said he’s hopeful that he can make his next start.

The two sides skate to the sixth-longest game in NHL history, with Florida eventually winning in the fourth overtime. Game 2: Matthew Tkachuk scores the overtime winner again, giving the Panthers a 2-0 series advantage.  NEWS & NOTES  It Takes Two To Tango: Although the Panthers earned victories in both Games 1 & 2 to start the series, Head Coach Rod Brind'Amour felt as if his team played well enough to win in both games. Carolina will need to generate more offense though, only being able to beat Sergei Bobrovsky three times on 103 shots in 201 minutes thus far.  Capitalizing When You Can: Carolina was the far superior team out of the gate on Saturday, not only claiming the game's first goal but also outshooting the Cats 16-1 at one point. While those things were great, the team talked about getting more than just one goal of offense when things were going so far in their direction.  The fight is far from over 😤 pic.twitter.com/fx4usyNLRS - Carolina Hurricanes (@Canes) May 21, 2023  Doesn't Matter Who: Antti Raanta made his first start since Game 5 of the first round on Saturday, drawing in after Frederik Andersen played nearly seven full periods of hockey in Game 1. Raanta was strong once again, showing no signs of rust in his 24/26 performance. The question begs though, does the team stick with the Finn, or turn back to Andersen for this evening?  Chatty's On The Board: Canes defender Jalen Chatfield recorded his first NHL playoff tally in Game 2, getting Carolina on the board just 1:43 in. The Hurricanes are one of just two teams with goals from five different defensemen in these playoffs (SEA: 6), and their eight total goals from the blue line trail only Florida (9) and SEA (9) for the league high.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T21:50:58","Sunday’s Game Report: Cardinals 10, Dodgers 5  By Rob Rains  The competition for playing time in the Cardinals’ outfield might be heating up again.  Taking advantage of Dylan Carlson’s sprained ankle, Oscar Mercado made his third start for the Cardinals on Sunday – and matched his career high by driving in five runs, three of them coming on a single and double off Clayton Kershaw, to lead the Cardinals to the win over the Dodgers at Busch Stadium.  In his three starts, Mercado has six hits in 11 at-bats with three runs scored.  “He just continues to find a way to create havoc one way or the other,” said manager Oli Marmol.  Including primary infielders Brendan Donovan and Tommy Edman, the Cardinals have used nine starters in the outfield so far this season, including top prospect Jordan Walker, who began the year in right field before being sent down to Memphis. Tyler O’Neill is also injured, but Carlson likely will be coming off the injured list sometime in the coming week.  Mercado is a former second-round draft pick by the Cardinals in 2013 who later was traded to Cleveland before coming back to the Cardinals’ organization this winter as a minor-league free agent.  “It’s fun to watch Mercado come back to where it all started and be able to contribute immediately to the team that drafted him,” Marmol said. “You’ve got a good team when somebody different is contributing every night.”  Sunday’s win was the third in the four-game series against the Dodgers and gave the Cardinals a 5-2 record on the homestand. They have gone 11-3 since May 7, when they snapped their eight-game losing streak that had left them with a 10-24 record for the season.  Here is how Sunday’s game broke down:  At the plate: Paul DeJong also had a big day as he drove in four runs, three coming on his seventh homer of the season, in the seventh inning. He also scored four runs … Mercado’s double in the second was the third double off Kershaw in the inning when the Cardinals scored their first three runs … His single in the fourth drove in another run as the Cardinals knocked Kershaw out of the game … They added three more runs in the fifth, highlighted by the two-run single from Mercado, matching his career high of five RBIs set on April 10, 2022 for Cleveland at Kansas City … Nolan Arenado had three hits and scored three runs, extending his hitting streak to 12 games … Edman also had three hits, including the first hit in his career off Kershaw, a double in the second, in 10 at-bats … The top three hitters in the lineup – Lars Nootbaar, Paul Goldschmidt and Willson Contreras – were a combined 0-of-14.  On the mound: Jack Flaherty was pulled after 4 2/3 innings, one out shy of qualifying for the win, with the Cardinals leading 4-2. He left with the bases loaded and one of the inherited runners scored on a balk by Drew VerHagen. Flaherty walked four in the game, including three in the fifth inning … VerHagen retired all seven hitters he faced and was credited with the victory … Matthew Liberatore allowed the final two runs for the Dodgers in the eighth.  Key stat: Mercado’s five RBIs were the most by a Cardinals’ hitter batting ninth in the order since pitcher Chris Carpenter drove in six runs on Oct. 1, 2009 at Cincinnati.  Worth noting: Marmol thought about putting Nolan Gorman into the starting lineup against Kershaw after his big home run Saturday night but instead decided to go ahead with a planned day off for Gorman. The Cardinals are in the middle of a streak of 19 games in 19 days … Liberatore will get another start on the upcoming road trip, but which game it will be has not been determined … O’Neill, who has been out since May 5 because of back tightness, will begin to ramp-up baseball activities on Monday but the team still does not have a timetable for his return to the lineup … Dakota Hudson made his first start for Memphis since April 19 on Sunday and needed 48 pitches to get through two innings. He allowed three runs, but two of them were unearned.  Looking ahead: The Cardinals begin a seven-game trip to Ohio on Monday night with the first of four games against the Reds in Cincinnati, which will be followed by three games in Cleveland. Jordan Montgomery is the scheduled starter. The game also starts a stretch that will see the Cardinals play 15 of their next 17 games on the road.

"game","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Niantic"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T09:00:00","Niantic's pitch for its new mobile app Peridot is enticing: Y2K-era nostalgia with the marvels of modern tech, a Tamagotchi for 2023.  If any company were to pull off such a feat, it'd be Niantic, which shifted global culture with 2016's Pokémon GO. Like Pokémon GO, Peridot uses augmented reality to layer a mystical animal — called a ""dot"" — over your real-life surroundings. They call it ""owning a pet, without the mess"" because there's nothing to clean or pick up after, and there's nothing to kill, either. In Peridot, your dot lives forever in the digital world, so the overwhelming guilt you still feel about neglecting your Tamagotchi as a kid won't apply here.  But while Peridot has the potential to be way less annoying and much more magical than the turn-of-the-century Tamagotchis, its schtick gets old just as quickly.  Starting off strong (and adorable)  Peridot gameplay is pretty simple: hatch a Peridot and help it grow from baby to teen to adult by feeding and playing with it.  Your Peridot will start its life with empty ""hunger"" and ""boredom"" bars, which you'll need to fill as its ""Keeper."" To procure food and toys, you'll need to draw a circle on your screen to show your Peridot where to ""forage"" in five types of real-life ""surfaces,"" as identified by AI: grass, plant, sand, dirt, water, and unnatural surfaces (brick, wood, and basically anything else). Each surface type yields different kinds of food and goodies, like patterned tennis balls. As you play fetch and toss them nibbles, the dots will become less hungry and more stimulated, gaining points toward their growth. Fulfilling their hourly desires, like ""look at a person"" or ""eat a spring onion,"" will also earn you points. Eventually, you'll earn enough for the dot to grow into a teen, and then an adult.  Pearl as a baby, then a teen, floating around my living room and sleeping on my bedroom floor. Credit: Niantic  The babies are squeak-inducing balls of fuzz with big, expressive eyes and short little legs. They can walk around on the floor of whatever environment you're in but they tend to float, too, leaving a trail of sparkling stars in their wake as they swim, wriggle, and flip in the air. This flying trait isn't just cute as hell, it's a convenient way for the game to avoid having the dots interact with objects in the environment that are harder for the AR algorithm to see or identify.  Once the dot becomes an adult, they are able to breed with other dots that are visiting nearby. You can send that dot's owner a ""Hatch-A-Dot"" request through Campfire, Niantic's messaging app. It's a clunky process that takes you out of the experience and requires you to actively check Campfire to see if the other Keeper has approved the request. Once they do (though sometimes they don't, probably because the Campfire feature is both hidden within the gameplay and not user friendly), an animation plays of your dot and their dot running around and swirling together until three eggs appear. Each egg's color and texture hints at the features of the baby dot inside, and an ""Eggs Ray"" can be purchased to see what each baby actually looks like.  Peel as a baby, hanging out in the harbor. Pitch playing fetch outside. Peel, as a teen, on a trip to a local diner. Credit: Niantic  I breed my first dot, Pitch, with two other dots visiting nearby by sending a ""Hatch-A-Dot"" request to their owners. When they approve, I hatch Pearl and Powder, who are spitting images of Pitch in different colors. That makes sense considering Pitch is one of their parents, and Pearl and Powder are half-siblings (I try to avoid thinking through this aspect of the game too often). But the game promises that no two Peridots are alike, and that there are more Peridots combinations ""than there are stars in the galaxy..."" so why are mine so boring?  My fourth dot is Peel, a ""banana-type"" archetype dot, which the game gives to me for free as a perk of being an early user. Apparently, there are 22 other archetypes the game says I should strive to hatch. But Pitch, Pearl, and Powder don't have a single archetype. This wounds my parent ego and confuses me as a user: Are my kids not all equally special?  My dot family. You can see that Powder and Pearl look just like their father, Pitch. Credit: Niantic Powder's desires for this hour: go for a short walk, practice tricks, and eat a dandelion. Credit: Niantic  Underdeveloped and overly complicated  After the initial shine wears off, it becomes clear the app isn't yet ready for primetime. While the gameplay can be almost mind-numbingly simple at times, the app's layout is ridiculously cluttered and the user experience is confounding. There are all kinds of interfaces and features that could be streamlined, simplified, or clarified in their purpose. For example, I received dozens of requests to Hatch-A-Dot with Pitch, but it took me more than two weeks to realize that, in order for him to be visible to other dots, I needed to manually add him to a nearby Habitat (a physical location akin to a local watering hole for dots). But how had other Keepers been able to see Pitch and hatch with him? I've had many of these head-scratching moments since I got the app, which add to a general feeling of messiness (ironic, since the app promises to be like ""owning a pet, without the mess"").  Another example is the process of trick training. You're supposed to give your dot food in exchange for practicing a trick, and you have to do this until their training is ""complete."" But it's unclear how to make your dot perform a completed trick in the wild without bribing them with food.  The game also taxes my iPhone 14 Pro's battery to the point of overheating. More than a few times, I have closed the game when my screen began to burn my fingertips.  And don't get me started on the two in-game currencies, which is one too many. ""Gemstones"" are used to purchase items in the Peridot shop and are earned by reaching a new Keeper level or as a reward for logging in every day. ""Sundrops"" are required to Hatch-a-Dot and are earned by completing Quests or foraging at Habitats and can also be gifted in the game. Of course, you can buy both gemstones and sundrops from the game store. I learned all this by looking it up online, because the game doesn't explain it at all.  Glitches galore: Pearl disappears into the flowers she is sniffing, desires are mistakenly listed twice, and Pitch's horn blends with his fur as he sleeps. Credit: Niantic  Plus, the augmented reality feature needs work. The dots glitch out almost constantly when interacting with their environment, either by blending in with their surroundings or blending in with themselves — like when their horns touch their own fur, for example. They sometimes walk in midair, followed by a shadow, as if walking on solid ground. Sometimes food will land next to the dot but they won't see it, so they'll just sit there together until the food swoops back into the knapsack it came from. The game is full of small idiosyncrasies like these that erode the joys of the user experience over time.  At a press event I attended for the app, Niantic reps said the game had been in the works for years. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell.  But wait! There's an expensive catch  The biggest disappointment is that, after the first few delightful days of using the app, it becomes clear that once your dot reaches adulthood there's really no need to ever interact with it again. That is, unless you need them for — and I can't believe I'm writing this — breeding. It seems that the point of the game is to level up as a Keeper and discover new archetypes of Peridot, and the only way to do that is breed, hatch, and raise a dot over and over and over again.  Therein lies the rub: While your first dot is free, hatching a new one requires buying a ""nest"" for more than 7,000 sundrops and $4.99, something Niantic conveniently neglected to mention at the press briefing. And if you're hoping to bypass that $4.99 charge by supplementing it with more sundrops or gemstones, you're out of luck. Peridot only accepts IRL money. That means to hatch the nine dots in the game's promotional photos, you'd have to spend around $40.  A promotional image from Niantic showing nine Peridots, which would cost around $40 to hatch. Credit: Niantic The interface for a ""Hatch-A-Dot"" purchase. Credit: Niantic  Take a look at the comments on Peridot's Instagram posts, and you'll see users are not happy about this, or that there's essentially a dead end to gameplay. ""Played till I got my two Dots to adulthood... haven't touched it since.. fun while it lasted,"" says one on a post from this week. ""This game will definitely not last long at this rate. How can you create a game with the purpose of hatching and creating more creatures but you have to PAY to experience the most important feature of the game??"" says another.  Peridot claims that dots were created to ""cultivate whimsy in the world."" But as one Instagram commenter noted, that's hard to do when it costs so much. ""Nobody can play due to your greedy pay to play scam,"" they wrote. ""The 'whimsy' is at an all time low.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcGVyaWRvdC1hcHAtbmlhbnRpYy1yZXZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

First spotted by Alpha Beta Gamer, this free Ludum Dare game jam project from developers Alec Gamble and Hannah Payne casts you as president Hugh Mann, a politician whose numbers would absolutely tank if the public found out he's actually a tentacle horror from beyond the cosmos. Do you have what it takes to keep it together and placate the American public, or will you slip up and reveal your otherworldly nature to all and sundry?  My first run through did not go so hot. You have to maintain a normal guy's speaking pitch with your mouse wheel, slap away your uncooperative tentacles when they pop up with a left click, remember to blink every few seconds by pressing the spacebar, and, most vexingly, individually pose each of your arms when prompted. Your left and right arms are mapped to ASDF/HJKL respectively, with each key representing its own position. This facet reminded me a lot of Bennet Foddy's QWOP, and frantically trying to do something normal with my hands every few seconds was a real frantic treat—Faking It feels like you're trying to keep plates spinning in the air, and I really dig its absurd, slapstick sensibility.  That first time through, I hit my poses and blinks just fine, but neglected my pitch, and the plebs just weren't having it: ""You blew it,"" my advisors informed me. ""Now you've gone and traumatised millions of people and your terrible secret has been revealed. This is going to cost you in the next election. Probably.""  My second time through went a lot smoother, and those shortsighted rubes—er, I mean, my valued constituents—were none the wiser as to Hugh Mann's celestial origins. That was only on the easiest of four difficulties, however, with increasing run times and more aggressive challenges available to test your capacity as a normal man—I know my capacity as a normal man is challenged quite enough by real life.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T22:21:51","FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) – A video of a spectator and referee fighting at a basketball game at SportONE Parkview Fieldhouse in Fort Wayne Saturday has gone viral across social media.  In the video, you can see the spectator approach the referee. The video then jumps to the two physically fighting.  A witness told WANE 15 a that the parent in the video was complaining about foul calls. After speaking to the referee, he was then asked to leave the game.  As the official attempted to get help in removing the parent, the man got in his face and grabbed the referee, according to the witness.  The witness then said the man was ultimately escorted out of the game and did not return. The witness claimed they showed officers the video of the incident.  The Fort Wayne Police Department’s activity log shows no record of being called the the Parkview SportONE Fieldhouse on Saturday. Public Information Officer Sgt. Jeremy Webb confirmed to WANE 15 on Monday that there was no record of FWPD responding to the incident.  Justin Shippy, the secretary and treasurer for the Northeastern Indiana Athletic Officials Association, told WANE 15 that the official in the video is part of their organization.  “I was shocked because you wouldn’t think that you would happen to see something like that here in Fort Wayne, Indiana,” Shippy said.  He added that the official has been great for their association and has worked a number of games. Shippy wouldn’t have expected to see that official involved in something like this.  “Not at all. I would not see him [getting involved], that’s very unlike him,” he explained.  The game was part of a Gym Rats Basketball tournament between Team Robinson 2027-PINK and Bluewater Hurricanes from Michigan. The players are in eighth grade.  “We’re talking eighth grade basketball here. We’re not talking about the national championship that we watched on CBS here a few months ago,” he added.  Shippy said it’s his understanding that the parent seen throwing punches at the official is from the Bluewater Hurricanes team.  In the grand scheme of things, Shippy said this incident is part of a larger problem across the country.  “The way things have been nowadays with fans, behavior, and sportsmanship, it’s not surprising,” Shippy explained. “I’ve been doing this for 26 years, and it’s just, I want to say within the last six to eight years it has, traditionally, become worse, and it’s hard for us as veterans to recruit newer officials because of instances that you happened to see there this past weekend. A lot of the officials don’t want to get involved, which I don’t blame them.”  He admitted that there’s more at stake in today’s games. Kids are quicker and stronger. The competition is better. Teams and players are fighting for spots. But why verbal attacks on referees have turned physical or when that shift happened, is something Shippy said he doesn’t have the answer to.  He just knows that it’s causing issues with recruitment and even being able to cover every game.  “Our numbers are dwindling and episodes like we saw this past weekend don’t help,” he said.  So, what’s the solution? Should officials boycott games to send a message? Shippy said he doesn’t know if that idea would work or not, but it isn’t something he’s interested in.  “We do this for the student-athletes and I hate to see games get cancelled because we don’t have enough officials to get the games done,” Shippy said.  “My kind of view on the whole thing, especially if officials are being physically attacked, we’re going to have to have a law that at least somewhat protects officials.”  Shippy explained that the IHSAA is backing officials on getting some sort of law passed to protect officials from physical attacks, but they can’t seem to get something pushed through the legislature.  In the meantime, he hopes parents and fans start to understand the officials’ importance to the games and their role in them.  “I’ll tell you what, we’re not perfect,” he said. “We’re human out there. So, you’re not going to agree with every call that I make or my partner makes. Just like the kids don’t make every free throw or layup. We’re not perfect. We’re going to miss stuff.”  WANE 15 reached out to Parkview Health on Monday and was told they’re working on sending out a statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbmUuY29tL3RvcC1zdG9yaWVzL3dhdGNoLWZpZ2h0LWludm9sdmluZy1yZWZlcmVlLWJyZWFrcy1vdXQtYXQtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1nYW1lLWluLWZvcnQtd2F5bmUv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FuZS5jb20vdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvd2F0Y2gtZmlnaHQtaW52b2x2aW5nLXJlZmVyZWUtYnJlYWtzLW91dC1hdC1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWdhbWUtaW4tZm9ydC13YXluZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So in this week of Mets magic, of course, it was Marte’s blast that put the club over the top.  Marte’s eighth-inning home run bailed the Mets out in a 5-4, comeback victory over the Guardians on Sunday at Citi Field in the first game of a doubleheader.  The Mets (24-23) won their fourth straight — each win by one run — and moved over .500 because their bats have been relentless through rally after rally.  It was Francisco Lindor’s walk-off, 10th-inning single that keyed Friday’s victory and Pete Alonso’s walk-off homer that sparked the Mets in the 10th on Wednesday.  This time, Marte did not wait for extra innings.  After the Mets’ bullpen blew a 3-0 lead in the top of the eighth, Brett Baty walked to put the tying run on base in the bottom of the inning. Marte, who had not had an extra-base hit since April 14, blasted a four-seamer from Trevor Stephan over the right-field wall to set off a celebration for the 39,995 on hand.

Corey Sipkin for the NY Post  “This has been a battle for the last couple of weeks,” Marte said through translator Alan Suriel after his first homer since April 7. “Day in and day out, we’re starting to get closer to where we want to be.”  Marte, who has been a slow starter after offseason groin surgeries and a neck issue that hampered him in April, has begun to show signs he can become the offensive force he was last season.  True to the afternoon’s theme, Marte’s dinger showed especially strong resilience after he had been picked off first base in the fourth inning, caught napping while he put his sliding glove on his hand.  “He cares,” manager Buck Showalter said. “Some of the conversations behind closed doors … you get to know a guy. It means a lot to him.”  Mets pitcher Adam Ottavino reacts as he’s pulled in the eighth inning during Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Guardians on May 21, 2023. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post  The Mets needed Marte because two of their best relievers blew the lead.  Adam Ottavino, handed a 3-0 edge, allowed one run to score on a Tyler Freeman double and a couple of ground outs. He allowed a second run on a double from Steven Kwan and an infield single from Amed Rosario.  In came closer David Robertson, whose third pitch of the game became a two-run home run to Jose Ramirez that put the Mets in a short-lived hole.  “Hats off to [Ramirez],” Robertson said after his first blown save of the season. “He’s an exceptional hitter. I threw my best pitch [a knuckle curve], and he hit it. Gotta regroup.”  He regrouped. Robertson authored a comeback himself when he reemerged for the ninth inning and pitched around an infield single from Gabriel Arias.  Max Scherzer pitching for the Mets against the Guardians Sunday in Game 1 of a doubleheader. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post  Robertson blew his first game, but also became the game’s winning pitcher.  The game’s starter, too, had to bounce back from adversity that came in the form of a split callus on his right thumb.  Max Scherzer had to rely more on guile than gas because he pitched through pain that affected his velocity (which was down) and his pitch selection (with far fewer fastballs).  Still, Scherzer gutted through six scoreless innings in a second encouraging outing in a row, as he attempts to put neck spasms, discomfort below his right scapula and the 10-game sticky-stuff suspension behind him.  He pitched with raw skin and used a heavy dosage of sliders, curveballs and changeups, allowing just three hits. No Guardians reached second base against him.  “It’s like playing basketball with a sprained ankle,” Scherzer said of his finger, which he said would not affect him in his next outing.  Brandon Nimmo celebrates his seventh-inning home run in the Mets dugout. Corey Sipkin for the NY Post  The Mets spotted Scherzer and the staff three runs with an RBI single from Eduardo Escobar, a sacrifice fly from Gary Sanchez and a home run from Brandon Nimmo.  They would need a few more, so they spun their wheel of fortune and landed on a player who had been searching for his moment and his swing.  “It’s awesome. This team’s been grinding, Marte especially,” Robertson said. “He needed that one — we all needed it.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL3N0YXJsaW5nLW1hcnRlLWhvbWVyLWJhaWxzLW91dC1tZXRzLWJ1bGxwZW4taW4tZ2FtZS0xLXdpbi_SAVxodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMS9zdGFybGluZy1tYXJ0ZS1ob21lci1iYWlscy1vdXQtbWV0cy1idWxscGVuLWluLWdhbWUtMS13aW4vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""BatonRouge"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T20:44:47","BATON ROUGE, La. – No. 11/15 LSU (42-17) drops a pair of instant classic games to UL-Lafayette (50-14), who advances to the Super Regionals. After falling short in game one 7-4, LSU overcame a six-run deficit and took the lead before coming up short 9-8 in the elimination game Sunday night at Tiger Park.  “I’m at a loss for words,” said Head Coach Beth Torina. “Congrats to ULL. They had a great season. They are a great team, and they will do well going on. We’ll be pulling for them because the rivalry here is made more from the constant pairing than from the teams themselves. Those are nice girls. They’re asking about my kids between innings. The rivalry is the constant pairing of these teams, and what it continues to do is instead of building softball in our state, we should have the opportunity for two teams to make the college world series from our state. It has been one of the joys of my life to coach this team. They did everything right. I have loved being their coach. I really enjoyed this season with them. I’m devastated for them. Thank you to our seniors Georgia [Clark], Ali [Kilponen] and Savannah [Stewart]. They really left it all out there and gave it all they had.”  Game One  Freshman pitcher Alea Johnson (7-1) entered the circle in the bottom of the second and let up three runs on four hits in 1.1 innings. Graduate pitcher Ali Kilponen, who started, and sophomore pitcher Raelin Chaffin tossed a combined 2.2 innings and allowed six runs on seven hits.  Graduate infielder Karli Petty went 1-for-2 from the dish with two RBIs and a homer. Junior infielder Raeleen Gutierrez had one hit and a triple, while junior infielders Danieca Coffey and Taylor Pleasants both had one hit.  UL-Lafayette’s sophomore pitcher Sam Landry (19-5) entered in relief in the third and earned the win by tossing two strikeouts and allowing one hit and no runs in 5.0 innings.  The Ragin’ Cajuns got on the board in the bottom of the first thanks to an RBI on a fielder’s choice by senior outfielder Karly Heath, but the Tigers answered quickly in the top of the second. After sophomore outfielder McKenzie Redoutey drew a one-out walk, Petty came to the dish and knocked a two-run homer over the center field wall to take the lead. In the next at-bat, Gutierrez launched one to deep center for a triple and scored two batters later on a fielder’s choice. The Tigers scored on another fielder’s choice to build a 4-1 lead through one and a half innings.  The offenses kept trading blows as UL-Lafayette hit a leadoff homer in the bottom of the second from sophomore infielder Alexa Langliers. They found the run column again in the second on an RBI single from sophomore infielder Stormy Kotzelnick to cut the lead to 4-3 through two frames.  The Cajuns used two home runs in the third and fourth inning to regain a 7-4 lead.  After three scoreless innings, the Tigers threatened in the seventh with two runners on and the tying run at the plate but could not cross another run.  Game Two  Freshman pitcher Sydney Berzon (14-8) was charged with the loss after striking out two batters and allowing nine runs on nine hits and four walks in the complete game effort.  Clark led the Tigers with a 2-for-2 performance, three RBIs, and two runs scored. Pleasants got hot at the dish, going 2-for-3 with two RBIs, and Redoutey finished the game with two RBIs. Petty pieced together a one-hit, one-RBI performance in the afternoon.  UL-Lafayette’s freshman pitcher Chloe Riassetto (2-1) earned the win while allowing no runs on three hits in 3.0 innings.  The Ragin’ Cajuns scored six runs on two hits in the first inning, highlighted by a grand slam from junior outfielder Jourdyn Campbell.  In the bottom of the second, the Tigers found the scoreboard with a solo shot from Clark, her 13th homer of the season. The Tigers returned the favor with a six-run third inning, scoring all their runs with two outs. A one-run double from Pleasants, a two-run single from Clark and a two-run double from Redoutey evened the score at 6-6. Petty added one more run with an RBI single to give LSU its first lead.  The bats stayed hot for LSU in the fourth. Briggs knocked a two-out double to left field, and Pleasants lined a one-run single to right field to increase the Tigers’ lead to 8-6.  The Ragin’ Cajuns had one more run in them and rallied back late. ULL got back on the board with a solo homer from Heath in the top of the fifth to cut the lead to one run, 8-7, and after a scoreless sixth inning, the Ragin’ Cajuns scored two runs in the top of the seventh to take a 9-8 lead over the Tigers. In the bottom of the seventh, LSU put a runner on but could not plate the tying run.  Directly support LSU Softball by joining the Diamondbackers today!

"game","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""SaintLouis"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T01:00:00","Fresh off of a series win over the Seattle Mariners, the Atlanta Braves will continue their homestand Monday when they begin a three-game series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Braves took two of three from Seattle, including a 3-2 win on Sunday that featured a fine pitching performance by rookie Jared Shuster.  Atlanta will enter the series Monday with a 29-17 record and a 5.0 game lead over the Miami Marlins in the NL East that seems likely to stretch to 5.5 games at the time of writing. The Braves are in the middle of a difficult stretch of games, but have thus far been able to maintain a comfortable lead in the division. Atlanta is currently dealing with injuries to Max Fried and Kyle Wright and have leaned heavily on their relievers for three bullpen games over the last week and a half.  Ronald Acuña Jr. has put together an MVP-caliber start to the season and will carry an 11-game hitting streak into Monday’s opener. Matt Olson had another first-inning double in Sunday’s game and is 7-for-18 with three doubles and two homers over his last five games.  The Dodgers come into the series with their own rotation issues. Los Angeles has lost Dustin May to a forearm strain and Julio Urias to a strained hamstring over the past week. The Dodgers are 29-19, but have lost two straight games, including a 10-5 defeat in St. Louis on Sunday. They are clinging to a two-game lead in the division and maybe overperforming their production a tiny bit (WAR-wins suggests a 28-20 record), but make no mistake: injuries and all, this is a dangerous team that does most things pretty well (other than fielding, which makes them pretty similar to the Braves in that regard).  This series will mark the return of a couple of familiar faces for Braves’ fans. Freddie Freeman returns to Atlanta for just the second time since signing with the Dodgers prior to last season. He’s unsurprisingly off to a good start at the plate hitting hitting .321/.394/.547 with 17 doubles and eight home runs over the first 48 games. Former Braves outfielder Jason Heyward is in his first season with Los Angeles. Heyward has appeared in 36 games, mostly as a reserve outfielder and has a .770 OPS with seven doubles and four home runs.  In addition to Freeman, the usual suspects of Mookie Betts, Will Smith, and Max Muncy have pushed the Dodgers to the top of the NL West so far. A less familiar, but no less impactful, name is James Outman, who has 1.5 fWAR and positive defensive value this season... but he is outhitting his xwOBA by a ton.  Pitching-wise, the Dodgers have been led by Clayton Kershaw, who pitched on Sunday, and Dustin May, who is now on the shelf, plus a stable of good relief performances so far. They’ve had a few relief arms struggle thus far, but those meltdowns have generally come at unimportant times.  All-in-all, this should be another tough series for the Braves, but it’s one where the pitching matchups are relatively favorable for the home team.  Monday, May 22, 7:20 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South)  Gavin Stone (1 GS, 4 IP, 4.3 K%, 8.7 BB%, 42.1 GB% 9.00 ERA, 4.30 FIP)  Right-hander Gavin Stone will make his second career start in Monday’s series opener, replacing the injured Dustin May. Stone is the Dodgers’ sixth-best prospect according to Baseball America. He made his major league debut on May 3 against the Phillies where he allowed eight hits and five runs (four earned) in four innings. Stone has a 4.04 ERA and a 5.11 FIP to go along with a 27.5 percent strikeout rate in eight starts at Triple-A.  Charlie Morton (8 GS, 47.1 IP, 23.8 K%, 8.7 BB%, 49.3 GB%, 2.85 ERA, 3.60 FIP)  The Braves’ pushed Morton back to Monday’s start which will give him six full days of rest. After an up-and-down start to the season, Morton has been on a roll, striking out 17 hitters over his last 12 2/3 innings. He struck out a season-high 10 and held the Rangers scoreless for 6 2/3 innings in his last start. Morton has held the opposition to three runs or less in seven of his eight starts this season, but he’s also walked multiple batters in all but one start this season.  Tuesday, May 23, 7:20 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South, TBS)  Bobby Miller (Triple-A: 4 GS, 14.1 IP, 19.7 K%, 9.8 BB%, 40.0 GB%, 5.65 ERA, 5.59 FIP)  Tuesday’s start would have gone to Julio Urias, but he too was recently shelved. As a result, the Dodgers are expected to call up right-hander Bobby Miller to make his major league debut. Miller is the Dodgers’ No. 2 prospect according to Baseball America. Miller didn’t pitch at all during Spring Training, while dealing with soreness in his throwing shoulder. He has made four starts at Triple-A where he has a 5.65 ERA and a 5.59 FIP in 14 1/3 innings. However, Miller is coming off his best outing of the season where he allowed six hits, one run and struck out six over six innings against Sugar Land.  Spencer Strider (9 GS, 51.2 IP, 41.5 K%, 8.7 BB%, 33.0 GB%, 2.96 ERA, 2.20 FIP)  Spencer Strider will make his tenth start of the season in Tuesday’s game. Strider wasn’t sharp in his last outing, allowing six hits and four runs. He walked three, but still managed to strike out seven. It was the first start of the season where he failed to record at least eight strikeouts, and the first start of his career where he allowed multiple homers — but somehow the Braves still won. Tuesday will be Strider’s second career start against Los Angeles. He faced them once last season and struck out seven over six scoreless innings.  Wednesday, May 24, 7:20 p.m. ET (Bally Sports South, MLB Network)  Tony Gonsolin (5 GS, 24.0 IP, 20.0 K%, 9.5 BB%, 39.4 GB%, 1.13 ERA, 4.05 FIP)  Right-hander Tony Gonsolin will start Wednesday’s finale for the Dodgers. Gonsolin began the season on the Injured List, but made his season debut at the end of April. He has had good results, hence his 1.13 ERA attests, but his 4.05 FIP suggests he has been very fortunate, and his xFIP is even worse, with a K%-BB% under 10 percent. Gonsolin has allowed just six hits and no earned runs over his last three starts (16 innings). He has made three starts in his career against Atlanta, allowing two runs over 15 2/3 innings.  Bryce Elder (9 GS, 52.1 IP, 21.3 K%, 7.1 BB%, 56.1 GB%, 2.06 ERA, 3.36 FIP)  In many ways, Bryce Elder has been the unsung hero of the Braves rotation over the first quarter of the season. Elder began the season at Gwinnett, but quickly solidified his position in the team’s rotation with 12 1/3 scoreless innings over his first two starts. He’s maintained that success and given Atlanta a chance to win just about every time he has been on the mound. He allowed seven hits and two runs over six innings in his last start against the Mariners. Elder has allowed just five runs through his first four starts in May (23 1/3 innings).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdHRlcnlwb3dlci5jb20vMjAyMy81LzIxLzIzNzMxNzM4L2JyYXZlcy12cy1kb2RnZXJzLXNlcmllcy1wcmV2aWV3LXBpdGNoaW5nLXByb2JhYmxlc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdHRlcnlwb3dlci5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wLzIwMjMvNS8yMS8yMzczMTczOC9icmF2ZXMtdnMtZG9kZ2Vycy1zZXJpZXMtcHJldmlldy1waXRjaGluZy1wcm9iYWJsZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-09-03","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T03:20:00","Brooks Raley shows off the leather with a glove flip to get Steven Kwan out at first.  NEW YORK -- — Max Scherzer fired six shutout innings in the first game, then Justin Verlander threw a gem in the nightcap.  A pair of veteran aces in peak form, pitching back-to-back. Exactly what the New York Mets had in mind heading into this season.  Verlander outdueled Shane Bieber in a marquee matchup of Cy Young Award winners, and the resurgent Mets edged the Cleveland Guardians 2-1 on Sunday night for a doubleheader sweep.  Francisco Lindor homered against his former team and Jeff McNeil hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly off Bieber in the eighth to make a winner of Verlander (2-2), who gave up three hits and struck out five.  “That’s why I have such respect for people that things are expected of, whether it’s a team or an individual, and they still deliver,” Mets manager Buck Showalter said. ""Because there’s such a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world. History’s history, but you’ve got to be able to repeat it when it’s expected. And that’s really hard to do.”  In the opener, Starling Marte hit a go-ahead, two-run homer off Trevor Stephan (2-2) in the eighth inning — his first extra-base hit since April 14 — that sent the Mets to a 5-4 win.  In just the second matchup of Cy Young Award winners this season — Scherzer started against Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara on opening day — Verlander became the first Mets pitcher to go eight innings this year.  “We’ve had so many exciting games this homestand and that’s what this team’s all about,” Verlander said. “Good to finish it off like this.”  Brooks Raley closed out New York’s fifth consecutive comeback victory — all by one run — since a 6-16 slide.  “I woke up this morning, I was like, ‘Oh, we’ve got Scherzer (and) Verlander going today, that’s pretty cool,’” Raley said with a grin.  José Ramírez hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning of Game 1 to give the Guardians a 4-3 lead before he connected against Verlander in the first inning of the nightcap.  Lindor homered off Bieber (2-2) in the sixth inning of Game 2 before rookie Francisco Álvarez singled leading off the eighth. Marte pinch-ran and dashed to third on Lindor's check-swing single past shortstop before scoring on McNeil’s sacrifice fly.  “That’s what makes it fun — everybody’s jacked up because of the way we’ve been winning,” said Scherzer, who pitched through a callus on his right thumb.  Raley needed only five pitches in the ninth to earn his 10th career save and first for the Mets, finishing an old-fashioned pitchers’ duel that took just 2 hours, 6 minutes. He made a terrific defensive play on Steven Kwan’s drag bunt and got Ramírez to ground into a game-ending double play.  The left-hander also threw a scoreless seventh inning in the opener.  Bieber permitted seven hits in his fifth career complete game and first this season. He struck out four and walked two, throwing 106 pitches.  Verlander and Bieber became the first pitchers to complete at least eight innings in the same game this season.  “You have to credit the Mets,” Guardians manager Terry Francona said. “They put the ball in play and McNeil is a hard guy to strike out and he gets a sac fly. That ends up being the difference.”  Francona oversaw a postgame team meeting Sunday night for the Guardians, who had just 11 hits in the doubleheader as they fell to 20-26 — the furthest they have been under .500 since May 29, 2022. Cleveland recovered to win the AL Central by 11 games.  “Just don’t take anything for granted,” Francona said. “Play the game as right as you can and see where you end up.”  POCKET ACES  Scherzer and Verlander entered Sunday with 449 wins between them, the most by a tandem starting a doubleheader since Nolan Ryan and Charlie Hough had 484 wins prior to Texas’ twinbill against the White Sox on Aug. 17, 1990.  WHOLE LOTTA STARTS  Verlander, who played his entire career in the American League before signing with the Mets last December, made his 55th career start against Cleveland, tied for the most by an active pitcher against one club. Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw has made 55 starts against San Francisco.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Guardians: C Cam Gallagher (right thumb) went 0 for 3 in the nightcap after sitting out the opener. Gallagher was hit on the thumb by a foul tip in the 10th inning Friday night. … RHP Triston McKenzie (teres major strain) allowed two hits over three scoreless innings in his first rehab start Saturday for Triple-A Columbus. Francona said McKenzie and RHP Aaron Civale (left oblique), who began his rehab stint at Columbus on Thursday, will pitch every fifth day for the Clippers.  Mets: Scherzer said the callus began bothering him in his previous start, but he should be healed for his next scheduled outing. He said the pain contributed to his low-90s (mph) fastball velocity and forced him to rely more on his curveball and changeup. “I’d rather pitch in pain and win than not pitch at all,” Scherzer said. … C Tomás Nido (dry eye syndrome) went 1 for 4 with a two-run homer as the DH for Class A St. Lucie in his third rehab game. Nido has been limited to DH duties in his last two games after being hit by a pitch Friday night. … C Omar Narváez (left calf strain) is expected to begin a rehab assignment this week. … LHP José Quintana (left rib fracture) threw his first bullpen Saturday since undergoing surgery in March.

Smith says the Lakers have struggled to make adjustments in the Western Conference finals, and as a result, the Nuggets have toyed with them. (0:56)  SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- On the doorstep of reaching their first ever NBA Finals, the Denver Nuggets say they must do something Monday that has never been done before.  No team has been able to sweep LeBron James in a playoff series before the NBA Finals and the Nuggets themselves have never completed a sweep in franchise history.  James has been swept only twice before, with both times coming in the NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers: to the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 and to the Golden State Warriors in 2018.  ""I mean, s--- that's LeBron man,"" Nuggets veteran forward Jeff Green said Sunday after the Nuggets met and watched film at their team hotel. ""He's done some amazing things throughout these last 20 years. For me, we have to end it.  ""It's like you can't continue to give him life. The more life you give him, the more confidence he gains and the more confidence he instills in his teammates. So for me, it has to end [Monday].""  Guard Bruce Brown echoed the same sentiment, saying the Nuggets must be focused on slamming the door shut on the Lakers.  ""We want to give them no hope,"" Brown said. ""No confidence.""  The Lakers went through practice Sunday hoping it is not the final time they practice as a team this season. They're motivated to avoid being swept.  ""It's a very real thing,"" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said of the Lakers being fueled to avoid a 4-0 finish to their season. ""It's a very real thing. It's a prideful group, again, highly competitive that cares and that wants to go and put on a good show for our fans as well.  ""Our fans, Lakers Nation, they support the hell out of us and we got to do our part. We got to go out there and show up and show out.""  Teams that have fallen behind 0-3 in a series are 0-149 all-time. The Nuggets, though, know this will be the hardest closeout game the franchise has ever played in its history because of what is at stake.  Not long after the Nuggets took a commanding 3-0 lead with their 119-108 win in Game 3 on Saturday, Nikola Jokic talked about the apprehension he was feeling knowing that Denver is going for the knockout punch with an all-time great fighting to keep his team's season alive.  ""I'm not going to say that I'm scared,"" Jokic said. ""But I'm worried because they have LeBron on the other side and he is capable of doing everything.""  Ham says the Lakers can only focus on staying alive Monday night.  ""We're facing a hell of a ballclub, one talented bunch that's very well coached,"" Ham said. ""But we have things that we can do as well. The only thing we have to do is just focus on one game. We don't have to be overwhelmed about the outside noise or the overall series. We just have to worry about one game, what's exactly in front of us.""

It features a wide variety of speakers from around the world, addressing some of the most interesting and urgent issues in modern gaming. Here are ten highlights from the days ahead.  AI Development Concerns  The first talk is by Andre Schenini Moreira (managing partner, FMA Legal), and it addresses a matter that’s top of mind for game developers and publishers right now – artificial intelligence. In The Use of AI Generated Assets and its Legal Implications Moreira will look at the current state of generative AI game development and will walk attendants through various legal potholes “especially in relation to IP ownership and liability”. You can read GameDaily’s interview with Moreira here.  Tackling Crunch  The game industry is notorious for demanding long hours from workers, leading to exhaustion, depression and illness. Even as companies have come to accept that crunch is self-defeating, many are struggling to reorient their cultures around their talent, instead of around deadlines. In Overcoming Crunch and Management Problems by Reviewing Your Approach to Well-Being, Kevin Scheepers, CEO of FlowMade will analyze the problem and suggest solutions. FlowMade has spent a decade offering “mental health and productivity solutions for game developers”.  Marketing games on TikTok  Abraham Lieberman is the founder of marketing agency Clicks Talent, which specializes in leveraging social media, and represents more than 100 clients. In his talk, The Top Secrets Of TikTok Marketing That No One Will Tell You, Lieberman will be exploring TikTok’s paid landscape, analyzing success measurement and ROI, and offering suggestions on how to select the right agency, marketing, or PR team.  Lessons in social gaming  Fostering “strong, meaningful and enjoyable social connections within gaming communities” is the theme of Victoria Gomes-Boronat’s talk on Harnessing the Power of Social Gaming. Gomes-Boronat is CEO of Lucio, a mobile gaming platform that matches players according to shared interests and experiences as well as geographic proximity. The talk will investigate how game designers can leverage Lucio’s learnings to “optimize gaming experiences and enhance social interaction for local economic growth”.  What is cultural interoperability?  Kate Edwards began her career as a cartographer, and has used those experiences to advise top gaming and tech companies on how to navigate cultural differences around the world. In Cultural Interoperability: The Biggest Challenge to the Metaverse (and Beyond), Edwards will speak on the difficulty of creating metaverse spaces that work internationally at a cultural and at a governmental level. You can find out more detail on this talk in GameDaily’s interview with Edwards here.  Gaming for the planet  In Make Your Team and Your CFO Smile While Restoring Nature, Maria Wagner will speak on how game companies can take economically sensible action “in reducing their ecological footprint and raising awareness”. Wagner, who is co-founder and general manager of Games Forest Club says: “There are easy ways to begin with, which will also help you with hiring, player engagement and more mindful business decisions. Win-win for nature and your future revenue.”  Celebrating 20 years of Eve Online  Eve Online is one of the most spectacular and successful MMOs in the world, with 20 years experience in creating and managing a vast virtual world of space opera. In The Unexpected Turns That Led to a Titan: EVE Online, CCP Games’ creative director Bergur Finnbogason will look back at the “twists and turns” of the game’s first two decades.  Learn about Africa’s gaming scene  According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the African gaming market is set to grow by more than 12 percent annually between now and 2028. In Africa’s Emerging Gaming Scene, Maliyo Games’ founder Hugo Obi will “provide broad insight into what is happening in the market using the perspective of one of the leading gaming companies”. Nigeria-based Maliyo Games is best known for creating mobile games inspired by African stories and cultures, and has developed more than 50 titles to date.

"game","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T21:59:38","Daniil Medvedev dismantles your game.  Playing your “A-Game” is next to impossible against Medvedev, who willingly absorbs your best punches and silently disrupts your winning patterns. Medvedev defeated Holger Rune 7-5, 7-5 in the Internazionali BNL d’Italia final on Sunday by dismantling Rune’s strengths and finding another level at the end of both sets to secure victory. There were seven specific battles in which Medvedev managed to craft an advantage over Rune to capture his first clay-court title.  1) Medvedev Owned Ad-Court Rallies  Medvedev’s primary baseline tactic was to make the match a backhand-to-backhand war of attrition through the Ad court. Medvedev’s ultra-flat, uber-consistent backhand is almost impossible to do anything with.  Medvedev Backhand Placement  67% cross court  15% middle  18% down the line  Rune Backhand Placement  46% cross court  25% middle  29% down the line  Medvedev shoveled two out of every three backhands crosscourt, handcuffing Rune in baseline exchanges. Overall, Rune hit 108 backhand groundstrokes, which included 14 errors and three winners. Rune also hit 54 run-around forehands in the Ad court for six winners and six errors. The Ad court belonged to Medvedev.  2) Rune’s Underperforming First Serve  Rune made a lowly 49 per cent of his first serves (33/68) for the match, only winning 52 per cent (17/33) of those points. Rune was broken four times, specifically due to these underperforming first-serve stats, but won a competitive 63 per cent (22/35) of his second-serve points. A key factor of Rune’s low numbers behind his first serve was Medvedev’s deep return position, where he regularly made contact six metres behind the baseline. Rune could not go through him, or around him.  Medvedev Return Hit Points vs. Rune    Hawkeye graphic courtesy of ATP Media  Medvedev consistently put Rune on the back foot at the baseline after a first serve, or landed it at his shoelaces as he attempted to serve and volley. Medvedev directed 81 per cent of his first-and-second-serve returns to the middle and backhand thirds of the court, trying to immediately enter into an oxygen-depraving backhand-to-backhand rally against Rune.  3) Rune Serve & Volley  Serve and volley is a natural counter-attack against a deep returner, but with Rune landing less than half his first serves, the tactic always felt dangerous in this match. Overall, Rune won seven of twelve serve-and-volley points, but was even in the second set with three won and three lost. Medvedev did a masterful job of mitigating this potentially damaging tactic.  4) Rune Drop Shots  Drop shots are a classic secondary tactic on clay that compliment a strong primary pattern of play, such as initially pushing your opponent deep behind the baseline before yanking them forward. Rune hit 10 drop shots in the match, with eight coming from his backhand wing. He only won four of ten, and they failed to disrupt Medvedev’s baseline patterns.  5) Net Points Won  Rune came to the net a healthy 26 times in the match but only managed to win 50 per cent (13) of those points. Medvedev countered by winning 13 of 20 (65 per cent) at net, providing another strategic victory.  6) Baseline Points Won  The primary pattern of play of blasting groundstrokes back and forth over the Roman red dirt was easily won by Medvedev.  Medvedev=53% (39/74)  Rune=43% (29/68)  Rune hit 131 forehand groundstrokes for the match, but Medvedev absorbed the punches like a true clay-court heavyweight. Rune struck nine winners with his forehand but contributed 17 errors as Medvedev consistently absorbed and repelled Rune’s forehands.  7) Court Position  Medvedev Court Position  Inside Baseline=23%  Within 2 Metres Of The Baseline=44%  Past 2 Metres=33%  Rune Court Position  Inside Baseline=21%  Within 2 Metres Of The Baseline=45%  Past 2 Metres=34%  Surprisingly, Medvedev played slightly more inside the baseline than Rune while at the same time not standing in the ultra-deep baseline location quite as much.  Medvedev’s first clay-court title came from playing solid tennis on his side of the net and forcing Rune to play his “B-Game”. What a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0cHRvdXIuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvbWVkdmVkZXYtcnVuZS1yb21lLTIwMjMtZmluYWwtYnJhaW4tZ2FtZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T05:57:15","              May 22 - The Milwaukee Brewers will be looking to generate some run support for ace right-hander Corbin Burnes against the visiting Houston Astros on Monday in the opener of the three-game series.  Burnes (4-3, 3.48 ERA) will be opposed by right-hander Cristian Javier (4-1, 3.25).  Milwaukee salvaged the final game of a three-game series at the Tampa Bay Rays on Sunday, winning 6-4 behind six solid innings from Freddy Peralta. Willy Adames, Rowdy Tellez and William Contreras each homered for the Brewers.  The Astros extended their winning streak to seven with a 2-0 victory over Oakland on Sunday as Framber Valdez tossed a four-hitter for his second career shutout.  Despite going 2-4 on the recent road trip, the Brewers remained atop the National League Central, a game ahead of Pittsburgh, which has lost seven of its last 10. They're the only two teams with a winning record in the division.  The Brewers are 21-4 when scoring at least four runs, 4-17 when scoring three or fewer. They were shut out twice on the trip and lost the first game 18-1 at St. Louis.  The Brewers begin a seven-game homestand as the Astros make their first visit to Milwaukee since September 2019.  Burnes took the loss in his last start, allowing three runs on eight hits in six innings in a 3-0 defeat at St. Louis, with the big blow a two-run homer in the sixth by Paul De Jong.  ""I felt great. I thought I threw the ball well,"" Burnes said. ""Outside of the walk in the first inning to (Paul) Goldschmidt that led to that run, from there until the home-run pitch, I thought I threw the ball really well.""  Burnes, the 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner, is 4-2 with a 2.13 ERA in his last seven starts. Burnes has struck out 46 in 51 2/3 innings with 19 walks. Last season, Burnes struck out 243 in 202 innings, and fanned 234 in 167 innings in 2021.  ""The stuff's been great,"" Burnes said after the Cardinals game. ""The cutter's coming out of the hand really well the last couple outings. Curveball was great tonight, we went to it when we needed to. We're starting to get some more swing and miss, and obviously a lot of week contact, so that's where we want to be.""  Opponents are batting .218 against Burnes this season, with five homers.  Burnes has only faced the Astros once in his career, pitching a scoreless inning of relief in 2019.  Javier allowed just one run in six innings in his last start, a 7-3 win over the Cubs.  In three starts in May, Javier is 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA, allowing just eight hits in 19 innings with 24 strikeouts. Javier has never faced the Brewers.  The Astros were bolstered at the start of the Oakland series by the return of Jose Altuve, who was 2-for-9 in his first three games this season.  Altuve is hitting .328 in 32 career games vs. Milwaukee with three homers and nine RBIs. All three of those homers have come at American Family Field, where he is hitting .355 in 16 games.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9jb3JiaW4tYnVybmVzLWJyZXdlcnMtdHJ5LWhhbHQtYXN0cm9zLTctZ2FtZS13aW4tc3RyZWFrLTIwMjMtMDUtMjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2018-09-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T00:48:00","Nintendo (NTDOY 0.28%) and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO -0.13%) represent two very different ways to invest in the video game market. Nintendo produces video game consoles and publishes its own games, and it develops family-friendly franchises like Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, and Metroid. Take-Two is smaller than Nintendo, doesn't sell any consoles, and primarily targets older gamers with its Grand Theft Auto, Borderlands, Red Dead, Mafia, WWE 2K, and NBA 2K franchises.  Both companies experienced growth spurts during the pandemic as people stayed at home and played more video games. But they also experienced tough slowdowns as the pandemic passed, and those tailwinds dissipated.  Both companies also face a lot of pressure to launch new products and games in the near future: Nintendo's Switch is now more than six years old, while Take-Two's blockbuster game GTA V is nearly 10 years old. Should investors buy either of these stocks as gamers await their latest moves? Let's dig deeper and find out.  Nintendo could still surprise the market  The bear case against Nintendo is pretty strong at the moment. Its revenue fell 6% in fiscal 2023 (which ended this March), representing its second straight year of shrinking revenues, and it expects another 9% decline in fiscal 2024. Its net profit slipped 9% in fiscal 2023, and it's bracing for another 21% drop in fiscal 2024.  Nintendo's sales and profits are withering because the aging Switch has largely saturated its addressable market, with nearly 125 million units sold since March 2017. It's refreshed the console with the cheaper Lite version and the pricier OLED version over the years, but it will likely need to launch a brand new console to revive its revenue growth again.  On the bright side, Nintendo's recent launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which sold 10 million copies globally in the first three days alone, could drive some gamers to either buy new Switch consoles or upgrade to the higher-end OLED model. The market's healthy appetite for Nintendo's evergreen franchises -- which can be seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie's box office performance and the popularity of its Super Nintendo World theme park attractions in Japan and California -- also suggests there will be plenty of demand for Nintendo's new console when it finally arrives.  Nintendo's stock looks reasonably valued at 20 times forward earnings, yet those valuations are pegged to analysts' conservative estimates for its near-term growth. If Nintendo's Zelda sales continue to shatter new records -- or the company unexpectedly unveils its next big console -- those estimates could be raised, and its valuations would drop.  Take-Two expects its ""next phase of growth"" to start  Take-Two's bookings rose 55% in fiscal 2023 (which ended this March), bouncing back strongly from its 4% post-pandemic decline in bookings in fiscal 2022. However, a lot of that growth was driven by its takeover of the mobile game maker Zynga last May. That acquisition caused Take-Two to post a net loss in fiscal 2023.  Most of Take-Two's bookings growth in fiscal 2023 was driven by its NBA 2K games, GTA V and GTA Online, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, as well as Zynga's Words with Friends, Merge Dragons, and Toon Blast. But after lapping its Zynga acquisition, Take-Two only expects its bookings to rise 3% to 5% in fiscal 2024.  That outlook suggests that Take-Two needs to follow up GTA V, which it already expanded significantly with GTA Online, with a proper sequel. The same can be said about Red Dead Redemption 2, which was launched in 2018. Take-Two hasn't set a firm launch date for GTA VI yet, but CEO Strauss Zelnick recently suggested the company would experience its ""next phase of growth"" in fiscal 2025 as it launches ""several groundbreaking titles"" to generate over $8 billion in full-year bookings.  Therefore, its bookings could jump about 45% in fiscal 2025 as several eagerly anticipated games -- which will likely include GTA VI -- finally hit the market. If that happens, its stock might be a bargain right now at 22 times forward earnings.  The better buy right now: Nintendo  I believe Nintendo and Take-Two are both great long-term plays on the gaming market. But if I had to pick one over the other right now, I'd stick with Nintendo because its business is better diversified, it owns more evergreen franchises, its stock is slightly cheaper, and it's approaching the trough of its cyclical slowdown. Nintendo also pays an attractive forward yield of 3.5% to reward its patient investors, while Take-Two doesn't pay a dividend at all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2JldHRlci12aWRlby1nYW1lLXN0b2NrLW5pbnRlbmRvLXZzLXRha2UtdHdvLWludGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2010-01-01","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T17:16:06","HoYoverse released Genshin Impact in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic nearly three years ago, and it has become a major hit in the gaming industry. This free-to-play anime RPG from China allows players to explore the vast world of Teyvat as a traveler separated from their twin in another world and interact with — as well as play as — a wide variety of characters whose combat moves are based on elements, like earth, wind, fire, water, and electricity.  Although the story is about a traveler (male or female, depending on your choice) working to find their sibling, Genshin Impact becomes more about exploring the seven nations of Teyvat, learning of their cultures and customs, and fighting the monsters that reside in those nations and less about the eventual family reunion. This game has won numerous awards (including Player’s Voice at The Game Awards 2022) and spawned loads of fan art and animations.  But for those who want to take a break from Genshin Impact and play something similar, here are 10 games you can check out.  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild  Breath of the Wild is the one Zelda game that kicked off a generation of open-world games outside the series that were inspired by its gameplay mechanics and/or art style, and Genshin Impact draws plenty of inspiration from it. Link wakes up after a century of slumber with no memory of anything that happened to him, and is tasked with saving Princess Zelda and stopping Calamity Ganon from destroying Hyrule and the world.  Nintendo gave players permission to complete the game’s story in a nonlinear fashion, giving them ample room to explore the vast landscape on the ground and in the air and experiment with various gameplay elements.  Immortals Fenyx Rising  In Ubisoft’s interpretation of Greek mythology, Typhon has escaped from his imprisonment in the underworld and robbed the Olympian gods of their powers and essences, causing Zeus to flee to Prometheus, who he chained to the mountain as punishment, for help to defeat him. Prometheus makes a deal with Zeus that if a mortal can beat Typhon, he will be freed from his imprisonment, thus he tells the story of Fenyx, a mortal who must stop Typhon after escaping the underworld in order to save their brother.  Fenyx gains the powers of the gods as the game progresses, such as Ares’ Wrath, and can upgrade their weapons. The one gameplay element that makes Immortals Fenyx Rising stand out from Genshin Impact is the player’s ability to change Fenyx’s gender (Fenyx is female by default), voice, and appearance. Genshin only allows you to choose characters of different genders. Aside from that, players need to monitor their stamina during combat so that they don’t get exhausted after repeated attacks.  Sonic Frontiers  You might think that Sonic Frontiers is leagues apart from Genshin Impact, but the lovable blue hedgehog’s latest outing couldn’t be any more different. Sonic and his friends get sucked into Cyber Space via a wormhole en route to Starfall Islands, and he manages to escape while they’re stuck in the digital world, hence why they appear to Sonic in pixelated form when he rescues them.  Frontiers is similar to Genshin Impact in that Sonic has the stamina gauge next to him every time he boosts or goes underwater, is able to climb up structures, has a skill tree, and experiences the day-cycle, and has a navigation system that leads him the desired destination. Not to mention that the puzzles and challenges he completes reveal more locations.  Final Fantasy 14  Final Fantasy 14 takes place five years after the events of the original 2010 game, which was a critical and commercial failure for Square Enix. The gods bless the player character to time travel five years into the future in order to escape the destruction of Eorzea caused by the primal dragon Bahamut, and must face the threat of invasion from the Garlean Empire as they are working to rebuild the land.  Unlike Genshin Impact, FF14 is an MMORPG where players interact with each other but still allows them a great deal of open-world exploration. However, the one thing the game has in common with Genshin is that it has a games-as-a-service model that contains gacha items for people to spend real money on if in-game currency doesn’t cover it. FF14 has also received four expansions in the last 10 years: Heavensward (2015), Stormblood (2017), Shadowbringers (2019), and Endwalker (2021).  Persona 5  Developed by Atlus, Persona 5 centers on a high school student under the pseudonym Joker who, after transferring to a new school after being falsely accused of assault and placed on probation, manifests a Persona along with some other students, prompting them to become vigilantes known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They dive into a supernatural realm created by humanity’s subconscious desires called the Metaverse and steal malicious intent from the hearts of adults.  Persona 5 allows players to go into dungeons within the Metaverse called Palaces, formed by the hearts of corrupted adults that represent their distorted perception of a real-world location, to fight them and their shadows (which are their true selves). Outside of that, they get to perform part-time jobs and fulfill requests from NPCs.  Tchia  Tchia is set in a fictional archipelago heavily inspired by the Pacific Island nation of New Caledonia, where the titular 12-year-old heroine goes on a mission to rescue her father after he gets kidnapped by a tyrant and his army of paper warriors. Tchia explores her island home by sea (in her raft), by air (with a glider she builds herself), and by ground. She also gains a unique ability called soul-jumping, which allows her to possess and assume control of animals and inanimate objects in order to perform certain tasks, such as a dog or a coconut, to travel to new areas, solve puzzles, and defend herself against enemies.  The characters speak entirely in French and Drehu, two languages that are dominant in New Caledonia. Soul-jumping is also inspired by New Caledonia’s folklore around shapeshifting.  Honkai Impact 3rd  Honkai Impact 3rd is HoYoverse’s sci-fi version of Genshin Impact that takes place 50,000 years in the future in an alternate version of Earth that has been plagued by catastrophes caused by Honkai, a powerful entity that corrupts humans and endows certain people called Herrschers with god-like powers to cause an apocalypse every time a civilization gets too advanced. Three Global factions were made to combat or take advantage of the Honkai: Schicksal, which deploys Valkyries; Anti-Entropy, which uses human soldiers instead of mechas; and World Serpent, which has been manipulating events since the end of the previous civilization.  Honkai Impact 3rd incorporates multifarious genres, including bullet hell, platforming, shoot ‘em up, and dungeon crawling in conjunction with gacha mechanics that offer new weapons and characters. It also hosts limited-time seasonal events that offer gameplay elements not seen in normal gameplay modes.  Honkai: Star Rail , the sequel to Honkai Impact 3rd which takes place in space, is available now on iOS, Android, and PC via Epic Games Store.  Tales of Arise  The 17th entry in the Tales series, Tales of Arise revolves around a Dahnan slave named Alphen, a slave with no memories of his past, and Shionne, a Renan girl with a curse that makes thorns erupt from her body if anyone touches her, as they form a bond during their journey to end the Renans’ oppression of the Dahnan people.  This game has no multiplayer like its predecessors, but most of its gameplay emphasizes evasion, countering, and other character interactions in combat.  Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom  Set hundreds of years after the events of Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch, Ni no Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom revolves around a young Grimalkin (part-human, part-cat) named Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, who gets deposed on his coronation day in a coup following the untimely death of his father. He sets out on a journey to build his own kingdom and unite all the world’s nations.  Players can freely explore the open world of Ni no Kuni 2, but they have to complete quests in a linear fashion to move the story forward. In battle, players can switch between three other characters at any time. There is some world-building involved, as they have to manage the workforces within the town to provide materials for weapons and armor in the shops.  Xenoblade Chronicles X  Xenoblade Chronicles X is a Wii U-exclusive Xenoblade title that takes places on the planet of Mira, where some of humanity flees to following the destruction of Earth by alien warfare. The player character, who suffers from amnesia after being rescued from their escape pod, becomes a member of BLADE and joins the mission to defend their new world against the Ganglion coalition — and explores their environment walking in their mechs.  Players can customize their character’s gender, voice, build and facial features at any point in the game. Just like Mondstadt serves as the hub world of Genshin Impact, New Los Angeles serves as the hub world for Xenoblade Chronicles X. Completing quests, most of which are divided into story quests, grants players experience points, elevating their stats and class.  Cristina Alexander is a freelance writer for IGN.

Finishing the season one win away from Super Regionals, Auburn tallied its most wins in a season under head coach Mickey Dean and its highest win total since 2017. It was Auburn's first appearance in a NCAA Regional final since 2019.  ""After playing through the bracket and having a late night, I am so proud of the fight our team had to force a game seven,"" Dean said. ""We just didn't have enough in the tank at the end. Congrats to Clemson. They are a talented team. We've been building something the last several years, and we're on the doorstep of something big. This was a special season. It's something we can continue to build off.""  Auburn wasted no time jumping out early on Clemson's Valerie Cagle. Nelia Peralta drew a walk before Rose Roach beat out an infield single to set up an RBI opportunity for Bri Ellis, and she did not miss. She drove a home run to straightaway center to put Auburn up 3-0.  Clemson answered in the top of the fourth with a solo home from Alia Logoleo, but Auburn responded in the home half of the inning. Aubrie Lisenby singled to left and was lifted for pinch runner Skylar Elkins. With Elkins standing at second with two outs, Peralta doubled down the line in left to push the lead back to three.  The host Tigers used a single and a pair of walks to load the bases with two outs, a bases-loaded walk push across a run to cut Auburn's lead to 4-2. Maddie Penta limited the damage, battling back from a three-ball count to record a strikeout.  Auburn perfected situational offense in the bottom of the sixth to plate a clutch insurance run. Lindsey Garcia led off with a single up the middle and was lifted for pinch runner Abbey Smith Lisenby dropped the sacrifice bunt to move Smith into scoring position before pinch hitter Jessie Blaine drove her home with a single through the left side.  Penta opened the seventh with back-to-back strikeouts, picking up her 300th of the season to become just the second player in school history to reach the milestone as she joined Kristen Keyes (2004). Cagle singled up the middle to keep the game alive, but Penta forced a fly out to right field to send Auburn into the if necessary game. The win was Penta's 27th of the year, which tied the program record for wins a season. She closed the game with seven strikeouts.  Clemson jumped out the first inning lead in the second game of the twin billing, scoring on a wild pitch. A walk and RBI single put the host Tigers up 2-0 before Clemson loaded the bases in the frame, forcing Penta out of the game. A bases-loaded walk put Clemson up 3-0.  Auburn manufactured a run in the top of the third as Makayla Packer drove a double to right before taking third on an error. An excellent slide at the plate on a fielder's choice allowed Packer to score. Clemson answered in the fourth, plating a pair of runs off three hits to secure the win.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zNzcwMzU2Mi9uby0xNy1hdWJ1cm4tZm9yY2VzLWdhbWUtc2V2ZW4tZmFsbHMtY2xlbXNvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-21","20:47:00","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T00:47:26","United States Football League Gritty Gamblers ride running game, defense to fourth straight win Published May. 21, 2023 8:47 p.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link  MEMPHIS — The Houston Gamblers showed Sunday that they are right at home in their hub city of Memphis, managing to pull off a 16-10 Grind City win against the New Jersey Generals to extend their winning streak to a league-best four in a row.  Running back Mark Thompson continued to perform as the best TD machine in the USFL. Before the first quarter ended against New Jersey, Thompson punched into the end zone from 6 yards out for his league-best ninth rushing TD of the season.  Thompson, who finished the day with 82 yards on 22 carries, has been a force when offensive coordinator Eric Price has been able to define the run-block look for him with man-on-man blocking from the offensive line. His vision has been clear and clean because of it.  ""It is definitely really clean this year,"" Thompson said. ""Last year we had a lot of things going on, and I was just grateful to be playing the game of football. It was fun being out there, but the result last year wasn't always in our favor. So this year, I'm really excited that I'm getting a chance to utilize my great offensive line.""  After missing the first two weeks of the season with an injury, Thompson has scored all nine of his TDs in the last four games. The Gamblers are undefeated when the former Florida product lines up in the backfield.  Highlights: Gamblers shut down Generals  The Gamblers offense also received a boost from the return of Monmouth all-time leading passer Kenji Bahar. Houston averaged more than 34 points across Bahar’s last three starts.  Bahar has elevated his game from one year ago, not only earning the starting job but becoming the kind of player he showed himself to be in college. He finished the game completing 19 of 29 passes for 130 yards and credited Houston coach Curtis Johnson for his leap in development as a pro from 2022 to 2023.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""I think it's more just (Coach Johnson) being more of a player's coach,"" Bahar said. ""It’s not just him telling us what to do. He asks us what we want to do, what we do well. That goes to show how we play.""  With Bahar behind center, Houston picked up 12 first downs and put itself in position for Nick Vogel to make two field goals (37 and 38 yards), giving the Gamblers a two-score lead in the first half. They were 6-for-9 on third-down conversions in the first quarter, while New Jersey was just 2-for-6.  The Generals offense was erratic at best with quarterback Kyle Lauletta receiving his first start of the season. Lauletta completed just four of his 12 first-half pass attempts for 33 yards and an interception, though he managed an 18-yard scramble to generate some momentum for the offense in the second quarter.  All but two of the Generals' first-half offensive possessions ended with punts. The two that didn't ended on a turnover on downs and an interception.  Houston defensive back Jeremiah Johnson went live-eating on a Lauletta pass he intercepted — his second in as many weeks — to set up a field goal that extended the Gamblers' lead to 13-0.  With their first possession of the second half, the Gamblers offense got into position to let Vogel have another go from the 25-yard logo, and he splashed from 34 yards out to put the Gamblers up 16-0, a lead they would just make hold up.  The Generals managed to get on the scoreboard to avoid foreclosure at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, after getting their pockets emptied at the table by the Gamblers.  With about 10 minutes left to play, though, and just their second possession of the second half, the Generals mounted a 12-play, 90-yard offensive.  Lauletta found wideout Alonzo Moore on a drag route across the formation for his first passing TD of the year, closing the gap to 16-10 with 3:04 to play. Lauletta finished 17-of-39 with a TD and an INT.  ""I just feel like we got into a rhythm there,"" Lauletta said of the late surge. ""I was throwing the ball more accurately down the stretch, getting rid of the ball before the rush could get there and just trying to find open guys.""  After the TD, Riley made the decision to take advantage of the USFL rule that allows a team to attempt a fourth-and-12 play from their own 33-yard line instead of an onsides kick.  The attempt failed, however, and Houston took possession with just over three minutes left in the game.  The Gamblers knew when to hold ‘em, when to fold ‘em, and left the Bank riding a four-game winning streak, ready to hit the tables again next weekend and let it ride.

With their backs against the wall, the third-seeded Florida State softball team (53-9) turned to their ace, Kathryn Sandercock, and she delivered with the Seminoles’ 15th perfect game in school history to defeat South Carolina (40-22), 1-0, in a winner-take-all regional final matchup. The win advanced the Seminoles to their 10th Super Regional where they will host No. 14 Georgia in Tallahassee. Dates and times are still TBD.  Sandercock’s perfect game was the first solo perfect game since Meghan King did it on Mar. 12, 2016, against Tulsa. It was also Florida State’s first perfect game in the NCAA Tournament.  After South Carolina won game one 4-0 to force a second game, Sandercock got the start in the circle and gave a raucous crowd a lot to cheer about as she struck out the first batter she saw. Sandercock not only threw a perfect game, but the Gamecocks did not hit a single ball out of the infield as she recorded five strikeouts, 15 groundouts and one pop up to Josie Muffley. Sandercock needed just 59 pitches to retire the 21 batters she faced.  Offense was hard to come by for the Seminoles, but Muffley singled and advanced to second on a groundout in the third inning. Jahni Kerr laid down a perfect bunt, and the pitcher threw the ball away into left field allowing Muffley to score to give the Noles the only run they needed.  The game entered a 40 minute rain delay in the bottom of the fifth, but Sandercock was not fazed as she went right back to business, and didn’t give the Gamecocks any chance. Devyn Flaherty fielded the final groundball of the game to secure the perfect game for Sandercock.

(1:40)  LAS VEGAS -- It wasn't like the Dallas Stars didn't address why they lost a second straight overtime game to the Vegas Golden Knights.  If anything, there was more of a conversation around the circumstances of the tying goal in their 3-2 overtime loss Sunday in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals that sent the Stars to their first 0-2 series hole of these Stanley Cup playoffs.  Stars defenseman Ryan Suter had possession behind the net only for Golden Knights center Jack Eichel to come from behind and steal possession. Eichel played a give-and-go pass up the wall to Ivan Barbashev before Eichel shoveled a no-look, backhanded pass to Jonathan Marchessault, who beat Suter in coverage, in the low slot for a shot he lifted above Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger's glove for a 2-2 tie with 2:22 left in the third.  Marchessault's goal sent the game to overtime where Stars forward Wyatt Johnston nearly scored the winner 28 seconds into the frame before Chandler Stephenson netted the winning goal 44 seconds later.  The Stars cleared the puck out of their defensive zone but were caught in the midst of a line change that gave the Golden Knights a 4-on-3 advantage. From there, Mark Stone passed it to Shea Theodore, who fired a shot on net that Oettinger initially saved before Stephenson collected the rebound for the winner.  ""Definitely in the overtime for sure. Poor line change,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said when asked about the smoothness in his team's line changes in the series. ""It's a game of mistakes. They make a mistake, leave Johnston wide open in front of the net in overtime, too. It's just they stuck it in.""  Both DeBoer and Suter spoke about what went wrong on Marchessault's goal that allowed the Golden Knights to get back into the game.  Suter was the first to speak.  ""Did you watch it?"" Suter said to a reporter. ""Then, you know what happened.""  He was then asked what he would have wanted to do differently in that situation.  ""That's for us to talk about,"" Suter said. ""Obviously, it wasn't the right play and it ended up past us.""  As for DeBoer? He said he was ""not going to start assigning blame"" on around what happened on the tying goal.  ""There's mistakes made, and they cashed in, and they made a real good play,"" DeBoer said. ""Jack Eichel makes a world-class pass.""  Being in a 2-0 series hole is an unfamiliar role for the Stars. They opened their first-and second-round series against the Minnesota Wild and Seattle Kraken with overtime defeats in Game 1 before winning Game 2 en route to winning those respective series.  Yet the inability to find success in overtime has been a familiar experience for the Stars this postseason. Stephenson's winning goal condemned the Stars to what is now an 0-4 record in the extra frame this postseason.  How DeBoer spoke about the Stars' effort in Game 2 was far different than how he sounded Friday after Game 1. DeBoer stressed that the Stars looked sharper Sunday than they did in the opener.  What Dallas achieved in the first two periods against Vegas was a reflection of what the Stars had done to reach the conference finals. Entering Sunday, they led all postseason teams in the fewest scoring chances per 60 in 5-on-5 play while allowing the third-fewest shots in 5-on-5 play, per Natural Stat Trick.  The Stars limited the Golden Knights, who are sixth in shots per 60, to a combined 10 shots through the first 40 minutes.  So, what changed? The Golden Knights started gaining control of the puck while finding ways to maximize that control. In their first two periods, they had a 41% shot share. But in the third period, the Golden Knights had a 63.45 shot share, which explains how they were able to break through for 12 shots despite not having any power-play chances.  After Game 1, DeBoer talked about why the Stars must find answers when it came to their overtime struggles.  Less than 48 hours later, overtime remains an equation the Stars are still trying to solve.  ""We had a good chance right before they score,"" Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen said. ""If we can capitalize on that and score on that, the series is 1-1. They got the bounce there and scored on that. Of course, it's little details and tough bounces sometimes. But we have to go out there and attack and try to score goals.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25obC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzA0MTEzL3N0YXJzLXN0dW1ibGUtbG9zcy1mYWNlLTItMC1kZWZpY2l00gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmhsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc3MDQxMTMvc3RhcnMtc3R1bWJsZS1sb3NzLWZhY2UtMi0wLWRlZmljaXQ_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Saturday, the Blue Bombers punched their ticket to the Section VII, Class D championship game with a 14-0 victory over the Bolton/Schroon Lake Wild Eagles on their home diamond.  The team will face Crown Point in the title game on Wednesday at the Chip Cummings Field in Plattsburgh. The game will start at 4:30 p.m.  Lake Placid took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first inning, before plating four runs in the third inning. The Blue Bombers then scored two runs in the fifth and seven runs in the sixth.  Lake Placid’s senior pitcher, P.J. Colby, kept the Wild Eagles in check with a complete game shutout. Colby recorded 13 strikeouts while walking five batters and giving up two hits.  Bolton/Schroon Lake’s Isaiah Pelkey earned the pitching loss, while striking out eight Lake Placid hitters. Pelkey gave up five hits and four earned runs before being relieved in the fourth inning. Sully Eager and Jace Hubert pitched the final two innings.  “It’s the second game in a row that they have locked horns and it was a pitcher’s duel. But we started to time Isaiah,” Blue Bombers head coach Brian Brandes said. “We had a lot of bats on balls today and I’m very proud of them, I’m very proud of their defense and PJ Colby on the mound.”  In the last matchup between the two squads, Lake Placid struggled offensively and relied heavily on a small ball approach and its pitcher Colby, who tossed a no-hitter that day.  But on Saturday, the Blue Bombers had the bats rolling, recording 10 hits while limiting their defensive errors to just two in the field.  “We could feel it for the last couple of weeks that it was more of a business going into this — basically to take care of business,” Brandes said.  Vann Morelli, a sophomore, led Lake Placid with three hits, while fellow sophomores Jon Caito and Jarrett Mihill each had two hits. Colby had the game’s lone extra-base hit with a double in the bottom of the third inning.  Andy Morehouse and Tyler Trowbridge picked up the lone hits for the Wild Eagles.  With a 1-0 lead, Colby’s double was followed by back-to-back singles from Mihill and Morelli and an error from a Bolton/Schroon Lake player allowing Hyler Isham to reach first. All four baserunners were able to score in the inning.  After scoring two runs in the fifth inning on past balls, the Blue Bombers rattled off seven straight runs in the sixth, with Caito, Morelli, Mihill and Will Landriault earning RBI singles in the inning to close out the contest.  The team improved to 11-3 overall with the win.  Wednesday will mark Lake Placid’s first trip to a sectional title game since 2019, when the Blue Bombers lost to the eventual state champions Ticonderoga Sentinels in the Section VII, Class C championship contest. It has also been five years since Lake Placid’s last Class D title victory in 2018.  “None of these guys have been there,” Brandes said. “It’s a brand-new team. We have a lot of young kids succeeding so it’s very nice to see.”  The Blue Bombers will take on the reigning Section VII, Class D champions the Crown Point Panthers on Wednesday after the Panthers defeated Chazy 12-7 in the other semifinal contest. Lake Placid defeated Crown Point in both of its matchups this season.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFkaXJvbmRhY2tkYWlseWVudGVycHJpc2UuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9sb2NhbC1zcG9ydHMvMjAyMy8wNS9ib21iZXJzLWJsYXN0LWludG8tdGl0bGUtZ2FtZS0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After dropping Games 1 and 2 at home, the C's were utterly outclassed by the Miami Heat in Sunday's Game 3 at Kaseya Center. Miami dominated the first three quarters and had the Celtics waving the white flag with their reserves in the fourth quarter of the lopsided affair. The Heat earned a 128-102 win to put Boston down 0-3 in the Eastern Conference Finals series.  POSTGAME POD: Celtics pushed to the brink after blowout loss in Game 3 | Listen & Subscribe  Six Heat players scored in double figures during their lopsided win. Gabe Vincent led all scorers with 29 points while Duncan Robinson (22 points) and Caleb Martin (18 points) enjoyed big nights off the bench. Jimmy Butler was kept relatively quiet with 16 points on 5-of-16 shooting, but it didn't matter with Miami's role players taking over.  Jayson Tatum (14 points) and Jaylen Brown (12 points) led the C's in scoring despite their abysmal offensive performances. Grant Williams also notched 12 in his 27 minutes off the bench.  No team has ever come back from being down 0-3 in an NBA playoff series. The Celtics will look to become the first, starting with Tuesday's Game 4 in Miami.  Here are three quick takeaways from Sunday's loss.  Torched by Heat role players  The Celtics struggled to get stops throughout Game 3. They allowed the Heat to shoot a ridiculous 56.8 percent from the floor, including 54.3 percent (19-of-35) from 3-point range. Much of that damage was done not by Jimmy Butler, but by Miami's role players.  Caleb Martin (11 points), Duncan Robinson (10 points), and Gabe Vincent (10 points) -- each undrafted -- lit Boston up in the first half. They set the tone early for the Heat with their 3-point shooting as they were a combined 7-for-12 from beyond the arc through the first two frames.

Vincent went off for 19 more points to finish with 29 on 11-of-14 shooting. He hit six of his nine 3-point attempts.  Robinson ended up with 22 points on 7-of-11 shooting, including 5-for-7 from 3. Martin also shot 7-for-11 from the field (4-7 3-PT) to tally 18 total points. The trio's performance helped to take pressure off Jimmy Butler, who was outstanding in Games 1 and 2.  Meanwhile, the Celtics bench was mostly shut down before the reserves entered in garbage time. Malcolm Brogdon was held scoreless and 0-for-6 from the field. Robert Williams found himself in foul trouble and finished with eight points (4-8 FG).  The Jays held in check  The Celtics needed their superstars to step up and get the series back on track, but neither Jayson Tatum nor Jaylen Brown could get it going in the crucial Game 3 showdown.  They were a combined 9-of-24 from the floor (1-7 3-PT) with five turnovers and zero free-throw attempts in the first half. Usually, at least one of the two finds their groove after a slow start. However, that was not the case this time as their woes continued, leading to Boston being blown out in a must-win matchup.  To put their struggles in perspective, Gabe Vincent scored more points (29) as Tatum and Brown combined (26).

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T06:06:00","Joe Mazzulla takes the fall for the Celtics' third straight loss to the Heat. (0:59)  MIAMI -- Demons were born Sunday night, those thoughts that stick in the head and on detractors' lips.  The Boston Celtics have played hundreds of memorable playoff games in their storied history, but for the foreseeable future, just saying ""Game 3"" is going to sting without any needed context.  Frankly, the Miami Heat have a pretty good catalog of playoff moments, yet their 128-102 victory to take a 3-0 Eastern Conference finals lead might get its own special heading. Unexpected success is often the sweetest, and the Heat and their fans were floating on that emotion.  Miami coach Erik Spoelstra, in the midst of painting his masterpiece by being on the verge of a career-affirming improbable Finals appearance for a No. 8 seed that was three minutes from not making it out of the play-in tournament, had to take measures to hold all the emotions in.  ""That was a solid, mature, professional approach,"" Spoelstra said Sunday night, realizing his job is now shifting to managing massive success. ""But we have respect, deep respect, for Boston.""  It is going to be tempting for the Celtics to make ""Game 3"" a watershed moment. To let the overwhelming disappointment of being thoroughly dominated and humiliated cause an angry response.  This is a hugely talented, experienced and expensive team that is on its way out of the postseason with a dud. When that happens in pro sports, there is typically a blame game that demands action.  There's going to be a push for firings, trades and makeovers in Boston. It's going to be like a dam straining against a flood. In a matter of days and three losses, this has transitioned from a team favored by the computers and the sportsbooks to win the title to a franchise in crisis.  Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck spent much of the third quarter, as his team was getting outscored 32-17, looking at his phone in his courtside seat trying to focus on anything else.  Team president Brad Stevens stood outside the Celtics' locker room after the game stunned at what he'd just seen, making sure to give credit to the Heat for their vanquishing.  Jayson Tatum, who seven days earlier had played one of the finest games in NBA history as he set a record in scoring 51 points in a Game 7 Eastern Conference semifinals victory, dragged himself to the postgame podium wearing the all-white suit he'd picked out for this game.  play 2:52 Heat cruise to 26-point win over Celtics, take 3-0 series lead Gabe Vincent and the Miami Heat jump out to a big lead early and never look back, thanks to the team's 19 3-pointers in a 128-102 win over the Boston Celtics.  Miami chic, no doubt, but it came across as such the wrong tenor after what happened in front of the typical ""white out"" Heat playoff crowd. It could've come off as confident; Tatum has had some awesome road playoff games in his career, but this was such a flat note that it was hard not to make it a symbolic connection to the outcome.  ""Obviously, we're in a tough position,"" Tatum said after an anemic 14 points on 6-of-18 shooting. ""But we've just got to have some pride.""  And then there was Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, whose game plan to accept all the blame for the loss was as ineffective as his strategy was for the game itself.  ""I just didn't have them ready to play,"" Mazzulla said, over and over. ""I have to get them in a better place ready to play, and that's on me.""  Mazzulla doth not protest too much. He was so over-the-top in trying to rip the attention toward himself and away from his team, a group that had played so lifelessly, that his tactics were transparent.  He's in the midst of learning many lessons in his first playoffs as a head coach, and this was yet another one. There's an art to being a shield -- and this wasn't it.  There is a wave of anger from New England and a rising expectation elsewhere Mazzulla will pay the price for this 0-3 hole the Celtics find themselves in. Stevens is a huge believer in Mazzulla and made the choice not only to promote him but also to make him the permanent coach midway through the season.  Stevens will tell you about his first season as an NBA coach in 2013 when he made mistake after mistake, some of them embarrassing. Like when he drew up a side out-of-bounds play for a last-second shot only to realize, to his horror, after the timeout that the ball was on the baseline and not the sideline.  Stevens knows when you have a rookie coach, rookie mistakes will be made.  Before Game 3, if you were around the Celtics, you'd know there was no chance Mazzulla would not be back next season.  After Game 3, nothing feels certain.  There is a question about whether the Celtics can give Jaylen Brown an extension worth more than $280 million this offseason. His performance has been dreadful in this series; he was 0-of-7 from 3-point range Sunday and is 2-for-20 from 3 in the three losses against Miami.  Before Game 3, it seemed like locking down Brown, 26, was automatic; getting a player at his age in his position under control for five years is good business.  After Game 3, it is human nature to wonder if the Tatum-Brown pairing is great or just very good. And considering they both might each cost more than $50 million in salary per season soon, is just very good actually good enough?  ""The series isn't over yet,"" Brown said. ""It's looking bad, but you come out, have some pride about yourself.""  This soul-searching could go on. It's easy to question just what happened to the Celtics' strong defense -- they are a shell of the team that made the Finals last season -- but then there's the continued lineup changes and the effort level and the inexplicable delay to double-team Heat star Jimmy Butler.  And that's the penalty for going down the way the Celtics are in this stunning collapse. It will cost more than just a chance at a title. This is the kind of loss that can rob a team of its confidence and its direction.  What has happened over the past five days for the Celtics is more than disappointing. The Heat are just crushing them. But the way it has unfolded has now become so much more than that.  And that could be what Game 3's true legacy is.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzA0ODkyL3doeS1nYW1lLTMtbG9zcy1tZWFuLW11Y2gtbW9yZS1jZWx0aWNzLWpvZS1tYXp6dWxsYdIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NzA0ODkyL3doeS1nYW1lLTMtbG9zcy1tZWFuLW11Y2gtbW9yZS1jZWx0aWNzLWpvZS1tYXp6dWxsYT9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With the victory, the Lions forced the ""if necessary"" game which will begin at roughly 3 p.m.  The Mavericks opened the top of the first with second baseman Matthew Fleischhacker reaching base after getting hit by a pitch. Shortstop Aidan Byrne followed with a walk, bringing right fielder Jackson Hauge to the plate.  Hauge drove a single through the right side, scoring Fleischhacker and moving Byrne to third. Centerfield Ryan Wickman then laced a single to center field, scoring Byrne and moving Hauge to third.  The Mavericks picked up their third run of the game when Hauge scored on a groundout off the bat of third baseman Mikey Gottschalk as the Mavericks took a 3-0 lead after a half inning.  The Mavericks picked up another run in the top of the third as Gottschalk walked to lead off the inning. Left fielder Adam Weed grounded out to move Gottschalk to second before he moved to third on a wild pitch.  First baseman Adam Schneider then singled through the right side to score Gottschalk and push the Maverick advantage to 4-0.  Missouri Southern got three runs back in the bottom of the fourth when first baseman Matt Miller doubled down the right field line, scoring Henry Kusiak who had reached on an infield single to third.  Will Doherty then walked to load the bases before Cheyton Beck singled up the middle, scoring two and cutting the Maverick lead to 4-3. Maverick starter Chandler Fochs then got a flyout to end the damage.  The Lions would six runs in the bottom of the fifth to open up a 9-4 lead. Missouri Southern took advantage of five hits and three walks.  Fochs worked four-plus innings allowing three runs on six hits while striking out two and walking one en route to earning the no-decision.  Neither team would have much of a threat until the top of the ninth when Wickman led off with a single to left before Gottschalk was hit by a pitch, forcing the Lions to bring in a relief pitcher.  Both runners would advance on a passed ball when Weed struck out. Schneider grounded to first, scoring Wickman, before Baker drew a two-out walk. Lion reliever Cale McCallister then stopped the threat with a strikeout to end the game.

"game","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T18:37:00","Ever since the bitter ending of the 2016 Wild Card game, Toronto has hardly been a welcoming place for the Orioles. Heading into the 2023, the Orioles were 17-28 in Rogers Centre since Buck Showalter made the ill-fated decision to pitch Ubaldo Jimenez instead of Zach Britton in that winner-take-all playoff match up. However, the first 45 games of this season have been a referendum on all those who expected the Orioles to backslide toward mediocrity. In a similar manner, Friday night’s win over the Blue Jays in Toronto can be seen as a turning of the tide when it comes to the O’s success north of the border.  What seemingly never changes is just how locked in Ryan Mountcastle is when he steps up to the plate against the Blue Jays. After going 1-3 with the decisive three-run HR on Friday, the O’s first baseman raised his career average against the Toronto to .323, to go along with a 1.030 OPS, 15 HRs and 36 RBIs. After hitting .313 with a 5 HRs and 17 RBIs in Rogers Centre last season, RMC seems intent to continue to victimizing Blue Jays pitching in 2023.  Today, Mountcastle and the rest of the Orioles lineup are tasked with doing damage against one of the AL’s best pitchers from last season in Alek Manoah. After finishing third in AL Cy Young voting last year, Manoah’s start to the 2023 campaign has been less than spectacular. After putting up mixed results in the first month of the season—two quality starts balance out by two truly poor start—Manoah’s disappointed throughout May. In three starts this month, the big right-hander is 0-3 with a 6.59 ERA and .321 batting average against. These struggles from Manoah are a welcome sign to the Orioles hitters that struggled against the All-Star pitcher last year. In five starts against Baltimore last year, Manoah limited Orioles hitters to a .180 average on his way to 2.54 ERA against the Birds from Baltimore.  The Orioles counter with their own flaming-throwing righty in rookie Grayson Rodriguez. The O’s prized rookie starter has been equally up and down throughout his first eight big league starts. We’ve seen some excellent efforts—back-to-back starts of five shutout innings against Detroit, only allowing two runs in 5.2 innings against league best Tampa Bay—to go along with some less-than-stellar outings. Last Monday against the Angels was Rodriguez’ worst start of the season, allowing eight runs over 3.1 innings against Shohei Ohtani and the Angels. The good news: Rodriguez has been better overall on the road this season. His ERA away from Camden Yards is over 1.5 runs lower and he’s put up strikeout rate of over 12 per nine innings on the road.

Each game seems to have one mistake you can circle as the reason for the loss. They say you lose as a team, and it is never about one play. Everything still seems to go back to the start of this losing streak when the Nats held a 2-run lead in the 9th inning and blew the save via a Marlins’ walk-off home run.  In manager Dave Martinez‘s postgame presser last night, he did not look to be his normal self, and the pressure might be getting to him. Remember, Martinez is on the final four months of his contract — unless he receives an extension.  “[Saturday], we’ve got to come out ready to play — from the first pitch on.” — manager Dave Martinez was not happy  The Nats starters have a combined ERA of 4.47 for 16th best in MLB.

We’re now we’re in mid-May and EA Sports has still not unveiled Madden NFL 24. We have no idea about the Madden 24 cover athlete, a release date or platforms, or any new gameplay features. For football fans eager for a first look at this year’s game, when can we expect EA to lift the curtain?  When will EA reveal Madden 24?  Looking at the calendar, the next major gaming event is Summer Game Fest. The annual summer gaming celebration, which has effectively replaced E3, is scheduled to take place from June 8 through June 10.  In previous years, EA would host its own showcase separate from E3 or Summer Game Fest; however, plans changed last year when the publisher chose not to hold the event and instead reveal each of its games when it was right for them.  EA has not announced any plans for EA Play Live 2023, which suggests they could once again be opting not to hold a showcase. They could instead be taking the same approach of showing a game when there’s something significant to show.  With the Madden NFL 24 Closed Beta taking place in June, EA could be waiting to reveal this year’s game next month. Perhaps at Summer Game Fest? If you recall, Madden 23 was revealed on June 2, while Madden 22 was unveiled on June 17.  EA’s struggles with the Madden franchise have been well-documented these past few years. After Madden 23’s disappointment — especially the major franchise save bug — there’s a lot riding on Madden 24. If EA were to put out another lackluster football game, it could spell the end of the franchise as far as fans are concerned.  Maybe that’s why EA has waited so long to reveal the game. Maybe they want to make sure everything is buttoned up and polished for a good first impression.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYXBwdHJpZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9tYWRkZW4tMjQtcmV2ZWFsLWNvbWluZy1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LWp1bmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Corbin (3-5) allowed two runs and six hits in six innings against the Tigers, the only big league team he had never faced. He struck out three, reaching 1,500 in his career when he fanned Jonathan Scoop in the sixth.  “Always cool to hit those milestones,"" Corbin said. ""I guess it means you've been around awhile. I think it's even sweeter to come away with a win today.""  Following up on a win over the New York Mets, Corbin won consecutive starts for the first time since beating Cincinnati on Aug. 28 and the Mets on Sept. 3. He settled in after allowing a first inning two-run homer.  “I thought everything was solid,” Corbin said. “I thought I located well. A lot of quick at-bats. A few less pitches there, which is good. ... You give up the homer, but it's still early so you just forget about it, move forward and try to put up as many zeros as you can.”  Follow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules  Carl Edwards Jr., Hunter Harvey and Kyle Finnegan finished with hitless relief. Finnegan converted his ninth save in 11 chances, ending a game that took 2 hours, 3 minutes.  Jeimer Candelario homered and hit a run-scoring double for Washington, which fell behind when Spencer Torkelson homered in the first. The Tigers managed four more singles against Corbin, but couldn't string together hits.  “He just started keeping the ball on the ground,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “I think almost half his outs were on the ground.""  Alex Faedo (0-2) gave up three runs and five hits in five innings. Detroit had won three of four.  After Candelario's fourth-inning homer, Thomas' single past diving shortstop Javier Báez gave the Nationals a 3-2 lead in the fifth.  “It jammed me a little bit but luckily it found a hole,” Thomas said.  Thomas had three hits and has reached base in 17 straight games. He is hitting .348 during that stretch.  Keibert Ruiz added an RBI single in the sixth and Candelario doubled in Thomas in the eighth.  CANDY MAN CAN  Candelario is 12 for 23 (.521) with four doubles, a triple, two homers, five RBIs and five runs scored in his past six games.

(WDAM) - University of Southern Mississippi senior third baseman Danny Lynch needed just about half a baseball game to post one the most remarkable days at the plate in Pete Taylor Park history.  Through five innings Saturday afternoon, Lynch became the first Golden Eagle to hit two grand slams in a game, tying a program record with eight RBIs, as the Golden Eagles rassled with the University of Louisiana in the final regular-season game of 2023 for both teams.  USM had hit two grand slams in a game before, with Matt Baltz and David Vilardi each going deep with the bases loaded in 1999 against Nicholls State University in Hattiesburg.  But Lynch became Saturday the first Golden Eagles to hit two grand slams in the same game.  Lynch’s first home run cleared the fence in right field and cleared the bases in the bottom of the first inning off Louisiana starter David Christie, tying the game, 4-4.  Reece Ewing, Christopher Sargent and Rodrigo Montenegro scored for the Golden Eagles.  Trailing 8-5 heading into the bottom of the fifth inning, Lynch homered with the bases loaded off Louisiana reliver Brendan Moody, giving USM a short-lived 9-8 lead against the Ragin’ Cajuns.  Ewing, Montenegro and Dustin Dickerson scored on Lynch’s second home run.  Lynch became the fifth Golden Eagles to drive in eight runs in a single game, joining Slade Wilks (2023, James Madison University); Hunter Slater (2019, University of New Orleans); Tommy Davis (1994, University of Tennessee-Martin); and Fred Cooley (1988, Belhaven University.

Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled the latest round of additions to Game Pass that would be rolling out in the days ahead. Some of these forthcoming arrivals include Massive Chalice, Railway Empire 2, and Chicory: A Colorful Tale, to name a few. And while this lineup is pretty solid overall, it won't come without the cost of a handful of losses.  Taking place at the end of this month on May 31st, Xbox Game Pass will see the departure of five games in total. Of this group, four of the games in question are available across both the console and PC versions of Game Pass while the one remaining title is solely locked to PC. When it comes to the various genres of these games, they include a pair of strategy titles, one sports game, and a hidden indie gem.  Here's every game that is departing from Xbox Game Pass in a little over a week:  FIFA 21 (Console and PC)  Evil Genius 2: World Domination (Console and PC)  Lawn Mowing Simulator (Console and PC)  Floppy Knights (Console and PC)  Europa Universalis IV (PC Only)  All in all, there aren't many big-name games on this list that happen to be getting removed from Game Pass. FIFA 21 would have been quite notable to be taken away at one point, but Game Pass has since added both FIFA 22 and FIFA 23 via EA Play. Still, as a final reminder, if you'd like to look to snag any of these games for yourself before they leave Xbox Game Pass, you can buy them outright at 20% off from their normal price to ensure continued access to them in the future.  Are you disappointed to see that any of these games are leaving Xbox Game Pass before June? And will you look to purchase any of these titles at a lower cost before they leave the service?

"game","2019-02-18","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T18:56:00","So, the NB A is considering changing the All-Star game format yet again. According to a report by Shams Charania and Mike Vorkunov of The Athletic, this has been a topic discussed recently among the Board of Governors (team owners) and general managers. The A ssociation wants to increase the competitiveness of the All-Star game and apparently feels like this is one of the solutions.  Maybe they’ve forgotten, but the format of the game was changed in 2018 due in part to a lack of competitiveness in the game. And that’s not anything new for the NBA’s All-Star game. It’s been a glorified 24 H our F itness pickup game for the past decade, no matter the format. Teams barely play defense in the regular season, so it shouldn’t be shocking that no one is going all out in the All-Star game. Players have little incentive to lay it all on the line like those back in the day. That’s just how players view it.  Advertisement  Thirty years ago, when role players weren’t bringing in eight-figure salaries, guys wanted every extra penny they could come across. So, the added bonus that came with playing on the winning team of an All-Star game was huge even for stars of the game back then. Now, most players who play in the All-Star game already have $100+ million contracts that are guaranteed, so playing hard in an exhibition with the potential of getting injured is out of the question. We’re lucky they play hard in the closing minutes when the game is on the line. But expecting every player to go full throttle in a game that means nothing to them is purely naïve.  Keep the draft aspect, even if the game reverts to East vs. West  If the NBA does go back to East vs. West, they should keep the drafting aspect of the game. Fans have enjoyed that for the past few years, and it adds a little spice to the event. Whether it’s players getting “snubbed” or guys trash-talking each other, as we saw with James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the early years of the current format. That drama adds to the spectacle because those one-on-one encounters are usually the most competition we get surrounding the game.  Advertisement  There could still be team captains if the league wanted to keep that wrinkle. Each team captain could only pick from the pool of players in their respective conferences. That would be the simplest way to reform this process and still make it fun for fans while also being able to create content for television, which is what all this is about. It always comes back to advertising, TV partnerships, and dollar, dollar bills y’all. That’s the name of the game.  As far as getting players to take this game seriously like they would any other, well, that’s a pipedream. The NBA can make all the changes they want, and it still won’t matter. That ship sailed long ago, and it ain’t returning. Going back to East against West would be a nice bit of nostalgia, but that’s about it. We’ll continue to hear the same complaints from fans and media that we’ve heard for years. Aside from money, players have little incentive to play hard for 48 minutes in an All-Star game. When you’ve got players who can make $5-10 million per year and never sniff an All-Star selection, good luck getting high-paid stars to play that game like it means anything of consequence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZHNwaW4uY29tL25iYS1hbGwtc3Rhci1nYW1lLWVhc3Qtd2VzdC1jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLTE4NTA0NTg0OTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}","2023-05-20T11:00:52","Over the past few years, I’ve found myself mourning the PlayStation brand I grew up with. When I was a kid, PlayStation was an eccentric platform home to the kind of oddball creative swings you now only ever see indie publishers take a chance on. In the PS5 era, though, Sony has doubled down on a cinematic action-adventure formula that feels less safe (though likely way more profitable) by comparison. It’s an understandable pivot, but it leaves me hungry for more diverse experiences on my PS5.  Thankfully, that desire has been satiated with Humanity, a game that’s already nabbing several impressive accolades from me. It’s the best reason to subscribe to PS Plus, the best game currently available on PlayStation VR2, and perhaps the best PS5 console-exclusive period (it’s also available on PC via Steam). The unique puzzler has all the markings of those left-field PlayStation classics I love … except for the fact it wasn’t developed or published by Sony at all.  Recommended Videos  Whether you enjoy complex puzzle games or just want a good excuse to use your PSVR2, Humanity is one of 2023’s few “can’t miss” games. What starts as a straightforward game about directing rows of marching people quickly turns into an insightful, challenging, and at times dark meditation on humanity’s ability to evolve and organize.  A true PlayStation game  In Humanity, players control a shiba inu tasked with herding rows of wandering humans through puzzle chambers. Each trial is set in a small room and largely revolves around an endless stream of humans flowing out of a door. In most levels, the goal is to direct that aimless traffic by placing commands down on tiles that the humans will follow when they pass by them. These include telling them when to turn or jump, as well as granting them the power to split into different directions, float, and more. Generally, they need to be directed towards some sort of goal, though that formula gets twisted in increasingly clever ways later on.  That premise creates some striking visual imagery. It’s a bit of a marvel to see thousands of tiny humans wandering around on screen — and it’s even more impressive once they’re following the intricate pathways I lay out for them. One level had me splitting rows of humans down a Q*bert-esque grid so they could reach three different goals. Another has me sending them crisscrossing over a bridge by floating over fans, creating multiple archways of human bodies. There’s something oddly satisfying about that; It’s like watching ants march around in their incredibly disciplined fashion.  While it can be played outside of VR, the experience gets even better in a headset. My playthrough has almost exclusively been in PSVR2, where I get a bird’s eye view of each level. That lets me get a better look at each level and game plan much easier, while enhancing that ant hill perspective even more. It’s an immersive experience and by far the most compelling reason to pick up Sony’s new headset yet.  A lot of excellent puzzle games come to mind as I play through its engrossing trials. Its diorama-like levels remind me of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, while the visual of a stream of bodies wandering around helplessly makes it feel like a modern version of Lemmings. The closest comparison, though, is something even more obscure: Echochrome. The 2008 Sony title (which is available in PS Plus’ retro catalog) has players controlling the path of an autonomous mannequin. Humanity very much feels like a spiritual successor to that title, right down to a powerful level creator that’ll give it lots of longevity beyond its 80 main puzzles.  As I played through it, I had to double-check to make sure it hadn’t been developed internally at PlayStation Studios. It’s a tonal dead-ringer for the platform’s older exclusives, holding that same atmospheric weirdness that makes games like Fantavision or I.Q.: Intelligent Qube so endearing. Perhaps that’s why Sony has included it as a freebie for PS Plus members, one of the best moves it has made with its subscription service platform so far. It’s perfectly positioned for the current PlayStation ecosystem.  The dark side of humanity  I knew that Humanity’s challenging puzzles would get my brain moving, but I didn’t expect it to hit me as hard as it did on a thematic level too. Though it may look like a simple puzzle game about routing objects to a destination (like Freshly Frosted, but with humans instead of donuts), there’s a surprisingly rich meditation about human evolution here — and a dark one at that.  That’s because of a big gameplay change midway through its seven themed chapters. Each set of levels introduces a new tool or idea that helps the at first aimless humans better deal with obstacles. At around the midway point, it tosses in computer-controlled humans who are in competition with your little guys. That playful dynamic quickly balloons into a full-on war, as the rival faction starts attacking with laser guns and swords. That’s where things radically change.  Around chapter four, Humanity gives players a set of new commands: ones that arm humans with weapons. While the gameplay hook remains the same, levels morph into real-time tactics battles where players need to find the right way to push back against waves of ongoing enemies and wipe them out en route to safety. The cute navigation puzzles soon become dark, with tooltips explaining useful battle formations instead of helpful puzzle hints. I watch as my dumb little herd of humans turns into an organized militia, cutting down thousands of faceless people with cold efficiency.  It’s a brilliant twist that speaks to the quietly subversive nature of Humanity. It isn’t just giving players stylish routing puzzles for the sake of brain-teasing fun. Rather, it’s using that format to visualize the way that civilizations form from chaos — in both astonishing and terrifying ways. It’s a more effective commentary on war than any Call of Duty game I’ve played.  Humanity is certainly a bit of a niche title. Some of its convoluted puzzle solutions are sure to cause frustration, even though the game includes handy video solutions for each one. Though I’d still recommend it to anyone who usually doesn’t click with the genre. This is one of those special, one-of-a-kind games that puts more thought into how game mechanics can naturally communicate some ideas better than any other medium. It’s a totally oddball experience and one that I’m hoping we see Sony nurture more in its current big-budget ecosystem.  Humanity is out now on PS4, PS5, and PC. It’s compatible with VR headsets, including PlayStation VR2.

"game","2023-05-24","21:00:00","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T21:33:51","With the absence of E3, Sony is kicking off the first major event of the gaming season with their PlayStation Showcase, scheduled for May 24th at 1 pm PST / 9 pm BST / 6 am AEST (next day).  What makes it intriguing is that this showcase serves as a precursor to the Summer Game Fest 2023 event, commencing on June 8th. Of particular interest is the wording used by Sony when they announced the event, stating that they will discuss upcoming PS5 titles. This suggests that the showcased games might leverage the advancements of the PlayStation 5, including the SSD technology and 60 FPS performance.  While we cannot predict the future, here are a few notable games that we anticipate will be revealed. Are you excited to see if any of your most anticipated games will make an appearance?  Ghost of Tsushima – In-game Screenshot  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2  The first game on our list is the highly anticipated Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, featuring the iconic web-slinging hero in the vibrant setting of New York City. Developed by Insomniac, who previously delivered an exceptional experience with Spider-Man for PlayStation 4 in 2018, this game was nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards. It marked Insomniac’s successful foray into creating a Marvel superhero game, captivating gamers with the immersive thrill of becoming Spider-Man.  Receiving glowing reviews from critics and achieving resounding success, Spider-Man set the stage for the release of its spin-off title, Miles Morales, in 2020. Though a shorter game in comparison to its predecessor, Spider-Man: Miles Morales was equally fantastic, leaving fans wondering if a Spider-Man 2 was on the horizon.  At the PlayStation Showcase in 2021, Insomniac delighted fans by unveiling both a thrilling trailer for Spider-Man 2 and an exciting new project, Marvel’s Wolverine. Sony officially announced that the release window for Spider-Man 2 is set for 2023, as confirmed on the PlayStation Blog. Insomniac later specified a more precise release in Fall 2023 through a tweet in December 2022.  Since then, information about the game has been scarce, leaving fans eagerly awaiting a gameplay reveal and an official release date. As the anticipated release approaches, it’s highly likely that Insomniac will soon break their silence, providing fans with the exciting details they’ve been eagerly anticipating.  Spider-Man 2 Reveal Trailer  The Return of Metal Gear Solid  As a passionate fan, I’ve long held hope for the revival of some beloved franchises from Konami’s extensive catalogue, such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. Over the years, rumours have circulated about Konami’s potential plans, and my optimism grew when MGS producer Noriaki Okamura hinted at a series of announcements, including the return of a “long-awaited” franchise, in an interview with Famitsu.  Although Okamura’s statement leaves room for speculation, it carries weight considering his involvement in one of Konami’s most successful franchises, with the last instalment being The Phantom Pain in 2015. Based on this, I strongly believe that a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 could be in the works for the PlayStation platform. Konami might be seeking to regain momentum following disappointing releases like Metal Gear Survive and eFootball, and revisiting the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid 3, a favourite among many fans, would undoubtedly be met with great enthusiasm.  While it’s true that the series was primarily shaped by the renowned game director Hideo Kojima, it’s important to note that Konami retains the rights to the license and engine. Thus, they have the capability to create a remake even after parting ways with Kojima in 2015, following the release of MGS: The Phantom Pain and the cancellation of Silent Hill, represented by the PT demo.  Only time will reveal Konami’s intentions and whether they will embark on revitalising the Metal Gear Solid franchise. As a lifelong fan, I am eagerly keeping my fingers crossed for an exciting announcement and the potential resurrection of this beloved series.  Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain – In-game Screenshot  7 Good  Bloodborne Remaster at the PlayStation Showcase  We’re eagerly anticipating the possibility of another remastered edition of a PlayStation classic from 2015, developed by an acclaimed Game of the Year winner. Bloodborne, crafted by FromSoftware, garnered universal praise from both critics and players alike. Despite ultimately losing the Game of the Year award to The Witcher 3, Bloodborne left a lasting impact on the gaming community. Following the release of Dark Souls 2, where FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki took a backseat, he sought to regain his creative stride and found it in the Victorian-era, Souls-style gameplay of Bloodborne. Miyazaki himself has expressed that Bloodborne is his favourite title among the Souls-like games.  Since its initial launch in 2015, Bloodborne has been locked at a 30 FPS frame rate, designed to maximise the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 technology at the time. However, I strongly believe that the game would greatly benefit from a graphics overhaul and the ability to run smoothly at 60 FPS.  With its self-contained narrative reaching its conclusion, the likelihood of a sequel seems uncertain, making a remastered version a more feasible desire. Not only would a remaster enhance the visual experience, but it would also serve as a delightful treat for fans of FromSoftware, bridging the gap until the release of Elden Ring‘s highly anticipated first DLC, Shadows of the Erdtree.  I am confident that I speak on behalf of countless Souls fans when I say that a Bloodborne remaster would be a truly fantastic surprise, reigniting our love for this remarkable game and satisfying our craving for more unforgettable experiences from FromSoftware.  Bloodborne – Key Art  What Games Can You Expect At The PlayStation Showcase?  As the reveal season dawns upon us, Sony has chosen May 24th as the date to provide a glimpse into the future of PlayStation 5. While my personal hopes lie with certain titles, there is always room for surprises that may surpass our expectations. Could we witness the unveiling of a Ghost of Tsushima sequel, a final trailer for Final Fantasy 16, or even gameplay footage for Death Stranding 2? The possibilities are endless, and our desires and aspirations run deep.  I have a strong intuition that regardless of the specific reveals, fans will emerge from the showcase with a sense of hope and satisfaction, knowing that the future of PS5 holds promising games. Yet, all we can do for now is exercise patience and eagerly anticipate what awaits us not only during the showcase but also throughout the Summer Game Fest in June.  Irrespective of the outcome, I will be present with my popcorn and overflowing excitement, eager to witness the unveiling of new worlds to explore or the rejuvenation of beloved classics in a fresh light.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVjcmF0ZXIuY29tL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXdoYXQtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXMtd2lsbC13ZS1zZWUv0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ2FtZWNyYXRlci5jb20vcGxheXN0YXRpb24tc2hvd2Nhc2Utd2hhdC12aWRlby1nYW1lcy13aWxsLXdlLXNlZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

That’s the highest series I’ve had since my fusion in September. I bowled a 543 the week before the surgery and so I guess I feel like I’m almost all of the way back. After taking off the fall and bowling one league in the spring, I’m back to two for the summer. Baby steps and progress!  And this came at a time when I don’t really need a paragraph of filler. While I was getting into a pretty good rhythm Friday night, so were the Cubs. And they did it on both sides of the ball. I’m not going to be obtuse about it. This was a strong game with a lot of good things, things that can be built on and lead this team forward.  At the same time, I’m not ready to throw a parade. I felt this way a few weeks ago when they Cubs came home after a disastrously bad road trip to Miami and Washington with a solid win. Over the first 44 games of the season, the Cubs are like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde team. They can look so good at times and so bad at others.  The story is well known by now. The starting pitching has been fantastic. Teams that have starting pitching as good as what the Cubs have featured to date are generally playoff teams. There have been a couple of clunkers over the last week or so. but by and large the most dependable part of this Cubs team has been their starting pitching.  After that, it gets more and more dicey. The offense has been statistically one of the best in baseball. Interestingly much of that was put up before Christopher Morel joined the team. He has been hands down the best player on the team since he joined it 10 days ago. Of course, some of that is offset by the torrid April of Patrick Wisdom. Wisdom has fallen off in May and not long after, Morel arrived.  But the offense has been maddeningly inconsistent. The old habits of striking out all too often and struggling with runners on base have reared their head increasingly. Amusingly, when you sort out the numbers, the Cubs are 12th in total team strikeouts, not all that much higher than league average. Even though it feels like they’ve grounded into a million double plays, they’ve actually been below average at that.  It has certainly been frustrating to watch the offense be so good one night and come up empty the next. Still, they have legitimately been one of the top 10 offenses in baseball. Even with the inconsistency, you can live with the work being done by the lineup.  The real frustrating things for this team are the performance in high leverage situations. When you search splits on Baseball Reference, you can find a statistic called Clutch and another called cClutch. I’ve not studied the methodology to have any impression on the effectiveness of the stat. But I don’t imagine anyone here is going to fall over in shock that the Cubs stand last in both (and I have little doubt that the two measures more or less measure the same thing with a little different methodology). Actually, my impression is that the Cubs are an extreme outlier for the statistic. For what it’s worth, in that eye it is even more impressive that the Cubs remain one of the highest scoring teams.  Of course, we know exactly why that is. The Cubs have scored in bunches and they’ve had a lot of high scoring games. This is already their eighth double-digit scoring game. They have an eight and five sixes in addition. So the combination of relaxing at the plate and perhaps seeing a lot of “B” team relievers has led to some stratified results (though this team has not been shutout yet).  On the other side of the ball, the Cubs relievers. For what it’s worth, those Clutch and cClutch numbers show up again. Once again, the Cubs find themselves near the bottom. They are 29th in both, ahead of only the Cardinals. The Cubs are 22nd in reliever ERA. They are 29th in saves (though in fairness, 30th in opportunities). Their bullpen has 13 losses, most in baseball.  Interestingly, the overall WHIP is 12th at 1.26 and the opponent batting average is 14th at .234. So the overall reliever numbers aren’t horrible. Certainly Mark Leiter Jr. has helped to prop these numbers. But, using MLB.com and their definition of late/close, in those situations the Cubs drop to 1.56 and .291. The WHIP is 22nd and the opponent batting average is 29th.  Put another way, the Cubs check in with the highest team OPS when the team is ahead and the second lowest team batting average. This team is fantastic when ahead. So you’ll pardon me if I don’t fall head over heels for this team when they jump out to a lead and keep it. Granted, that Wednesday game was a gut punch. But that’s more the exception than the rule. This team usually just keeps pouring on.  This team needs to learn how to battle through the competitive games. They can’t run with the big boys until they do. Let’s look at three positives from this one.  Nico Hoerner checks in to the top spot. He had three hits and drove in four runs. In case you haven’t picked up on the oddity yet, Nico moves into the team lead in RBI (tied with Patrick Wisdom), despite spending 10 days on the injured list. Two of his four hits were doubles. Welcome back. We certainly missed you. Marcus Stroman hadn’t won since April 7. Glad to see that put to rest. Six innings, three hits, two walks, one run. He struck out four. There were games in that stretch that he probably should have won. This time he got it done. He picked up his eighth quality start to move into the major league lead. Julian Merryweather faced six batters and retired all six. He struck out two. So he had that garish first appearance against the Brewers. Since then? 16 games, 17 innings, 13 hits, four walks, five runs, 18 strikeouts. Of course, the Cubs are 5-11 in those 16 games. he has been one of those “B” team relievers. He gets some work here in a lopsided win and he does excellent with it. Today I’m going four deep. Why? Because I’m gonna just keep banging the Christopher Morel drum. He homered for the sixth time in nine games. That moves him into a tie for third on the team. He will catch Cody Bellinger for the second spot before Cody returns. With the homer, Morel has had a hit and scored a run in every game. He has 12 RBI and 12 runs in nine games. That would be a pace for 216 RBI and runs over 162 games. Clearly, it can’t last, but this is an amazing run. HIs BA dropped to .359, his OBP rose to .390 and SLG up to .872. That’s a wRC+ of 234.

Jameson will make his seventh start of the year seeking his first Cubs win. He has a 6.66 ERA over 24⅓ innings. He almost made it five innings in his last start, coming one out short. He did allow four runs. They were all earned because there is no error charged on a ball misplayed in left field that would have avoided all of the damage.  On the other side, veteran right hander Aaron Nola (3-3, 4.53, 55⅔ IP) will start. Nola is coming off of a loss in Colorado last Sunday. He pitched seven innings in that one, but allowed four runs. Nola hasn’t been totally dominant since 2018. But, he did have a 3.25 ERA last year in 205 innings for a Phillies team that reached the World Series. In the early going his strikeouts per nine innings pitched is a little over three lower than where it sits. Paired with that, he’s allowing a little more homers than he has. Long story short, in the early going Nola hasn’t been quite as impactful as we historically expect. Still, at 29, there is no reason to believe he’s washed up. Let’s hope he doesn’t find himself until after the Cubs leave town.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVkY3ViYmllYmx1ZS5jb20vMjAyMy81LzIwLzIzNzMwODc2LzIwMjMtY3Vicy1oZXJvZXMtYW5kLWdvYXRzLWdhbWUtNDTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlZGN1YmJpZWJsdWUuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMjAvMjM3MzA4NzYvMjAyMy1jdWJzLWhlcm9lcy1hbmQtZ29hdHMtZ2FtZS00NA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

You can sign up to receive stories like this in your inbox every Tuesday.  Dungeons & Dragons, the world’s most iconic tabletop role-playing game (RPG), has evolved from a niche fantasy game to a major cultural phenomenon, spawning books, documentaries, animated and live action television shows, references in popular culture, and recently a major motion picture.  It’s also led to a sub-genre of episodic live play, with audiences tuning in to watch players act and improvise, dare and create magic around a table bursting with figurines, dice, notebooks, and maps.  The world of D&D — and other popular tabletop RPGs — is an ever-expanding collection of lore, events, communities, and organizations.  Around Kansas City, there are clubs and guilds and groups for both the gamer enthusiast or role-playing curious.  Here’s an introduction to the wide world of D&D and the RPG community in the region.  Roll for initiative  Alperen Yazgi / Unsplash Dice are one of the essential elements of role-playing games, involving chance and improvisation.  First of all, you don’t need to know anything about D&D before getting involved. Not really. The game is complex, yes, but it grows as you grow. Whether age 12 or 20 or 92, there are plenty of regular beginner-friendly sessions to introduce you to the concept.  KCUR’s community engagement producer Zach Perez plays Dungeons & Dragons and has served as a Dungeon Master since college, making him the resident expert for D&D queries.  “In my experience, most people’s entry point for D&D is being friends with someone who already plays the game,” says Perez.  Wizards of the Coast, which produces Dungeons & Dragons, sells starter sets with pre-packaged stories and characters, to help groups learn together. If you don’t have friends in the know, consider checking out local groups, like the Kansas City Dungeons and Dragons Facebook group.  A handful of local businesses host beginner game nights. ReRoll Tavern, in North Kansas City, has D&D 5E for Beginners (that’s 5th Edition) on Monday nights in May and open campaigns to join every Saturday.  Game Cafe, in Independence, hosts Dungeons & Dragons night on Wednesdays, and Redux Society in the Crossroads has “Beginner D&D” on Thursday evenings.  Cardboard Corner Cafe, in Overland Park, has a Learn to Play D&D 5e session on May 29 and Peculiar Games and Hobbies in Peculiar, Missouri, hosts one on May 22.  Building character  Libby Hanssen / KCUR 89.3 ReRoll Tavern in North Kansas City offers beginning Dungeons & Dragons sessions, open play, and Paint n Take workshops to make customized miniature figures.  In RPGs, gamers create and play as characters who navigate fantasy worlds — tiefling warlocks and dragonborn paladins and half-elf rangers and, sure, humans too.  Creating a character is one of the first stages of the game, and the first opportunity for a new player to be imaginative and learn some of the features of the world. Some people create a new character with each campaign, some evolve their character game after game.  Perez recommends creating characters that are nothing like the real you.  “One of my favorite characters I’ve ever played was a 325-year-old dwarven woman named Olda who was raising a Lizardman as her son,” Perez says. “The reason she was one of my favorites is because of all the moments I had in thinking about how a different person would examine a situation.”  And while characters can exist purely in imagination (or rather, as documented on your character sheet), they can also be represented by miniature figurines, accoutrements on the gaming table, or even full costumes.  Many players enjoy painting their own mini figures. ReRoll Tavern hosts Paint n Take Workshops on Friday nights and TableTop Game & Hobby has monthly mini painting 101 and 102 classes.  Others personalize with customized dice. Check out the selection at LevelOne Game Shop in the River Market, the Geekery in Shawnee, Kansas, or learn more about dice making at Druid Dice in the Crossroads.  The adventure begins  Redux Society Many local organizations host beginning role-playing game sessions and welcome new players.  Building community is as much a part of the experience as playing the game.  Phil Kilgore, owner of TableTop Game & Hobby, credits Dungeons & Dragons for changing his life and has built his business to be a destination for area gamers. Perez spoke with Kilgore about the store’s evolution for KCUR’s series The Regulars.  Bringing together gamers from around the region, TableTop hosts RPG (Really Pleasant Gaming) Weekend June 9-11, filled with inspiration, community and adventure.  For teenagers looking for an opportunity to learn, the Kansas City Public Library hosts regular D&D sessions on Tuesdays at the Lucille H. Bluford Branch. (And they have snacks!) You can also learn more about the game by watching “Adventure Never Ends: A Tabletop Saga,” accessed through the library’s Kanopy account.  Mid-Continent Public Library hosts Teen Role-Playing Games at various times and locations as well as Teen Games: Dungeons & Dragons 101.  Another community group is The Role-Players Guild of Kansas City, a non-profit dedicated to “enhancing gaming in Kansas City and the surrounding areas since 1990.” The organization hosts monthly game days on first Saturdays at different area businesses, which includes ongoing D&D campaigns that welcome new players.  Becoming game master  ReRoll Tavern Building community is as much a part of the experience as playing the game. A large group gathers at ReRoll Tavern to play Dungeons & Dragons.  Though everyone’s actions determine the outcome of the adventure, the Dungeon Master (or Game Master) is the chief storyteller. They create the world, plot the challenges, determine success and failure, and play all the other characters in the story.  To make the leap from player to DM may seem daunting, but it is “often as easy as volunteering to be one, even if you don’t know much about it,” says Perez. “It can definitely be a lot, but I think it’s important to not put pressure on yourself to be incredible immediately. The best way to become a DM is to try doing it.”  There is a “How to be a Dungeon Master” course at KingCade Arcade in Overland Park on May 28. This class is Course 2, about improvising and world-building. (If you missed Course 1, call ahead and they’ll have the Course 1 material ready for you.)  TableTop has a variety of Game Master Boot Camp classes, covering everything an aspiring game master needs to know.  D&D is by no means the only tabletop RPG out there, with many designed for different ages and interests. No Thank You, Evil! is a fun introduction for families (and kids make great game masters).  Try out different tabletop role-player games on Mission: Board Games’ TTRPG nights at the North Kansas City location on Tuesday evenings or the Mission, Kansas location on Thursdays. TableTop has open play for the popular Pathfinder/Starfinder games on Tuesdays.  Events like KantCon, in July, and the Midwest GameFest, in December, are also great opportunities to try out new games and meet fellow gamers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnL2FydHMtbGlmZS8yMDIzLTA1LTIwL2thbnNhcy1jaXR5LWR1bmdlb25zLWRyYWdvbnMtdGFibGV0b3AtcnBnLWNhbXBhaWduLWdhbWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-10-12","19:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T02:23:00","Dead by Daylight looked to capture the spirit of classic horror franchises like Halloween and Friday the 13th, and now Level 99 Games is attempting to capture that same spirit with Dead by Daylight: The Board Game. Just like in the original video game, the board game version is a mostly cooperative affair that has players looking to start generators around various locations to power the exit gates, allowing you to escape. I say mostly because one player will play as the killer, attempting to sacrifice the Survivors and ultimately win the game. The game succeeds in building the necessary tension on each Survivor's turn, as the Killer can quickly get on a roll if you're not paying attention, and yet the Survivors have a bevy of handy abilities that can help keep them one step ahead. Dead by Daylight: The Board Game embraces its theme and brings players into the game with ease, and those who jump into this survival scenario will not regret it in the least.  Level 99 and designer D. Brad Dalton Jr. did a fantastic job fitting the various components and overall aesthetic to the theme, and credit especially goes to graphic designer Davy Wagnarok and sculptor Sergei Popovichev. The miniatures of the Survivors are all good, but it's really the Killer miniatures that stand out, and the creepy artwork on their Identity Boards helps bring them to life. Even the board, Movement Cards, and Prop Tiles contribute to the dour motif. That said, the Generator Progress Tokens feel too large for the smaller Generator Tile, and in the area of nitpicks, this might be one of the most oversized First Player Markers I've ever had to use, and I just never understand oversized First Player Markers.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Once you pick your location (through a double-sided board) you and the other players roll a Skill Check Die and place your Survivors, and the Killer player does the same. Then you all strategize and figure out where you want to go through Movement Cards, and since you can only move once per turn (without taking a Bonus Action), you need to really consider your move and what it allows you to do while also factoring in where you think the Killer might move to. That's because you won't be able to see the Killer's Movement Cards (without a special Perk allowing you to do so) and the Killer gets to take two actions instead of just one each round. This push and pull is the central mechanic that helps build the tension and cultivates the gameplay's risk vs reward nature, but it's the variability that really makes this all shine.  (Photo: ComicBook)  The game may only have two locations to play in, but there's so much replayability built into the game that even after several plays you'll still find new elements to spice things up. This is partly due to the Survivors, who all have three different Perks at their disposal. These base Perks are for the most part incredibly useful and shake up your play style, but if those don't appeal to you, there's an entire Perk deck that you can choose from to find Perks more up your alley. You might not use them every round (even if they cost 0 to use), but they are essential to keep you away from the killer and on the road to success. The same goes for the Killer, who has his own unique Power and three Perks to choose from, and it's just as important for the Killer player to keep these in mind when taking your turns.  The number of options at your disposal is impressive. You can heal your teammates as an ordinary interact action, but some Perks allow you to heal in other ways. You can also block the Killer's path with Pallets and hide in Lockers when a Killer enters your area. The Killer can then interact with that occupied Locker, either destroying it or wounding you after a skill check. Crows can be used to give Bonus Turns to Survivors, but Killers can take them out and net Bloodpoint Tokens. While you're trying to get Generators started 3 times, Killers can reset that progress, and then Killers have their own innate powers that can lay traps, charge foreword with Chainsaws, cause Madness, and more.  (Photo: ComicBook)  The back and forth of it all as you try to outsmart the Killer while the Killer tries to anticipate your moves is incredibly fun and addictive, and the more comfortable you become with the Perks and Killers abilities the better that experience becomes. Level 99 has also done an exceptional job of balancing and counteracting abilities and play styles, so while it will be challenging to survive, you do always feel like you have a valid shot to make it happen. Likewise, the Killer is outnumbered, but you still feel empowered and able to achieve the end goal.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Between the 7 survivors, 6 Killers, two locations, and Perk Decks, the amount of content in the box is impressive, and I had a truly fantastic time on both sides of the encounter. I personally enjoyed playing on the Survivor side more but still had fun on the opposite side too. I would have loved one additional location in a dream scenario, but the two in the core box are more than enough to hold you over for some time thanks to the other factors and abilities in play. Dead by Daylight: The Board Game is a breeze to learn and gets you into the frantic action quickly, and once you're in I doubt you'll want to stop playing anytime soon.

Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images  In a must-win game on Saturday night, the Lakers couldn't afford to have any weak links.  And that is exactly what D'Angelo Russell was in Los Angeles' 119-108 loss to the Denver Nuggets on their home floor at Crypto.com Arena to fall into a dreaded 3-0 series hole against the No. 1 seed in the West.  It was the Lakers' first loss at home in the playoffs.  Russell, who was the team's big acquisition ahead of the trade deadline back in February, had just three points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field and 1-of-6 from three-point range. He also had three turnovers in the loss.  Coach Darvin Ham had to take him out in place of Rui Hachimura as Russell played just 20 minutes to Hachimura's 34.  It may be a switch that Ham needs to make permanently if the Lakers' are going to have any prayer of overcoming the 3-0 deficit, which has never been done before.  Despite Russell's horrific night, Los Angeles was still able to keep it close for most of the night, even holding a lead early in the fourth quarter. But it just wasn't enough despite Anthony Davis' 28 points and 18 rebounds and LeBron James' 23 points and 12 assists.  Lakers' nation directed a lot of its anger towards Russell following the loss.  Russell's performance immediately led to Lakers' fans calling for the team to acquire Mavericks' star guard Kyrie Irving this offseason.  It's something the fanbase has been groveling for all year long. And now on the brink of elimination, the calls are louder than ever.  As for the Nuggets, their star duo of Nikola Jokic´ and Jamal Murray showed up big once again.

The Trojans had a great year, and a memorable playoff run. But they’d saved the worst for last and couldn’t do much more than endure the pain and heartbreak as they grinded through the final few innings of their season.  Brodey Walker piled up 13 strikeouts on the mound, and went 4-for-5 with four RBIs at the plate to lead Manchester Academy to a 13-1 rout of Tallulah Academy on Saturday to win the MAIS Class 3A baseball championship.  Email newsletter signup  “I think we just weren’t all there. We weren’t ready to play — at all,” Tallulah first baseman Hayes Hopkins said. “Our batting wasn’t there, our fielding wasn’t there. We had a lot of errors. That’s about all you can blame it on. Our coaches got us ready. It just happens.”  The crushing loss in Game 3 of the Class 3A finals marked a brutal finish to an otherwise great season for Tallulah Academy. It finished with a 25-8 record, won two Game 3s in the playoffs and forced a third by winning on the road against Manchester on Thursday. This trip to the state finals was its second in three years.  “25-and-8 for the season? That’s a pretty good year. You can’t just dwell on this,” Tallulah coach Stuart King said.  The Trojans shouldn’t, and not just because they might lose sight of all they did accomplish. If they dwell on it too long they might have nightmares.  Manchester (35-6) scored its first run just five pitches into the game. Leadoff batter Mills Paul reached on an error, then scored when Walker ripped a double to the gap in left center field.  The Mavericks loaded the bases, but Tallulah got out of the jam when Brayson Morson caught a fly ball and fired a strike to home plate to throw out courtesy runner Grant Nixon as he was trying to tag up and score.  Manchester left two runners on base in the second and third innings, then started to pull away in the fourth. A passed ball and a throwing error allowed two runs to score and led to a third to make it 4-0. Another error in the fifth inning, along with RBI singles by Paul and Walker, helped push it to 9-1.  Manchester then got four consecutive singles in the sixth inning to make it 13-1 and cruised through the last two innings.  “Defensively, when they hit it you need to give them three outs and get in the dugout. It all multiplies,” King said.  Tallulah committed five errors in the game, and had a handful of other baserunning and mental mistakes that kept Manchester rolling. It was one of their worst outings of the year, at the worst possible time, made even worse by being on their home field and on the biggest stage.  “It’s hard to watch, but you’ve just got to play through it,” Hopkins said.  Despite all of that, King pointed out that the Trojans were one of the last two teams playing in Class 3A and tried to put a philosophical spin on things.  “You can’t win one if you don’t get here. We forced it to the third game and that’s all you can ask of them, and then once you get here you flip a coin,” King said. “We knew that with their lefty we needed to keep it close where maybe one clutch hit can make a difference. When we closed it, we had a chance. But they rolled the ball well. That’s the way baseball is.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvdGFsbHVsYWgtYWNhZGVteXMtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXF1ZXN0LWZhbGxzLXNob3J0LXdpdGgtZ2FtZS0zLWxvc3MtdG8tbWFuY2hlc3Rlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Nebulas are awarded by the Science Fictions & Fantasy Writers Association, known as the SFWA, and are one of the highest profile awards in English-language speculative fiction writing.  It's the third prestigious Nebula win for Martin, but the first for Miyazaki and FromSoftware. Martin has been nominated for the awards more than a dozen times over his decades-long career, for the first time in 1973, while he won in 1979 and 1985 for novelettes. Martin's contribution to Elden Ring has been a bit confusing for some. See What did George R.R. Martin do for Elden Ring anyway? for details on why, yes, his name deserves to be on the award.  Also nominated for 2022 were manuscript adventure Pentiment, cat adventure Stray, robot adventure Horizon Forbidden West, dead people adventure Vampire: The Masquerade - Sins of the Sires, and tabletop adventure book Journeys through the Radiant Citadel.  The Nebulas have only had an award for Best Game Writing since 2018. Elden Ring is preceded in videogame winners by Supergiant's Hades in 2020, Obsidian's The Outer Worlds in 2019, and House of Tomorrow/Netflix's Black Mirror: Bandersnatch for the inaugural award in 2018. The 2021 winner was tabletop roleplaying game Thirsty Sword Lesbians.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)  New York Mets' Francisco Lindor celebrates after hitting a walkoff RBI-single during the 10th inning of a baseball game against the Cleveland Guardians, Friday, May 19, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)  NEW YORK (AP) — Saturday’s game between the Cleveland Guardians and New York Mets was postponed because of rain.  It will be made up as part of a split-admission doubleheader Sunday at Citi Field, with the opener beginning at 1:40 p.m. and the nightcap at 7:10 p.m.  With steady rain falling Saturday morning in New York and a wet forecast all day, the game was called off more than five hours before the scheduled first pitch.  Max Scherzer (3-2, 4.88 ERA) had been slated to start for the Mets against rookie Tanner Bibee (1-1, 3.22). Both were pushed back to the first game Sunday, with Justin Verlander (1-2, 4.76) facing Cleveland ace Shane Bieber (3-2, 3.20) in the series finale Sunday night as originally planned — a marquee matchup of Cy Young Award winners.  The last time Scherzer and Verlander both started as teammates in a doubleheader was with Detroit on Sept. 29, 2010. When they take the mound Sunday for the Mets, it will mark the longest stretch in big league history between a particular pair of pitchers starting for same team on the same day, according to Major League Baseball.  New York won the series opener 10-9 in dramatic fashion Friday night, rallying from a 5-0 deficit to tie it 7-all on Pete Alonso’s grand slam in the seventh inning. After falling behind 9-7 in the 10th, the Mets scored three times in the bottom half against All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase, winning on Francisco Lindor’s two-out RBI single against his original team.  Lindor was facing Cleveland for the first time since getting traded to the Mets in January 2021.  It was New York’s third consecutive one-run victory since a 6-16 slide. Cleveland has dropped three of four, giving up a total of 25 runs in those three defeats.  Bad weather has wreaked havoc with the Mets’ schedule over the past three-plus weeks. Saturday’s postponement was the team’s fifth this season — four since April 29. The doubleheader Sunday will be New York’s third this month, after splitting with Atlanta on May 1 and getting swept in Detroit on May 3.  It was the Guardians’ third postponement this season. Cleveland was swept in both its doubleheaders, April 18 in Detroit and April 22 at home against Miami.  ___  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21ldHMtZ3VhcmRpYW5zLXBvc3Rwb25lZC1yYWluLWRvdWJsZWhlYWRlci02MGQ5OWY1NGFkMDgwNDAxNGQ2NWU0ZGU3ODA3Y2QwYtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With no specific platforms attached – just a vague promise of PC and consoles – many felt that it could be a cheap cash-in designed to make bank off the wizarding world.  But with a closed beta currently taking place, it was only a matter of time before some gameplay leaked – and footage has started to surface online. While we’re not going to reproduce the videos here for obvious reasons – or even link to them due to the strict NDA in place – we’re quite buoyed by what we’ve seen.  Looking at the gameplay that’s circulating, you’re able to customise your own character, selecting their appearance, broom trails, goal celebrations, and much more. The gameplay itself does strike us as quite complicated – Quidditch isn’t exactly straightforward at the best of times – but visually it looks clean, and it seems like developer Unbroken Studios has tried to remain as faithful as possible.  We reckon it’s pretty clear Warner Bros is hoping for a Rocket League-style hit here, and given the sheer scale of the customisation seemingly available, we wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up being free-to-play. Obviously it’s been a long time since the last full-scale Quidditch game – PS2, to be precise – so we have high hopes this can follow-up on Hogwarts Legacy’s success and be another hit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1c2hzcXVhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9nYW1lcGxheS1vZi1oYXJyeS1wb3R0ZXItcXVpZGRpdGNoLWdhbWUtbGVha3MtYW5kLWl0LWxvb2tzLXByb21pc2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2009-11-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T03:41:19","We're digging into the PC Gamer archives to publish pieces from years gone by. This article was originally published in PC Gamer issue 206, November 2009.  Combining designer Peter Molyneux's twin obsessions of the time—collecting mana and deformable landscapes—Magic Carpet is almost like a simplified, first-person 3D version of Populous without the pesky man-management. And with a great deal more fireballs.  Reinstall Reinstall invites you to join us in revisiting PC gaming days gone by. This time, Ed Ricketts calls 1994's Magic Carpet ""bloody hard"".  Each world/level/set of islands of the 50 featured has a set level of mana, the idea being to collect enough to ""restore"" that world (for tedious plot reasons). This is why you happen to be floating about on your Axminster dispatching monsters with spells. At first you have only two, a pathetic fireball and a Possession spell. Do-in a monster with fireballs and it breaks up into a jumble of golden mana balls that bounce around the landscape. That's where the Possession spell comes in: shooting the golden balls turns them silver and claims them for your own.  Other magicians also flit about on carpets, have the same spells as you, and aren't averse to nicking some of your mana. So you need to protect it, and you do this by collecting another spell that builds castles out of the earth itself. Your PortaCastle comes with its own hot air balloons, which search out your claimed mana globules and take them back, safe from harm. The more mana you collect, the stronger your castle can be, and thus better protected from the other magicians who try to attack it.  MC isn't about the flying. Controlling your carpet is a simple matter of left, right, forward and back, with mouse tilt for up and down, and since you can never crash (or land, for that matter), it takes only a few minutes to get comfortable with it. Spell collection, too, isn't hard—they just lie about on the ground.  No, MC is about the strategy, and the action. The basic concept is beautifully simple, but as the game progresses, you need to use the increasingly sophisticated spells to full advantage. A well-placed volcano pinged at an enemy castle sprouts into a satisfying fire-spewing monster that nets you a great deal of mana, while Invisibility, Rebound and Mana steal could be termed utility spells.  The minute your back's turned, a rival wizard nabs all your waiting mana. The arse.  I've heard that sound on adverts, films, music tracks and TV shows, and it always reminds me of Magic Carpet.  Do you protect your castle or your balloons? Do you whizz round the native villages trying to convert them to your side, or take on an enemy wizard directly and attempt to eliminate him? Do you deal with those sodding Kraken, which pull you inexorably towards them with a kind of tractor beam, or just avoid the bloody things?  It's a game of violent chess, and by modern standards, a bloody hard one. With the introduction of the aforementioned Krakens at level 7, what has previously been a bit of breeze suddenly turns serious. The combination of monster types, spells and surprisingly irksome enemy AI guarantees a hefty amount of swearing on the road to level 50.  Two things about MC will remain burned in my brain forever—or at least raise a Pavlovian response every time I hear them, as they're both sound effects. The first is the whooshing noise your carpet makes when you use the accelerate spell. It must have been a stock library effect, because I've heard it on adverts, films, music tracks, TV shows and just about everywhere since, and it always—ALWAYS—reminds me of Magic Carpet.  Magic Carpet's golden balls.  The worm that flies  The second is the noise that both the crawling worm things and the flying worm things (dragons, if we're being accurate) make when they attack you. It's a two-note howl of rage, or rather a mixture of outrage and anger, which is almost impossible to describe but which becomes the bane of your life throughout the game: EEEEEEH-UUUUUUH, EEEEEEHUUUUHHH. The second you hear this, you know one of these creatures has decided to zero-in on you—usually when you're desperately fighting an enemy wizard and really don't need any extra distractions right now, thanks.  In fact sound plays a vital part in the game's atmospherics. Most of the time a vaguely Far Eastern motif is warbling in the background, with the sound effects changing to suit the location. Drift towards a village, and a hubbub of foreign-sounding voices rises to meet you. Go out over the ocean and all you can hear is the sighing and lapping of the waves. But these are subtle effects: they aren't simply short samples that have been obviously looped, but an ambient mass of noise which drifts in and out of your consciousness.  (Image credit: EA)  Partly because of this, Magic Carpet is a schizophrenic game. Sometimes, while you're soaring through the ether admiring the scenery with the hypnotic music gently washing over you, it's almost a thing of beauty. (Yeah, I'm man enough to say it.)  Deformed: terrain, that is (Image credit: EA) Magic Carpet was doing real-time deformable landscapes back in 1994, albeit in a very simple form. Spells such as Volcano and Crater create gigantic spewing mountains or deep crevices, both of which are great for cocking up enemy castles. In addition, one nifty if ultimately rather pointless feature enables you to load a picture and use it as the height-field for your own landscape.  But as soon as you encounter a beast of some sort, the whole mood changes. The music starts pounding, your missiles fly by the dozen accompanied by terrifying whooshes and explosions, and the air is filled with fire, golden globes of mana and general chaos. At these times it's like being in Vietnam... well, like watching a film about being in Vietnam, at least.  MC's graphics were truly revolutionary in their day: deformable landscapes in ""real"" 3D, water reflections and translucency, incredible speed. What stands out most these days is the use of 2D sprites rather than true 3D models, and the cripplingly short view distance, but at least you can finally run it at a fair clip (at the time, it needed an incredibly pricey Pentium to run its fancy ""high resolution"" mode properly).  Carpet, unlike its contemporary Doom, was something of a one-off. There still hasn't been anything to compare to it. Here indeed is a game far more worthy of a remake than yet another tedious retro arcade title: a manic blend of pure action, subtle strategy and the sort of bonkers mentality for which Bullfrog used to be justly famous. EEEEEEH-UUUUUH.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3BldGVyLW1vbHluZXV4cy1tYWdpYy1jYXJwZXQtd2FzLWEtZ2FtZS1vZi12aW9sZW50LWNoZXNzLWFuZC1hLXRydWUtb25lLW9mZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

ATLANTA -- — After seeing the Atlanta Braves attack his fastball in the first inning, Logan Gilbert needed to change his strategy to keep Seattle in the game.  Gilbert's splitter saved the day.  Gilbert recovered from a rocky first inning to retire 15 consecutive hitters, Eugenio Suárez hit a two-run homer, and the Mariners beat the Braves 7-3 on Saturday night.  Gilbert (2-2) gave up three consecutive hits, including Matt Olson's two-run homer, to open the game. Gilbert gave credit to catcher Tom Murphy for helping him adjust his pitches ""just based off the swings. They hit the fastball hard early. ... Murf did a good job recognizing that and setting up a new game plan from there.”  Gilbert also issued his only walk in the first inning but didn't give up another hit until Austin Riley singled to right field with two outs in the sixth.  Gilbert allowed two runs on four hits with nine strikeouts in six innings.  “They were really aggressive in the first inning,” said Seattle manager Scott Servais, who said Gilbert made “an awesome adjustment after that.”  J.P. Crawford had two hits, including a run-scoring single in Seattle’s three-run fourth.  Olson's homer to center field drove in Ronald Acuña Jr., who led off the game with a single up the middle.  “Not really the start you're looking for,” Gilbert said.  Placing more emphasis on his splitter, which at first looks like a fastball to hitters, Gilbert regrouped with a dominant stretch of five scoreless innings. The Mariners' offense chipped away at Atlanta's collection of relievers who followed opener Jesse Chavez in the bullpen game. Taylor Trammell drove in a run with a single off Michael Tonkin (3-2) in the fourth.  Teoscar Hernández's single drove in Jarred Kelenic in the fifth for a 5-2 lead. Suárez, who drove in three runs on two hits, added his fifth homer off Kirby Yates in the seventh to stretch the lead to five runs.  “It was awesome,” said Gilbert of the Mariners' nine-hit attack. “It helps me out a ton after a rough first inning.”  Olson leads the Braves with 13 homers, including blasts in each of the first two games of the series with Seattle.  Tonkin, Atlanta's second pitcher, allowed five runs, only two earned, on six hits and two walks in two innings. The Braves committed three errors, including two by Acuña, one fielding and one throwing.  Jesse Chavez was effective as Atlanta's opener, allowing one hit in 2 1/3 scoreless innings.  DEPLETED ROTATION  The Braves fell to 0-3 in bullpen games.  Atlanta is attempting to compensate for a depleted rotation during the team's stretch of 13 consecutive games before its next off day on June 1. If the bullpen is stressed during that stretch, the Braves may have to make other roster moves to overcome the losses of LHP Max Fried (strained left forearm) and RHP Kyle Wright (right shoulder inflammation) to the injured list.  “It's going to be determined by the starts with the other guys,” said manager Brian Snitker.  Help could be coming soon from 20-year-old right-hander AJ Smith-Shawver, who allowed two runs on four hits in five innings in his debut with Triple-A Gwinnett on Friday. Smith-Shawver was a 2021 draft pick who signed with the Braves while turning down an opportunity to play quarterback for the Texas Tech football team.  “The kid's got a really good arm,” Snitker said. “His stuff is real.”  LOOKING TO END DROUGHT  After splitting the first two games of the series, the Braves on Sunday will be looking for their first series win against the Mariners since 2011, when Atlanta swept three games in Seattle. The Mariners won two of three at home against the Braves last season.  Before this series, the Mariners had not played in Atlanta since 2017’s debut of the Braves' new stadium, now named Truist Park.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Fried is lifting weights two weeks after being placed on the injured list. There is no indication the update impacts initial projections that Fried is expected to miss about two months. “He's going to be in great shape when he comes back,"" Snitker said.  UP NEXT  Braves LHP Jared Shuster (0-2, 7.24 ERA) will look for his first win in Sunday's final game of the series against Mariners RHP George Kirby (5-2, 2.45).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbWxiL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTQ3MTcwNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Shohei Ohtani hit his 11th home run of the season for the Angels, a night before he takes a 5-1 record to the mound for the rubber game. Minnesota will be trying to win its second road series in eight tries this season.  Kyle Farmer, Kyle Garlick and Willi Castro drove in runs in a three-run first. Farmer went 3 for 5 and is batting .395 (15 for 38) since becoming Minnesota's starting third baseman on May 10.  “Kyle Farmer's a heck of a baseball player,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I like relying on him, and he handles a lot of what comes with this job very, very well. And he's here to play. He's here to do whatever we're asking him to do, and right now what we're asking him to do is basically play every day, and right now it's at third base.”  Gallo boosted the lead to 4-1 with a leadoff homer in the sixth, his 11th home run this season.  Larnach tripled into the right-field corner in the seventh against Andrew Wantz, scoring Farmer from first, then came home when second baseman Brandon Drury took the throw from right fielder Hunter Renfroe and heaved the ball past third for an error.  “Tacking on some runs later on in the game, I mean, that's vital,” Baldelli said. “It changes the game mightily when you're able to put another couple of runs on the board. And the way we did it, that was fun.”  Louie Varland (2-0) gave up two runs and six hits in five innings. He liked being able to pitch with a three-run lead from the start, allowing him to be more aggressive against the Angels’ star tandem of Ohtani and Mike Trout.  “Having the lead, it makes every everything, like, a lot easier, smoother,” Varland said. “It’s not like you have to be perfect.”  Jared Walsh of the Angels went 0 for 4 with a fourth-inning RBI groundout in his season debut. Walsh had been on the injured list because of headaches and insomnia.  Patrick Sandoval (3-3) allowed three runs, five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings. He needed 55 pitches to get through the first two innings, lucky to escape further trouble after loading the bases in the second.  “He just had a rough start,"" Angels manager Phil Nevil said. ""It was a lot of pitches in the first two innings, and to get us through the point where he did was gutsy.”  The Angels have not won consecutive home games this month.  GOOD RESPONSE  It had been a frustrating road trip for the Twins, with blown leads carrying over from losing two of three against the Dodgers into a 5-4 loss Friday. With that in mind, Baldelli was pleased to see his team shake it off immediately.  “It was a great way to start a ball game after having some opportunities where we weren't able to capitalize this week, we did capitalize against their guy in the first inning,” he said.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Twins: Byron Buxton, who had a a run and two walks as the designated hitter, came out of the game in the sixth inning because of tightness in his right knee. He will not start Sunday. … 2B Jorge Polanco (strained hamstring) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Thursday, INF Edouard Julien was recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.  Angels: OF Brett Phillips was designated for assignment.  UP NEXT  Twins: RHP Pablo López (2-2) will look to bounce back after allowing a season-high three homers in 4 2/3 innings against the Dodgers.

The energy was electric with fans ready to cheer on the Nuggets at both locations. Dana Williams, a third-generation Denver resident brought out her entire family to Ball Arena for Game 3.  “It’s been a long time coming and I think this is the year so we definitely want to be here to support them, so that’s why we’re here.

(WISH) — Surveillance footage captured someone breaking into Valkyrie’s Vault in Brownsburg around 4:00 am Friday, making off with 1,600 “Magic the Gathering” cards.  “I was hoping that the door was ajar or something like that, I never expected to find things in disarray on the ground, and then to learn that some really important items had been taken from us,” said Jessi Kahlo, co-owner of Valkyrie’s Vault .  “Magic the Gathering” was created in 1993 and has become a popular card game.  Each card has a value energy point attached to it. A player can win by drawing a stronger card against his or her’s opponent.  “For me, it’s less about the card game and more about being able to meet people and talk to people face to face, and how you get to interact with them,” said Austin Oliveira, who started playing Magic a few months ago.  The cards are rare and worth thousands of dollars.  “I know somebody who sold a card to a game shop and got almost a thousand dollars out of it. Some of these cards, because they are so rare and there are so little of them printed, they’re just very valuable,” said Oliveira.  Kahlo believes the people who stole these cards know how valuable they are, and may have even cased out her store before the break in. The crime strikes a blow at the trust built among those in the gaming community.  “Because we built this collection off our personal collection and three years of business, the loss hurts,” said Kahlo.  Kahlo said she called around to other gaming shops in the Midwest so they can be on the lookout for these thieves because they may try to sell the stolen cards.

"game","2023-09-02","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T23:45:00","It has been an eventful week at Rogers Centre. The Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees played a chaotic four-game series earlier this week that included, among other things, controversy over Aaron Judge glancing at the first base coach during an at-bat, Domingo Germán getting busted with a foreign substance, and coaches jawing at each other.  On Saturday, Alek Manoah got into it with Baltimore Orioles infielder Adam Frazier, yelling at him and using some choice words to tell him to go back to the dugout following a sixth inning strikeout. Blue Jays manager John Schneider came out to speak to Manoah after the exchange with Frazier, presumably to help him get his focus back on the game.  There was one small problem though: Schneider did not realize it was the second mound visit of the inning. Pitching coach Pete Walker visited Manoah earlier in the frame. By rule, you must change pitchers following the second mound visit in an inning, so Manoah had to come out of the game. He'd thrown 85 pitches in 5 2/3 innings of two-run ball.  ""I f----d up."" Schneider told MLB.com about the mound visit after the game. ""But I think, regardless of my f--- up, it was the right time to get him out.""  The score was tied 2-2 when Manoah was forced to exit. The Blue Jays went on to take a 5-2 lead, though the O's tied it on Ryan O'Hearn's eighth inning three-run homer against Jordan Romano. Baltimore won the game in 10 innings (BAL 6, TOR 5 in 10 innings). Toronto has lost five of their last six games, all to AL East rivals.  Those five losses in the last six games -- all at home at Rogers Centre -- have dropped the Blue Jays into last place. They are 25-21 on the season, which certainly isn't bad, though the AL East is incredibly competitive. In that division, an 88-win pace equals last place.  The Blue Jays wrap up their homestand and their series with the Orioles on Sunday. Things don't get any easy after that though. Toronto begins a four-game series with the first place Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field on Monday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2JsdWUtamF5cy1sb3NlLXRoaXJkLXN0cmFpZ2h0LWdhbWUtYWxlay1tYW5vYWgtZm9yY2VkLXRvLWV4aXQtYWZ0ZXItbWFuYWdlci1tYWtlcy1tb3VuZC12aXNpdC1ibHVuZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Unfortunately Findlay had to cancel out because they did not have enough receivers and Glennville made the trip to Massillon, but did not have their helmets so they could not participate. So the event turned out to be just two teams, Pickerington North against Massillon Washington.

The New York investors spent more than $10 million to purchase a majority stake in Counter Logic Gaming, an e-sports team, and said that professional video gaming “now stands on the verge of enormous change, which we believe has the potential to generate significant growth.”  Instead, that growth has stagnated. As e-sports revenue fell below expectations and investors became skeptical of the industry, Madison Square Garden’s owners last year tried to find a way out of the business by selling their marquee team.  After years of fanfare, e-sports in the United States are giving way to economic realities. Unable to turn a profit, team owners are cutting costs by laying off employees and ending contracts with star players. In some cases, they are selling their teams and sometimes at a loss, offering a blunt reality check to people who believed e-sports could be the next big thing in entertainment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9lLXNwb3J0cy1yZXZlbnVlLXZpZGVvLWdhbWluZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, Dead by Daylight is about to get the narrative-driven title treatment at the hands of Supermassive Games. Besides that, we might get an announcement this year. That’s right; we won’t have to wait too long to see what the studios are cooking up for this beloved franchise about to expand.

ST. LOUIS — It was exactly one year ago that Nolan Gorman found himself playing in his first game in the major leagues, starting at second base for the Cardinals in Pittsburgh.  Gorman celebrated that anniversary in a big way on Saturday night.  Gorman broke a 3-3 tie with a three-run homer in the eighth inning, his 13th of the season, to propel the Cardinals to the win over the Dodgers at Busch Stadium.  The homer came off a left-handed pitcher, the second time Gorman has done that in the last three days after getting only a few opportunities to hit against lefthanders in the first six weeks of the season.  Gorman’s 13 home runs is tied for third in the National League; his 39 RBIs rank second and his 1,031 OPS also is the second highest in the league. He is hitting .302, which ranks eighth.  One more stat – Gorman turned 23 just 10 days ago.  In the first calendar year in the majors, Gorman hit 27 homers, drove in 74 runs and posted a .251 average in 131 games.  Here is how Saturday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: The Cardinals built an early 3-0 lead on an RBI single by Willson Contreras in the first and a run-scoring double from Alec Burleson and a sacrifice fly from Lars Nootbaar in the second … The Cardinals only had two hits between the third and seventh innings, singles by Nolan Arenado and Gorman that extended both of their hitting streaks to 11 games … In the eighth, Tommy Edman led off with a double and after Nootbaar struck out, Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked to bring up Gorman, who had made his first start of the season against a lefthander on Thursday night. Gorman hit a 1-1 pitch into the seats in right, his ninth multiple-run homer of the season.  On the mound: Miles Mikolas did not allow a hit until Freddie Freeman doubled with one out in the fourth. He pitched around two hits in the fifth, but then gave up singles to Mookie Betts and Freeman to begin the sixth before serving up the homer to Martinez, his former college teammate at Nova Southeastern (Fla.) University. Mikolas then retired six more hitters in order, completing the seventh … Ryan Helsley worked around a hit batter in the eighth, but gave up a double, single and another double in the ninth that produced one run … Giovanny Gallegos relieved and got the final three outs, with a sacrifice fly scoring the second run of the inning, before stranding the would-be tying run on second by throwing a called strike three past Betts to end the game.  Key stat: Of Gorman’s 13 homers this season, six have come in either the eighth or ninth inning, the most in the major leagues. Seven of his homers have come with the game tied.  Worth noting: Mikolas became only the second starter this season for the Cardinals to retire the first six batters he faced in order. The only other game when that happened was on April 8, by Jordan Montgomery, at Milwaukee … The home run by Martinez was the 26th allowed by the Cardinals with two strikes this season, tied for the second most in the majors. It was the fourth off Mikolas with two strikes, out of the team-leading eight homers he has given up … Dakota Hudson was activated off the injured list at Memphis and will get the start on Sunday, his first appearance since April 19.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvc3RsLWNhcmRpbmFscy9zYXR1cmRheXMtZ2FtZS1yZXBvcnQtY2FyZGluYWxzLTYtZG9kZ2Vycy01LXJvYi1yYWlucy82My05ZmRkN2NkYS05MGMyLTRkNzgtODFlYy1kNzdlZmEzYTM2YmTSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3Nkay5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL21sYi9zdGwtY2FyZGluYWxzL3NhdHVyZGF5cy1nYW1lLXJlcG9ydC1jYXJkaW5hbHMtNi1kb2RnZXJzLTUtcm9iLXJhaW5zLzYzLTlmZGQ3Y2RhLTkwYzItNGQ3OC04MWVjLWQ3N2VmYTNhMzZiZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","2023-05-21T05:50:24","Jerusalem is a city of many qualities. It boasts a rich history, a colorful mix of cultures and a never-ending flow of tourists.  One thing Jerusalem is not, however, is a gaming powerhouse. It is not even a gaming cellar. In fact, while many tech companies made Jerusalem their home in recent years, anyone interested in dabbling in the video games industry in Israel would have no choice but to move to Tel Aviv.  The founders of Jerusalem’s first major video games community – developers Amir Blum and Simon Gross – say their desire to change this status quo is what prompted them to establish MakeGamesJLM in 2019.  Developing a gaming ecosystem  “We were developing games in Jerusalem, and we knew some other people were as well, but there were no social events, meetups, courses, lectures or anything like that,” says Blum.  “People were always going to Tel Aviv for those things. So, we started MakeGamesJLM to show people that it was possible to do it in Jerusalem, and we wanted them to join us on that journey.”  Collage of Unity 2D (Arabic-language course). Photo by MakeGamesJLM  The community is part of the worker cooperative Double Jump (“a professional expansion of MakeGamesJLM”) supported and partially funded by Jerusalem’s Tech Community: Made in JLM, the Jerusalem Development Authority, the American Center Jerusalem and Startup Nation Central. The rest of the funding comes from Double Jump’s business ventures.  “MakeGamesJLM is a place for all of the different disciplines of game making,” says Gross. “We have programmers, 3D and 2D artists, sound designers, all sorts of people with their own area of expertise.”  The community holds weekly four-hour meetups. “Basically, it’s a support group,” says Blum.  “It’s a format we borrowed from similar communities around the world. The idea is that you come with your project and we all work in the same space, where we are able to share ideas, learn from each other and help each other.”  Representing all of Jerusalem  MakeGamesJLM also works to integrate Jerusalem’s under-represented groups, such as Arabs and ultra-Orthodox (“haredi”) Jewish women, by offering various training courses.  “Project Ignite” graduation at MakeGamesJLM. Photo by Jenya Malai  “The beauty of the games industry is that it’s not just technology, it’s also art. So it’s a ground where different backgrounds — professional and socia l– mix and create together. It was our vision from the beginning,” says Blum.  “We also worked alongside a leader of the Arab community in East Jerusalem, Amin Abu-Zahra, to create courses in Arabic for developers.”  Gross, meanwhile, developed and taught a course for ultra-Orthodox women. “Beyond the base level of meetups, the courses serve the purpose of getting people into this industry. In my course, the haredi women were learning how to do 3D art for games. At the end of the course, they were making their own game themes; it was really impressive.”  While the courses were fully subsidized at the beginning for anyone who wanted to take them, MakeGamesJLM recently added a small fee to make sure the people who sign up are “serious and aren’t going to quit” after one lesson.  “The courses are meant for people who are interested [in creating games], but don’t have the skillset yet. Integrating marginalized groups is a very important aspect of it all,” Blum adds.  Blum and Gross say they have noticed quite a few game studios popping up across Jerusalem. They say this is partly due to connections made at MakeGamesJLM community events.  But they add it’s impossible to measure the success of their enterprise in a quantifiable way. “We’re creating the right environment, but it’s not a college,” says Gross.  Gaming ideology  The difficulty in making game development popular in Jerusalem also stems from the characteristics of the games industry in Israel in general.  “The Israeli games industry is mostly focused around large, mobile game companies, like Playtika and ironSource,” says Blum. “Many of the games they produce are social gambling games, with casino-based mechanics. Mobile and free to play. These are the kind of companies that have succeeded in the games industry in Israel.”  Simon Gross and Amir Blum, founders of MakeGamesJLM. Photo by Dylan Brahms  MakeGamesJLM is more focused on the creative side of game development rather than the monetary aspect.  “If we’re creating something different in the Israeli games industry that doesn’t exist in Tel Aviv, we want it to be the kind of experience that would get to you in non-predatory ways. The focus here [in Jerusalem] is on the arts side of game development,” Blum tells ISRAEL21c.  “Games are an artform,” adds Gross. “We have our ideology, but money isn’t something to sneer at. So if you want to take our course to make mobile games — everybody’s welcome.”  ‘Scramballed’  Among Double Jump’s business ventures is the Unboxed gaming studio, a creative partnership between Blum and Gross founded in 2018.  There, the two are creating “indie” games such as “Scramballed,” developed for the Nintendo console and is described as a “chicken tennis deathmatch” video game.  Cover for Scramballed game. Photo by Unboxed  They say that despite their ideology, they do want Scramballed to sell well. “Unless you’re independently wealthy, in order to make games as an art, you need those games to be a monetary success,” says Blum.  “It’s our first commercial game. We’ve been trying to tell our community that it’s possible to do, and now that we’ve done it, hopefully it’ll serve as inspiration to others.”  For more information, click here.

"game","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T02:24:10","MIAMI – If you’ve seen one Miami Heat game this postseason, you’ve seen them all. Invariably, whether it’s a play-by-play announcer or an analyst on a TV broadcast or someone seated nearby in the stands, you have heard the term “Heat culture” again and again and again. More or less in sync with that team’s 10-3 record this spring.  What is Heat culture? That’s not always easy to define. Generally, it has to do with attributes such as toughness, resiliency, a willingness to sacrifice for the group and unyielding effort. It is long on plow horses as opposed to show ponies.  Taking charges, challenging referees to call every bit of physical contact and chiding the occasional Heat player who tips the scales a couple pounds too heavy are other markers of an ingrained Miami way.  No one is more impressed by Heat culture, mind you, than the Heat, its media and its fans. And it does seem to come and go – setting tongues to wagging in the Orlando bubble in 2020 when Miami reached the NBA Finals, receding rather significantly seven months later when the Heat got swept out of the first round by Milwaukee, beaten by an average margin of 20.5 points.  For now, though, two games into the Eastern Conference finals – with Game 3 against Boston on Sunday at the Kaseya Center (8:30 ET, TNT) – Heat culture is rampant. It is Jimmy Butler hitting big shots and making pivotal plays late in both games, with not just a swagger but a sneer. It is coach Erik Spoelstra stomping his feet, walking to the free-throw lane to call timeouts and working the officials on pretty much every call and non-call.  It is an inordinate number of undrafted contributors – four of nine in Spoelstra’s current rotation – making a huge difference: Max Strus, Gabe Vincent, Caleb Martin and Duncan Robinson have scored 45% (105-for-234) of Miami’s points so far. It’s the fact, too, that the Heat’s stars didn’t arrive as such; Butler was the last player picked in the first round in 2011, while Bam Adebayo and injured Tyler Herro went 14th and 13th in their respective drafts.  Oh, one more thing about Heat culture: It typically gets noticed relative to whichever opponent Miami is playing, who by definition do not have Heat culture. In this case that means Boston, which has dug itself a two-game deficit by squandering double-digit leads both times while going frosty cold offensively at the least opportune times.  Which leads to the inevitable question: What is Celtics culture? And for that matter, where is it?  This isn’t about banners and retired numbers in the rafters, about legends such as Russell, Bird, Cousy, McHale, the Joneses, Pierce and Garnett. This is right-here, right-now urgent, a reliable style of playing, even a way of life that can translate into Boston prevailing in the closest thing to a must-win challenge this side of an elimination game.  The Celtics culture exhibited thus far has been as unsavory as something scraped from a discarded petri dish. Game to game, there has been almost nothing on which they or their fans can hang their proverbial hats. No defensive intensity to dial up night in and night out, no go-to scoring option who can grind his way to essential points the way Butler’s been doing for the Heat.  “They work for everything and they’re grinders,” Celtics role player Grant Williams said, “and we have to match that energy. We have to come out with that same competitive nature, that same physicality, that same toughness. And then on top of that take care of our job on the other end, because they don’t come down and have empty possessions. And that’s part of why closing the game against them is so difficult, is they come down and find a way to get a bucket.”  By the way, let’s not be blaming Williams for provoking Butler into his devastating finish in Game 2. Sure, Williams talked trash with the Heat wing and engaged in a literal cabeza-a-cabeza showdown. But what followed – Butler outscoring Boston 7-4 over the next 3:49, leading a turnaround from being down 96-89 to going up 102-100 – was nothing we haven’t seen.  No need to indulge in revisionist history about Butler and his performances/antics with three previous teams (Chicago, Minnesota, Miami). In the world of what-have-you-done-for-us-lately, “Playoff Jimmy” has been quite real.  “I love that gnarly version of Jimmy,” Spoelstra said late Friday, “but you get that regardless. I just think people are paying a lot more attention to him now that we’ve won some games in the postseason the last few years.”  More Celtics culture these days: In just two crushing quarters – the third in Game 1, the fourth in Game 2 – Boston has been outscored 82-47. In the other six, they had a 174-152 advantage. That might appeal to coach Joe Mazzulla, who mentioned “quarters won” as if this were the old Continental Basketball Association, but it will push his team to a quick ouster unless it can avoid such sinkhole periods.  Jayson Tatum ostensibly is Boston’s star, with Jaylen Brown a notch below. The former finished fourth in Kia MVP voting this season and earned All-NBA 1st Team status, while the latter landed on the second team. But Tatum, who saved his team last round with a flurry in the fourth in Game 6 and 51 to dump Philadelphia in Game 7, has no field goals in the final quarters here. Brown is 4-for-12 in the fourth so far.  As a group, the Celtics looked stymied by Miami’s zone defense and overmatched against its tenacity in generating second and third chances. If this is a direct result of Heat culture, then this seems a by-product of Celtics culture of late.  Mazzulla conceded the “discipline and mindset” battle to the Heat Friday, a staggering mental surrender for a home team already down in a series. Anything short of a full reversal in Game 3, doing on Miami’s court what was just done twice on theirs, might as well be a white flag.  “This team has a real decision to make,” Williams said. “The decision is going to be whether we are going to come back and really set the tone for the rest of this year and make a statement, or are we going to come out and lay down?”  Rest of this year? Boston had better focus on the rest of this week and go from there.  * * *  Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T21:50:00","The Aces look like the defending champs as they cruise to an opening game victory over the Storm. (2:22)  SEATTLE -- Without head coach Becky Hammon, serving the first game of a two-game suspension, the defending WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces set a league record for margin of victory in a season opener with their 105-64 win Saturday over the Seattle Storm.  ""I think more so than anything, it's just a testament to how hard they continue to play,"" said acting coach Tyler Marsh. ""There's never a feeling of satisfaction. We want to play to the best of our ability at all times until the clock hits zero. That's the standard we've tried to set on the court.""  The 41-point margin was the largest ever in a WNBA team's opening game, per ESPN Stats & Information research, and also the largest defeat ever suffered by the Storm. That outcome made Marsh feel a lot better heading into his postgame chat with Hammon.  ""I'm sure that this call will be a lot more pleasant than had things gone a different way tonight,"" he joked. ""I think what you saw today was a team and a staff that wanted to get a win very badly for their head coach. We know who Becky is to us and who she's been for us. So the best thing we can do is come out and get this win for her.""  On Tuesday, the WNBA announced a two-game suspension for Hammon for violating team and league policies for respect in the workplace in her comments to former Aces forward Dearica Hamby -- subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Sparks -- in connection with Hamby's recent pregnancy.  Las Vegas decided to split those two games among its coaching staff. Assistant Natalie Nakase, a Southern California native, will coach Thursday when the Aces visit the Los Angeles Sparks. Marsh drew the assignment for opening day in Seattle. After learning he would coach, Marsh made plans for his father, Donnie (an assistant at the University of Detroit Mercy), wife and son to travel for the game.  ""My dad, he's been a college coach my whole life, and for him to be out here just to see me coach and for my wife and my son to be here, that's the sentimental part for me,"" Marsh said. ""Outside of that, it's just an extreme level of gratefulness to the organization and to Coach [Hammon] for having that trust in me to do the job.""  Hammon was able to help the Las Vegas staff craft a game plan in practice leading up to Saturday, but come gameday, the team was in Marsh's hands. He made sure not to deviate from how he operates as an assistant.  ""I tried to approach it the same way,"" Marsh said. ""It was key for me personally to come in and just be myself -- not trying to be Becky, because there's only one Becky Hammon. I think that was the message she was trying to communicate to me as well: just be yourself and let them go out and play. That's what I tried to do today.""  For players, however, there was something special about the opportunity to spotlight a member of their coaching staff who typically operates behind the scenes. Although the win is officially credited to Hammon in the WNBA record books, the Aces celebrated by dousing Marsh with water in a postgame locker room celebration.  ""When you have someone like Tyler, I don't think anyone sees the work that he does for us, and it is so incredibly awesome to see him get this win,"" two-time MVP A'ja Wilson said. ""He was incredible through and through, always kept us level-headed. We have amazing assistants and the way that Tyler helped guide us to the win -- he was prepared, he had just prepared -- it was truly special. It was honestly a great day for us to start playing and get a win, but especially with Tyler as our head honcho today.""  Marsh hadn't yet spoken to Hammon before meeting the media, but Wilson had, calling her head coach via FaceTime shortly after leaving the court.  ""She knew we were in good hands, obviously, with Ty, but I just wanted to make sure we were on the right track,"" Wilson said. ""She said she only yelled twice, so that's pretty big for us, because I'm pretty sure in real life she would have been yelling more than twice.""  Even for a coach as demanding as Hammon, there wouldn't have been much to lament in a dominating performance by Las Vegas, which added to the championship core in free agency by signing two-time MVP Candace Parker to join the starting lineup and veteran starter Alysha Clark to come off the bench.  In contrast to a slow start in the season opener from the other co-favorite to win the 2023 title, the New York Liberty, the Aces already appeared to be in midseason form. Taking advantage of an inexperienced Storm team that lost former MVP Breanna Stewart to New York in free agency and saw legendary point guard Sue Bird retire since facing Las Vegas in last year's competitive semifinals series, the Aces built a double-digit lead midway through the second quarter and never looked back.  Led by 23 points apiece from Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, all five Las Vegas starters scored in double figures. So too did Clark off the bench. Meanwhile, just one Seattle player (holdover All-Star Jewell Loyd, who had 22) scored more than eight points.  As impressive as the new-look Aces appeared, Wilson indicated there's still work to be done integrating the team's new players.  ""It's not easy,"" she said. ""We've got newcomers that have to get used to the system. We ourselves as the core are still trying to get to know and jell with everyone. I think it's just going to come with time. I'm glad it looks easy, but it's actually definitely hard. We're going to communicate and make sure that we're just all on the same page and have that same goal.""  That goal remains repeating as champions, something that hasn't been done in the WNBA since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002. Despite Hammon's absence, on Saturday Las Vegas took its first step toward that eventual outcome in dominating fashion.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL3duYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY5NDQ3My9hY2VzLWJlZ2luLXduYmEtdGl0bGUtZGVmZW5zZS00MS1wb2ludC13aW4tc3Rvcm3SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS93bmJhL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2OTQ0NzMvYWNlcy1iZWdpbi13bmJhLXRpdGxlLWRlZmVuc2UtNDEtcG9pbnQtd2luLXN0b3JtP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Boston vs Miami Betting Analysis  The Miami Heat continue to silence the critics who have doubted them since the opening night of the NBA postseason. Despite being the No. 8 seed, the Heat have taken a 2-0 series lead over the No. 2 Celtics in the Eastern Conference Final.  The Heat are an example of a team literally defying the odds. According to ESPN analytics, Miami only had a 3% chance of reaching the NBA Finals prior to the ECF. Miami will hope to keep exceeding expectations, as they still only have a 35% chance to defeat Boston per those same analytics.  The Celtics have been favored in both games against Miami, including 8.5-point favorites in Game 1 and 10-point favorites in Game 2. Miami has offered tremendous underdog value, winning outright on the moneyline at +305 and +350.  Boston hasn’t been covering the spread consistently going back to the last round. The Celtics are just 2-4 ATS in their past six games, while the Heats are on an impressive 9-2 ATS run in their past 11 contests.  When it comes to the game total, bettors who cheer for high-scoring games haven’t been disappointed. The “over” has hit in both Eastern Conference Final games so far, and has also cashed in 10 of Boston’s last 13 contests overall.  Celtics vs Heat Betting Pick  Oddsmakers and analytics alike indicate that this series is far from over. The last time Boston was down 2-0 in these playoffs (Round 2 vs Philadelphia), they responded with a 95-86 road win to force a Game 7.  The good news for Boston is they’ve been a better team on the road than at home this postseason, posting a solid 4-2 record away from TD Garden. Furthermore, Jayston Tatum arrived in Game 2 with a 34-point performance that should inspire confidence going forward.  There are a few things that likely need to happen for Boston to win Game 3. Firstly, Jaylen Brown needs to bounce back after shooting 7/23 (30.4%) in Game 2. The Celtics also can’t turn the ball over 15 times and get out-rebounded 45-35 like they did last outing.  We’re betting on Boston to respond with their backs against the wall. Yes, they’ve had a hard time defending Jimmy Butler, but they had a 12-point lead heading into the fourth quarter Friday and blew it.  The Celtics are due for some positive regression after shooting well below their three-point average in the two Eastern Final games so far. It also helps that the Heat surrender the second-most threes (13.3) per game at home. Lastly, the Celtics haven’t lost three straight games since the start of March.

Celtics vs Heat Player Props & Same-Game Parlay  When it comes to our Celtics vs Heat same-game parlay for Game 3, we’re banking on a bounce-back performance from Jaylen Brown, plus pure desperation from Boston facing a potential 3-0 series deficit.  There have been two instances this postseason when Brown failed to record double-digit points, and he responded each time by putting up at least 25 points the following game. FanDuel is only listing Brown’s player prop number at 23.5, which offers value considering he went for 28 playing in Miami during the regular season.  We also like targeting the game total in this same-game parlay, as both teams rank top-three in offensive rating this postseason. The Celtics and Heat have averaged 227.5 points through the first two matchups, and the over is also 10-2 in the Celtics’ last 12 road games.  A change of scenery could provide the spark Boston needs in this series. In addition to the team’s solid road record this season, they are 4-1 ATS in their last five visits to Miami.  If you parlay the Celtics -3.5 spread, with the over on Jaylen Brown’s point total and the game total over, you can get juicy +467 odds at FanDuel.

After eliminating Harvard earlier in the evening, the Fighting Irish dropped the day’s finale 5-0 to the host Arkansas Razorbacks. Notre Dame ends the season 30-19-1 overall, having qualified for their 24th consecutive NCAA Regional, and 27th in program history.  Freshman Micaela Kastor manned the circle for the Irish. Kastor worked a complete game, her third of the season as she allowed six hits, five earned runs and struck out four of an Arkansas lineup that finished second in the Southeastern Conference in batting average.  Lexi Orozco led the offense, going 2-for-3 with two singles. Joley Mitchell added another single as the Irish offense couldn’t get on track against first team All-SEC selection Chenise Delce.  How It Happened  Arkansas played the untraditional role of the visiting team at Bogle Park, and wasted no time getting on the board. A lead-off single followed by a fielder’s choice and two hit batters loaded the bases with two outs. A walk brought in the first run of the game.  The Razorbacks kept the pressure on in the second, this time using the bats. A single up the middle and another single back to center field brought in another run to double up the lead at 2-0 after an inning and a half.  The teams exchanged zeroes for the next four innings before Arkansas added insurance in the seventh. A called ball on a check swing put a runner on with a walk. A ground ball back up the middle led to a fielder’s choice as the runner from first was off on the pitch and beat the throw to second before the relay was too slow at first to put two on. Rylin Hedgecock left the yard for the 21st time on the season as the three-run homer put Arkansas up 5-0.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdW5kLmNvbS9pcmlzaC1mYWxsLXRvLW5vLTEzLWFya2Fuc2FzLWluLWVsaW1pbmF0aW9uLWdhbWUtb2YtbmNhYS1mYXlldHRldmlsbGUtcmVnaW9uYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Bellevue"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T15:12:33","After more than 2,000 hours in Dota 2, I’ve finally been sent to gamer jail for the first time. It’s worse than I ever imagined, which makes it an extremely effective deterrent in a competitive game where teamwork is essential. But now that I’ve been punished, I see that there’s a better way to administer multiplayer justice.  I had been proud of my perfect player conduct score since Valve introduced the rating system in 2019. (By the way, that’s a score of 10,000, and it comes with a reassuring green smiley face when you’re doing well.) The score is a loose measure of whether you’re an upstanding member of the player community. If you’re reported a lot by your teammates or abandon games before they’re finished, your score goes down. I think those are the right metrics to track, even though people routinely abuse the reporting feature for petty reasons.  So here’s why I’m in the Dota 2 cone of shame: I’ve “abandoned” several games over the past couple of weeks due to having a life. For various reasons, I’ve had more urgent phone calls to attend to than usual and other things that have demanded my attention in a way I can’t ignore. To be clear: I think it sucks when people leave team games prematurely and, in Dota, that includes going AFK for just a few minutes at a time. Even if you return to your keyboard and resume play, the jig is up: you’ll be officially assessed with game abandonment. I’m not proud of abandoning my teammates, even if we still ended up winning several of those games when I returned.  I’ve now been placed into what’s called the “low priority matchmaking pool,” which is a very lonely place. It’s difficult to find a match; in my experience, it can take up to 20 minutes to find enough players to queue up with. And the really punishing measure is that you’re required to earn several victories to escape this matchmaking pool; losing a game doesn’t get you any closer to freedom. Because each match can last anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour, it could take many hours to get out of purgatory. As of the time of writing this, I’ve got one victory left, after trying to get out of this for about five hours.  Some players are punished more than others for reasons outside of their control  The way this system is set up means that some players will be punished more than others for reasons outside of their control, whether it’s because of their own skill level, their ability to complete a match with life happening in the background, or because they’re required to complete matches with people who are more likely to be horrible trolls.  I am a huge supporter of moderation in social games, and I’ve put heat on Valve in the past for making people pay to avoid toxic members of the community. I’m usually on the side of more moderation in games. But my recent experience has made me realize that a lot of team games are not built to recognize a particular segment of their audience: people who love the game but just can’t commit to its demands. This group spans all ages: kids who are being called down to dinner; parents who have to suddenly attend to their children; and anybody else who is faced with an urgent need in real life that is more important than playing a video game.  Let me reiterate something: I deserve to be in Dota 2’s punishment pool because I did abandon those games and left my teammates hanging. And that’s true even if there were legitimate reasons for me to step away from the keyboard. But that makes me think multiplayer games that require moderation should create space for people who want to intentionally lower the stakes.  I thought Dota 2’s “turbo” mode, which is an unranked mode played at a faster pace (kind of like listening to a podcast at 2x speed), was that solution. But I’ve found that people take it just as seriously as other modes. Players in turbo still often get angry at teammates for not demonstrating expert skill. And the system seems to punish people for leaving turbo games the same as in other more serious modes of play. While I’ve played in turbo mode exclusively for some time because it accommodates my lifestyle better, it hasn’t really lowered the stakes of the game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzcyODU3MC9tdWx0aXBsYXllci1nYW1lLXRlYW0tc3Rha2VzLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLW1vZGVyYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-08","Not Discerned","{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T03:22:24","After playing until almost 2 a.m. in the series opener, there were questions at to how much both the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes would have left in the tank for Game 2.  Turns out, enough to do that overtime thing. Again.  It certainly did not go as long.  And now the Panthers are two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final.  Florida continued its winning ways away from Sunrise as Matthew Tkachuk again scored in overtime — less than 2 minutes in, this time — to beat the host Hurricanes 2-1 to take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals.  The Panthers have now won eight straight road games — second all-time in NHL playoff history — as they come home to Sunrise with a commanding lead for the second consecutive series.  They are also 6-0 in overtime games with five of those wins coming on the road including both games in Raleigh.  Florida got a second-period goal from Sasha Barkov as Sergei Bobrovsky made 37 saves in his seventh consecutive road win.  Bobrovsky has now given up two goals or fewer in seven straight games and, dating to Game 1, has stopped 80 of his past 81 shots.  After being outshot 36-22 through regulation, the Panthers caught a break when Jesperi Kotkaniemi got called for tripping 1:39 into OT.  Moments later, Barkov got the puck in the corner and, as two Carolina defenders stumbled to the ice, fed it to Sam Bennett.  Bennett, Sam Reinhart and Tkachuk played a little tic-tac-toe with Tkachuk going top shelf to win it — and now the Panthers are two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final with five games left in this series.  Carolina came out flying taking a 1-0 lead on a Jalen Chatfield redirection 1:43 into the game on the Hurricanes’ first shot of the game.  Florida appeared to tie the score a minute later on a Gus Forsling shot through traffic, but it was first of two goals to be called back for offside via video review in the period.  At 15:56, Jack Drury’s goal was taken off the board due to a successful Florida challenge.  That goal would have made it 2-0 as Florida was being outshot 21-4 at the time.  Carolina, which got 6 of its 20 first-period shots on a Florida power play, threw everything it had at Bobrovsky and the Panthers yet only held a 1-0 lead going into the second.  The Panthers were much, much better at the end of the first and that carried into the second.  Not long after coming out of the penalty box for holding, Barkov took a feed from Josh Mahura and scored as sweet a goal as one will get to see in the postseason.  Barkov was somehow all alone in front of the net and showed the patience to get goalie Antti Raanta to commit as he pulled off a fake between the skates move and calmly backhanded the puck above his downed countryman.  Wayne Gretzky, working the game in the TNT studios in Atlanta, said it was one of the best playoff goals he had ever seen.  High praise indeed.  “He does that all the time in practice, we’ve just been trying to get him to do it in a game,” coach Paul Maurice said on the TNT broadcast. “He has a heck of a shot, is an incredible player and at speed, there are very few guys who can do what he does.”  The Panthers and Hurricanes ended up tied in shots on goal in the second 8-8 which was a big improvement over the first.  Raanta, meanwhile, was not exactly a surprise starter for the Hurricanes as Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour had said he was thinking about making a switch in goal during his media availability on Friday.  During the first period, Brind’Amour said the move was made simply because of how much work Frederik Andersen carried on Thursday night and Friday morning in Game 1 and went with his most rested goalie.  Bobrovsky did not look tired, at all, as he carried the Panthers throughout.  In the third, Bobrovsky got a little help on what could have been the game-winner for the Hurricanes.  With Radko Gudas in the box with 6:25 left, the Panthers killed the penalty — thanks in great part to Marc Staal blocking a big shot in front of the net.  Tkachuk also made a great block as Brent Burns tried to feed to a wide-open Jordan Martinook before the penalty kill.  Florida’s best chance at taking the lead in regulation came with 7:07 left when Colin White walked in on Raanta and could not get the shot off.

The Panthers and Hurricanes have been trying to recoup their energy after playing four overtimes in Florida's 3-2 win in Game 1 of the best-of-7 series, which ended at 1:54 a.m. on Friday.  ""Playing 2 1/2 games in one night certainly doesn't help anyone, but we had a good day to recover,"" Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said. ""Being on the road, being kind of together all day yesterday, you're all kind of recovering together, going through the same things together. So all that helps, and this morning just feels like a normal game day.""  Neither team skated Friday. Florida held an optional morning skate Saturday. Only the Carolina extra players skated Saturday morning.  Even the younger players appreciated the time off.  ""I've got the youth advantage on my side, so I can play that card a little bit,"" said 21-year-old Hurricanes forward Seth Jarvis. ""But it's nice to feel not like I did yesterday.""  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  The Panthers are looking to win the first two games on the road in their second straight series after taking a 2-0 lead in the second round against the Toronto Maple Leafs and winning in five games.  Teams that take a 2-0 lead are 345-55 (.863) winning a best-of-7 series all-time, including 3-1 (.750) in 2023.  Here are 3 keys to Game 2:  1. Hurricanes goalie decision  Coach Rod Brind'Amour wouldn't reveal Carolina's starting goalie after saying Friday the Hurricanes were considering whether to rest Frederik Andersen and start Antti Raanta because of concern about possible ""wear and tear"" on Andersen from playing nearly seven full periods in Game 1.  ""I'll just leave it as suspenseful for the lineup tonight,"" Brind'Amour said Saturday. ""Everybody's available, though.""  Florida coach Paul Maurice said Sergei Bobrovsky will start for the 11th consecutive game.  Andersen has started seven straight games, his longest string of the season, and is 5-1 with a 1.65 goals-against average and .936 save percentage. Raanta, who last played on April 25, started Carolina's first five playoff games is 3-2 with a 2.59 GAA and .906 save percentage.  He is also 8-1 with 1.78 GAA, .933 save percentage and one shutout in 13 home playoff games (11 starts) in his NHL career.  2. Start strong  The Panthers and Hurricanes each like to play with speed and be aggressive on the forecheck, but finding the legs to do that from the drop of the puck will be a challenge because of any lingering fatigue from Game 1. Getting through that early could give either team an advantage.  Carolina took until the third period of Game 1, when it outshot Florida 14-2, to establish the sustained offensive-zone pressure that is usually its trademark, so wants to get to that game more quickly in Game 2.  ""It's a great team we're playing,"" Brind'Amour said. ""They got to their game. We would like to, obviously, do a little better job earlier. You want to start on time, but at the end of the day, when you look at that game as a whole, in the game we gave up 20 shots (in regulation).""  3. Time to kill  The Panthers were the better team 5-on-5 in Game 1, scoring each of their three goals at even strength and eventually winning because of it. But the Hurricanes were a Jarvis shot off the crossbar in the first overtime away from scoring a third power-play goal and winning with their special teams play.  Carolina was 2-for-6 on the man advantage in Game 1 and killed off all three Florida power plays while yielding a total of two shots on goal. The Hurricanes are a League-best 30-for-33 (90.9 percent) on the penalty kill in the playoffs. The Panthers are 29-for-44 (65.9 percent) on the penalty kill.  This could be a difference maker in a game at some point between two otherwise evenly matched teams.  ""We're asking our penalty kill to give us the moments we need,"" Maurice said. ""Get the kill in overtime. We don't care if we gave up two (power-play goals in regulation). Just get the kill in overtime. The power play is going to be a challenge because that penalty kill is a beast. It's not just good. They're not hot. They've been good for five years.""

Raanta stopped 24 of 26 shots, but the Panthers won 2-1 to take a 2-0 series lead.  Raanta, 34, last appeared in the Hurricanes' Game 5 loss against the New York Islanders in the first round on April 25. Andersen took over the crease, won Game 6 and had started every game since then, winning five of seven games.  Andersen and Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky both played 139 minutes and 47 seconds in Game 1, the sixth-longest game in Stanley Cup playoff history. Panthers coach Paul Maurice didn't hesitate in naming Bobrovsky his starter for Game 2, but Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour indicated after Game 1 that a load-management decision for his goaltenders was under consideration.  ""You have to. The guy played the whole game,"" he said of Andersen.  One consideration in switching to Raanta was his dominance on home ice.

"game","2023-05-05","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T04:16:03","LeBron James sends a hopeful message to his teammates following the Lakers' Game 3 loss against the Nuggets.  LOS ANGELES -- — Nikola Jokic was far from his usual dominant self while mired in foul trouble, and Jamal Murray cooled off after his scorching first half. The Denver Nuggets' big early lead disappeared entirely in the fourth quarter of Game 3, and the Lakers' home crowd was in a frenzy.  The Nuggets weathered every setback and calmly, methodically took control with a poise worthy of champions.  With one more victory, they'll finally get the chance to play for their first rings.  Murray scored 37 points, Jokic added 24 points and eight assists and the Nuggets rolled to a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals with a 119-108 victory over Los Angeles on Saturday night.  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 of his 17 points in the second half against his former team for the top-seeded Nuggets, who have never been this close to the NBA Finals in 47 years in the league. Denver is making its fifth straight playoff appearance, and the ultimate stage is now just one win away.  “I learn a lot about this team every time we play,” Caldwell-Pope said. “We have that dog mentality where no matter if we’re up, down, we’re going to continue to fight and play our game, and do it at a high level. We’re going to continue to do that for the rest of these games.”  Denver blew a 14-point lead in Game 3, but made a decisive 13-0 run in the fourth quarter to snap the Lakers' nine-game home winning streak since March 26, including seven straight victories since the regular season ended. The Nuggets excelled down the stretch with Murray and Jokic repeatedly running a two-man pick-and-roll game suggested by “Coach Jokic,” according to coach Michael Malone.  “This group is capable of doing great things, and they believe,” Malone said. “Belief is a very powerful thing.”  No team has rallied from a 3-0 playoff series deficit in NBA history. Game 4 is Monday night in Los Angeles.  “I can’t speak for the guys right now because I don’t know what’s going through all their minds, but I still (believe),” said LeBron James, who had 23 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds. “So it’s time to go right back home and start to refuel and start the treatment process and recovery process and get ready for Monday. My mindset is always locked in.”  Anthony Davis had 28 points and 18 rebounds for the seventh-seeded Lakers, who hadn't lost three straight games since early February. Los Angeles' prolonged, desperate surge ever since the trade deadline has finally run out of steam against the powerhouse Nuggets, who have won five consecutive playoff games.  “They've been at the top of the food chain for a reason, and have a plethora of guys that can hurt you, as was on full display tonight,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “But you know, circumstances are what they are. Difficult, but not impossible.”  James hit three 3-pointers after starting the series 0 for 13 from distance, and Austin Reaves added 23 points and seven rebounds. But Rui Hachimura was the only other Lakers scorer to crack double figures with 13 points, and they couldn't counter the Nuggets' balanced effort down the stretch.  “Our backs have been against the wall (for) probably about the last two months, maybe more than that since the trade deadline,"" Reaves said. “Swinging, throwing punches to fight to get to this opportunity. ... We can either come out Monday and go home, or we can fight for another day. And with the group of guys that we’ve got, I know what that answer will be.”  Jokic's streak of four consecutive triple-doubles ended in a fairly quiet game for the two-time MVP, who got his fourth foul in the third quarter. But Murray scored 17 points in a dynamic first quarter following his 23-point fourth quarter two nights ago, and he had 30 points by halftime of Game 3.  Bruce Brown scored 15 points and hit a key 3-pointer down the stretch for the Nuggets before Jokic all but iced it on a 3-pointer with 3:17 to play.  The Lakers’ passionate fans turned out in force for the 17-time champion franchise’s first conference finals games at home since 2010. Los Angeles tried desperately to get back in the series, with James playing 43 minutes after spraining his left ankle in Game 2 on top of his already sore right foot.  But the Nuggets’ flight to the coast didn’t cool off Murray in the slightest: The Canadian guard poured in 17 points in the first quarter and had 26 midway through the second. Reaves racked up 15 points, three assists and three rebounds in the second quarter alone to keep LA in it.  Hachimura’s 3-pointer early in the fourth gave the Lakers their first lead since the opening minutes, but the Nuggets took charge again in a rally highlighted by Brown’s 3-pointer with 7:02 to play, after which he taunted the Lakers’ bench with Los Angeles’ own “Freeze” 3-point celebration.  D’Angelo Russell had another rough game for the Lakers, scoring three points on 1-of-8 shooting in 20 minutes. The Lakers’ biggest addition in their trade deadline transformation has just 21 points in the series.  TIP-INS  Nuggets: Aaron Gordon had seven points in 32 minutes. ... Michael Porter Jr. had 14 points and 10 rebounds, capped by a 3-pointer in the final 90 seconds.  Lakers: Backup C Mo Bamba missed his ninth consecutive game with a sore left ankle. The team is hopeful Bamba can play at some point in this series. ... Fans near courtside included Jack Nicholson, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Andy Garcia, Dyan Cannon, Ken Jeong, Joel McHale, LA Kings captain Anze Kopitar and defenseman Drew Doughty, and Khalil Mack, Derwin James and Sebastian Joseph-Day from the Los Angeles Chargers’ defense.  ------  AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmJhL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTU0NzY4M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-02-11","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T19:19:00","After dropping another close game in Denver, the Lakers (0-2) return home to face the Nuggets (2-0) in Game 3 of their Western Conference Finals playoff series. The game tips at 5:30 p.m. PT on ABC and 710 ESPN radio.  Below are three things to know ahead of the matchup:  HOLDING SERVE  After losing both games in Denver, the Lakers find themselves in an unfamiliar situation these playoffs -- trailing in a series for the first time and winless after the first two games. As the #1 seed and one of the best home teams during the regular season, the Nuggets did what they were supposed to do by holding serve.  Now it is up to the Lakers to do the same. The good news is they, too, have been one of the best home teams of late, particularly after the trade deadline and through the first two rounds of the playoffs.  Since February 11th, the Lakers posted a 10-4 record at home to close out the regular season, outscoring teams by an average of 5.9 points a night. And in the postseason, the Lakers have been even better. In their six home playoff games, the Lakers are undefeated and have outscored opponents by an average of 18.3 points per game, the best mark for home teams in the postseason.  Denver, of course, offers the Lakers their biggest challenge yet in maintaining this sort of dominance at home. But the Lakers should feel confident about returning home and being able to play their best basketball.  History, too, is slightly on the Lakers' side here. Since 1984 in series with a 2-2-1-1-1 format, the higher seeded team has won both their home games 223 times. Of those series, 126 times the team trailing in the series has won Game 3 (56.5% of the time). The Lakers being able to add to that tally is critical in them being able to hold serve themselves and keep extending this series.  D'ANGELO RUSSELL'S RHYTHM  A key reason the Lakers have had such success at home is that D'Angelo Russell has played his best basketball when in the confines of Crypto.com Arena. Here are D-Lo's road/home splits this postseason:  Road: 8 games, 30.8 minutes, 12.1 points, 3.3 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 40.4% FG, 24.3% 3-point FG  Home: 6 games, 31.9 minutes, 18.2 points, 2.7 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 47.6% FG, 39.5% 3-point FG  In the first two games vs. Denver, Russell is averaging nine points a game on 36.8% shooting and has connected on one of his eight attempts from behind the arc. Getting him in position to find his rhythm is necessary not just for his own level of play, but because of how instrumental he can be for the Lakers overall success. A return home offers him a great opportunity to find that rhythm.  Denver, to their credit, have put Russell in the bull's-eye of their game plan, understanding his importance to the Lakers offense. They have hounded him defensively, and both head coach Michael Malone and reserve guard Bruce Brown commented that challenging Russell to defend at a high level on the other end of the floor is a Nuggets' priority.  Russell has shown these playoffs that he's able to meet these moments with strong games that help propel the Lakers to wins. A strong performance in Game 3 would go a long way in boosting his team in this series.  MORE ADJUSTMENTS COMING?  The Lakers have already made a few tweaks and changes to their lineups and defensive coverages this series. And while they do not yet have a win to show for these adjustments, they had some success in slowing down a potent Nuggets' offense in Game 2 and posting good shot quality for their own offense.  Considering the margin of these games has been just 11 total points, the Lakers are in a situation where they know what they have been doing can have some success and put them in position to win, while also seeking more solutions to get over the hump and claim some momentum of their own. As Coach Ham has noted in previous series, finding the right balance between scheme and execution is imperative in a playoff setting.  For the Lakers, the early returns on some of their lineups show that groupings involving Dennis Schröder and Rui Hachimura playing next to LeBron James and/or Anthony Davis have been pretty successful. The five-man lineup of those four players along with Austin Reaves has played 15 minutes together and have a net rating of +44.1 in those minutes. That group has shown to have strong execution on both sides of the ball, with a nice balance between size, athleticism, speed, strength, and skill.  Additionally, alternating defensive assignments on Nikola Jokic with Rui Hachimura and LeBron, and by putting Anthony Davis in more help situations has been a boost to the Lakers overall defense, while also challenging Jokic's ability to finish in the paint as efficiently. Continuing to build in this success while having answers to potential Denver counters will be important.  On the Nuggets' side, they have leaned into playing a shortened rotation in which six players are playing the majority of the minutes. This has put a heavy burden on Jokic and Jamal Murray to carry their offense, a call they have been able to answer so far. And being up 2-0, they have had little reason to deviate from this plan.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbGFrZXJzL25ld3MvdGhyZWUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctZ2FtZS0zLWxha2Vycy12cy1udWdnZXRzLTUtMjAtMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T05:45:28","LOS ANGELES — If history is our guide and remains unrelenting and inflexible, then it’s not a matter of if the Nuggets will be moving onto the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, it’s a matter of when.  The final shove of the Lakers off the 2022-23 ledge could arrive courtesy of a sweep Monday (8:30 ET, ESPN), or if the basketball gods have a heart — and the Lakers have a pulse — then it might take another game or two. In any event, it’s a 3-0 series lead for the Nuggets after their 119-108 victory Saturday and you don’t need yet another reminder that nobody has blown an advantage that big.  What was especially comforting for the Nuggets is how they captured Game 3 with, by his standards, a mild effort from Nikola Jokic. He was mainly silent through three quarters, dogged by fouls and decent L.A. defense, yet Denver managed to win anyway, rare for a team so dependent on the multiple skills of their two-time Kia NBA MVP center.  There was plenty from Jamal Murray (30 of his 37 points in the first half) and enough from a variety of others to break away from the Lakers and breeze down the stretch. Eddie Murphy beat the rush by leaving his courtside seat with four minutes left, and the crowd at Crypto.com Arena took a hint, following him out the door moments later.  And just like that, a Laker team that spent much of the regular season shoveling out of a mess of their making, find themselves covered in it all over again. Remember when Lakers coach Darvin Ham said “we’ll be OK, trust me” after Game 1? Well, they’re not.  The Nuggets are the No. 1 seed in the West for a reason, as they constantly love to point that out in case anyone forgot.  Here are five takeaways from Denver’s Game 3 victory, its commanding lead in the best-of-seven, and the plunging plight of the Lakers:  1. Finally, the help carries Joker  This was, by far, the most impressive Everyone Else has been in a game this season for the Nuggets. Keep in mind that Jokic is the center of the Nuggets’ universe and when he’s either on the bench or in a rare funk, bad things happen to the Nuggets. The Nuggets were the most efficient team in the league with him on the floor and were among the worst when he wasn’t.  But for one night — and it couldn’t come on a more important night, given the stakes — Denver not only survived without much from Jokic, who missed a triple-double for the first time in five games, but thrived. It started when Jamal Murray couldn’t miss a first-half shot, and then others chimed in. Bruce Brown, Michael Porter Jr., Jeff Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope all hit timely shots or made defensive plays that prevented the Lakers from taking advantage of the situation.  Jokic had nine points, six assists and four rebounds through three quarters and dealt with foul trouble; he got his fourth with seven minutes left in the third and sat. And yet, L.A. could only manage a 1-point lead before the Nuggets snatched momentum back for good with a 13-0 run in the fourth.  “It’s not about one guy,” said Murray. “We have a deep team and everyone’s ready to contribute.”  Now, for the bigger question: Was this just an exception by the Nuggets on an exceptional night? That depends on whether Jokic has another lapse. And that might not happen again in this series or, if the Nuggets advance as expected, at all in the NBA Finals. This was probably his one stinker for the postseason. He’s been that good, he is that good. And the Lakers missed an opportunity.  2. Jamal Murray a menace  It’s all but assured that Jokic will capture the Magic Johnson Award for most outstanding player in the West playoffs. But Murray, if nothing else, is leaving quite the impression as someone who must be considered among the top performers in this postseason as well. His level of play over the last two games is the main reason the Nuggets are up 3-0. And the Lakers simply have no answer for him.  Well, they finally cracked the Murray Code in the second half, but only after he torched them for 30 points in the first. In that first half, Murray dropped buckets of all varieties, a continuation of his 37-point Game 2. He’s now averaging 31 in this series on 52% shooting, 45% from deep.  LeBron James sent postgame flowers to the visiting locker room, saying this: “Once he gets going, it’s hard to turn him off, a guy that has that type of rhythm. Jamal’s one of those guys who can run off 20 in a quarter or 30 in a half. He can score at all three levels in the game, in the paint, free-throw line or 3-point line. You tip your hat. He’s a hell of a player.”  Murray, who was blistering in the bubble a few years ago, is a prideful player who feels slighted by the perception, at least in his mind, that he’s not in the class of the elite guards — Devin Booker, Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, etc. Murray did miss considerable time while rehabbing a knee injury that cost him an entire season, and he was load-managed initially this season, and therefore missed out on all the award-earning accolades (All-NBA, All-Star, etc.). More than anything, he’s a victim of circumstance, and his injury, and the fact that Jokic handles much of the point guard chores.  There is a consolation, though. Murray is still playing and those other guards aren’t.  3. Anthony Davis, gassed  It was Davis’ turn to falter in the fourth quarter when he had nothing left at the finish. After playing inspired basketball through three quarters when he punished the Nuggets in the paint and especially on the glass, Davis was on empty. He had one basket and two rebounds in the quarter, and this followed LeBron James’ fourth-quarter disappearance that proved costly in Game 2.  Of course, it’s all about perspective. Davis was downright beastly, finishing with 28 points and 18 rebounds; is it reasonable to believe he could stretch that through 41 intense minutes? And where was the help?  It enhanced the notion that LeBron and AD are wearing down right before our eyes, right when the Lakers can least afford them to do so. Both are playing heavy minutes, as they have all postseason, and there’s a game every other night. That’s not ideal for a player with AD’s injury history and a 38-year-old star with creaky ankles.  There’s no rest for the weary, with the next game up in 48 hours. After enduring a tough season, spending plenty of energy rallying to make the Play-In Tournament, then dealing with the physicality of the Grizzlies in the first round and Steph Curry in the second round, the postseason is catching up to the Lakers’ two stars.  Oh, and maybe the Nuggets are simply the better team.  4. Another low for D-Lo  There was much jubilation in the Laker Nation when Russell Westbrook was essentially dumped for D’Angelo Russell in February, and that optimism was affirmed when Russell prospered in the final few months of the season, then amped up in the first two rounds.  But right now? He’s mainly unplayable in this series, a swift fall by a point guard whose shot isn’t dropping and whose lack of defense is being exploited by Jamal Murray. Russell is shooting under 30% from the floor in this series, just 19% from deep, and saw only 20 minutes Saturday.  As if his timing was bad enough, Russell will be an unrestricted free agent this summer and there’s no assurances he’ll be extended by the Lakers. It’s not a stretch to see a scenario where Chris Paul joins the Lakers next season if he and the Suns don’t see a future together. That’s the situation facing Russell. Not only is he playing for his playoff life right now, his Laker life is also at stake.  5. Storied franchise vs. storybook franchise  There couldn’t be a bigger contrast than the Nuggets and Lakers. One owns 17 championships, the other hasn’t even made the Finals in its 47 years in the league. One is a marquee team filled with Hall of Famers and all-time greats in a history that stretches back to 1947, the other feels constantly slighted by the basketball public and TV networks.  The Nuggets are the Goliath in this matchup. Any notion of this being a close Western Conference finals is all but over, and the best two players so far belong to the Nuggets.  It would be an obvious breakthrough by Denver to win one more game in this series. And if they capture a title next month, it would be a crowning achievement by the Kroenke family, which also owns the Colorado Avalanche and L.A. Rams — both of whom won NHL and NFL championships in the last three years.  “You need 16 wins to win a championship and we have five more to go,” said Murray. “We just gotta stay locked in.”  * * *  Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

"game","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:31:16","Hunter Renfroe drops in a hit to bring home the Angels' go-ahead run in the seventh.  ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Mickey Moniak ended up coming through in center field for the Los Angeles Angels as Mike Trout had the night off.  Moniak had three hits and made a game-saving catch at the wall in the seventh inning as Los Angeles rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday after Angels starter Reid Detmers took a no-hitter into the sixth inning.  Moniak was playing in center after Trout was out of the lineup for only the fourth time this season. The three-time AL MVP got an off day after the team flew cross country Thursday after completing a four-game series in Baltimore.  The all-around game continues what has been a strong start for Moniak since he was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake one week ago. In six games, he is 9 for 19 with two home runs and three RBI.  “He’s done everything we’ve asked. He's got an opportunity and he’s wrapped his hands around it and run with it,” manager Phil Nevin said.  In the top of the seventh, Moniak made a well-timed jump at the wall to rob Michael A. Taylor of what would have been a solo home run that would have given the Twins a two-run advantage.  In the bottom of the inning, Moniak's triple to the right-field corner drove in Zach Neto and tied the score at 4-all.  “I like to pride myself on both sides of the ball. Just that catch there was a lot of work and refining stuff,” said Moniak, who was acquired from the Phillies at the trade deadline last year. “Just being able to see the fruits of my labor, I guess you could say is, is fun.”  Hunter Renfroe also had three hits for the Angels, including the RBI base hit in the seventh inning that drove in Taylor Ward for the go-ahead run.  Detmers tied a career high with 12 strikeouts and allowed only three Twins to reach base via walks before Byron Buxton lined a base hit to left with two outs in the sixth to end the left-hander's bid for a second no-hitter. Carlos Correa's walk and Buxton's single started a three-run rally that allowed Minnesota to tie the score.  ""I felt like I had all four pitches going. I was tunneling really well,"" said Detmers, who allowed three runs and two hits. “I mean things kind of got out of hand in the sixth a little bit, but other than that it was really good.”  Willi Castro homered in the seventh inning for the Twins to give them a short-lived 4-3 lead.  Zack Weiss (1-0) got the win and Carlos Estevez picked up his 11th save.  Griffin Jax (2-6) was charged with the loss.  Minnesota has dropped three of four games on its road trip, and has squandered late leads.  “We didn’t just sit there and and mope and go, we’re just not going to score today. We went out there, scored some runs, and had the lead on a day where we don’t have a hit through most of the game,” manager Rocco Baldelli said. ""We’ve done this a few times where we were in the driver’s seat, and then late in the game, we weren’t in the driver’s seat.”  The Angels opened the scoring in the third when Taylor Ward's sacrifice fly brought home Zach Neto. Los Angeles added two runs in the fourth. Brandon Drury had an RBI double then scored on catcher Ryan Jeffers' throwing error when Luis Rengifo stole second base.  After Buxton's base hit in the sixth, Kyle Farmer followed with an RBI single to left to end Detmers' night. The Twins then tied it on Alex Kirilloff's two-run double down the right-field line off Jimmy Herget.

"game","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Lancaster"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T21:10:00","Stefan Bogen's delightful board game Camel Up always makes for a good time. Though it's in a smaller box, Bogen and Pretzel Games have recreated those central elements in Camel Up The Card Game. Players will still put their bets in and attempt to manipulate the race to turn those bets into big payouts, all while trying to move up the track as you stack under and over other Camels. The entertaining push and pull of the core gameplay loop don't suffer from the game's compact nature. While some of the personality flourishes are missing compared to the original, Camel Up The Card Game should charm just about anyone that decides to jump on in.  Instead of the original game's bigger board, Camel Up The Card Game lives up to its name and goes for cards only in the setup. You lay out a track's length of cards, with each one having two spaces on it and an alternate sandstorm side with only one space. The original's trademark stackable Camel game pieces are back, and the only other elements that may occupy the track are the Shortcut and Fennec markers. These can either send you back a space or move you forward one extra space, and all the other cards on the table are Betting Cards.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Between the Fennec and Shortcut Markers and the Betting Cards, there's a welcome amount of strategy to unearth, and that's without factoring in the Crazy Camel, which we'll get to shortly. Regarding the former, your goal in the game is to have the most coins by the end of the game, and you earn coins by placing bets throughout. On each of your turns, you can take a Betting Card and these reward (or cost you) coins depending on where the Camel places in the race. There are Betting Winner Cards, Betting Midfield Cards, Final Betting Overall Winner Cards, and Final Betting Overall Loser Cards. While the Midfield, Final Winner, and Final Loser cards are limited to one of each color, there are several Betting Winner Cards, allowing multiple people to bet on the same Camel with slightly different coin results.  So for instance, each turn you can take one of the Final Betting and Midfield Cards, which will be cashed out at the end of the round. You can also take Final Betting Overall Winner and Loser cards, though these aren't turned in until the end of the game, so you want to be careful on who you bet on, as those cards also cost you if that Camel color doesn't win or lose.  The betting is one aspect of the game, but the real fun lies in attempting to move your Camel up the track and sabotaging the others so your chosen Camel can win. For those not familiar with the original, the game comes with several Camel pieces that can be stacked on top of one another, and this can lead to massive swings in who leads the group from one turn to the next.  (Photo: ComicBook)  For example, let's say the Blue Camel wants to move, and they have a card that allows them to move 2. If they are on top of the stack or by themselves on a space, they can just move as normal. If thought the Blue Camel is underneath a Green Camel and above a Red Camel, the Blue Camel will move the Green Camel with it 2 spaces. It's also important to note that the person higher in the stack counts as the furthest in the face, so while three Camels might all occupy the same space, their stack order is what dictates whether they are 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. This allows for chaotic shakeups throughout the race, as with the turn of a few cards and some key moves from players you can quickly find yourself backing the losing Camel instead of the winning one.  Players can directly manipulate the race in several ways. You can reveal the top card of the racing deck and move the Camel the number of spaces it dictates, though you will also have a finite amount of cards in your hand to play per round. The twist is that other players can use those cards too simply by paying a coin to you, and then they can also place a shortcut to move a Camel forward or a Fennec to move a Camel backwards.  (Photo: ComicBook)  That's all without even considering the Crazy Camel, which is facing the opposite way on the track and continues to move backwards. My first game the Crazy Camel really didn't affect much, but that changed in the next game, as the Crazy Camel ended up taking two heavily bet-on winners back to fourth and fifth place in just two turns. This ever-changing formation is like a constantly moving puzzle, and you're betting on through instincts and belief in your ability to maneuver constantly throughout.  Most of the game's flaws are in the presentation. The biggest issue is in how the cards are differentiated from each other and represented in the manual. The changes between a Betting Winner, a Midfield, a Final Winner, and a Final Loser card aren't all that drastic, and due to the manual's smaller size, the image of the setup is pretty small, making these differences even more difficult to sort out. Some more drastic visual differences would've been welcome, but nothing that seriously hinders the game once you get used to them.  Camel Up The Card Game offers an experience that will be a hit at just about any game night, and the painless learning curve coupled with the surprisingly tactical yet chaos-inducing gameplay makes multiple replays a joy. It's not the deepest experience, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one and worth a spin.

It then moved on to the likes of ‘I Am Bread’, a simulator where players assume the role of a piece of bread, and then ‘I Am Fish’, which… Well, you get the picture.  There have been other titles that have emerged from the London-based developer, but the latest game to be announced may turn out to be the crowing glory of the studio. Lost Skies is a total pivot from the established standard – an open-world, cooperative survival title set in a unique, innovative environment.  It has just been revealed, and it looks fantastic.  Lost Skies Is Waiting To Be Found  Right now, gamers can leap onto Steam and wishlist Lost Skies, a customisable, expansive adventure set ‘amongst the clouds’. It’s a cooperative game that’ll facilitate up to six players, all of whom will be intent on surviving this never-before-seen world.  In the words of Bossa Studios (and publisher, Humble Games), there’s an ‘ancient world of danger and beauty’ up for exploration. Players will be able to construct their own ‘skyships’ as they experienced ‘unparalleled freedom’, leaping between islands that float high up in the sky.  It can be played solo, but it looks as though it’s designed to be enjoyed with other players. There are combat mechanics, traversal features such as zip lines and gliders, an enhanced physics engine, and traditional survival elements such as crafting and hunting.  At first blush, it looks like a fantastic title, and the screenshots that have been released by Bossa Studios are nothing short of tantalising. Lost Skies boasts a charming aesthetic that is pleasing to the eye, and the colourful, animated style is sure to be an instant hit with players.  There’s nothing more known at the moment about the game – such as a release window – but we’ve got more than enough to go on to get excited about.

"game","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:43:53","Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said the company hasn't seen a ""pushback"" on the recent widespread price increase for big budget games, which now regularly sell for $70.  Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was ""keeping an eye on market conditions"".  As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn't seen any real resistance from players so far.  Watch on YouTube Newscast: After Redfall's launch woes, where next for Xbox?  Zelnick's comments come from Take-Two's latest earnings call (thanks VGC), in which he stated consumers were now generally limiting overall spending by ""going either to the stuff they really, really care about, blockbusters, or to value"".  As for Take-Two itself, Zenick seemed confident in its slate, with ""a bunch of blockbusters"" and a ""wonderful catalogue"".  The publisher has also suggested Grand Theft Auto 6 could be launching as soon as next year. In the company's yearly earning's report, which was published earlier this week, Take-Two predicted it will generate a staggering $8bn in net bookings for its 2025 fiscal year (beginning April 2024), as it launches ""several groundbreaking titles"". One of these is surely GTA6...  Mortal Kombat 1 will retail for $69.99 across platforms.  Outside of Take-Two, Mortal Kombat 1 was officially revealed yesterday by publisher Warner Bros Games in a rather graphic and juicy-sounding trailer. Along with this debut, we also found out the various platforms NetherRealm's upcoming fighter will be releasing on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store).  As you can see, there are no plans for a PS4 or Xbox One version of the game - Mortal Kombat 1 is a 'next-gen' only release. Well, except for the Switch, which, despite my very fond affection, is somewhat comparatively dated hardware.  But even though Mortal Kombat 1 will be releasing on Nintendo's hybrid console, and likely not have the same graphical polish as those versions on PS5 or Xbox X/S, it will still cost the same as its beefier counterparts - that's $69.99, for the game's standard edition.  This will be the second game to release on the Nintendo Switch with that higher price tag, the first of which was the recently released Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (although it is worth noting that in the UK the game retailed for £60).  Tears of the Kingdom has won itself plenty of fans in the week since its release, and I have not seen any quarrel from those across the pond about having to shell out an extra $10 for the pleasure of returning to Hyrule.  Will this also be the case for Mortal Kombat 1? Currently, I am not sure it will be (although, I am happy to be proved wrong).","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvdGFrZS10d28tYm9zcy1ub3Qtc2VlaW5nLXB1c2hiYWNrLW9uLTcwLXByaWNlLWZvci1nYW1lc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thursday’s Lakers-Nuggets NBA Western Conference Finals Game 2 averaged a 4.1 rating and 7.66 million viewers on ESPN (7.71M including ESPN Deportes), up 15% in ratings and 13% in viewership from Mavericks-Warriors on TNT last year (3.5, 6.77M) and the highest rated and most-watched conference final Game 2 since Blazers-Warriors on ESPN in 2019 (7.88M).  Compared to ESPN’s conference final Game 2 last year, Celtics-Heat, ratings increased 31% (from 3.1) and viewership 27% (from 6.05M).  Denver’s win, which peaked with 9.45 million from 11-11:15 PM ET, delivered the fifth-largest audience of the postseason. It was the 11th game of the playoffs to average at least seven million viewers, the most in any postseason prior to the NBA Finals since 2018 (13).  The Lakers have played in eight of the 11 most-watched games this postseason, tied with the Warriors as the most of any team. All six second round games between Golden State and the Lakers placed in the top 11.  Most-watched games of 2023 NBA Playoffs (through May 18)  As should be no surprise, viewership soared over the last time the Lakers and Nuggets met in the conference finals, three years ago in the “bubble.” Game 2 of that series, which aired on a Sunday night in September opposite the NFL, averaged 3.28 million viewers on TNT.  Game 2 was television’s most-watched program of the night and dominated in the key young adult demographics of 18-49 (2.6), 18-34 (2.25) and 25-54 (2.9). Compared to Mavericks-Warriors last year, ratings in those demographics increased 24%, 36% and 19% respectively.  All six games of Lakers-Warriors and the first two of Nuggets-Lakers have been the most-watched primetime program of their respective nights. While it is common for NBA games to dominate the rest of TV in the young adult demographics, it is comparably rare for the league to win the night in viewership during the television season.

Sebastian Aho over 2.5 SOG (-120 DK)  So, Sebastian Aho was a sweaty win in Game 1, as it took some overtime for him to deliver on his shots. While that may trouble some, I'm fine to go right back to him, and it isn't because he finished the first game with six SOG on 18 attempts, most of those came in OT.  The reason I backed Aho in Game 1 was his shot volume, and how his attempts and lack of hits in Round 2 had me seeing a guy that seemed due.  Aho has had 5+ shot attempts in six straight at home now and all four games against Florida this season. Over the past two seasons, when the Carolina center finds that level of volume, he's gone over 2.5 shots at a 74% rate.

The Flyers won 5-1. (Photo by Dave Sandford/Getty Images/NHLI)  Last night the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers put on a great show. The game started at a little after 8pm and ended just before 2 am. Florida’s Matthew Tkachuk sent everyone home with under 13 seconds left to play in the fourth overtime period of the game. Had he missed that shot, it would have sent the game into a fifth overtime; something that has happened just five times before. And it got me to thinking about the time the Flyers did this.  It was 2000. I was a junior in college in Utica, NY. My roommate, Ken, was a huge Penguins fan. And this came right on the heels of the Flyers whomping on the Buffalo Sabres in five games; a team that my friend Joe from across the hall was a huge fan of.  This was the Pittsburgh team of Jaromir Jagr, Matthew Barnaby, Darius Kasparaitis, and Martin Straka. They were a solid team from top down. They could score, hit, and defend. And much like the Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin led squad, they were a perpetual thorn in the side of the Flyers and their fans.  And what a better place to showcase thorniness than in the playoffs. And Pittsburgh had done just that. Despite winning the Atlantic Division that year, the Flyers struggled in the first two games of the series against Pittsburgh. Goals by Jagr and Straka supported a 28 save performance by Ron Tugnutt as the Pens downed Philly 2-0 in the series opener. In game two, Simon Gagne got Philly on the board, but only after Pittsburgh started off with three. The Pens won Game 2 by a score of 4-1. Down 2-0 in the series, all seemed hopeless.  In the forgotten game three of the series, the Flyers finally won a game. Andy Delmore opened the scoring in the first period followed by Keith Jones. Pittsburgh tied the game at two goals each in the second period. John LeClair put the Flyers up in the third only to see Jagr tie it up again. In the overtime period that followed, Delmore scored again at 11 minutes in to secure the win.  Then we come to the epic game four. Alex Kovalev scored for Pittsburgh in the first period. As the game went on, it was a tightly controlled game with neither team letting the other get a chance to score. LeClair tied the game up at 4:47 in the third on a power play goal. And that’s where things remained.  And in our dorm room, Ken and I watched. Each of yelling, cheering, screaming “Dammit!”, complaining about perceived missed calls and dirty plays. Going “OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” at every ping off the post or miraculous save. Probably, just like every hockey fan in Pennsylvania was doing that night.  Now, the date of this hockey game was Thursday, May 4. My college, Utica College, graduates students on Mother’s Day; I guess they felt it was a nice gift for mom. That was 10 days later. So, May 4 was right at the start of exam week. My roommate Ken was a senior. And while we were big hockey fans, we were also conscientious students first who happened to have exams at 8:30 the next morning.  We stayed up watching the first two overtime periods before calling it a night. It was wayyyyyyy after midnight at this point. And again, we both had early morning exams.  The next morning, we turned on Sports Center and saw the news: Keith Primeau had saved the day.  It is still one of the greatest moments in Flyers history that wasn’t a Stanley Cup victory. Primeau would forever remain a Flyers hero because of it. My buddy Matt, who lived across the hall with Joe, stayed up to watch the whole thing. He said the game ended sometime after 2 am. I wish I could’ve stayed up. And I know some of you will think that I was a huge nerd for not doing it…and you are right. I’m not going to argue that.  Losing a game in a multiple overtime matchup like that can turn a series around. Pittsburgh never recovered from that lose and dropped the next two games to Philly. This set up an unfortunate seven game series with New Jersey that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe Carolina can recover from this loss. Maybe Florida is the magic team this year. We’ll just have to see.  But 23 years ago, Primeau and the Flyers were on top of the world and forever gave us a memorable moment that we can always go back to when the current iteration of the Flyers fail us.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYnJvYWRzdHJlZXRidXp6LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3JlbWVtYmVyaW5nLWZseWVycy1wZW5ndWlucy1tYXJhdGhvbi1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The program aims to enhance the player experience and provide additional value. Read more about this game-changing move in the gaming industry.  Epic Games, the renowned gaming company behind titles like Fortnite, has recently unveiled its latest initiative to further strengthen its position in the gaming industry. The introduction of Epic Rewards, a new rewards program for the Epic Game Store, aims to provide players with added benefits and incentives for their loyalty.  Starting today, all Epic Games account holders will be automatically enrolled in the Epic Rewards program. This means that whenever players make eligible purchases, such as games, apps, add-ons, or virtual currency, they will receive 5% back in rewards. These rewards will be added to their account balance approximately two weeks after the purchase.  One of the key advantages of Epic Rewards is its flexibility. Players have the option to apply their rewards at the checkout to receive discounts on future eligible purchases, or they can choose to save them for later use. The program also allows the combination of Epic Rewards with other discounts and coupons, enabling players to maximize their savings.  However, it’s important to note that Epic Rewards do have an expiration date. The rewards will expire 25 months after their acquisition date, encouraging players to make use of them within a reasonable timeframe.  The introduction of Epic Rewards is another step in Epic Games’ ongoing efforts to improve the Epic Game Store and provide a compelling alternative to platforms like Steam. The company has gradually enhanced the storefront by offering a more favorable revenue split for creators, weekly free games, and securing notable timed-exclusives. These strategic moves have contributed to the store’s growth, with monthly active users reaching a peak of 68 million in 2022.  Last year, the Epic Game Store saw significant business, with players spending $820 million on Epic’s own games and $355 million on third-party applications. While Epic’s own game sales experienced a slight decline compared to the previous year, third-party application sales saw an impressive 18% increase year-over-year.  With the introduction of Epic Rewards, Epic Games aims to strengthen its relationship with players and reward their support. By offering tangible benefits and combining them with the existing features of the Epic Game Store, the company aims to create a compelling ecosystem that caters to the needs of both developers and players alike.  As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it is initiatives like Epic Rewards that demonstrate the company’s commitment to innovation and player satisfaction. By providing a more rewarding experience, Epic Games is poised to make a lasting impact in the digital distribution landscape.  As the gaming industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies like Epic Games are constantly exploring new ways to attract and retain players. The introduction of the Epic Rewards program for the Epic Game Store is a strategic move that aims to provide players with added value and incentivize them to choose the platform for their gaming needs.  By offering a 5% reward on eligible purchases, Epic Games is not only giving players a direct benefit but also encouraging them to continue making purchases on the Epic Game Store. This not only helps to boost the platform’s revenue but also strengthens its position as a viable alternative to other digital distribution platforms like Steam.  The flexibility of the Epic Rewards program is another key aspect that sets it apart. Players have the freedom to choose when and how they want to use their rewards. Whether they decide to apply the rewards immediately for discounts on future purchases or save them for later, the program allows for a personalized experience tailored to individual preferences.  Moreover, the ability to combine Epic Rewards with other discounts and coupons further enhances the value proposition for players. This means that players can stack multiple savings opportunities to maximize their purchasing power. It’s a win-win situation, as players get more value for their money while the Epic Game Store benefits from increased customer loyalty and engagement.  The success of the Epic Game Store in recent years is evident from its growing user base and increasing sales figures. The platform’s commitment to providing a fair revenue split for developers, offering weekly free games, and securing exclusive titles has contributed to its popularity. With the introduction of Epic Rewards, Epic Games is reinforcing its dedication to player satisfaction and further differentiating itself from competitors.  In a rapidly evolving industry, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Epic Games understands this and continues to innovate to meet the changing needs of players. The launch of the Epic Rewards program demonstrates the company’s proactive approach to improving the gaming experience and fostering long-term relationships with its player community.  As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other platforms and publishers respond to initiatives like Epic Rewards. It’s clear that players are increasingly looking for value beyond just the games themselves. Programs like this not only benefit players but also contribute to the overall growth and competitiveness of the gaming industry.  The introduction of Epic Rewards is a significant development for the Epic Game Store and the gaming industry as a whole. By providing players with a rewarding experience and additional incentives, Epic Games is taking a step forward in building a loyal player base and solidifying its position as a key player in the digital distribution landscape. As players continue to seek value and unique experiences, programs like Epic Rewards will undoubtedly shape the future of the gaming industry.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwdHJpZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9lcGljLXJld2FyZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nonetheless, bugs and glitches do exist in the game, somewhere, and Nintendo has released a patch for Tears of the Kingdom that fixes a game-stopping main quest bug for “The Closed Door.”  Tears of the Kingdom Patch Ver. 1.1.1 Fixes The Closed Door  The patch notes are pretty short on this update, so you can just read them all through the magic of Copy and Paste below:  General Updates  Fixed issue where, sometimes, the player could not clear main quest “The Closed Door,” even if they fulfilled the conditions to advance the quest. If you have already encountered this issue, you will be able to clear the quest by downloading this update data.  Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.  Personally, I have not reached “The Closed Door” yet, and in fact, I’ve barely touched the main story at all yet. I do have two whole stamina wheels though, which I just used to tame a gigantic white stallion that I named “Cheonsa,” the Korean word for angel.

Tonight they play the first of a weekend series in Toronto at Rogers Centre. They'll then head to New York for a series next week at Yankee Stadium.  The Orioles (28-16) are 3 1/2 games back of Tampa Bay for first in the AL East. They just completed a 6-4 homestand with Thursday’s 6-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. The Orioles went 2-1 versus Tampa Bay, 2-1 against Pittsburgh and 2-2 versus the Angels during the homestand. They are now 9-7 in May and 10-3-1 in 14 series for the year.  The Orioles went 6-4 on their last road trip, which took them to Detroit, Kansas City and Atlanta. They are 13-8 on the road for the season and are 5-2 in road series. The Orioles are 12-2 in 2023 in series-opening games, going 7-0 in road series openers.  Serving as the designated hitter on Thursday, Adley Rutschman launched his seventh homer of the season with a 424-foot blast in the seventh inning to give the O’s a 5-4 lead. It marked his second career go-ahead home run in the seventh inning or later, joining a solo walk-off homer on April 13 vs. Oakland. Rutschman has hit safely in eight straight starts since May 9, slashing .357/.471/.750 (10-for-28) in those games.  O’s right fielder Anthony Santander tied the game at three with a two-run blast in the fifth inning, his seventh longball of the year. He has homered six times in his last 19 games after homering just once in his first 22. Santander is batting .339/.406/.645 (21-for-62) in May and has hit safely in 13 of 16 games, compared to .213/.280/.362 (20-for-94) in March/April.  O’s third sacker Gunnar Henderson singled in the second inning and has hit safely in six straight games for the first time in his career, going 7-for-22 (.318) with four extra-base hits. He has reached base safely in nine straight games since May 9. And second baseman Joey Ortiz recorded his first career multi-hit game, finishing 2-for-2 with a pair of singles and a run scored in the series finale with Los Angeles.  Toronto (25-19) lost 4-2 at home to the New York Yankees last night, dropping three of four in that series after sweeping Atlanta three in a row in the previous series. The Blue Jays are 13-6 at home.  Toronto has lost three of four, five of nine and 10 of its last 17 games.  O's right-hander Kyle Gibson (4-3, 4.67 ERA) will make his 10th start for his new team. He has thrown 52 innings on the year, allowing 57 hits with a 1.404 WHIP, 2.8 walk rate and 6.2 strikeout rate. The Orioles are 5-4 in his starts.  Gibson had a 3.93 ERA in six starts through April, but is 0-3 with a 6.11 ERA in May. This month opponents have hit .319 off him with an OPS of .831.

Maybe it was ""all the small things,"" if you asked the emo version of Austin Reaves.  On the court, Reaves had 22 points in Game 2. He was tied with LeBron James as the team's high scorer. Reaves also hit 5 of 9 3-pointers in the 108-103 loss. You might say Reaves was wearing the loss like so much hair dye and eyeliner. He showed up to his postgame news conference in a black T-shirt with messy, wet hair. And the emo meme version of the Lakers' guard was born on NBA Twitter.  Am I more than you bargained for yet?

Most games tend to stick around in Game Pass for around 12-24 months, and to give you an idea of what to focus on before Microsoft makes an official announcement, we've looked through our data to bring you a list of games that might leave the service next month.The majority of games in Game Pass tend to remain in the service for about 12 months before they leave. The games listed below all joined the service 12 months ago, so they could be next to leave.So many great games joined Game Pass in June 2022, including three Ubisoft games that might be on the chopping block due to the launch of Ubisoft's own subscription service, Ubisoft+. It should be noted that the Xbox One version ofonly came to Game Pass in December last year, so it could be sticking around in the service for longer. The same can be said for the, where the PC versions of the three Shadowrun games joined PC Game Pass earlier this month. While the Shadowrun games and Naraka: Bladepoint are unlikely to leave, we've included them anyway to be on the safe side.It doesn't happen all the time, but some games do leave Game Pass after 18 months in the service. Here are all the games that are still in Game Pass that joined back in December 2021.There are several quick completions here that you may want to get done and out of the way now: Townscaper can be completed in under 30 minutes, Paw Patrol: Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay in four hours, and The Gunk in under eight hours. For those looking for a challenge, Stardew Valley, ANVIL: Vault Breaker, and Generation Zero all have pretty lengthy completion estimates and some achievements with hefty TA ratios. Rubber Bandits has one partly discontinued/unobtainable achievement , so you may want to avoid the party game if that sort of thing bothers you.Nearly all games that joined Game Pass two years ago have now left the service, but there is one that is still hanging on.From what we can tell, out of all the games that came to Game Pass in June 2021, just Yakuza: Like a Dragon remains. If you want the completion for Yakuza: LAD on your tag, you'll need to set aside between 80 and 100 hours. Technically, retro-inspired FPS Produes also joined PC Game Pass back in June 2021, but that was in Game Preview and hadn't fully released.Next, we have games that are still in Game Pass after a full three years. While most games that joined Game Pass in June 2020 have left, a couple remain.No Man's Sky has a pretty tough achievement list, thanks to permadeath and survival modes, but if you're thinking of going for the completion, unlocking all 27 of its achievements will take between 50 and 60 hours. PC Game Pass title Battletech could also leave next month, but it doesn't feature any achievements.After a huge 48 months in Game Pass, a surprising number of games are still hanging on. These five games joined Game Pass back in June 2019.Now, Batman: Arkham Knight was announced as leaving Game Pass back in September 2020, but for some reason, it was never removed from the service, so it was either a mistake, or its contract was renewed. We don't know how long it was renewed for, but it's possible that it could leave on its four-year anniversary in the service next month. All the games listed above have pretty chunky TA ratios and completion estimates. Batman's base list is estimated to take between 40 and 50 hours, Astroneer's between 60 and 80 hours, Hollow Knight's between 60 and 80 hours, Moonligter's between 25 and 40 hours, and Bridge Constructor Portal's between 15 and 20 hours.Finally, we come onto the Game Pass faithful. These games have been in Xbox Game Pass since its full launch back in 2017 — a full six years!Both games here have lengthy completion estimates, so you'll want to get cracking on these sooner rather than later. To complete Payday 2: Crimewave Edition's base achievement list, you'll need between 150 and 200 hours. For Terraria, estimates suggest a completion will take between 80 and 100 hours.As for games leaving at the end of May, Microsoft has confirmed that five games are leaving Game Pass .

"game","2014-05-24","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T05:29:09","Ten years on from the viral game's release, we take a look back at why it captured our attention  Every once in a while, a game comes along that gets so many people onboard for the ride, the very notion of what defines a video game is challenged.  People who would never have considered themselves gamers flock to it, it makes headline news, and becomes a cultural touchstone that will forever encapsulate a certain period of time, a certain world mood. But long before there was Wordle, there was Flappy Bird.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Yes, it's a name that probably hasn't crossed your synapses in the decade since the game's unceremonious wiping from history. But hearing it has likely taken you straight back to early 2014, tapping away at your phone's screen before another infuriating collision with a Super Mario pipe. Gold.  But though the game gained its popularity in early 2014, it actually first made an appearance 10 years ago on 24 May 2013. So what better time to revisit an unsuspecting mobile game that captured the world's attention?  Tap, tap, tap again  (Image: .Gears)  Developed by Vietnamese programmer Dong Nguyen and released for iOS and Android devices, Flappy Bird's concept was simple yet challenging; navigate a small, pixelated bird through a series of obstacles consisting of green pipes that resembled those from the Super Mario Bros. games.  The controls were straightforward, requiring players to tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and gain height, and the objective was to pass through the gaps between the pipes without colliding with them. Each successful passage awarded the player a point, and the goal was to achieve the highest score possible.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Flappy Bird spread rapidly through word-of-mouth recommendations, with players introducing the game to their friends and family, challenging them to beat their scores or boasting about their achievements. Players only needed to tap the screen to control the bird's flight, making it accessible to a wide audience, including casual gamers.  But while the game was simple to grasp, it was incredibly difficult to master. The timing required to navigate the bird through the narrow gaps between the pipes was precise, resulting in frequent collisions and frustration, but that led players to share their high scores, screenshots and frustrations on social media.  This created a ripple effect, as people were curious to try the game for themselves and see if they could achieve similar or better results, and the addictive nature of the game kept new players engaged as they continuously tried to beat their high scores or compete with friends.  (Image: .Gears)  Flappy Bird achieved unprecedented levels of mainstream success during its peak popularity, climbing the ranks on app stores and reaching the top of the charts in several countries, surpassing many well-established and heavily marketed games. It became one of the most downloaded and played games worldwide; at its height, it was downloaded millions of times a day.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The game's explosive popularity caught the attention of various media outlets worldwide, and it became a topic of conversation, generating memes, parodies and discussions across social media as Flappy Bird and its creator, Dong Nguyen, were featured in numerous news articles, interviews and television segments.  The downfall  Despite the immense success and attention, Nguyen found the overwhelming response to be too much to handle, and he expressed concerns about the addictive nature of the game and the impact it was having on players.  Flappy Bird's popularity on social media platforms fostered a sense of competition among players, and the game's quick turnaround time - when the bird collided with a pipe, the game immediately restarted - reinforced the ""one more try"" mentality and contributed to the addictive nature of the game.  Some players spent excessive amounts of time playing, often neglecting other responsibilities and activities in their lives. The game's difficulty and frequent failures could also lead to frustration, stress and even anger, which began to draw criticism and scrutiny as the game's popularity soared.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Some critics questioned the simplicity of the gameplay and the visual resemblance to Super Mario Bros., leading to discussions about potential copyright infringement and the ethics of the game design. The difficulty level of Flappy Bird, which frustrated many players, became a topic of debate, with some arguing that it was unfairly challenging and caused unnecessary stress.  This didn't sit well with Nguyen, and in February 2014, he unexpectedly removed the game from app stores, stating that he could no longer handle the fame and attention it brought him.  Splashy Fish, Flappy Wings and Clumsy Plane  Flappy Bird's popularity persisted, and after the addictive game was removed from app stores, some players even experienced withdrawal symptoms and a longing to play the game again.  There were even reports of devices with the game still installed being listed on online marketplaces, such as eBay, for prices ranging from a few hundred to several thousand pounds, with sellers attempting to capitalise on the game's scarcity and continued demand.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The sudden absence of the game created a void for those who had become heavily invested and addicted to its gameplay, and inevitably, imitators and clones began flooding app stores. But while a multitude of Flappy Bird clones emerged attempting to replicate its success, they were often met with mixed reviews and failed to achieve the same level of widespread popularity.  Flappy Bird had a significant impact on the mobile gaming industry, showcasing the potential for simple, addictive gameplay to capture a massive audience and achieve viral success, and inspiring developers to create similar games with challenging mechanics while also sparking conversations about the addictive nature of games.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsd29ybGQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZ2FtaW5nL2ZsYXBweS1iaXJkLWlwaG9uZS1nYW1lLXdoeS1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tYXBwLXN0b3JlLTQxNTAzODTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Lewistown men, best friends on and off the football field, wouldn’t have it any other way.  “I think every single one of us have been playing football since we were 6 or 7 years old up through Pop Warner, Pee Wee and Midget football,” said the 28-year-old Beck, who is completing his 10th season with the Tomahawks in the Great Eastern Football Association.  “We do it because we love it,” he added. “We treat it like our NFL whether we get paid or not. It’s something that we don’t want to give up until our bodies can’t handle it anymore.”  At 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds, Beck is one of the smaller players in the league. Making his home playing slot receiver, don’t think he’s afraid to get hit going over the middle.  “I don’t know how many years I have left in me,” he quipped. “I can’t imagine my life without football. It’s more than just a game to a lot of us.”  For many, it’s a refuge where their real-world problems don’t exist – at least for three hours on Saturdays. On the other hand, when they need a shoulder to lean on, they have 25 to 30 teammates to rely on.  “All these guys come from all different walks of life,” Beck added. “We’re each unique, but on Saturdays we come together as a team. I don’t think of us as a team, we’re a true family. I look at any one of the players as my brothers. I would do anything for them on and off the field.”  Beck credits long-time Tomahawks head coach Brian Rodgers as the cog that holds everything together.  “Coach does an excellent job keeping this family-oriented,” Beck said. “I couldn’t imagine having the whole team over to my house like he does his house.  “I can appreciate him more and more,” he added. “He goes above and beyond for each one of us. I am so appreciative of what he does for me in my life and for this team.”  Coaches and players have shared in the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat – back-to-back appearances in the Keystone Bowl are tainted by losses to the Lancaster County Cyclones on both occasions.  Beck played high school football at Indian Valley High School as a freshman and sophomore then finished up his final two scholastic seasons at Mifflin County. He was supposed to play for his old high school coach, the late Steve Hayes, at Division III Juniata College. Things didn’t work out.  Playing in the semi-pro GEFA has given him a second chance. “I have to hit that hole if I want to make that yardage, and I have to absorb the hit,” he explained. “The league has made me a better football player.”  Critics question its authenticity since there are only eight players on each side, no goal posts so kickers aren’t needed and the length of the field is 50 yards – half the size of an NFL field. To keep insurance and operating costs down, players aren’t paid, which makes them amateurs and cheaper to insure.  “People think this league is a joke,” Beck said. “We don’t get paid. I was recruited by a few schools. Thankfully, I had this football to keep my passion going.”  Practice not perfect  Because of conflicting work schedules, players only practice once a week during the season – on game day. Coaches and players meet at Lewistown’s Rec Park around 9 a.m. on Saturdays for 1 ½- to 2-hour practice. “We watch film and game plan then head down to the (Kish Park) field for warmups.  “It’s not just 1 to 4 p.m. on game day, guys are waking up at 7:30 for practice, film and the game then they’re done at 5 p.m.”  There’s little time during practices to teach new concepts or schemes. Coaches stress the basics and make adjustments, depending on what players are available that particular week and the scouting report for the opposition.  Kahley: Feeling aches and pains on Sunday  At age 27, Kahley has played in the league for six years and has enjoyed every minute of it. “It feels great to still be playing football,” said Kahley, who played one year at Indian Valley then three years at Mifflin County before playing at Division III Lycoming College.  “Just to be able to do that for something you’ve had a true passion for as a wee little kid,” he added “You can play the game that you fell in love with. There’s nothing more precious in life to still play right now.”  The physicality of the game has taken its toll on his body. During the 2019 season, Kahley suffered a back injury that sidelined him for nearly two years.  Getting hit nearly every time he carries the ball catches up to him. “Now, I’ve started to feel it every Sunday,” he explained.  Still, he relishes the opportunity that the Tomahawks have afforded him.  “It feels great to still play football,” Kahley said. Although he realizes the clock on his career is ticking as the league is undergoing a youth movement.  “There are so many younger guys coming in,” he explained. “Eight-man football is a lot different. With the smaller field and the athletes, we have now, there’s a better chance anyone can become a superstar in any game.”  Case in point: With Kahley resting one game after injuring his ankle, Jonathan Dodson filled in and rushed for a team-record 157 yards and four touchdowns against Snyder County. “It took one game,” Kahley said. “You never know when that moment is going to happen. It happened in a flash.”  The unwanted champion  Dodson, who lives in Huntingdon, should have been reveling in that championship feeling in 2022. The Moshannon Valley Vikings had just captured Keystone Bowl XVIII with a 26-18 victory over Dauphin County.  Dodson didn’t feel much like celebrating as he saw little playing time as a Viking. A few days later, Moshannon Valley released Dodson. He came to Mifflin County, believing he would get a chance to contribute.  “I keep playing for the love of the game,” said the 37-year-old Dodson, who works as a correctional officer. “It’s more of a stress reliever. It’s simply an escape for a little bit.”  The yards don’t matter to Dodson as much as the feeling he’s contributing to the team. After his record rushing day, the first thing Dodson did was seek out his three children on the sidelines.  “It’s pretty cool when your kids watch you play, and think that you’re a superhero,” he explained. “(The Tomahawks) They gave me an opportunity here and I ran with it – no pun intended.”  Still, he cherishes every carry, like it could be his list. “Football means a lot to us that play this game,” Dodson said. “It’s our first love. Semi-pro football has a lot of has-beens or never was. Guys that might have been stars in high school. Guys that have tried out in high school and never did anything after that. They just want to see if they’re capable of still doing it.”  His last three seasons with Moshannon Valley tested his spirit. “I didn’t have the opportunity to show my skills,” he explained. “Now, I’m doing pretty darn good.  “My new team is giving me an opportunity,” he added. “I can’t ask for anything better than that. My offensive line has been tremendous.”  Stepping away isn’t easy  During the week, Chris McClellan works in information technology, fixing other people’s computer problems. “It’s weird telling people what I do for a hobby,” McClellan said. “But you’re only young once.”  While still suiting up on Saturdays, the 34-year-old McClellan also serves as the Tomahawks’ defensive coordinator. “My planning style and coaching style go hand in hand,” he said.  Now in his 12th season, McClellan shows no sign of slowing down. He realizes Father Time might disagree.  “I remember seeing a flyer (looking for players) and calling the number on a whim,” he said. “A week later, I was playing. I see the league is going through a transition right now. People used to go door-to-door to find players on Fridays. Now, film is readily available. Semi-pro football is more structured. It’s no longer just a backyard league.”  Back in the day, “random teams seemed to show up on Saturdays,” he added.  For the players, Tomahawk football remains an outlet to play the game. “It’s something to do as an extracurricular activity,” he added. “We’re all in the same social circles, we all go to the other guys’ wedding, we all know their kids and families.”  Football also gives a sense of structure and commitment to those who need it.  “There are lots of ups and downs,” McClellan said. “These guys are my best friends … people that I’ve spent the last 12 to 13 years with.”  It’s just Tomahawk football.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxld2lzdG93bnNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9sb3ZlLW9mLXRoZS1nYW1lLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

South Korea's foreign affairs and culture ministries held meetings with their Indian counterparts to help lift the ban, a Krafton Inc (259960.KS) representative said.  The Indian government blocked BGMI, the flagship game made by Krafton last July, citing concerns about its data-sharing and mining in China.  Krafton is backed by China's Tencent (0700.HK) which owns around a 13.5% stake.  The three-month trial approval of the game was agreed after it complied with issues of server locations and data security, Indian deputy minister for Information Technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, said in a tweet.  loading  Daishin Securities analyst Jeeeun Lee said the spillover from political spats with China to Krafton will be limited.  ""It will be tough for India to impose an outright ban on companies affiliated with China over political issues when they operate through a local corporation that hire Indian workers like Krafton for instance,"" she said.  Shares of Krafton rose 1.45% compared to the wider KOSPI index's 0.89% rise when the market closed on Friday.  At the time of its removal from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Play Store and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store, BGMI had more than 100 million users in India.  A Facebook page for the title says the game will be available for download soon.  The government will keep a close watch on other issues of user harm and addiction in the trial period before making a final decision, Chandrasekhar added.  New Delhi banned another Krafton title, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), in 2020, following which the company launched BGMI.  The ban on PUBG was part of a larger ban on more than 300 Chinese apps, including short-video platform TikTok, after the government ramped up its scrutiny of Chinese businesses in the wake of a 2020 clash between the neighbours.  The government also intensified the scrutiny of investments by Chinese firms in Indian companies.

"game","2023-05-19","19:00:00","{""Maryland"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T23:48:26","Maryland baseball’s magic number for at least a share of the Big Ten regular-season title sat at one on Friday. With a win, the Terps would have clinched the title for the second season in a row.  After taking the lead in the fifth, the Terps looked to be in prime position to do so.  Both teams were in the midst of a tight pitching battle as the score stood 3-2 in favor of the Terps, but Penn State junior infielder Jay Harry hit a two-RBI single that took back the lead.  Maryland didn’t score the rest of the game, and ultimately fell to the Nittany Lions, 5-3.  Unlike Thursday’s game — in which there were 32 runs scored — both team’s starting pitchers and defense were solid Friday.  Penn State sophomore right-handed pitcher Tommy Molsky held Maryland’s offense relatively quiet in his outing, tossing five scoreless innings. Meanwhile, Maryland junior right-hander Jason Savacool had an up-and-down start, surrendering four runs on eight hits. He did fan six batters, though.  Penn State struck first in the second inning when graduate catcher Thomas Bramley hit a two-RBI double.  Even so, it was night and day for the Maryland defense from Thursday to Friday. It executed a gorgeous double play between junior catcher Luke Shliger and sophomore first baseman Eddie Hacopian with the bases loaded in the third. The Terps committed no errors and stranded nine Penn State runners the entire game.  Maryland’s bats finally clicked in the fifth. Hits by junior shortstop Matt Shaw, senior third baseman Nick Lorusso and sophomore outfielder Ian Petrutz drove in three runs to give the Terps a 3-2 lead.  But the two-run single in the fifth from Harry proved too much for the Terps, who couldn’t get anything else going.  Penn State senior left-handed pitcher Ryan Partridge pitched three innings of scoreless baseball in what might have been the last appearance of his career to secure the win for the Nittany Lions.  With the loss, the Terps dropped to 16-7 in Big Ten play ahead of their regular-season finale at Noon Saturday  Three things to know.  1. Maryland’s offense cooled off. It was a rare occasion in which Maryland’s pitching staff lacked run support. The Terps’ three-run rally in the fifth was the only time they scored all game, as Penn State’s Molsky and Partridge shut down the Terps all game long.  2. The Terps need to wait another day. Maryland was hoping to clinch the Big Ten regular-season title on Friday, but will have to wait until tomorrow with the loss. It has a chance to clinch Friday evening if Indiana loses against Michigan State, but can also can clinch if it wins Saturday’s affair against Penn State.  3. Defense kept the game close. Both teams stranded a total of 16 batters, with both team's defenses committing no errors after a disastrous showing on Thursday. While both pitching staffs gave up a good amount of hits, there weren’t many dangerous balls hit.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXN0dWRvdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvNS8xOS8yMzczMDY1MS9uby0yMC1tYXJ5bGFuZC1iYXNlYmFsbC1mYWxscy10by1wZW5uLXN0YXRlLWluLXBlbnVsdGltYXRlLWdhbWUtb2YtcmVndWxhci1zZWFzb24tNS0z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc3R1ZG90aW1lcy5jb20vcGxhdGZvcm0vYW1wLzIwMjMvNS8xOS8yMzczMDY1MS9uby0yMC1tYXJ5bGFuZC1iYXNlYmFsbC1mYWxscy10by1wZW5uLXN0YXRlLWluLXBlbnVsdGltYXRlLWdhbWUtb2YtcmVndWxhci1zZWFzb24tNS0z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a newly released blog, Keller says the discussion going around about “how we’re canceling PvE outright…isn’t accurate” before getting into details about the game’s origins, development process, and future.    Read More: Overwatch 2 Multiplayer Isn’t Good Enough To Justify Gutting Its Long-Promised PvE    Advertisement  Back in 2019, then-director Jeff Kaplan stepped onto the BlizzCon stage and promised an extensive Overwatch 2 PvE experience with skill trees and customizable hero abilities, offered as a buyable add-on to the original game. It would have a shared multiplayer universe with the OG title, that way players who didn’t want to shell out extra for the PvE sequel wouldn’t get left in the dust. Over time, it became clear that we weren’t getting what was promised, as Kaplan left Blizzard, Keller took over, and Overwatch 2 became a standalone sequel that would replace Overwatch 1 entirely.    Overwatch 2 game director on PvE  But on May 16, Blizzard confirmed that the expansive PvE mode would never happen and that the company was instead focusing on shoring up its PvP mode. Keller’s blog makes it clear that Story Missions (“fast-paced, co-op gameplay” that are “leaps and bounds above what we’ve built for PvE previously”) are still happening, and he’ll have more details “in the coming weeks.” But the Hero Missions (“an in-development game mode that allowed players to upgrade individual heroes through talent trees, providing a deeply replayable version of PvE in Overwatch 2”) make up the mode Blizzard is “no longer moving forward with.”    Advertisement  Keller continues:    “The Overwatch team was founded in the wake of a canceled game at Blizzard called Project Titan. That game had many facets, but at its heart, it was an FPS MMO. The Overwatch team, especially at its inception, considered itself an MMO development team. As we transitioned away from that original concept and started creating Overwatch, we included plans to one day return to that scope. We had a crawl, walk, run plan. Overwatch was the crawl, a dedicated version of PvE was the walk, and an MMO was the run. It was built into the DNA of the team early on, and some of us considered that final game a true realization of the original vision of Project Titan.”  Advertisement  After Overwatch launched, however, Keller alleges the team wasn’t “as focused as we should have been on a game that was a runaway hit” and instead tried to continue to build off of a “years old” Project Titan ideology: “Things rarely go as planned in game development. We struggled to find our footing with the Hero Mission experience early on. Scope grew. We were trying to do too many things at once and we lost focus. The team built some really great things, including hero talents, new enemy units and early versions of missions, but we were never able to bring together all of the elements needed to ship a polished, cohesive experience.”  According to Keller, the team kept trying to employ the “crawl, walk, run” plan, but the “audacious” and “gargantuan” PvE mode was “continuously pulling resources away from the live game.” He confirms that there were years of dev work and “emotional investment” put into the Hero Missions mode, and the team “tried to find ways to make all of our ambitions fit together in a plan that we believed in.”  Advertisement  “We couldn’t.”  Keller also attempts to clear up why the team waited so long into 2023 (which was when this mode was promised) before announcing they weren’t going forward with it. “Lastly, people have wondered why this announcement came at this time. After Overwatch 2 had launched, we started refining our plans for future seasons.” The team realized they couldn’t keep pulling focus towards the promised PvE mode “as plans grew,” so they decided to abandon Hero MIssions altogether. “The decision was the start of a long process, not the final piece of it,” Keller writes. Instead of Hero Missions, the team is focusing its efforts on the live service game—which is, ostensibly, Overwatch’s bread and butter.  Advertisement  “This has been hard for us, but as the director on this project, I have to do my best to make decisions that put the game and the community first, even when those decisions are disappointing. In this case, I had trouble pivoting away from a vision that just wasn’t working. And for that I would like to apologize to our players and to our team. I’m sorry.”  He ends the blog post with some flowery language about Overwatch being born from the ashes of Project Titan and how “something beautiful” came from it. “This is another moment of change. And the future of Overwatch will be born out of it.”  Advertisement  I’m not sure I’m as hopeful as Keller is about the future of Overwatch 2, but I’m always happy to be proven wrong.

The Utes waste no time jumping into the thick of things hosting Florida at Rice-Eccles Stadium in what many have circled as a bit of a revenge game for Utah in week one. Utah football will then travel to Baylor for a first-ever meeting of the two programs.  Fast forward into the end of October and the Utes will have massive back-to-back Pac-12 games against USC at the Coliseum and then host Oregon at home. These two games seem to be the favorites for determining who ends up winning the regular season in the Pac-12 and moving on to the championship game in Las Vegas. However, according to Jensen, there is one more game for the Utes worth considering.  Utah Football At Washington Football, November 11  Jensen feels like this game in Seattle should be receiving more hype and he’s probably right.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by KSL Sports (@kslsports)  The Utes and Huskies haven’t faced off since 2020, a 24-21 win for Washington at Husky Stadium, and the matchup has historically been an entertaining one. Washington, like Utah, Oregon, and USC also bring back a lot of the talent that made them successful last season while setting them up for another run in 2023.  “I don’t think we are talking enough about Washington,” Jensen said. “I think that game, November 11, on Saturday, in Seattle at Husky Stadium may determine who wins the Pac-12 regular season and then determines which of these teams goes to the Pac-12 Title game. After that, Utah plays Arizona and Colorado, so you figure, if Utah is still in the mix and they beat Washington, they’ll handle the last two games. That could be the make-or-break game.”  Michelle Bodkin is the Utah Utes Insider for KSLsports.com and host of both the Crimson Corner Podcast (SUBSCRIBE) and The Saturday Show (Saturday from 10 a.m.–12 p.m.) on The KSL Sports Zone.

Released as a tie-in to the new Phantomime EP, Escape The Ministry is a point-and-click puzzle-based online game in which fans explore the band's mysterious headquarters, with an ominious warning that they must escape before they're found out.  It all ties in to the wider lore and mythos surrounding the band that has been shared across the (semi)-frequent chapters on YouTube, with hints of appearances from members of the wider Ghost family including Sister Imperator and the previous Papa Emeritus lineage.  Armed with a camera (which can download images directly to your desktop), the player walks around Ghost HQ collecting clues and messages that may hint towards what lies in store for the band. A heavy metal take on Monkey Island style puzzle solving, the game can be played online and via VR.  While the band remain typically tight lipped about what the future holds, there have been plenty of hints that the band are gearing up to kill off the current Papa Emeritus - IV - as they traditionally have between each album cycle.  IV remains an anomaly in the Ghost lore, being the only character to serve as a Papa that hasn't been 'killed off' between albums (thus far, at least). Granted, when Copia was introduced in April 2018 he was simply Cardinal Copia, before ascending to full Papa-Dom in March 2020 during a show in Mexico.  Currently Ghost have tour dates running right up until October, playing in Europe, North America and Australia, including appearances at European festivals throughout the summer.  In-game, a room dedicated to the four previous Papas (Papa I - III and Papa Nihil, the apparent originator of the band) includes an empty pedestal with the ominous message ""under construction, this pedestal will be filled at a later time"".  We won't spoil any of the puzzles for you, but suffice to say the whole game ties in to Phantomime in some fiendishly ingenious ways and features plenty of easter eggs from across the band's history.

"game","2023-10-01","19:00:00","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T17:36:00","Best known for working on the publisher’s WWE and NBA games, Visual Concepts has found itself behind the wheel of 2K’s latest licensed experiment. Lego 2K Drive is a high-octane competitive racer full of destructible brick-y environments to crash through and a kid-friendly narrative full of fourth-wall-breaking fun.  The game’s best feature is Bricklandia, the playful Lego landscape in which 2K Drive is set. It’s a world begging to be dismantled by the brunt of your screeching tires and custom boat masts. Accelerating across the open-world playmat (that a human would never want to step on) is a thrilling experience, made better by the carefully animated auto-morphing ability. As you cross different terrain, from road to off-road and on water, players automatically switch between vehicles to fit the context.  Tires and water noodles frame the world’s vistas and act as charming obstacles, and it’s this blend of real-world objects with Lego constructs that amplifies the delightful toy box atmosphere. As a budding racer dropped into this striking open world, you tackle an onslaught of revheads, claiming their flags to ascend to the honor of Sky Cup Champion. Mohawked egomaniac Shadow Z serves as your rival in this endeavor, popping up from time to time to remind you of how mean-spirited he is.  To even get close to taking him on, you must explore Bricklandia in search of rival speedsters, each with their own unique driving skills they exercise in instanced Mario Kart-style races. From an actual horse to an alien in a suit, they make for a charming ensemble and provide new cars and perks to play with, as well as Brickbux, with which you can buy new machines and parts. You can also build your own vehicles brick-by-brick at the garage, which let me create some truly cursed rides. While the building system isn’t the most intuitive, it does feel like an appropriate nod to Lego’s humble brick-building origins.  Across Bricklandia’s varied biomes, you also encounter On-The-Go Events, ambient missions that you can drop in and out of for pockets of absurd fun, such as jumping over houses or drifting through a minefield. Conquering the criteria to earn XP and resources feels like getting your license in Gran Turismo on a schoolyard sugar high.  Lego 2K Drive’s constant barrage of dialogue kept me giggling throughout, though the intensity of some missions, like the less-interesting wave-defense or NPC rescue expeditions, left me unable to focus on the jokes. This was always disappointing, given the evident talent of the writers and voice actors, who provide an effective satire of conventional racing games.  Bashing and smashing your way through the map is easy junk food fun, but the must-win races can be punishing due to some devastating pickups and brutal slow down when you veer off track. Some of the open-world missions require you to drive with dexterity and attempt deft movements while herding rockets or smashing through tiny robot invaders, which can lead to frustration, where I often felt too fast for my own good. While I relished how it got my heart pounding, I was left longing for a more low-key approach to exploration.  While it is a little buggy, another delightful surprise was Lego 2K Drive’s couch co-op, which allows you and a partner to peel through the open world together, pooling XP as you go. I found myself getting in the way of bombs or smashing into targets for my partner to make sure one of us got the top spot. Notably, this feature made the dreary defend and rescue missions much more palatable thanks to the collaborative nature of the gameplay.  Unfortunately, the elephant in the room, or in this case, a monkey, is the game’s storefront, Unkie’s Emporium, introduced during the tutorial by its eponymous primate mechanic. Here, you can purchase premium currency with real money that can be exchanged to access cars and characters previously locked behind a costly Brickbux wall. Of course, you could earn all these items by grinding, but the temptation lingers, which is troubling for a game so clearly geared toward younger audiences.  Lego 2K Drive builds an incredibly inviting world where speed and silliness reign supreme as you race and morph across its delightfully destructible setting. Despite some frustrating mission design and a smattering of bugs, Lego 2K Drive quickly won me over with its absurd narrative full of irreverent dialogue and moreish open-world challenges. If only the specter of microtransactions didn’t loom so large in this kid-friendly game, it would make for an even smoother ride.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vcmV2aWV3L2xlZ28tMmstZHJpdmUvc3R1ZC15b3VyLWVuZ2luZXPSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1laW5mb3JtZXIuY29tL3Jldmlldy9sZWdvLTJrLWRyaXZlL3N0dWQteW91ci1lbmdpbmVzP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It’ll be showdown between two impressive rookies on the mound, as Seattle sensation Bryce Miller (2-0, 0.47 ERA) faces off against Braves righty Bryce Elder (3-0, 1.94).  After a magical run to the postseason last year, the Mariners haven’t quite been able to get out of neutral thus far in 2023, entering play Friday fourth in the crowded AL West at 21-22. Injuries to Robbie Ray and Andres Munoz have taken their toll on the pitching staff, but behind Luis Castillo, Logan Gilbert, George Kirby and Miller’s budding AL Rookie of the Year campaign, preventing runs isn’t Seattle’s problem — scoring them has been. Julio Rodriguez and Teoscar Hernandez are going to have to start making noise in the middle of the order if the team wants to make it two playoff appearances in a row.  The Braves, meanwhile, have had no such problems at the plate this year. Atlanta ranks fifth in runs scored and second in slugging percentage in all of baseball, as NL MVP frontrunner Ronald Acuna Jr. spearheads an attack that’s propelled the team to the top of the NL East. The back of the rotation is a major question mark after injuries to Max Fried and Kyle Wright, but if anyone has the depth to weather that kind of storm, it’s the Braves.

"game","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T01:49:41","Reds' manager David Bell is ejected after Clarke Schmidt is sent to wash his hands of foreign substances.  CINCINNATI -- — Aaron Judge has been scorching hot since a mild hip strain sent him to the injured list earlier this month.  The reigning AL MVP hit his seventh home run in as many games and the New York Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-2 on Friday night.  “When you’ve got Anthony Rizzo hitting behind you, who’s been red hot as well, you’re going to get good pitches to hit,” Judge said.  Rizzo also homered for the surging Yankees, who improved to 9-3 in their last 12 games.  Judge, who received a standing ovation from the many Yankees fans in attendance following his pregame batting session, wasted little time making his presence felt in the teams’ first meeting in Cincinnati since 2017. Judge took the fifth pitch he saw from Reds starter Ben Lively 431 feet to center field for his 13th home run of the season.  “It’s just very reminiscent of what we saw last year,” Yankees starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt said of Judge. “You see the same guy. I don’t think anything’s changed from last year. When you see him catch hot like this, just watch out. It’s definitely a reason for concern for the rest of the league.”  The homer was Judge’s only hit of the night, but he has homered in five of the last seven games — including hitting two in two games during that stretch.  With New York still leading 1-0 lead before the bottom half of the fifth inning, the umpires administered a foreign substance check on Schmidt (2-4).  “When I went out there for the fifth inning, the third-base umpire checked me,” Schmidt said. “He checked my hands and said they were completely fine. He checked the back of my wrist where the glove slides onto, and I’m using a black glove, and there’s like black fur inside the glove.  ""Throughout the game, sweating and rosin, it kind of built up on the back of my wrist where the fur sits.”  The umpires allowed Schmidt to stay on the mound after Schmidt cleaned off his wrist. Reds manager David Bell was ejected while disputing the umpires’ decision to allow Schmidt to continue his scoreless outing. Cincinnati had just three hits off Schmidt at that point.  “David was upset that we made him clean it off and not eject him,"" crew chief Brian O’Nora said via the pool reporter. “I explained the situation. He kept going. I told him it was enough and he kept going. I had no choice but to eject him.”  Bell declined to discuss the ejection after the game.  “I think it was probably obvious what happened, and I’m just going to leave it at that,"" the Reds manager said. ""We don’t benefit from me talking about this, so I’m not going to talk about it. But it was obvious what happened.”  Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán was suspended for 10 games Wednesday by Major League Baseball and fined for violating the sport’s prohibition of foreign substances on the mound.  “I get it,” Schmidt said. “The league is hypersensitive about it right now. You see it all across the league where guys are getting more extensive on the searches, which is completely fine. I have nothing to hide.”  Lively (1-2) was pulled in the sixth after walking Judge on six pitches. Lively allowed just two hits, including Judge’s first-inning home run, while compiling a career-high eight strikeouts as the Red lost for the fourth time in five games.  Following Lively’s exit, Rizzo tagged Reds reliever Ian Gibaut with his 10th homer of the season to score Judge and make it 3-0.  Jake Fraley drove in two runs on a double off reliever Jimmy Cordero in the sixth to chop New York’s lead to 3-2.  The Yankees added three runs in the ninth, including a two-run double by Kyle Higashioka.  BOONE RETURNS  Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before the game he got emotional during the drive to the ballpark.  Boone, who made his big league debut with the Reds in 1997, returned to Cincinnati for the first time as a manager. It was also Boone’s first visit to the city since the All-Star Game weekend in 2015 when he was an analyst for ESPN.  “This place was a huge, huge part of my life,” Boone said. It will forever be a in my heart and a special place to me. Every time I get to come here, it means a lot to me.”  Boone played for the Reds until he was traded to the Yankees in 2003. Boone’s older brother, Bret, also played in Cincinnati from 1994-98. Their father, Bob, was the Reds’ manager from 2001-03.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Yankees: INF Oswald Peraza (sprained ankle) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list after the game and optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  Reds: OF TJ Friedl (mild oblique strain) took some swings and ran before the game. Bell said Friedl has not shown any symptoms of the left oblique strain since being diagnosed with the injury on May 13. Cincinnati placed Friedl on the 10-day injured list on Monday.  ADDING DEPTH  The Yankees announced after the game they acquired OF Greg Allen from Boston Red Sox for minor league RHP Diego Hernández and cash considerations.  It’s the second stint with the Yankees for the 30-year-old Allen, who played in New York in 2021. He also has played with Cleveland, San Diego and Pittsburgh during his six big league seasons.  UP NEXT  Reds RHP Luke Weaver (1-2, 6.26 ERA) is scheduled to get the ball Saturday in the second game of the three-game series. The Yankees had yet to announce their starting pitcher.  —  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbWxiL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE0NzE2ODnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""SaintLouis"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T02:53:48","Nico Hoerner drives in half the Cubs' runs with a pair of doubles in the team's road win.  PHILADELPHIA -- — Nico Hoerner had two two-run doubles in his return from the injured list and the Chicago Cubs snapped a five-game losing streak, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 10-1 on Friday night.  Marcus Stroman (3-4) allowed one run and three hits in six innings for the victory. The Cubs have won seven straight games over the Phillies dating to the 2021 season.  “It's a great sign for our group that we were able to save the bullpen and create some positivity,” Hoerner said. “That was something we did well earlier in the year.”  The Phillies (20-24) have lost five in a row and showed visible signs of frustration as the game ended.  “The way we play, it's on us,” Phillies designated hitter Bryce Harper said. “Every guy in this clubhouse should be frustrating because of the way we are going about it right now and the mistakes we're making. We're not playing the game the right way. And when you don't play mistake-free baseball, you lose ballgames.”  Part of the issue has been starting pitching, with Ranger Suarez lasting only two innings while allowing five hits and four earned runs on 66 pitches. It was the third time this week that a Phillies starter did not go longer than two innings.  “He looked like he was trying to find his changeup,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “That second inning, he got the ball up and over the plate. And then his pitch count got so high that -- coming off an injury- I had to get him out.”  The Cubs put together a pair of four-run innings with Hoerner, who played in his first game after suffering a left hamstring strain against St. Louis on May 9, playing a key role with the matching doubles that scored Christopher Morel and Nick Madrigal. Morel hit his sixth home run of the season in the ninth.  “It is a continuation of the things that we have done well, which is getting on base and hitting with runners in scoring position,” Hoerner said. “We did a great job of cashing in tonight.”  Stroman allowed only Nick Castellanos' sacrifice fly in the first inning while holding the Phillies to one hit in his final five innings. The Cubs got three hitless innings out of Julian Merryweather and Nick Burdi to finish things.  “I was way better with my mechanics and felt way sharper with great movement,” Stroman said. “Yan (Gomes) did a great job of mixing up my pitches.”  It was a solid outing for Stroman, who allowed six runs and seven hits in just 2 2/3 innings during a 16-3 loss at Minnesota on May 14.  “That was a really good outing for Stroman,” Cubs manager David Ross said. “He was able to overcome some of the mistakes that we made which was important for him and us. He continued to make pitches and get us out of jams.”  MAY DAY  The loss secured the Phillies' second five-game losing streak of the month and dropped their overall record to 5-10. Over the past three seasons, Philadelphia is a combined 27-44 (.380) in May. In the rest of the season, the Phillies are 163-135 (.547).  TRAINERS ROOM  Cubs: OF Cody Bellinger (left knee contusion) was moved to the 10-day injured list, retroactive to May 16 for what the club feels is a precautionary move.  Phillies: LHP Jose Alvarado (left elbow inflammation) threw from 75 feet for the second time since going on the injured list on May 10. ... DH Bryce Harper (right elbow reconstruction) continued to increase his throwing distance with manager Rob Thomson indicating that Harper could stretch his throws to 90 feet in the next week. If that happens, Harper could end up at first base for the Phillies at some point in June.  UP NEXT  The second game of the weekend series features Phillies ace Aaron Nola (3-3, 4.53 ERA) taking on Cubs RHP Jameson Taillon (0-2, 6.66).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWxiL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE0NzE2ODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This season saw 203 40-plus point performances by 57 different players — both marks shattering the previous records of 142 games (from 1961-62) and 47 players (from 2020-21).  If it felt like there was a player dropping 40 point every single night, it’s because it was almost true. Of the 164 days of regular season games, 111 featured at least one 40-plus point game (67.8%). Additionally, 52 of those days featured at least two 40-point scorers (31.7%).  That feeling has carried over to the postseason as nearly every edition of playoff action features a stellar performance. It took only one game into the conference finals for there to be more 40-point games in the 2023 playoffs (17) than all of 2022 (16), and these playoffs have already seen the second-most 40-point games and tied for the most 50-point games in a single postseason in NBA history.

And with the conference finals just getting going — the Nuggets lead the Lakers 2-0, while the Heat lead the Celtics 1-0 in the East — that means we have a minimum of nine games (if both conference finals series and the NBA Finals end in sweeps) and a maximum of 18 games (if each of those series goes the full seven games) to potentially add more games to this total.

Not only has the 2023 playoffs already doubled that mark to tie the 2020 bubble season for the most 50-plus point games in a single postseason, two of those 50-point games have come in Game 7s.  Stephen Curry set the record for most points in a Game 7 when he led Golden State to a series-clinching win on the road in Sacramento with a playoff career-high 50 points on April 30. That record stood for only two weeks before Jayson Tatum sent Boston to the conference finals for the fourth time in six seasons with a 51-point gem to defeat Philadelphia in the conference semifinals.  Here’s a closer look at the 40-plus and 50-plus point scorers in these playoffs who are still chugging along.  Jimmy Butler (2 40+ playoff games)  But neither Curry nor Tatum holds the mark for the highest scoring game of this year’s playoffs. That honor belongs to Jimmy Butler, who dropped a playoff career-high 56 points on the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 4 of Miami’s first round series with the playoff’s top overall seed. Butler followed that up with a 42-point game in the series clincher to lead the No. 8 seed Heat into the second round.  The phenomenon of Playoff Jimmy has only grown in the 2023 playoffs. Since arriving in Miami in 2019-20, Butler has played 231 regular season games and has zero 40-point games. However, in 53 playoff games with the Heat, Butler has eight 40-point games – the most in franchise history, ahead of Dwyane Wade (7) and LeBron James (3).  Butler is the leading remaining scoring in the playoffs with an average of 31.5 points per game. He has made the biggest leap (plus 8.6 ppg) from regular season scoring average to playoff scoring average of any player remaining in the playoffs, followed by Denver teammates Jamal Murray (7.2) and Nikola Jokic (5.9).

Through 13 games played — five games in the first round, six games in the conference semifinals and two games in the conference finals — Jokic has averaged 30.4 points (5th overall, 2nd among active players); 13.8 rebounds (2nd overall and active) and 10.2 assists (1st overall, 1st active), while shooting 54.9% from the field (11th overall, 2nd active) and 47.8% from 3-point range (8th overall, 2nd active).  During the regular season, Jokic’s points scored and points created with his assists were identical (24.5 ppg apiece) for a total of 49 points either scored or created (42.3% of Denver’s 115.8 ppg). In the playoffs, Jokic has increased both marks as his minutes have risen from 33.7 to 38.4 mpg. Additionally, he’s up to 30.4 ppg scoring by himself and 25.4 ppg created for his teammates, for a total of 55.8 ppg (47.9% of Denver’s 116.5 ppg).  In Denver’s Game 2 win, Jokic posted his fourth consecutive triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. It was his seventh of the playoffs – matching Wilt Chamberlain in 1967 for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason in NBA history. With a minimum of four games and a maximum of 12 games remaining this postseason, expect Jokic to take sole possession of that record soon.  Jayson Tatum (1 40+ and 50+ point game)  While Tatum’s scoring average in the playoffs (28.3 ppg, 8th overall, 3rd among active players) is down slightly from his regular season mark (career-best 30.1 ppg, 6th overall), he owns one of the signature performances of the 2023 postseason with his 51-point masterclass in Game 7 of the conference semifinals.  But before he could get to Game 7, Tatum had to overcome a dreadful start in Game 6 — missing his first 11 shots, shooting 1-of-14 from the field and 0-of-6 from 3-point range with less than five minutes to play in the fourth quarter — before catching fire in the closing minutes with Boston’s season on the line.  Tatum shot 4-of-5 from 3-point range in the clutch as he single-handedly outscored Philadelphia in the fourth quarter, 16-13, to send the series back to Boston for a winner-take-all Game 7. Only Butler (28) has more clutch points this postseason than Tatum (28) with Tatum shooting 61.5% from the field and 62.5% from 3-point range.  Once Tatum got hot at the end of Game 6, he never cooled off as he was dominant from start to finish in Game 7 to keep the Celtcs’ hopes of title No. 18 alive.  Anthony Davis (1 40+ point game)  Of course, Boston isn’t the only team in search of its 18th championship. The Lakers are just eight wins away from their own 18th title (and second in four seasons) behind the duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis.  Davis has the Lakers’ only 40-plus point game so far this postseason — he finished with 40 points on 14-of-23 shooting in L.A.’s Game 1 loss to Denver — part of a roller coaster ride of offense for Davis as he has four games with 30 points or more and six games of fewer than 20 points.  Overall, Davis’ postesason scoring (22.3 ppg) is down 3.6 ppg from his regular-season average (25.9 ppg). While Davis’ defense has been strong — a league-best 3.2 bpg as well as 1.5 spg — the Lakers need Davis to find offensive consistency against Jokic and the Nuggets.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy80MC1wb2ludC1wZXJmb3JtZXJzLTIwMjMtcGxheW9mZnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T05:25:00","After losing its first game of the 4A bracket on Monday, Crimson Cliffs needed a rally of wins against Ridgeline, Green Canyon, Dixie twice and Snow Canyon twice to take the back-to-back 4A title.  The Mustangs went on a tear through the bracket, winning every game needed so far, including Friday’s game against Snow Canyon 9-2 to move within one win of the championship.  Crimson Cliffs head coach Justin Abbott made sure his boys were not letting the early postseason loss affect them mentally, which has helped result in its playoff run.  “We didn’t put any kind of pressure on it,” said Abbott. “We didn’t talk about it; I didn’t think we needed to because we knew what was in front of us. It was an afterthought. It happened and was over with.  “It’s kind of like what we talked about, one pitch at a time. If you didn’t get your pitch and they call it a strike, so what. There’s nothing we can do about it now and there was nothing you could do about Monday when it was over. We haven’t put a whole lot of emphasis on it. We just have to go play it one pitch and one game at a time.”  The Mustangs put their mark on the game early Friday, taking a 3-0 lead after Brexten Starley’s homerun in the third inning.  However, Snow Canyon had made a multi-run comeback in every previous playoff game, so when the Warriors rallied for two runs in the fourth, the game was far from over.  But Crimson Cliffs did not want history to repeat. The Mustangs started the fifth inning with consistent hitting to get multiple players on base to set up teammates for RBIs.  “We’ve been talking about quality at-bats all week,” said Abbott. “We’ve just been talking about all week that it’s a hard-hit ball, and we’re not getting uncomfortable with pitches that we don’t like to hit. “We stayed disciplined enough to get some guys on base and have some big two-out RBIs.”  Crimson Cliffs lead hitter Jayger Baldwin came up big, hitting two of his teammates home in the fifth for a four-run inning and 7-2 lead.  Baldwin got on base on every at-bat and ended the game with four RBIs.  “All I want to do is get on first base so I can give my teammates opportunities to get RBIs,” said Baldwin.  “Stayed composed, lots of confidence, breathing and we just knew we could do it. We are playing with a lot of confidence right now, and after that Green Canyon game we knew we were getting to this spot.”  Abbott says one of Baldwin’s biggest strengths is his mentality.  “He’s so locked in. It doesn’t matter what happens, he is the most positive kid I’ve ever been around. Even if he doesn’t do good you couldn’t tell,” said Abbott.  The Mustangs will have a shot to win the series, and the state title, at 12 p.m. on Saturday.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T04:59:11","Rafael Devers goes deep twice as the Red Sox lead vs. the Padres.  SAN DIEGO -- — Rafael Devers homered twice and drove in four runs to help the Boston Red Sox beat San Diego 6-1 Friday night to hand the staggering Padres their 10th loss in 12 games.  Devers and his friend and former teammate, Padres shortstop Xander Bogaerts, took the lineup cards out for the pregame exchange and hugged. Devers then circled the bases in front of Bogaerts in consecutive innings in his 14th career multi-homer game.  Devers hit a solo shot to right so hard leading off the second that he stumbled back a few steps before starting his trot. He hit a three-run homer nearly to the base of the batter's eye in straightaway center field with no outs in the five-run third for a 6-0 lead. He has 13 homers this season.  Both came off lefty Blake Snell (1-6), who allowed six runs and five hits in four innings.  Before the game, Bogaerts said he hoped Devers didn't hit any homers because “he's a dangerous guy. He's truly one of a kind.""  Devers proved his friend right.  “Very happy today that I was able to hit two runs but you have to keep doing adjustments every day,” Devers said through a translator.  “He put two great swings,” manager Alex Cora said. “Around him, everybody put up good at-bats. That was impressive, the third inning. We were grinding at-bats, fouling off pitches, staying on pitches, taking our walks. It was a fun inning.”  Rob Refsnyder hit a two-run, bases-loaded double ahead of Devers' three-run shot to help the Red Sox to their third straight win.  Other than Fernando Tatis Jr.'s leadoff homer in the third off James Paxton (1-0), the Padres' offensive struggles continued on a day when slugger Manny Machado went on the 10-day injured list with a hairline fracture in his left hand. The Padres were booed at game's end, just as they were Wednesday after a loss to Kansas City. They fell to five games under .500 and are 8 1/2 games behind the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and just one game ahead of the last-place Colorado Rockies.  The Padres managed just Tatis' homer, his sixth, and four singles in six innings off Paxton, who was making only his second start of 2023. He made his Red Sox debut a week earlier, his first big league appearance since April 6, 2021, with Seattle. He missed most of the 2020-22 seasons due to injuries and had Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2021.  “It feels great, just really to contribute to the team and be here pitching again,” said Paxton, who earned his first victory since Aug. 15, 2020, against Boston while he was with the New York Yankees.  Paxton said Devers is ""awesome. His swing is amazing. So good on offense and he does a great job at third base, too. Just an all-around fantastic player, fun to watch.”  Josh Winckowski pitched the final three innings for his second save.  Bogaerts, who left the Red Sox as a free agent and signed a $280 million, 11-year contract in December, was robbed of a single by diving right fielder Alex Verdugo to end the fifth.  EXPLOSION IN SINGLE-A CLUBHOUSE  Two contract workers were burned in a natural gas explosion in the home clubhouse of the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Padres' Class-A affiliate, leading to Friday's game being postponed. The two workers were taken to a hospital. The Padres said no players were involved.  DEVERS AND BOGEY  Devers and Bogaerts went out to eat Thursday, an off day for both teams. “You know what's crazy is, I forgot my wallet at home. I'm not even kidding,"" Bogaerts said. He thought he left it at the ballpark but didn't find it there, and started to get nervous. “I said, 'Man, you've got to pick this up. I don't even have a dollar.'"" Bogaerts said he found his wallet at home, in his backpack, where he put it during the bus ride home from Dodger Stadium last Sunday. ”I haven't told him that piece yet but I told him right away that he's got to pay,” Bogaerts said.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: 1B Justin Turner, who was aboard for Devers' three-run shot, left the game with left knee soreness.  Padres: Machado's was hurt when he was hit by a pitch Monday night. His IL stint is retroactive to Tuesday. Manager Bob Melvin said there’s a possibility Machado can return when the Padres play at the New York Yankees next weekend.

Game Summary: A six-run fourth inning gave the Oklahoma City Dodgers the lead and the Dodgers pitching staff held the Sugar Land Space Cowboys scoreless over the final six innings in the Dodgers’ 7-6 win Friday night at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. The Dodgers won a 10th consecutive game for the team’s second-longest winning streak since 1998. Sugar Land (17-25) built a 6-1 lead through three innings, fueled by a four-run first inning. The Space Cowboys scored the game’s first run on an OKC fielding error then added two runs on a RBI double by Rylan Bannon. Another run scored on a sacrifice fly by Justin Dirden for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers (32-11) scored a run in the bottom of the first inning when Michael Busch grounded a RBI double into right field. Sugar Land added two more runs in the third inning, scoring a run on an OKC fielding error and another on a wild pitch for a 6-1 advantage. Then in the fourth inning, the Dodgers responded with six runs, including scoring four runs with two outs. Patrick Mazeika grounded out to bring in a run and Drew Avans hit into a fielder’s choice to score another run. The Dodgers went on to load the bases with two outs before Ryan Ward lined a two-run single into right field. Jonny DeLuca followed and tied the game, 6-6, with a RBI single. An infield RBI single by Justin Yurchak then gave the Dodgers a one-run lead. Dodgers pitchers held the Space Cowboys to one hit over the final six innings and no hits over the final five innings as they retired 16 of the final 18 Sugar Land batters of the game.  Of Note:  -The Dodgers extended their winning streak to 10 games for the team’s second-longest winning streak during the team’s Bricktown era (since 1998). The Dodgers now have their longest winning streak since a team-record 12-game inning streak July 26-Aug. 6, 2013.  -The Dodgers improved their Pacific Coast League-leading record to 32-11 and OKC’s 32 wins are the most by an OKC team through 43 games since 1998. OKC has now won 11 of the last 12 games and are a season-best 21 games above .500.  -The six runs scored in the bottom of the fourth inning by the Dodgers tied the most runs they have scored in an inning this season — April 23 in Albuquerque when they scored six runs in the sixth inning.  -The Dodgers have now trailed at some point in 22 of their 32 total victories this season, as well as in each of their last five wins and in 12 of their last 14 wins…OKC is now 19-2 in games decided by one or two runs this season, including a 13-1 record in one-run games.  -Michael Busch, Yonny Hernández and Justin Yurchak all finished with multi-hit games. Busch recorded OKC’s lone extra-base hit with a double. Ryan Ward led OKC with two RBI and Drew Avans scored two runs.  -The Dodgers bullpen has now allowed just three runs and 20 hits in 54.0 innings over the last 13 games, holding opponents 20-for-172 (.116) with 61 strikeouts. The unit has allowed just one run over 34.1 innings going back to the start of the previous series in Round Rock (10 games).  -The Dodgers took a 4-0 lead in their series against the Space Cowboys and have won the first four games of a series for the fourth time this season.  -Dodgers players and coaches wore special retro OKC 89ers jerseys and hats in recognition of the franchise’s pre-Bricktown history and the game atmosphere and entertainment had a throwback feel. The 89ers played at All Sports Stadium from 1962-97 and won four league titles before the franchise relocated to Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in 1998.

"game","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T03:58:37","Friday’s Game Report: Dodgers 5, Cardinals 0  By Rob Rains  Anytime more proof is needed that baseball is a game of inches, just pop in the tape of the Cardinals’ half of the sixth inning from Friday night’s game at Busch Stadium.  They trailed the Dodgers 1-0 when Paul Goldschmidt led off the inning with a smash headed for the top of the wall in right center – but James Outman timed his jump perfectly and caught the ball, robbing Goldschmidt of a game-tying home run.  Following a single by Nolan Gorman, Nolan Arenado hit a ball that looked like it was going into the left field corner – before landing about an inch outside the foul line. Arenado then grounded into an inning-ending double play.  So instead of tying the game or perhaps taking the lead, which might have altered their pitching strategy for the final three innings, the Cardinals still were down 1-0 – and the Dodgers went on to win the game after adding four runs in the eighth, three coming on a home run by Mookie Betts off Chris Stratton.  The loss was only the third for the Cardinals in their last 12 games.  Here is how Friday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: One night after hitting seven home runs and scoring 16 runs, the Cardinals were held to just two hits – a first-inning single by Arenado and the single by Gorman, which extended his hitting streak to 10 games … Goldschmidt drew three walks for the second consecutive game … Gorman struck out in his other three at-bats … The Cardinals had just four at-bats with a runner scoring position, going 0-of-4 … Their two hits were a season-low, and they were shut out for the fifth time in their 46 games.  On the mound: The only run allowed by starter Steven Matz in five innings was unearned because of a throwing error by Arenado in the fifth. A two-out walk and a balk moved Betts to third before he scored on a double by Chris Taylor … Andre Pallante stranded the two runners and worked a 1-2-3 sixth … Jordan Hicks pitched around a walk and a hit batter in the seventh but Stratton allowed a leadoff single and a two-out walk in the eighth before giving up the home run to Betts.  Key stat: Matz fell to 0-5 on the season in his nine starts. He has won only one of his last 14 starts, dating back to May 7 of last year.  Worth noting: After having to leave Thursday night’s game following an outfield collision with Lars Nootbaar, Tommy Edman was out of the starting lineup but did enter the game as a pinch-hitter in the eighth.

Dale Mitchell Park.With the loss, the 10-ranked Cowboys fell to 36-16 overall and are now tied for second in the Big 12 standings with Texas at 14-9, one game behind West Virginia heading into Saturday's regular season finale, which is scheduled for a 4 p.m. first pitch.The Mountaineers clinched at least a share of the league title with OSU's loss. For the Cowboys to claim a championship, they would need to beat OU Saturday and have WVU lose to Texas – in that scenario, OSU, West Virginia and Texas would all share the conference crown.OU (30-23, 11-12) rode the left arm of Braden Carmichael to the win as he allowed just four hits in a complete game effort and shut out the Cowboys for only the second time this season. In doing so, he improved to 7-0 on the year.took the loss as the right-hander allowed four runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out nine and issued five walks.Watts-Brown did become the 16Cowboy pitcher to record 100 strikeouts in a season, a feat that has been achieved just 20 times in program history; he now has 108 strikeouts on the year, the 13most in a season in OSU history.After 3 ½ scoreless innings, OU got on the scoreboard in the fourth. Following a one-out single by Dakota Harris, Watts-Brown struck out Kendall Pettis. But the next batter walked, and Easton Carmichael then stepped to the plate and delivered a two-RBI double down the left-field line.The Sooners added to their lead in the fifth when a triple by Anthony Mackenzie brought home a run to make the score 3-0 before a wild pitch plated another to push the advantage to four.OSU had chances in the middle innings, getting back-to-back singles with two outs in the fifth before a fielder's choice ended the threat. In the sixth, the first two Cowboys reached safely on a base hit and a hit by pitch, but a fielder's choice and a double play kept them off the scoreboard.OU's final run came in the seventh on an infield single.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vb2tzdGF0ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTkvY293Ym95LWJhc2ViYWxsLWRyb3BzLWdhbWUtdHdvLW9mLWJlZGxhbS1zZXJpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","1938-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:23:19","The Town of Light  Mental Health Awareness Week this year runs from May 15-22, and we've spent this week so far showcasing games that explore themes of mental illness and wellness. Our coverage has included my own story about games and mental health, a look at Will O'Neill's Actual Sunlight, Eli Piilonen's Fixation and The Company of Myself, and Matt Gilgenbach's Neverending Nightmares. Today, we're looking at LKA's The Town of Light, a psychological thriller set in 1938 about a 16-year-old institutionalized in a mental health facility with dire conditions. By sidestepping tired stereotypes and tropes, The Town of Light instead leverages reality to paint its survival horror story.  CONTENT WARNING: This article explores themes of abuse, rape, and archaic psychiatric treatment  The Town of Light  EXPANDING HORIZONS  Neverending Nightmares  This terrifying horror game about OCD helped me understand conditions different to my own  If you've even a passing interest in survival horror, I'd wager you've played at least one horror game that unfolds in an asylum. From Silent Hill to Outlast, Alan Wake, Until Dawn, and Dead Space 2, to name just some of the games that visit mental institutions, asylums feature heavily in the genre with almost always harmful effects. Patients within these settings are almost always angry, crazed, and out to get the player. They've often lost touch with reality, and are used as pawns to be slaughtered on the protagonist's path to success. And, by way of all of this, mental illness is viewed in the most negative of lights.  Games are less guilty of pandering to these ill-informed stereotypes today, but they still persist in many spaces. LKA's 2016 slept-on gem, The Town of Light, however, takes us to an asylum, tells a horrifying tale, but never once panders to misguided tropes. As mentioned above, the story follows 16-year-old Renée who has been institutionalized in the Volterra asylum, southwest of Florence in Italy. By virtue of flashbacks driven by diary entries strewn around the game's lonely corridors, examination rooms, and isolation chambers – all of which are modeled on the still-standing, real-life Volterra building – players learn the harrowing tale of how Renée wound up here, and, crucially, why it's now so difficult for her to leave.  Story continues  Described as a ""danger to herself and others,"" Renée spends much of her life held against her will, while continuously clashing with orderlies, nurses, and doctors, both mentally and physically. One particularly distressing scene takes place in a changing room where patients have been stripped naked and left in the cold. One internee is seen screaming while lying on her side cowering beneath a wooden bench. Another scene sees Renée being forcibly given electroshock therapy, which the devs researched by watching live videos of inpatients going through the same barbaric procedure. One scene depicts Renée being raped.  It's in these moments where LKA's meticulous attention to detail accentuates the horror of its premise and setting. Renée's narrative is fictitious, yet was wholly inspired by reality. And while the vast majority of horror games take place beneath the cover of darkness, The Town of Light is set in the afternoon, where interminable beams of sunlight split the institution's vacuous, cobweb-covered floors. It's haunting, often upsetting, but always thought-provoking. Not every horror game can be like The Town of Light, but that's exactly what makes it so noteworthy.  The Town of Light is out now on PC via Steam, PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch.  Check out these 10 games to help kickstart conversations about mental health","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vaG9ycm9yLWdhbWVzLXRlcnJpZnktd2l0aG91dC10cm9wZXMtMTQyMzE5MjM1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:31:48","Sci-fi horror is all the rage these days, with Scorn, SIGNALIS, The Callisto Protocol and the upcoming Greyhill Incident all capitalizing on the voguish trend. Even Dead Space (a franchise that was driven into the ground by its own publisher and forced into complete dormancy for almost a decade) has managed to make itself relevant again.  Always with its finger on the pulse, Dead by Daylight is looking to get in on the action next with its Chapter 28 DLC. This imminent expansion — which is scheduled for release on DbD’s copper anniversary — will see the multiplayer game take to the stars and promises to really shake things up with fresh content that’s unlike anything they’ve ever done before.  And what better way is there to celebrate 7 years of asymmetrical bloodshed than to go intergalactic? After all, crossing that final frontier is pretty much the crowing achievement of any slasher franchise that has legs.  If you can keep the money rolling in for long enough, then you eventually get to go to space. Those are just the rules. It was only a matter of time then, before Dead by Daylight followed in the footsteps of Hellraiser, Friday the 13th and Leprechaun before it and ditched the confines of Planet Earth.  Bringing a lot to the table, Chapter 28 will introduce an original map, an additional survivor and a totally unique killer. To learn more about what’s waiting for us in the farthest reaches of the cosmos, we attended a recent press conference hosted by developer Behaviour Interactive.  Here, we gained a deeper insight into the DLC’s alien environments and discovered what makes the new “Singularity” character such a distinctly menacing opponent.  The Year Ahead…  Before we got stuck into Chapter 28 (titled End Transmission), we were walked through the content roadmap for the next twelve months.  Fans will be pleased to hear that they are going to be treated to a whopping six major updates this year, the first of which is obviously End Transmission.  After this, there will then be three more fully-fledged chapters (adding both licenced and original characters to the roster), as well as two smaller updates that are billed as “survivor-only” DLCs.  In terms of chronology, the breakdown for 2023/24 is as follows:  1st: End Transmission  2nd: Nicolas Cage Chapter (Survivor Only)  3rd: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  4th: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  5th: Survivor Only Chapter  6th: Original Chapter with Killer + Survivor  Alongside all of this, various quality- of-life improvements will also be rolled out throughout the year.  An anti-camping system will be implemented to promote good sportsmanship and to discourage cheap tactics, while a new search-bar function will enable players to navigate their sprawling inventories with greater ease.  Most exciting of all, however, is the introduction of “survivor disconnect bots.” Swooping in whenever a sore loser rage quits or somebody encounters crippling network issues, these A.I.-controlled teammates will fill the vacancy left behind. They might not be flawless substitutes for your fellow human players, but they will at least ensure that matches can continue in some form if the lobby starts to dwindle for whatever reason.  The Perfect Lifeform…  Speaking of Artificial Intelligence — and the implications of it one day replacing us — it turns out that this will actually be the main theme of the latest DLC.  While many in the DbD community were understandably hoping for an Alien chapter (with a playable Xenomorph), the game’s first foray into sci-fi horror is a wholly original affair instead. That being said, the ideas that it will be tapping into ought to be instantly familiar to anyone whose seen movies like The Terminator, Westworld or Richard Stanley’s Hardware.  Set in the distant future, the basic premise of End Transmission is that a group of human settlers have arrived on a strange, exotic world. Hoping to colonise it for the sake of mankind, they dispatch a state-of-the-art A.I. to scout out this foreign terrain and identify any potential hazards.  Unfortunately, the servile android ends up learning a little too much on its reconnaissance mission and starts to wonder why it should be taking orders from these fragile meatbags in the first place. No prizes for guessing what happens next.  As A.I. is wont to do, the machine inevitably comes to the conclusion that humans are just a waste of oxygen and decides to overthrow its masters, picking them off one by one. By the time the DLC opens, this purge is nearing completion and only a single member of the crew is still breathing.  The ensuing confrontation between Gabriel Soma (the chapter’s new survivor) and The Singularity (the chapter’s new killer) forms the central crux of End Transmission. A teaser trailer sets the adversarial dynamic up nicely, pairing cinematic footage with some Kyle Reese-esque narration from Gabriel.  As he dashes through an alien rainforest, the terrified astro-engineer lays out everything that you need to know about his cybernetic tormenter: “It became self-aware. It has no empathy. It doesn’t feel pain. It learns at an impossible rate and it won’t stop until we are dead. Or worse.”  If you are wondering what fate he could possibly be alluding to here that’s worse than being hacked to pieces by a homicidal robot, Dead by Daylight’s Creative Director, Dave Richard, was able to clear things up. Speaking about The Singularity’s ghoulish M.O., he said: “While it was scouting for potential dangers on this uncharted world, [The Singularity] made contact with old alien technology and was subsequently enlightened.”  Having had a profound revelation of some kind, it now single-mindedly strives to grow and amass even more power. It does this by assimilating other pieces of machinery as well as organic material, in the hope that it will eventually become “the perfect lifeform.”  Richard continued: “This killer is an interesting take on the idea of a cyborg. We’re used to seeing human characters [augment] themselves with technology in science fiction, but The Singularity is doing everything in reverse. It’s a piece of software that’s decided to fuse with human flesh in order to increase its strength and mobility. It’s on a quest to assimilate every living being in the universe.”  The end result is a grotesque amalgamation of synthetic components and viscera. On the subject of its appearance, you’re never going to have an iteration of The Singularity that’s entirely pure (one way or the other), but you will be able to modify its look through various cosmetic options.  According to Richard, there will be different skins to choose from here, with some emphasising the more robotic qualities of the killer, while others suggest that it is being slowly mutated by the planet’s eerie flora and fauna.  As for how it plays, The Singularity has the ability to deploy gelatinous sacs around the environment. Known as “bio-pods,” these can stick to almost any surface and are used as a kind of body-horror version of CCTV.  Richard explained: “They allow the killer to project its consciousness elsewhere. By strategically placing these pods, [Singularity players] can spy on survivors and even spew projectiles at them. We call that last part ‘The Slipstream Effect’. When a survivor is hit with a Slipstream, The Singularity can then teleport to their location and immediately attack.  “To [counterbalance] this, survivors will have access to a brand-new special item; the EMP. This will be peppered in chests around the map whenever you face off against The Singularity and can temporarily disable its bio-pods and even [negate] the Slipstream Effect.”  A Long Way From Home…  Alongside the killer and survivor characters, End Transmission will also introduce a new arena into Dead by Daylight’s map rotation. That being the aforementioned jungle planet where Gabriel’s and his crewmates sealed their collective fates.  Describing this inhospitable environment, Richard said: “Toba Landing is an obscure and foreign place. Its dangerous flora, fauna and structure are unlike anything that can be found on Earth. So it will be very different for our players.”  “There were several big themes that we wanted to explore when designing this realm. First of all, it was important that it’s clearly an alien world. We wanted the player to feel as though they are far from home and lost in space.”  Elaborating upon how they pulled off this vibe, he continued: “We took inspiration from the weirdest things that we could find in real-world nature and then modified them further to make it all feel even less familiar. We also added hints of a long-lost alien civilisation throughout, as a reminder that even powerful civilisations like ours can disappear and be forgotten.”  Rest assured that there will be some recognisable elements in Toba Landing, however, as Richard confirmed that all of the staple Dead by Daylight assets will remain intact. He clarified: “Our lore permits that palettes, hooks and generators can all exist within this futuristic sci-fi universe.  “The Entity creates them so that they can be distributed across all of the different Omniverse realms for its trials. So those things do look the same for gameplay purposes. That way players can quickly identify them and get on with the match.”  END TRANSMISSION will be coming to Dead by Daylight on the 13th of June and will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5LWRpc2d1c3RpbmcuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzM3NjI4ODEvY2hlY2stb3V0LXRoZS1wcm90b3R5cGUtZm9yLWJvZHljYW0taG9ycm9yLWdhbWUtZGVwcGFydC12aWRlby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Events from Microsoft, Ubisoft, and other companies will follow in June and beyond. Naturally, not everything stays a secret. In this post, we're rounding up some of the leaks and rumors we've come across so far.  We will keep updating this story over time and will add more information as it comes to light. Bear in mind, too, that we have not been able to independently confirm these rumors, so be sure to take all of this information with a grain of salt for the time being.  One of the rumors previously reported on, a new Mortal Kombat game, was officially confirmed this week as Mortal Kombat 1. The game launches this September.  For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of the 2023 summer gaming shows. For what it's worth, Nintendo is attending Gamescom this August--and it might be the perfect place for some Nintendo news (but nothing is confirmed at this stage).  Summer Game Show Rumors  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3  Activision has already confirmed that a new Call of Duty game is coming this year, but what is it? And when will it be announced? According to reports, 2023's new Call of Duty game is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, with development led by Sledgehammer.  The game is rumored to launch in November, with multiple beta periods and a campaign early access release coming before the official launch date. It's believed to have multiplayer, campaign, and Zombies. A report said Activision might reveal the game in August, potentially via an in-game teaser campaign in Warzone 2.0. Historically, Call of Duty games have been announced in May, but the playbook very well may have changed this time.  Konami's Metal Gear, Silent Hill, and Castlevania  According to a report from VGC, Konami is gearing up for some ""pretty big"" reveals this summer during the time that was going to be occupied by E3 before the show was canceled. What's on tap? The report suggests the long-rumored Metal Gear Solid 3 and a Snake Eater revival could be announced.  Konami might have a new Castlevania to announce this summer, reports have suggested, while Konami's Silent Hill is confirmed to be coming back with at least three games: Silent Hill: Ascension, Silent Hill: Downfall, and Silent Hill: F. There is also a Silent Hill 2 remake in the works. Could we see more of these games this summer? We sure hope so.  Spider-Man 2 Coming This September?  The PlayStation Showcase coming up on May 24 will focus on PS5 games, and with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 poised to be one of Sony's biggest games of the year, we'd expect it will get some attention. The latest rumor is that it will launch this September, and the PlayStation Showcase could be a venue for a release date announcement.  Persona 3 Remake  Another rumor for this year is that Atlus will announce a Persona 3 remake during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. The game has reportedly been in development for several years already, and it could finally be formally announced this year.  Next-Gen Switch  According to reports that have been circulating for some time, Nintendo might be working on a new, more powerful console. Details are thin at the moment, but one research firm believes the new console might launch near the end of 2024. Nintendo rarely, if ever, comments on future hardware plans, but the company has confirmed it has no new hardware coming until April 2024 at the soonest.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lMy1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXJ1bW9ycy1sZWFrcy8xMTAwLTY1MTQzODIv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2FtcC1hcnRpY2xlcy9lMy1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXJ1bW9ycy1sZWFrcy8xMTAwLTY1MTQzODIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Friday's loss to Kennesaw State officially put the Eagles (38-16, 20-9 ASUN) out of contention of earning at least a share of the ASUN Conference regular season title. FGCU will now aim for No. 2 overall seed for the upcoming ASUN Championship as Lipscomb walked-off Jacksonville State 6-5 to clinch the regular season championship.  ""I expected more out of us than what we showed tonight,"" said FGCU baseball head coach Dave Tollett . ""We will regroup and come out on Saturday to get this bad taste out of our mouths.""  A 45-minute weather delay to begin the night did not appear to faze FGCU early, soaring out to a 2-0 lead courtesy of RBI singles by both senior Joe Kinker (North Port, Fla./Venice HS) and senior Alejandro Figueredo (Sucre, Venezuela/West Oaks HS/Seminole State). Kinker missed out on notching his 18th home run of the season by inches, settling for the RBI single off the top half of the right-field wall.  KSU battled to grab its first lead of the contest in the fifth, 3-2. The first three Owls runs were spotted by an FGCU balk, a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly.  In the bottom of the same inning, senior Stephen Wilmer's (Sarasota, Fla./Riverview HS/Pasco-Hernando State/ECU) stand-up triple plated the tying and go-ahead run for the Eagles, giving the FGCU back the lead 5-3.  The lead would be short lived as Kennesaw State cut the deficit to one with a sixth-inning solo shot and reclaimed the lead once-and-for-all in the seventh - utilizing a 3-run frame for a 7-5 advantage.  The Owls battered the FGCU pitching staff for 16 hits and began to finish off the Eagles with a 3-run blast in the eighth inning. KSU scored at least one run in the final six innings to reach its double-digit mark of 14, highlighted by a five-run eighth.  Seven of KSU's 14 runs were scored in the final three frames. Jamarie Brooks had the Eagles number Friday, going a perfect 4-for-4 with four RBIs.  FGCU produced 10 hits but failed to record a home run for just the eighth time this season.

Lexi Orozco led the offense with a 3-for-3 effort, driving in a run and scoring once. Joley Mitchell added a 2-for-4 performance with two doubles and scored twice. Karina Gaskins added an RBI double, with Mickey Winchell tallying a single. Jane Kronenberger stepped in off the bench to drive in a pair in the sixth inning.  How It Happened  Notre Dame didn’t waste any time getting on the board, scoring a run in the top of the first inning. Mitchell doubled to left center and moved up when the Oregon center fielder robbed Gaskins of a home run at the wall in left center. Orozco turned on an inside pitch for a single down the third baseline to bring in Mitchell and put the Irish up 1-0.  The Ducks rallied for five runs in the bottom of the second.

It looked like it would be a laugher in favor of the visiting team for a bit and then took several turns before ending in dramatic fashion.  The biggest eye-catching detail of this one would be how it finished. Francisco Lindor came through with a walk-off single.  Remember, Lindor spent six seasons in Cleveland and made quite a mark. He was a four-time All-Star, finishing in the top 10 of MVP voting three times. He played on three playoff teams, including the 2016 AL pennant winner and the 2017 team that won 102 games. He was traded to the Mets prior to the 2021 season and hadn't yet faced his old squad, now named the Guardians.  As such, in and of itself, Lindor's game-winner was worth a mention.  There was so much leading up to that, though.  The Guardians had a 5-0 lead heading to the bottom of the fifth inning. The Mets chipped away with three runs in the next two innings (including homers from Francisco Alvarez and Brett Baty). The Guardians would get two back in the top of the seventh, though, making it 7-3 at the stretch.  And then Pete Alonso tied it with a grand slam in the bottom of the seventh.  The game would head to the 10th with that 7-7 tie. Gabriel Arias hit a two-run homer for the Guardians to give them a 9-7 lead, but the Mets rallied for their three runs with one out.  The Mets have now won three straight to climb back to .500 at 23-23.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vbWxiL25ld3MvbWV0cy1mcmFuY2lzY28tbGluZG9yLXdhbGtzLWl0LW9mZi1pbi1maXJzdC1nYW1lLWFnYWluc3QtZ3VhcmRpYW5zLWluLXdpbGQtY29tZWJhY2std2luL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Really special, great effort, great execution. He battled through a little bit of a mess early, and defensively we came up clutch.""Long's success started thanks to his ability to work through traffic in the early innings without ever allowing much damage.

Things were not easy, but the Dolphins made the plays again when they needed them. The first batter reached on an error, the lone miscue of the night for JU defensively.

"game","2019-03-15","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:08:23","SAN DIEGO – Tristin Lively finished what he started on Friday night at Tony Gwynn Stadium, authoring his first collegiate complete game in his final career start in New Mexico’s 4-3 Mountain West Conference defeat against host San Diego State.  The fifth-year senior right-hander threw a career-high 120 pitches in his final turn in a Lobo uniform, finishing a memorable career with one of his grittiest efforts since debuting in the spring of 2019. In his eight innings pitched Friday, Lively allowed four runs on seven hits, with four strikeouts and a pair of walks.  Both teams were finished scoring by the end of the fifth inning, as Lively traded zeros with the San Diego State pitching staff for the remainder of the game. The Lobo offense managed just one baserunner over the final four innings, as the Aztecs backed a strong start by TJ Fondtain to secure the win.  SDSU improved to 23-28 overall on the season and 17-11 in conference play, moving into first place in the Mountain West standings with one game left on the regular-season schedule. The Lobos slipped to 26-24 and 13-16 in conference games.  Justin Olson hit his 13th home run of the season and was 2-for-4, and Sean Stephens turned in his second straight two-hit game while making five catches in center field. The Lobos were limited to just seven hits for the second night in-a-row, and struck out 13 times while leaving five runners on base.  Poncho Ruiz went 3-for-3 with two RBIs to lead the SDSU offense, which also managed just seven hits against Lively. Fondtain allowed three runs on six hits with nine strikeouts and one walk in six innings of work, before turning the ball over to four relievers to finish the game. Kelena Sauer earned his team-leading 12th save of the year, retiring the Lobos in order in the ninth.  The Aztecs got on the board first, when Shaun Montoya led off the first with a single and worked his way around the bases eventually scoring on a sacrifice fly by Ruiz.  The Lobos got the run back in the top of the second, which started with a ringing double off the wall by Reed Spenrath. Olson singled to put runners on the corners, and Konner Kinkade made the score 1-1 with an RBI-single.  Lively settled into a groove, retiring 8 of 9 hitters after Montoya’s leadoff single and putting up zeros in the second and third innings. After a leadoff walk drawn by Kyle Smith in the top of the fourth, Olson unloaded his 13th home run of the season with a loud line drive over the fence in right to make the score 3-1.  Ruiz and Fondtain hit back-to-back doubles to start the fourth, and an ensuing RBI-single from Xavier Gonzalez pulled the game even at 3-3. A leadoff walk in the fifth came back to sting Lively, as Charlie Rhee came around to score on a pop-up double by Ruiz that landed near the right-field foul line.  The bloop hit proved to be the final run-scoring at-bat of the game for either team, as both offenses struggled to generate momentum in the late innings. Lively allowed just two singles across his final three innings of work, pitching well to contact and receiving strong support from his defense. Kinkade fielded a ball on the left side of second base and threw across his body on the run to get Gonzalez by half a step and take away a hit. Devon Dixon then helped negate an eighth-inning single by Ruiz, snagging a line drive off the bat of Fondtain and firing a laser of a throw to first in time to double off the runner.  Lively’s final career out was a routine fly ball off the bat of Cade Miller to Stephens in center, as the senior from Las Cruces completed the gutsy performance. It was the first complete game of the season by a Lobo pitcher, and it was the third time this year that Lively went at least eight innings in a game.  Overall in his five seasons as a Lobo, Lively pitched in 43 games making 36 starts, while logging 178 1/3 innings and striking out 159 hitters. Lively recorded a dozen wins in his collegiate career, including six in 2023 which was far and away his best season. Lively had career highs of 77 1/3 innings pitched, 62 strikeouts, and 13 starts in his final spring with the Lobos.  LOBO NOTES: New Mexico is now 84-131 all-time against SDSU and is 37-72 in games played in San Diego…the Aztecs lead the season series between the teams 5-0…Olson’s home run was the 24th of his collegiate career and his 17th in a Lobo uniform…it was the Lobos’ 86th home run of the season, breaking a tie with the 1999 team for the third-most in UNM single-season history…Ashby’s double was the 60th of his collegiate career.

The Tigers, who improved to 47-9, finished with home runs from Caroline Jacobsen, Alia Logoleo, Reedy Davenport and Maddie Moore to help propel them to the win.  The Tigers’ bats came alive early, as Clemson sent 11 batters to the plate in the bottom of the first. Following a McKenzie Clark single to left field, UNCG intentionally walked Valerie Cagle to put two on with one out. Jacobsen jumped on the opportunity to send a three-run shot out of left center, then Logoleo followed by driving the second pitch of her at bat out to dead center, giving Clemson a 4-0 lead.  Action didn’t slow down on the offensive side for the Tigers as Aby Vieira, who returned to the lineup for the first time since April 11, drew a walk, and JoJo Hyatt brought her home with a double into deep right center. In an attempt to get Vieira going home, Hyatt advanced to third. Where Hyatt was on the bases didn’t seem to matter as Davenport sent the seventh pitch she saw out of left center to push the Tigers ahead 7-0.  The Spartans answered with a single run in the top of the second, but Clemson bounced back with two additional runs. Jacobsen reached on a fielder’s choice, Logoleo singled up the middle, and Moore loaded the bases with a walk to bring Vieira back to the plate. Hitting a ground ball through the right side plated both Jacobsen and Logoleo and credited Vieira with a double to make it 9-1.  The momentum continued in the third as Ally Miklesh reached on a fielder’s choice and Cagle drew her third walk of the day. Jacobsen doubled to right center to score both. Two batters later, Moore joined the home run party with a two-run shot out of center to make it 13-1.  Bringing pinch hitters into the lineup, Arielle Oda led off the bottom of the fourth with a walk, and Abi Stuart singled through the left side to put two on. A single by Cagle scored Oda. Jacobsen added her third hit of the game with a single at the pitcher, and Logoleo drew a bases loaded walk to tack on another run. Moore rounded out the scoring for the Tigers with a single to center that plated Sarah Howell, who was running for Cagle, and Jacobsen to make it 17-1.  UNCG scored one more run in the top of the fifth, but Clemson shut things down to take the opening game, 17-2.  Junior Millie Thompson earned her 14th win in the circle pitching three innings with three strikeouts. Sophomore Brooke McCubbin pitched the final two frames with one strikeout.

"game","2023-05-19","14:00:00","{""China"", ""NuevoLeon"", ""Mexico""}","2023-05-19T21:51:35","Microsoft said Friday that China has unconditionally approved its plan to buy video game company Activision Blizzard even as the deal still faces antitrust opposition in the U.S. and United Kingdom  Microsoft said Friday that China has unconditionally approved its plan to buy video game company Activision Blizzard, even as the deal still faces antitrust opposition in the U.S. and United Kingdom.  China’s approval is complicated by the fact that Activision Blizzard stopped offering many of its games in mainland China earlier this year because of a dispute with its local publishing partner.  China and the European Union are the two biggest economies to have approved Microsoft's planned $69 billion takeover of the California game publisher behind popular titles such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush.  European regulators representing the 27-nation bloc approved the deal Monday on condition that Microsoft make some promises meant to boost competition in the emerging cloud-based gaming market.  China’s State Administration for Market Regulation cleared it without conditions, according to Microsoft, though as of late Friday the agency's website didn't mention the decision.  Game sales in mainland China come with a requirement that game-makers work with a Chinese publisher to release titles in the country. And since earlier this year, popular Activision Blizzard franchises such as World of Warcraft, the StarCraft series, Overwatch and Diablo have been suspended because of a disagreement between Activision subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment and its Chinese partner, NetEase.  Blizzard had a longstanding partnership with NetEase dating to 2008, which helped the latter company grow to become China’s second-largest games distributor after local rival Tencent.  But the U.S. company said late last year it would suspend most of its game services in China after current licensing agreements ended, leading to a public spat between the two companies.  Microsoft says its planned Activision acquisition — considered the priciest tech deal in history — now has been cleared in 37 countries, which includes the 27 in the EU as well as 10 others such as China, Japan and Brazil. But the blockbuster deal is still in jeopardy because British regulators have rejected it and U.S. authorities are trying to thwart it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lyZVN0b3J5L21pY3Jvc29mdC1jaGluYS1hcHByb3Zlcy1wbGFuLWJ1eS12aWRlby1nYW1lLW1ha2VyLTk5NDY5MTk50gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lyZVN0b3J5L21pY3Jvc29mdC1jaGluYS1hcHByb3Zlcy1wbGFuLWJ1eS12aWRlby1nYW1lLW1ha2VyLTk5NDY5MTk5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","1911-10-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T00:30:25","With a franchise like Grand Theft Auto under its belt, it is hard to imagine Rockstar Games needing to deliver other medium-defining titles. Yet that is what the studio does. Dabbling in every genre from noir to high school comedy, Rockstar always manages to craft a unique experience that, more often than not, shapes the video game industry for years to come. But in a catalog of critically-acclaimed and commercially successful titles, 2010’s Red Dead Redemption stands out as the pinnacle of what the company can offer. Not only is it a mechanical marvel for its living world, but it is one of the best-executed narratives in gaming even after 13 years.  Just like every other title in Rockstar’s catalog, Red Dead Redemption can be easily summed up with a simple descriptor: it’s the cowboy game. Just like L.A. Noire is the detective game, GTA is the crime game, and Bully is the ... bully game. All of these are accurate but lack the depth of the games themselves. When it comes to Red Dead Redemption, the cowboy element goes far beyond letting players live their West World-esque fantasies of a consequence less frontier.  John Marston is a man under the thumb of the law. Rockstar Games  Instead, Read Dead Redemption is a deconstruction of the mythologized American West and the idyllic picture of a cowboy. A brutal story of a world defined by the cruelty and betrayal within it, people take more than they need and pay for everything in blood. Players take the role of John Marston, a man who lived by these rules until they caught up with him. Formerly a member of the Van der Linde Gang, Marston got out to live a quiet life with his family. That is until government agents kidnap and blackmail him into hunting down and murdering the remaining members of his old gang.  The player is let loose in a sprawling open world and tasked with killing off each former acquaintance of Marston’s. Combat is fast-paced and violent. Bullets do the talking, and Marston can talk faster than most. So, he keeps on livin’. Despite the perceived freedom that the traditional Rockstar open world offers, Red Dead Redemption makes the player feel like there is a chain around their leg all the time. The government knows how to find you, and how to punish you if they can’t. You are their attack dog.  1911, when Red Dead Redemption takes place, is a time when men like the former Van der Linde Gang members were already out of time. The Old West was over as American industrialization swept through the country. Men were no longer able to live free at the expense of others. This is not a world of the golden age cowboy; it is a world that wants people like Marston gone. That is unless the government has a use for them.  Marston is only ever a tool used to enact the violent will of those holding the reins of his leash. Dutch Van der Linde used him to gain notoriety and wealth as an outlaw which put him on the wrong side of the law. The law is willing to ignore those past indecencies so they can similarly use Marston to do their dirty work. In Red Dead Redemption, Marston helps snuff out the last remnants of a version of the West that the government could not control. Which means it has to go by any means necessary.  It’s the end of the line, partner. Rockstar Games  It's a brutal and depressing narrative, one that seems to run counter to the cheeky crime simulation of Grand Theft Auto. But both titles, as well as L.A. Noire, act as skillful analyses of moments in history that have been mythologized as part of larger American legends. GTA is a parody of the fallacy of the American Dream, L.A. Noire deals with the dream of honorable police and the glamor of the 1940s. Red Dead Redemption is a sobering portrayal of American expansion written in blood red at the cost of numerous lives.  One character Marston can meet while roaming the hills and valleys of the world is the Strange Man. He knows Marston, despite Marston not knowing him, and is widely accepted to be an omen of bad things to come — perhaps a representation of death himself. But not just for Marston. He represents the death of the West as a concept, the end of an era that requires those who can’t live in the next era to die as well.  Red Dead Redemption’s power lies in how it utilizes the open world of a Rockstar game and incrementally removes power from the player. This is not a world they control. The West was never free. It’s an astounding achievement of storytelling that remains the pinnacle of what Rockstar can accomplish.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2dhbWluZy9yZWQtZGVhZC1yZWRlbXB0aW9uLTEzdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktcm9ja3N0YXItYmVzdC1nYW1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It took until 19:47 of the fourth overtime period for the Florida Panthers to earn the 3-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.  During NHL regular-season games, a five-minute 3-on-3 overtime period is played; if no team scores, it goes to a shootout. But in the playoffs, it's repeated 20-minute periods of sudden death until a goal is scored.  Will the Panthers-Hurricanes marathon result in any players getting a rest for Game 2? Not likely.  ""I've got a 38-year-old in the back end,"" Canes coach Rod Brind'Amour said of defenseman Brent Burns, who played over 54 minutes in Game 1, per ESPN's Greg Wyshynski. ""Maybe I shouldn't go to him [in Game 2]. But I can tell you right now that if I confronted him, he would punch me in the face. This is why they play the games. To get in these moments. So I guess that answers [the question] for the rest of the guys, too.""  Nevertheless, Thursday's marathon contest was not the longest playoff overtime game in NHL history. The 79 minutes, 47 seconds of extra game time was the sixth highest in the league's more than 100 years. Courtesy of ESPN Stats & Information research, here's a rundown of the five games that were even longer:  1936: Detroit Red Wings 1, Montreal Maroons 0  Overtime periods: 6  Extra game time: 116:30  The wonderfully named Mud Bruneteau finally scored at 16:30 of overtime No. 6 to break the tie with Montreal in Game 1 of the best-of-five Stanley Cup semifinal series. Per NHL.com, Red Wings goalie Normie Smith lost 12 pounds of body weight during the game and made 92 saves to earn the W. The Red Wings would win the Stanley Cup Final that year against the Toronto Maple Leafs.  Overtime periods: 6  Extra game time: 104:46  It was another Stanley Cup semifinal best-of-five matchup here and the NHL's first true marathon game. Ken Doraty was the hero of this one, and as it was Game 5 of the series, this was a series clincher as well.

Overtime periods: 5  Extra game time: 92:01  The Keystone State rivals have played many an epic playoff game, and this one was nearly two extra games of hockey for fans in attendance. Keith Primeau ended the festivities at 12:01 of the fifth overtime, tying their Eastern Conference semifinal series 2-2. The full game is available on YouTube; bring some snacks, the runtime is 5:22:54. Philly would win this series 4-2 but lose to the eventual Cup-winning New Jersey Devils 4-3 in the Eastern Conference finals.  Overtime periods: 5  Extra game time: 90:27  During the NHL's ""bubble"" Stanley Cup playoffs in 2020, many things seemed like an illusion. The amount of time on ice for the Lightning and Blue Jackets in this game's box score is one of them. Often cited as one of the times that NHL officials ""swallowed their whistles"" in OT, there were 14 total penalty minutes in this game. No matter, as Lightning center Brayden Point scored the game-winning goal at 10:27 at even strength, giving the Lightning the 1-0 series lead even though it felt like this one should've counted extra.

"game","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:37:00","Brett Howden collects the rebound and finds the back of the net in overtime as the Golden Knights take Game 1 vs. the Stars. (0:53)  LAS VEGAS -- Brett Howden's game-winning goal less than two minutes into overtime gave the Vegas Golden Knights a 4-3 win Friday night against the Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.  The sequence that led to the Golden Knights taking a 1-0 series lead was just as quick as overtime itself.  Chandler Stephenson carried possession into the Stars' zone before playing a centering pass to Mark Stone. He then fed an instant backhanded pass to Howden, who was left alone at the net front. Howden's initial shot went wide, but he recovered the rebound off the boards and fired a shot beneath the goal line that he banked off Jake Oettinger for the win.  ""I just tried throwing it in there and got lucky that it went in,"" Howden said. ""I think Oettinger put it in himself. I was just trying to throw it in there and see what would happen.""  Howden's goal is the latest in a narrative that has come to define the Golden Knights during these playoffs: They're a team that can get goals from their entire lineup. The Golden Knights have had 14 different players score goals these playoffs, equaling the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers (the Stars lead the way with 15).  Stars winger Jason Robertson, who did not score in the second round against the Seattle Kraken, staked his team to a 1-0 lead with less than 90 seconds remaining in the first period from a deflection off a shot from Roope Hintz.  Golden Knights center William Karlsson tied it at 1 in the second period before giving the Golden Knights a 2-1 lead just 1:19 into the third period. Both of Karlsson's goals were a byproduct of his constant movement. Karlsson carried the puck into the Stars zone and played a pass to Zach Whitecloud. Karlsson kept skating and was able to get to the net front right as Whitecloud's shot went off the boards with Karlsson there to collect the rebound and fire it into an open net.  His second goal was the result of a blocked shot that led to a 50-50 puck that Karlsson snagged before creating a little bit of separation before firing off a wrister that beat Oettinger for the lead.  ""Well, the first goal, I kind of got lucky, I'd say,"" Karlsson said. ""I'm sure Whitey was trying to put that one on the net. I just wanted to be first for the possible rebound, but it went behind the net instead and perfectly to me. On the second one, I was just kind of backing up and trying to play safe and there was a chance for me to grab the puck. It's hard to explain but I try to be in the right place and that pays off sometimes.""  Hintz, who had a hand in all three of the Stars' goals, tied it at 2 before Teddy Blueger scored what looked like the initial game-winning goal with a little more than 10 minutes left in the third period.  Blueger's goal was his first of the postseason and just his second career playoff tally. But it came at a time that allowed the Golden Knights to take what was ultimately a temporary edge from another source of offensive production.  ""I think we have good depth at all positions -- goaltending, defense, forwards,"" Blueger said. ""I think whoever is in the lineup can do the job. That's probably what it is.""  Blueger's goal also led to a late push by the Stars. Vegas controlled most of the possession in the game with a shot-share of more than 71 percent in the first period, followed by 55.6 percent in the second in 5-on-5 play, according to Natural Stat Trick. Dallas countered by owning the puck with a 63.4 percent shot-share, which played a significant role in why the Stars had 16 shots in the third compared to the Golden Knights with eight.  Creating and maintaining that level of pressure resulted in the Stars pulling Oettinger for a 6-on-5 advantage that set the stage for captain Jamie Benn's game-tying goal. Benn, along with Joe Pavelski and Hintz, were camped at the net front when Miro Heiskanen's shot from the point reached Golden Knights goaltender Adin Hill to create a scramble on net.  Hintz and Pavelski fought for possession with Pavelski sliding the puck over to Benn, who passed it into the net with 1:59 left in the third. And while Benn's goal did tie the score, it also represented something else.  Namely? How these playoffs have seen Hintz go from one of the Stars' most open secrets into a player who has become a front-runner for the Conn Smythe Trophy.  This was the sixth time Hintz finished with more than two points in a game, and he's had more than three points in five of those performances. It's why Hintz will enter Game 2 leading the NHL with 22 points in the playoffs. Panthers star winger Matthew Tkachuk would be the closest player of those still playing and he's trailing Hintz by five points.  With Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals Thursday between the Panthers and Hurricanes going to four overtimes, there was some expectation that the Stars and Golden Knights could possibly create another lengthy battle Friday.  Instead, Howden ended it early.  ""It can't always be the stars, right? Or the guys that you would expect, and that's what's been good about our team,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We've had different people step up in key moments. It's the time of the year where you got to enjoy the moment and kind of embrace it. Raise your hand if you had Howden in your pool in overtime? You probably went in a different direction and that's good for us. That's why we've been able to win.""  Taking Game 1 has not been a necessity for the Golden Knights. They lost 5-1 to open the first round against the Winnipeg Jets before winning in six. But they did win Game 1 versus the Edmonton Oilers before clinching that series in six wins.  Yet here's why beating the Stars in Game 1's this postseason comes with a rather intriguing caveat. The Minnesota Wild beat the Stars in overtime to open their first-round series. The Kraken also beat the Stars in overtime to open their second-round series.  Guess how that turned out for the Wild and Kraken? The Stars beat the Wild in six games before ending the upstart Kraken's season in seven games.  ""The good news is that the other two ended the right way,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said when asked about losing a third straight series in overtime. ""That's what we'll hope for, but you got to win some overtime games too in the playoffs. You can't go 0-for-3, 0-for-4 in the playoffs in overtime. That's something we've got to get fixed quickly.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmhsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2ODkxNDIvaG93ZGVuLXNjb3Jlcy1lYXJseS1vdC1nb2xkZW4ta25pZ2h0cy10b3Atc3RhcnMtZ2FtZS0x0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jby51ay9uaGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY4OTE0Mi9ob3dkZW4tc2NvcmVzLWVhcmx5LW90LWdvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLXRvcC1zdGFycy1nYW1lLTE_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T08:17:47","RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes each deserved to take a bow, but they probably didn't have the energy.  Still, after the Panthers' thrilling 3-2 quadruple overtime win in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Final at PNC Arena on Thursday, it's going to be difficult to wait for the next one. When Matthew Tkachuk ended the exhausting marathon by scoring with 12.7 seconds remaining in fourth overtime, all you could think was more of the same, please.  But, of course, get some rest before Game 2 of the best-of-7 series is played here Saturday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, CBC, SN, TVAS).  ""I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch,"" Tkachuk said. ""It's little stuff like little battles that maybe people don't realize, but they're very important and both teams are doing it all night long. So they're a great team over there. I'm sure both teams are gassed right now.""  That's understandable. It was the sixth-longest game in NHL history and the longest for each franchise. The game started at 8:10 p.m. ET on Thursday and ended at 1:54 a.m. ET on Friday.  Total elapsed game time was 139 minutes and 47 seconds.  ""I thought it was a [heck] of a battle,"" Hurricanes center Jordan Staal said. ""It's going to be like that every game against that team. That's playoff hockey. I'm not surprised that's the way it looked out there. We'll have to regroup and take it to the next game.""  Video: Tkachuk nets the Game 1 winner in the 4th overtime  Five skaters played more than 50 minutes, led by defenseman Brandon Montour at 57:56 for Florida and defenseman Brent Burns at 54:33 for Carolina. And each goalie went the distance.  Florida's Sergei Bobrovsky was superb again, setting a Panthers record with 63 saves, including 34 in overtime, for his second game in a row with at least 50 saves (50 in a series-clinching Game 5 against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday). Frederik Andersen more than held his own at the other end for the Hurricanes with 57 saves, a Hurricanes/Hartford Whalers record, including 39 in overtime.  ""Both teams spent what they had,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""That's a huge cost for both teams, and then it's a race to recover.""  By the time Tkachuk's shot from the right circle went in over Andersen's glove for the winning goal, you might have forgotten that Florida led 2-1 heading into the third period after Aleksander Barkov (15:28) and Carter Verhaeghe (17:43) scored 2:15 apart late in the second. Carolina tied it on Stefan Noesen's power-play goal 3:47 into the third period and couldn't add another goal in regulation despite outshooting Florida 14-2 in the third.  That included Bobrovsky's left pad save on Martin Necas on a breakaway at 12:33 and his follow-up shot two seconds later.  ""[Bobrovsky] was good, but so was Freddie,"" Necas said. ""Both goalies played great. We've got to get a little more in, shoot a little bit more with traffic, get the pucks through. Both goalies played great. They got a nice goal at the end there.""  Ryan Lomberg appeared to score the winning goal for Florida 2:34 into the first overtime before it was disallowed after a video review determined Colin White interfered with Andersen. So the teams played on.  The Panthers couldn't convert on a power play resulting from Burns' holding penalty at 3:11 of overtime and Seth Jarvis nearly won it on a Hurricanes power play resulting from Anthony Duclair's high-sticking minor at 11:51 but hit the underside of the crossbar on his rebound chance in front at 12:31.  In the second overtime, Bobrovsky made back-to-back sterling saves on Jack Drury and Sebastian Aho at 11:03 and 11:07, respectively. Andersen fought through traffic to make a glove save on Josh Mahura's shot from the high slot at 11:50.  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  Andersen did his best work in the third overtime, with 11 saves, including one with the shaft of his stick at 5:35 on Montour, who was alone in front with the puck following a Hurricanes turnover. Andersen also made a dazzling glove save on Eric Staal with 47 seconds remaining to push the game to a fourth extra period.  ""Listen, it's the worst way to lose,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""There's no way around it. ... But we'll regroup and come back at it the next one. It's just one game.""  Something had to give. The Hurricanes were 5-1 at home in the Stanley Cup Playoffs entering Game 1. The Panthers were 6-1 on the road this postseason, including six straight wins.  Florida was 4-0 in overtime in this postseason and had won seven straight playoff overtime games dating to 2021. Carolina was 3-0 in overtime this postseason and also had won seven straight playoff overtime games dating to 2021.  Carolina had 145 shot attempts and blocked 39 shots. Florida had 125 shot attempts and blocked 38 shots.  ""You've got to tip your cap to both teams how they played,"" Tkachuk said. ""Fourth overtime, guys are diving, blocking shots, diving to get pucks out. I don't know how many blocked shots there were on both sides. But both teams are very dialed in and playing smart but hard and very for the team. Both teams are very team first and you can easily tell that.  ""We knew they were going to be tight, low-scoring games against these guys and that's something that we're confident and comfortable in, and it should be good the rest of the series.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5obC5jb20vbmV3cy9wYW50aGVycy10b3AtaHVycmljYW5lcy1pbi02dGgtbG9uZ2VzdC1nYW1lLWluLW5obC1oaXN0b3J5L2MtMzQ0NDY1Mzgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Lions (31-10) were defeated in the first game of the day against the Marlins after costly mistakes proved too much to overcome, before quickly rebounding with a clutch, low-scoring victory against the Valiants to return to their winning ways.    GAME ONE (Virginia Wesleyan 9, TCNJ 3 - FINAL)  The Lions struck first in the bottom of the first. Catcher Julia Mayernik recorded her 100th career hit came in the form of a sharp double down the leftfield line, scoring Jaclyn Carifi and Julia Kinnally to put the Lions up 2-0.    Virginia Wesleyan quickly rallied in the top of the second to tie the game at two apiece. The Marlins would take the lead an inning later by scoring two more to go up 4-2.    The Lions would slash the deficit in half in the bottom half of the third when a Mayernik sacrifice bunt scored Carifi for TCNJ's third run of the game.    The Marlins responded by adding three additional runs in the top of the fourth to go up 7-3. Virginia Wesleyan would ultimately go on to win the match 9-3, sending the Lions into a must-win elimination game later in the afternoon.    Kinnally finished the game with three hits and reached base four total times. Mayernik and senior Alexis Rizzo each recorded two hits, with the catcher also throwing out her second baserunner of Regionals in the game. Carifi rounded out the Lions' hitting with a hit.    GAME TWO (TCNJ 1, Manhattanville 0 - FINAL)  With both teams facing elimination and determined to be the one to advance onto Saturday, the game would become a hard fought pitcher's duel between TCNJ's Elizabeth Gosse and Manhattanville's Shinstine in which both pitchers went the distance and neutralized each other's offenses the entire game.    The bottom of the third saw the Lions' defense make two superb defensive plays. To start, Julia Kinnally made an athletic diving tag out for the first out of the bottom half inning, before Mayernik threw out her third base stealer of the weekend to close out the inning.    The Lions catcher added on to her caught stealing totals in the bottom of the fifth when she threw out her fourth base stealer on another perfectly timed throw down to second base.    Manhattanville nearly broke through the scoreless game first in the bottom of the sixth, when a Valiants' third batter landed a two-out triple down the rightfield line. However, staying composed, Gosse managed to immediately get out of the inning by forcing a pop up to Kinnally at shortstop.    The Lions finally broke through Shinstine's dominant pitching in the top of the seventh, when senior Jaclyn Carifi lifted a single to right field that scored freshman Ashley O'Hagan from second after the Manhattanville catcher was called for obstruction at the plate. The Lions led 1-0 heading into the bottom half of the final inning.    Closing out the elimination game herself, Gosse struck out the first batter looking before forcing a weak groundout to Camryn Kitchin at first. The freshman would punch out the final Valiants' batter to send the Lions onto Saturday's Regionals finals.    Gosse collected her 15th win of the season and completed her 11th complete game as well. She finished with five strikeouts while only allowing four hits.    At the plate, Neveling and Carifi each had two hits apiece, while freshman Reina Jeronimo drew three walks.    UP NEXT  With the hard fought win, the Lions advance onto Saturday's NCAA Regional Title game, with the first pitch scheduled at noon. The blue and gold will need to beat Virginia Wesleyan in consecutive games to win the region and advance onto the Super Regionals round.

Mazzulla could have used a timeout or two during the Miami Heat's red-hot third quarter in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals during which they outscored the Celtics 46-25 en route to a series-opening victory. He also could have used Derrick White and Robert Williams a little more during the fourth quarter of Game 2 when the Heat were making a run.

""We got his back, he got ours,"" Celtics star Jayson Tatum said after his team's 111-105 defeat in Game 2. ""Joe ain't missed no shots tonight. He ain't had no turnovers.

"game","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T05:53:00","Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo take over in the fourth quarter to lead the Heat to another win in Boston. (3:21)  BOSTON -- Over the past two postseasons, the Celtics have repeatedly responded well after losses. They have also repeatedly struggled in close late-game situations.  In control for significant portions of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat on Friday night, the Celtics appeared poised to even this series at a game apiece, but another collapse saw Boston lose Game 2 111-105 and has the Celtics staring at a 2-0 deficit.  Game 3 is Sunday night in Miami.  ""At the end of the day, we have a real, real decision to make,"" Celtics forward Grant Williams said. ""And that decision is going to be, are we going to come back and really set the tone for the rest of this year and really make a statement, or are we going to come out and lay down?  ""And I don't think this team is built for laying down.""  Whether or not the Celtics are ready to lie down, they find themselves in a massive hole after Jimmy Butler and the Heat once again took them apart in the closing moments.  In the fourth quarter of Game 1 on Wednesday night, the Heat held Boston scoreless for over four minutes and forced three turnovers -- including two traveling violations by Jayson Tatum -- inside the final three minutes.  In Game 2, after Williams had a dunk with 3 minutes, 52 seconds remaining, the Celtics didn't make a field goal for the rest of the night, missing their final four shots and committing two turnovers. They essentially had a third turnover on a backcourt violation against Al Horford and saw Tatum nearly lose the ball multiple times late in the contest.  That allowed Miami to close with a 24-9 run over the final 6:37. Butler scored nine of his 27 points in the fourth and Bam Adebayo -- who had 22 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists -- had eight points, eight rebounds and four assists in the quarter, including two huge offensive rebounds.  ""This is a series of discipline and mindset,"" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said, ""and there were times throughout the game where we weren't the more disciplined team.""  For the Celtics, it is a familiar refrain. Against the Heat in Game 7 of last year's conference finals, Boston nearly coughed up a double-digit lead late. The Celtics have repeatedly struggled in these situations at plenty of other points over the past couple of seasons, as well.  Not surprisingly, there was no shortage of answers for what went wrong after this one.  ""We just got to stay poised,"" said Jaylen Brown, who had 16 points on 7-for-23 shooting. ""I think we get sped up at times. Two, we just play basketball. In those moments we got to come alive. It seems like we let the game slip away from us when we are in those situations.""  Tatum, who had 34 points but committed five turnovers and missed all three shots he took in the fourth quarter, said, ""We got to execute better. We have had double-digit leads in both games and a turnover has changed the momentum or offensive rebounds led to a 3 has changed the momentum. So those plays right when we're up 12, when we could go up 15, 16 ... they go on an 8-0 run and now it's at four, and now the momentum has shifted.  ""So we've been up and we got to do a better job of making those, I would call them winning plays, in those situations.""  There were times, as Tatum pointed out, that it appeared the outcome would be different. Boston went on extended runs in both the first and second halves to build double-digit leads on multiple occasions. Mazzulla made several notable adjustments that worked well, from plugging Grant Williams into the rotation to going away from a two-big lineup by starting Derrick White over Robert Williams III in the second half.  But Boston struggled to hit shots, going 10-for-30 from 3-point range. The Celtics are 29-30 in the regular season and playoffs when they shoot under 40% from long range, compared with 36-2 when they shoot 40% or better.  Combine that with another bout of struggles late in a close game, and the Celtics are now 11-4 over the past two playoffs when playing after a loss. Friday's defeat snapped a streak of 16 consecutive games in which a team that lost Game 1 at home had won Game 2.  Now trailing 2-0 in the series and heading to Miami, Boston needs to win four of the next five games -- three of which would be in Miami -- to return to the NBA Finals for a second straight year.

"game","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T06:21:32","BOSTON — What happened in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals was nothing short of stunning.  We had witnessed the Miami Heat’s resilience before in these playoffs. We’d also witnessed the Boston Celtics’ flakiness. But Miami’s 111-105 victory on Friday was still a shocker.  Home teams had won the last 16 Game 2s in series that they trailed 1-0, and the average margin of victory in those games was 17.3 points. The Celtics should have been the more desperate team, knowing that they couldn’t afford to lose two games at home. At times, they looked the part. They had a 21-2 run spanning the first and second quarters and a 24-8 run in the third.  But they lost, because the Heat just will never die. Miami is now 6-2 in these playoffs in games it trailed double-digits, while every other team is 15-60, with none of the other 15 having a winning record.  In this game, the Heat faced two double-digit deficits, coming back from 12 down in the second quarter to take the lead before halftime and coming back from 12 down again early in the fourth.  “You start to wrap your mind around that it’s going to be a long game, 48 minutes,” said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. “We had to battle through deficits in both halves, but we showed that grit and perseverance to be able to hang in there and make some plays.”  This was the Heat’s third win (they’re 3-2) in a game they trailed by double-digits in the fourth, with every other team in these playoffs being 1-53 in those situations. (The other win was from Atlanta in Game 5 of the first round in this same building.) The three wins after facing a double-digit, fourth-quarter deficits are tied for the most* in any postseason in the 27 years for which we have play-by-play data.  * Tied with last year’s Memphis Grizzlies, who were 3-4 after trailing by 10 or more in the fourth. The 2020 Heat (2-5) are one of the six other teams with multiple such postseason wins.  Here are some notes, quotes, numbers and film from a game that has the Heat two wins from being the first 8 seed in a full (82-game) season to reach the Finals:  1. Been here before  It was a game of runs that, naturally, went down to the wire. And it just seems that the Heat are much more comfortable in high-leverage situations.  Both of these teams have played 97 total games (regular season, Play-In and playoffs). And the Heat have played 16 more *clutch games (63) than the Celtics (47). Boston was 24-13 (second best) in the clutch in the regular season, but is now just 4-6 in the playoffs, while Miami is 6-2, having allowed their opponents to score just 64 points on 70 clutch possessions (91.4 per 100).  The Celtics missed some good looks down the stretch on Friday, but also had a few rough possessions, and they have twice as many fourth-quarter turnovers in this series (10) as the Heat (5). With the score tied and a little less than three minutes left, Marcus Smart simply dropped the ball.  The Heat, meanwhile, scored 36 points on just 23 fourth-quarter possessions (1.57 per) in Game 2. They executed, they made big shots, and they out-worked the Celtics on the glass. The biggest possession of the game may have been one where Miami got four shots, the last being a Bam Adebayo put-back dunk after he discarded Al Horford.  That was a physical play, but Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla agreed that his team’s inability to execute down the stretch was more mental than physical.  “It’s a series of discipline and a mind set,” he said. “So, yeah, it’s mental from the standpoint of who can make the right plays at the right times, who can make the simple plays, who can win those details and those margins. So, yeah, it’s definitely mental.”  “I think they outplayed us,” Jaylen Brown added. “They out-toughed us tonight and they found a way to make plays down the stretch and we didn’t.  2. Poking the bear  Grant Williams has been a rotational staple for the Celtics since he came into the league four years ago … until this past March, when Mazzulla didn’t play him at all on occasion. Williams had three DNPs in the first round, another in Game 6 of the conference semifinals, and a fifth in Game 1 of this series, when Payton Pritchard got (surprising) minutes.  But Williams checked in late in the first quarter of Game 2 and played more than 25 minutes, his second highest total in the playoffs. He did some good things and actually had Boston’s only three field goals in the final eight minutes of the fourth quarter.  “I just liked his physicality,” Mazzulla said. “I liked his rebounding, his ability to communicate defensively. I thought he gave us some really good minutes.”  But Williams also went forehead to forehead with Butler after the Heat star took him 1-on-1 and got an and-1 bucket in the paint with 6:22 remaining.  Now, this is the Eastern Conference finals, when players shouldn’t need any motivation beyond the chance to play for a championship. And Heat coach Erik Spoelstra thinks that Jimmy is going to be Jimmy whether or not an opponent is in his face.  “I love that gnarly version of Jimmy,” Spoelstra said, “but you get that regardless.”  Spoelstra’s players had a different opinion.  “I knew it was going to be good for us,” Caleb Martin said of the fourth-quarter confrontation. “Knowing Jimmy, at that point in the game, you get him going, we’ll take mad Jimmy any time. I knew that you could kind of see it in his eyes that he was ready to go after that.”  Butler kept seeking out his new nemesis. He scored on Williams on the very next possession, and then two more times (one, two) after that. All four of his fourth-quarter field goals were isolations against Grant Williams, and he agreed that their little chat after the first one did put some extra gas in his tank for those final six minutes.  “Yes, it did,” he said. “But that’s just competition at its finest. He hit a big shot. Started talking to me; I like that. I’m all for that. It makes me key in a lot more. It pushes that will that I have to win a lot more. It makes me smile. It does. When people talk to me, I’m like, OK, I know I’m a decent player, if you want to talk to me out of everybody that you can talk to.  “But it’s just competition. I do respect him, though. He’s a big part of what they try to do. He switches. He can shoot the ball. I just don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to [laughter].”  3. Robinson, outside and in  Another guy who hasn’t been a rotation regular is Duncan Robinson. The shooter was out of the Heat’s rotation for the last three months of the regular season and didn’t play in either of their Play-In games. But with Tyler Herro and Victor Oladipo injured, Robinson has gotten regular minutes off the bench since Game 2 of the first round.  Still, he played less than seven minutes in Game 1 of this series and missed both his shots. And then, while his teammates didn’t shoot nearly as well as they did in Game 1, Robinson came up huge in Game 2, scoring 15 points in less than 21 minutes. Eight of those 15 came in the fourth quarter, when he took advantage of both Celtics named Williams.  Robert Williams III started his fourth straight game and was switching screens more on Friday. In fact, Game 2 was just the seventh time this season that the bigger Williams switched more than five ball-screens, according to Second Spectrum tracking.  But dribble hand-offs are different than standard ball-screens, when it’s easier for the screener’s defender to anticipate the action. When Bam Adebayo had the ball at the high post, Williams was sagging off and protecting the paint. But that made him unready to switch out to Robinson, when Adebayo handed the ball off.  Robinson drained one 3 with Williams sagging in the paint:  And then hit another on a more standard pick-and-roll (with Williams late to react) two possessions later.  But Robinson wasn’t just a 3-point shooter on Friday. He got two first-half layups when Derrick White was overplaying him on the perimeter and after those two 3s in the fourth, he got a layup when Butler set a back-screen that Grant Williams (maybe because he was focused on Butler) didn’t switch:  4. No busting the zone  Robinson, of course, can be a defensive liability. And the Celtics were more purposeful offensively than they were in Game 1, targeting him and Kevin Love in pick-and-rolls with Tatum. After three straight scores on possessions midway through the third quarter where Love’s man set a screen for Tatum, the Heat called timeout and Love was done for the night.  But the 2022-23 Heat played the most zone in 19 seasons of Synergy tracking, sometimes to throw a wrench in the opponent’s offensive flow and sometimes to protect their weaker defenders. With the Celtics doing some more pick-and-roll targeting, Miami played zone a lot in the second quarter (when most of the Celtics’ scores were in transition) and it helped them come back from that first double-digit deficit.  It also helped them come back from the second one. The Heat went back to the zone early in the fourth quarter and, basically, stayed in it for the entire period … because the Celtics couldn’t score against it.  “When you play against great teams,” Spoelstra said, “you just have to do whatever is necessary.”  Robert Williams did have a couple of paint scores against the zone, and Grant Williams got a dunk when an inside screen for Tatum had the Heat outnumbered on the weak side. But the Celtics couldn’t put enough of those scores together.  “We just haven’t figured it out in terms of how to exploit it every single time down the floor,” Brown said. “We got to recognize certain situations, and credit to them defensively, they have been able to hide some of their guys defensively in order to slow us down on offense.”  Spoelstra, as he often does, downplayed the significance of the zone.  “It’s not about the schematics or the Xs and Os,” he said. “You have to be committed to doing the multiple efforts to contain, to get to the three-point line, to contain their drives. They do all of that, and then they crash the glass, whether in the man or the zone.”  5. How far they’ve come  It bears repeating that the Heat lost their first Play-In game and were trailing the Chicago Bulls in the fourth quarter of the next one, facing elimination five weeks ago. Now, they’re two wins from the Finals in a conference that had the three best teams in the league. They haven’t been dominant (the Celtics still have the better playoff point differential), but they’ve been remarkably resilient.  The Heat are up 2-0, going back to Miami for the next two games, and thus far undefeated (5-0) at home in these playoffs. Game 3 is Sunday (8:30 ET, TNT).

"game","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 15:00:00","Game thread word. Game thread word. Game thread word.  I’m not sure that accurately sums it up. I’m glad I don’t have the job of recapping this one. But holy cow, when you pull the lens back from the close up shot, the wide angle ain’t pretty either. That the Cubs once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory comes as no great surprise to a fandom used to disappointment. But even as someone who thought this team was only going to win about 75 games, I’m stunned at how bad this team is right now.  I am getting tired of reading from many of the prime voices of Cubs Twitter that the Cubs are a good team underperforming. I don’t know how this team can be framed that way. Nothing is ever permanent and things can definitely turn around. But this team is a bad team that overperformed in April. And it overperformed despite a roster that everyone following the team knew was patched together with beer goggles or a whole lot of wishful thinking.  This team was put together with no viable depth. Who knows if that might have been different earlier in the season if the team had opted for players like Christopher Morel, Matt Mervis and Nelson Velázquez. Instead they opted for the ghost of Eric Hosmer and two players in Edwin Rios and Luis Torrens who, even if they were talented, the organization never felt comfortable enough to give them any meaningful playing time.  Then they balanced the lack of offensive depth with the lack of any proven reliever. To be fair, this exact strategy has worked over and over for this front office. They stack the big league team and Iowa with a number of retread major leaguers and some waiver wire pickups with great stuff looking to harness it. The recent vintage has added some organizational prospects. Without any question, this organization has been good at doing this.  But if you roll the dice over and over again, you eventually roll craps. Can they still pull this together? Maybe. But none of the experienced guys appear to be any good at this. And everyone who has pitched in high leverage situations has buckled under the job. This is vaguely reminiscent of the leadoff spot between the time Dexter Fowler left and Nico Hoerner taking over the spot. That is, a lot of guys try it. A few have occasional success, but ultimately none of them appear able to rise to the occasion.  Of course, 43 games is not an enormous sample size. But this team has given away at least half a dozen games already this season. With different choices would they all be wins? We can’t know. Sequencing changes and can have a profound effect. But David Ross is on a jaw dropping run of every decision he makes in tight ballgames fails. The law of averages would suggest you’d occasionally be right.  With the loss tonight, the Cubs are 2-9 in one-run games. They are also 2-5 in two-run games. A strong bullpen is the surest way to stealing close games. Having a deep bench that might give you the advantage in a game late can help too. Both of those things are useful if you aren’t the defending world champions and loaded with talent on both sides of the equation. Even there, the Astros used one pinch hitter in this game. He drew the walk that finished the night of Keegan Thompson.  This sucks. I’m tired of excuses for poor play. There is still way too much deadweight on this team and there doesn’t see to be any quick and easy way to fix it.  Who’s sense of humor created this schedule? The Cubs get an off day Thursday as they travel to Philadelphia to face the other team in the World Series. I mean, this is comical. Maybe they should do it to every team. The World Series challenge. After that series, there are homes series with the Mets, Reds and Rays. Amusingly enough, the Phillies and Mets are both under .500. But the Cubs have now helped what ailed the Cardinals and the Astros. Maybe the two NL East teams are next? For the record, if you have a friend who is a Cardinals fan and you tap danced on the grave of the Cardinals, know that they are now only 1½ games behind the Cubs. Odds are they will finish a long way ahead of the Cubs. Again.  Rant over. For now. Let’s talk about some positives in a game that actually had some.  Hopefully you’ve read about Seiya Suzuki’s incredible accomplishments. Homers in consecutive at bats is some pretty rare air. Reaching base five times is a different and also fabulous accomplishment. For everyone who was ready to give up Seiya after a rough start, he now has a line of .286/.372/.491 (wRC+ 135). If Morel is emerging as the most productive player on this team, Seiya is bidding for the second spot. Speaking of Morel, he had three hits and a walk in six plate appearances. One of the hits was a homer. He now has five of them across his first eight games of the season. He’s entering some record books as well with his blazing start. That’s eight games with at least one hit and eight games with at least one run. Sure, he struck out once and now has 14 strikeouts in only 36 plate appearances. But also 10 runs driven in on a team struggling to score runs consistently. If you were part of the decision to keep Morel off of this team, you are in a painfully difficult spot. The more he dominates, the stupider you look. So what, you either take the L or you root against your team’s hottest player. For the video game craziness of it, Morel’s line is .371/.389/.857 (wRC+ 233). He has a slug higher than all of his teammates except Patrick Wisdom and Ian Happ have OPS. Arguably, I’ve done Drew Smyly a disservice by placing him down here. Drew should have picked up a win for allowing four hits, no walks and one run against a very talented offensive team in six innings of work. I just can’t bring myself to start the conversation of players who might have value in trades come July.

I know pitcher wins aren’t a great stat, but Stroman hasn’t won since April 7 when he made his second start of the season.  The Phillies will have left Ranger Suarez making just his second start of the season. The last one was four innings of work in Colorado. He allowed three runs on seven hits and a walk. He has 113 lifetime appearances, 45 of them starts, and he has a 3.18 career ERA. The Cubs are 8-5 against lefties in one of the few remaining splits that remains positive for the team.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVkY3ViYmllYmx1ZS5jb20vMjAyMy81LzE4LzIzNzI4MDI0LzIwMjMtY3Vicy1oZXJvZXMtYW5kLWdvYXRzLWdhbWUtNDPSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlZGN1YmJpZWJsdWUuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMTgvMjM3MjgwMjQvMjAyMy1jdWJzLWhlcm9lcy1hbmQtZ29hdHMtZ2FtZS00Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 18:15:09","Sci-fi horror is all the rage these days, with Scorn, SIGNALIS, The Callisto Protocol and the upcoming Greyhill Incident all capitalizing on the voguish trend. Even Dead Space (a franchise that was driven into the ground by its own publisher and forced into complete dormancy for almost a decade) has managed to make itself relevant again.  Always with its finger on the pulse, Dead by Daylight is looking to get in on the action next with its Chapter 28 DLC. This imminent expansion — which is scheduled for release on DbD’s copper anniversary — will see the multiplayer game take to the stars and promises to really shake things up with fresh content that’s unlike anything they’ve ever done before.  And what better way is there to celebrate 7 years of asymmetrical bloodshed than to go intergalactic? After all, crossing that final frontier is pretty much the crowing achievement of any slasher franchise that has legs.  If you can keep the money rolling in for long enough, then you eventually get to go to space. Those are just the rules. It was only a matter of time then, before Dead by Daylight followed in the footsteps of Hellraiser, Friday the 13th and Leprechaun before it and ditched the confines of Planet Earth.  Bringing a lot to the table, Chapter 28 will introduce an original map, an additional survivor and a totally unique killer. To learn more about what’s waiting for us in the farthest reaches of the cosmos, we attended a recent press conference hosted by developer Behaviour Interactive.  Here, we gained a deeper insight into the DLC’s alien environments and discovered what makes the new “Singularity” character such a distinctly menacing opponent.  The Year Ahead…  Before we got stuck into Chapter 28 (titled End Transmission), we were walked through the content roadmap for the next twelve months.  Fans will be pleased to hear that they are going to be treated to a whopping six major updates this year, the first of which is obviously End Transmission.  After this, there will then be three more fully-fledged chapters (adding both licenced and original characters to the roster), as well as two smaller updates that are billed as “survivor-only” DLCs.  In terms of chronology, the breakdown for 2023/24 is as follows:  1st: End Transmission  2nd: Nicolas Cage Chapter (Survivor Only)  3rd: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  4th: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  5th: Survivor Only Chapter  6th: Original Chapter with Killer + Survivor  Alongside all of this, various quality- of-life improvements will also be rolled out throughout the year.  An anti-camping system will be implemented to promote good sportsmanship and to discourage cheap tactics, while a new search-bar function will enable players to navigate their sprawling inventories with greater ease.  Most exciting of all, however, is the introduction of “survivor disconnect bots.” Swooping in whenever a sore loser rage quits or somebody encounters crippling network issues, these A.I.-controlled teammates will fill the vacancy left behind. They might not be flawless substitutes for your fellow human players, but they will at least ensure that matches can continue in some form if the lobby starts to dwindle for whatever reason.  The Perfect Lifeform…  Speaking of Artificial Intelligence — and the implications of it one day replacing us — it turns out that this will actually be the main theme of the latest DLC.  While many in the DbD community were understandably hoping for an Alien chapter (with a playable Xenomorph), the game’s first foray into sci-fi horror is a wholly original affair instead. That being said, the ideas that it will be tapping into ought to be instantly familiar to anyone whose seen movies like The Terminator, Westworld or Richard Stanley’s Hardware.  Set in the distant future, the basic premise of End Transmission is that a group of human settlers have arrived on a strange, exotic world. Hoping to colonise it for the sake of mankind, they dispatch a state-of-the-art A.I. to scout out this foreign terrain and identify any potential hazards.  Unfortunately, the servile android ends up learning a little too much on its reconnaissance mission and starts to wonder why it should be taking orders from these fragile meatbags in the first place. No prizes for guessing what happens next.  As A.I. is wont to do, the machine inevitably comes to the conclusion that humans are just a waste of oxygen and decides to overthrow its masters, picking them off one by one. By the time the DLC opens, this purge is nearing completion and only a single member of the crew is still breathing.  The ensuing confrontation between Gabriel Soma (the chapter’s new survivor) and The Singularity (the chapter’s new killer) forms the central crux of End Transmission. A teaser trailer sets the adversarial dynamic up nicely, pairing cinematic footage with some Kyle Reese-esque narration from Gabriel.  As he dashes through an alien rainforest, the terrified astro-engineer lays out everything that you need to know about his cybernetic tormenter: “It became self-aware. It has no empathy. It doesn’t feel pain. It learns at an impossible rate and it won’t stop until we are dead. Or worse.”  If you are wondering what fate he could possibly be alluding to here that’s worse than being hacked to pieces by a homicidal robot, Dead by Daylight’s Creative Director, Dave Richard, was able to clear things up. Speaking about The Singularity’s ghoulish M.O., he said: “While it was scouting for potential dangers on this uncharted world, [The Singularity] made contact with old alien technology and was subsequently enlightened.”  Having had a profound revelation of some kind, it now single-mindedly strives to grow and amass even more power. It does this by assimilating other pieces of machinery as well as organic material, in the hope that it will eventually become “the perfect lifeform.”  Richard continued: “This killer is an interesting take on the idea of a cyborg. We’re used to seeing human characters [augment] themselves with technology in science fiction, but The Singularity is doing everything in reverse. It’s a piece of software that’s decided to fuse with human flesh in order to increase its strength and mobility. It’s on a quest to assimilate every living being in the universe.”  The end result is a grotesque amalgamation of synthetic components and viscera. On the subject of its appearance, you’re never going to have an iteration of The Singularity that’s entirely pure (one way or the other), but you will be able to modify its look through various cosmetic options.  According to Richard, there will be different skins to choose from here, with some emphasising the more robotic qualities of the killer, while others suggest that it is being slowly mutated by the planet’s eerie flora and fauna.  As for how it plays, The Singularity has the ability to deploy gelatinous sacs around the environment. Known as “bio-pods,” these can stick to almost any surface and are used as a kind of body-horror version of CCTV.  Richard explained: “They allow the killer to project its consciousness elsewhere. By strategically placing these pods, [Singularity players] can spy on survivors and even spew projectiles at them. We call that last part ‘The Slipstream Effect’. When a survivor is hit with a Slipstream, The Singularity can then teleport to their location and immediately attack.  “To [counterbalance] this, survivors will have access to a brand-new special item; the EMP. This will be peppered in chests around the map whenever you face off against The Singularity and can temporarily disable its bio-pods and even [negate] the Slipstream Effect.”  A Long Way From Home…  Alongside the killer and survivor characters, End Transmission will also introduce a new arena into Dead by Daylight’s map rotation. That being the aforementioned jungle planet where Gabriel’s and his crewmates sealed their collective fates.  Describing this inhospitable environment, Richard said: “Toba Landing is an obscure and foreign place. Its dangerous flora, fauna and structure are unlike anything that can be found on Earth. So it will be very different for our players.”  “There were several big themes that we wanted to explore when designing this realm. First of all, it was important that it’s clearly an alien world. We wanted the player to feel as though they are far from home and lost in space.”  Elaborating upon how they pulled off this vibe, he continued: “We took inspiration from the weirdest things that we could find in real-world nature and then modified them further to make it all feel even less familiar. We also added hints of a long-lost alien civilisation throughout, as a reminder that even powerful civilisations like ours can disappear and be forgotten.”  Rest assured that there will be some recognisable elements in Toba Landing, however, as Richard confirmed that all of the staple Dead by Daylight assets will remain intact. He clarified: “Our lore permits that palettes, hooks and generators can all exist within this futuristic sci-fi universe.  “The Entity creates them so that they can be distributed across all of the different Omniverse realms for its trials.

Shuvalova is now tied for third, trailing the leaders, GMs Kateryna Lagno and Tan Zhongyi, by half a point.  WGM Dinara Wagner unleashed a spirited piece of home prep on IM Bibisara Assaubayeva, leading to a double-edged game where Assaubayeva was able to navigate the complexity over the board.  GM Aleksandra Goryachkina had a commanding advantage vs. GM Alexandra Kosteniuk, but in the end, the 12th women's world champion found a way to create counterplay and save the game.  The final leg of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix continues with round four on Friday, May 19, starting at 5:00 a.m. Pacific/14:00 CEST.  How to watch?  You can watch live games of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix on our Events Page . The rounds start each day at 5:00 a.m. Pacific/14:00 CEST.  Lagno vs. Tan  In the clash between the leaders, the Petroff took on a more aggressive nature when Lagno used her king to escape Black's pin on the h5-d1 diagonal and Tan reacted by opening the f-file to double her rooks to create more kingside pressure.  After several trades in the center, the position changed into a queen and rook ending where Lagno's heavy pieces dominated the e-file, but Tan's major counterparts kept her few weaknesses well-supported. Though Lagno used the majority of the time left on her clock looking for ways to increase her slight edge, the game eventually winded down to a draw.  Wagner vs. Assaubayeva  Wagner intensified the already notoriously double-edged King's Indian Defense with 12.g4!?―a bolt to Black's kingside. As commentator WGM Keti Tsatsalashvili noted, so far in this event, Wagner's home preparation has been a strength: “Very, very heavy home preparation. Dinara, to me, seems to be well-prepared. I think, in the time from the Munich Grand Prix until the Cypress Grand Prix, she was working hard, many hours of the days.”  Assaubayeva seemed to be surprised, yet unfazed, responding energetically in the center and then offering a pawn sacrifice on the queenside. Though Wagner gained the superior pawn structure and a mighty knight on the e4-outpost, Assaubayeva created counterplay by building up pressure on White's backward f-pawn. In the end, this led to a topsy-turvy balance.  Wagner had hostile intentions against Assaubayeva's King's Indian Defense. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  Shuvalova vs. Mammadzada  Shuvalova is the only player remaining who’s played all decisive games. Her efforts for the win have played off; despite her round-one loss, she’s joined the tie for third.  Shuvalova opted for a Maroczy Bind setup against Mammadzada’s Sicilian Kan, giving White a space edge while Black has few weaknesses, always looking to prepare the pawn breaks …d5 or …b5.  By move 21, Shuvalova gained a vast time edge of nearly 50 minutes to just 10 for her opponent. Black can often struggle to find moves because her plan is less concrete in her solid yet cramped position.  White increased her edge by barreling her forces down at Black’s weak d6-pawn, forcing …e5, permanently weakening d5 and the light-squares. Shuvalova soon took over this potent central outpost and, by move 27, every single white piece was more active than its black counterpart, which was completely tied down to the passive defense of her backward d-pawn.  Shuvalova is proving to be a relentless fighter. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  With such a commanding position, Shuvalova seemed a little over-eager to convert her advantage, rushing to win the weak pawn but allowing her opponent to trade into a rook ending with drawing chances. From there, the world number-16 for women had to win the game all over again, but she was up for the challenge. When Mammadzada gave her a chance at winning, she capitalized. Can you find how she turned a drawish rook ending into a winning one?  In her post-game interview, Shuvalova shared that―although the original rook ending was technically drawn―she intended to press on for as long as possible:  ""In the end, she had probably good chances to save the game if she just stayed, not pushing ...g5 (...). If she just stayed, I would play g3 and f4 at some moment and grab the e5-pawn. And then we will be playing for another hundred moves.""  And then we will be playing for another hundred moves. —Polina Shuvalova  This tenacious victory is our Game of the Day, analyzed by GM Rafael Leitao.  Kosteniuk vs Goryachkina  In the battle between the Aleksandras, the top seed faced the 12th women's world champion. Further, these two competitors currently lead in grand prix points (except for GM Zhu Jiner, who’s already completed three events).  With the black pieces, Goryachkina discovered the chance to weaken her opponent's structure, forcing the creation of doubled backward pawns on the half-open e-file. Then, she increased her advantage by expanding on the queenside, step by step. Gaining a dominant grip on the position, Goryachkina created a queenside passed pawn and maneuvered her knights to centralized outposts on c5 and e5. She won a pawn and seemed on her way to grinding down White's defenses for the full point.  However, after one inaccurate move, Kosteniuk leaped at the opportunity to win her rival's passer and simplify into a queen vs. two rooks ending with ample counterplay, ultimately holding the balance.  Kosteniuk resiliently defended her difficult position vs. Goryachkina. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  Kiolbasa vs. Khotenashvili  In an Open Ruy Lopez, IM Oliwia Kiolbasa expanded in the center with a d4-d5 break and later with c4-c5, breaking up Black's queenside structure. GM Bella Khotenashvili kept the position balanced by activating her pieces, doubling on the d-file and sinking her bishop into White's side of the board and d3. With all the heavy pieces facing each other, hinting at mass exchanges, the players drew.  Dzagnidze vs. Dronavalli  This game finished very quickly and looked like neither player had much intention to play for a win. GM Harika Dronavalli and GM Nana Dzagnidze went into a known perpetual check idea in the opening. Despite playing White, it's likely that Dzagnidze intended to draw as a reset to her tough loss in the previous round. While it's certainly disappointing from a spectator perspective to see a game that isn't really a game, the players often pace themselves in a long, high-pressure tournament against top-notch competition, being mindful of their energy and confidence levels.

The Chargers dropped a back-and-forth game one by the score of 7-5 before coming back and taking game two in yet another dramatic walk-off barnburner, winning in extra innings by the score of 5-4.  Game one of the night saw Kalamazoo Christian overcame a two run deficit thanks to a run scored in the fifth inning and three scored in the sixth as the Comets took the 7-5 win.  K-Christian scored first, putting up a single run in the first inning and two in the second for the early 3-0 lead.  Union City came right back however, plating five runs in the third inning thanks to an Owen Jackson RBI double, scoring Luke Watson; a Ryan Zweng RBI single, scoring Jackson; an Aidan Decker two run double, scoring Zweng and Rick Austin; and Phoenix Elkins scoring on a wild pitch, giving the Chargers a 5-3 lead after three innings.  K-Christian closed out the game with four unanswered runs after that, scoring one in the fifth and three in the sixth for the 7-5 win.  Rick Austin took the loss on the mound for Union City after throwing all seven innings in the start. Austin allowed nine Comet hits and seven runs, four earned, with three strikeouts.  Owen Jackson packed the big bat for Union City in game one, finishing a perfect 3 for 3 with two singles, a double, one walk and one RBi with a run scored.  Aidan Decker also recorded a double to go with two RBis to help the Chargers offense.  Also adding to the Charger effort was Rick Austin with two walks and a run scored; Ryan Zweng with a single, an RBI and a run scored; Phoenix Elkins with a run scored; and Luke Watson with a single and a run scored.  Game two of the twin bill saw Union City tie the game up with four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning before winning the whole thing in walk-off fashion in extra innings.  K-Christian kicked off the scoring with three runs in the third inning and a single run in the fifth to build a 4-0 lead. Union City came right back to tie things up with four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning. Union City’s four runs came courtesy of an Owen Jackson two run double, scoring Jakob Fosmore and Luke Watson; a Rick Austin fielder’s choice, scoring Ethan Neveraski; and Ryan Zweng with an RBI double, scoring Jackson.  Both defenses buckled down and kept the runs off the board, eventually forcing extra innings as the game stood tied at 4-4 after seven.  After the Charger defense sat Kalamazoo Christian down in order in the top of the eighth it was Union City’s turn to provide the dramatics once again. Senior Tyler Wagley started off the Charger effort with a one out walk, followed by a clutch double from Aidan Decker, putting runners at second and third with one out.  Stepping to the plate was senior Jakob Fosmore who has seen his share of big at-bats over his four year varsity career. Thursday was no different as Fosmore stayed patient and took a 2-2 count to deep centerfield, allowing Wagley to tag-up and score on the Fosmore sac fly, giving Union City the exciting 5-4 walk-off win.  Phoenix Elkins secured the win on the mound for Union City after throwing two innings in relief, allowing no hits or runs with one walk and four strikeouts.  Ethan Neveraski made the start on the mound for Union City, throwing six innings while allowing nine hits and four runs with three walks and three strikeouts.  Union City out hit Kalamazoo Christian 10-9 in the win with four of those 10 hits coming as doubles.  Leading the way for the Chargers was Owen Jackson with a single and a double with two RBIs and a run scored while Jakob Fosmore added a double, and RBI and a run scored.  Also adding to the Union City victory was Rick Austin with an RBI; Ryan Zweng with a double and an RBI; Phoenix Elkins with a single; Tyler Wagley with two singles, a walk and a run scored; Aidan Decker with a double; Luke Watson with a single and a run scored; and Ethan Neveraski with a single, a walk and a run scored.  With the non-conference split the Union City record now stands at 20-7 overall on the year. Union City will next see action Friday when they travel to Comstock for more non-conference tune-ups.  Early lead propels Climax Scotts past Bronson  BRONSON, MI. - The Bronson Vikings dropped a non-conference matchup with Climax Scotts Thursday night, falling by the score of 5-0.  Climax Scotts raced out to the lead and never really looked back, scoring four runs in the first inning.

James Jourdan took the loss on the mound for Bronson after throwing two innings in the start, allowing five hits and four runs, all earned, with two walks.

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day.  Intel's tired of doing cost-benefit analysis. It's making AI do it instead.  It may sound a little meta, but Intel is working on tech that uses AI to decide whether or not to use AI to regenerate video graphics. Here's how it works: Neural networks are fed reference images of graphics, such as frames of a video game, that have been rendered without the use of AI. Based on the quality of those images, this tech then predicts a ""visual quality score"" of how well an AI could reproduce those graphics.  Intel argues in its filing that this tech essentially does the job of a quality assessment tester to ""maximize quality while minimizing performance budget,"" and can help decide what Intel called the ""cutoff point"" for when to stop training a GPU's machine learning-based renderer.  The current industry standard for testing the visual quality of graphics is to use human opinion scoring, Intel notes, which can be a ""time consuming and expensive"" approach as it involves a large group of people to rate an even larger set of photos and video sequences. The company said this tech automates the process with a ""high correlation to a subjective human opinion score of quality.""  ""To determine whether such AI-based rendering models are able to improve the rendering performance while maintaining the image or video quality, a measure of how good the quality of the image/video is versus the analytic solution may be utilized,"" Intel said in its filing. ""Such a measure of image/video quality should correlate with a subjective human observer's opinion.""  One additional note: Intel mentioned that this tech can be integrated with several gaming devices, including a server-based gaming platform, or handheld, mobile, and online gaming consoles.  Photo via the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Intel's patent isn't the first time we've seen this in gaming QA testing. Just last month, Google patented tech that allows developers to use AI to test their games, claiming that quality testing teams can't ""scale with the complexity of modern games, leading to delayed launches and lower quality products."" While the focus of Google's tech differs from Intel's, the basic point is the same: AI is being used to replace inefficient and typically human-run processes.  Intel, however, is not exactly the shining star of the gaming PC sector. Its latest earnings were grim, with the company seeing revenues for its client computing sector, which includes gaming computers, fall 38% as demand continues to tumble. The company's results echo the industrywide turmoil that started last year and has continued into 2023, with worldwide shipments falling 30% in the first quarter, according to Gartner.  Nvidia far outpaces Intel in the gaming PC market, said Romeo Alvarez, director and research analyst at William O'Neil. Nvidia currently hoards 82% of the market, leaving Intel neck-and-neck with AMD at 9% each. Intel didn't enter into the space until 2020, Alvarez said, and its gaming offerings really started to pick up in 2022 when it started shipping its Arc graphics card. Despite the gaming sector's woes last year, the company managed to nearly double its market share since the end of 2021.  ""Intel's (stock) has been an underperformer for a couple of years now,"" said Alvarez. ""They're definitely becoming more competitive. There is upside there. But I think we still need more confirmation that the market is going to normalize.""  By adding more AI offerings as this patent suggests, the company may be itching to stay competitive. But as rivals race ahead with AI development, Intel is still lagging behind.  ""In gaming PCs, they are gaining ground already,"" said Alvarez. ""In AI applications, I think it remains to be seen whether they can be a competitor. They're definitely moving in the right direction, but I still think by far Nvidia is the king there.""

"game","2005-06-17","Not Discerned","{""Outlook"", ""Saskatchewan"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:15:00","This delve into the virtual world was written with a half-smile and a wink on the writer's face!  Do you like video games?  I suppose such a question may depend on the generation reading this. But if you're around my age range, the odds are pretty good that you grew up as part of the Nintendo generation.  Yes sir, the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 8-bit video game console that was released in North America in late 1985 and introduced the world to Mario, the pint-sized Italian plumber character who would fast become the king mascot of the Nintendo enterprise for decades. There was also Luigi, Mario's thinner brother who wore all green in comparison to Mario's all red, but let's face it, the world knew who the true star was here.  The Super Mario Bros. video game came included with every Nintendo system that was bought, which was exactly what my brothers and I discovered when we woke up on Christmas morning in 1992 to find a Nintendo under the tree. Cheers rang out, and the odds were good that they were probably heard all over Conquest as my mom and dad poured their morning coffee, exchanging smiling glances of, 'Oh man, what sort of chaos did we unleash on this household?'.  It goes without saying that our Nintendo system became a treasured item in our household. Our collection of games grew substantially, and it was a point of personal pride when my brothers and I managed to convince our dad to join in on the fun. If you remember the game Duck Hunt, which also came included with the Nintendo system, then you know that the game was super simple with an easy-to-follow premise; the ducks will fly out of the bush, and you aim with the Nintendo gun and fire away. Duck hits equal points, and the hunt would become increasingly difficult. If you fired and missed, a dog would pop out of the bush and laugh at you.  Well, we got Jack convinced to give this hunting game a shot one night and handed him the gun controller. He knew what to do, and to his credit, he would hit the odd duck here and there, but it was still a hilarious sight to behold watching Jack Edward Ruttle - a gruff, no-nonsense, meat-and-potatoes kind of guy - pointing a plastic gun at a TV screen and trying his damdest to blow away virtual game fowl.  I still remember him sneering at that giggling cartoon dog laughing between missed shots and remarking to me, 'Don't suppose I can shoot that damn dog, eh?'  As the years went on, so did the video game industry. The Nintendo system grew to include the Super Nintendo, or you could ""switch sides"" and join the Sega Genesis side of the fence. From there, the Nintendo 64 came along, which was a legitimate game changer as far as graphics, quality, and gameplay were concerned. And then came the Playstation.  Not long after the Playstation arrived, its sequel, the Playstation 2 (real geniuses coming up with these catchy names) arrived and it seemed like everyone had one. I did too, and I remember playing many games on nights when I wasn't out driving around with friends, doing God knows what around Outlook, worrying about school, or thinking about girls. Hey, I'm a teenage boy at around this time, so girls took up a lot of residency in my brain. If I'm being honest, the opposite sex still does today!  The Playstation 2 was where my favorite video game of all time was released into a society that reacted to it in one of two very definitive ways; you either accepted it and enjoyed it as the fun, but very adult content that it was, or you condemned it as garbage that was ""soiling the minds of our children"". The game was Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, a story of criminals acting like, well, criminals toward each other in a multilayered tale of betrayal, violence, power, and all of it set against the backdrop of sunny Florida in the year 1986.  The game quickly became popular when I was in high school, with my friends and I playing it over and over and over.  And then, there was one night in June 2005 while my buddies Kyle, Chris and I were having a bonfire late on a Saturday night. We were discussing video games, and of course Vice City popped up. I wish I could remember who posed the question, but the question did indeed come up - What if Outlook as a community was a video game? What would the missions be? What's the story? What's the setup?  Well, the three of us must've sat around that bonfire that night for two or three hours coming up with all sorts of missions, character profiles, and twists and turns throughout the story that would eventually lead to the story's conclusion.  Outlook as a video game.......hmmmmmm....  That's an interesting question for 2023, don't you think? The story that my buddies and I came up with in 2005 will stay retired, and let's just say there's an oath of secrecy between us that will never be broken. But here's my crack at it for modern times.  So what are we thinking, Outlook as some sort of medieval war-torn land? Nah, too bleak. I'm thinking of retaining the same Grand Theft Auto model, but without all the shameless stealing from the popular video game series. Make it TRULY unique to Outlook and the surrounding area.  Mission 1: Modestly-popular reporter Eric Tuttle and his newspaper The Lookout have had their names slung in the mud by the local town council. Who's the culprit who stooged you to your higher-ups? What will you do when you find out? And in the end, whose side will the residents of Lookout be on when the dust has settled?  Mission 2: Local rock band Good Intentions have a gig in town coming up, but something's wrong - their bass player has gone missing! Did he join another band? Nope, you'll find out that he's been kidnapped by a rival band from a rival town, and it's up to YOU to rescue him!  Mission 3: You go to your buddy's house to pick him up to go for drinks, but wait, he's not there. You phone him up, and someone else picks up. You learn that your buddy got in a fight with some no-good punks from the next town over in Rosetown. No, wait, we probably shouldn't use real town names here, eh? How about Tulipville?  There are probably a dozen other missions and likely a whole convoluted backstory I could write, but there's only so much space, as they say.  And relax, people. I wrote this with a half-smile and a knowing wink on my face. It's video games, folks; no sense in getting hot about any of this.  For this week, that's been the Ruttle Report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhc2t0b2RheS5jYS9jZW50cmFsL291dGxvb2svdGhlLXJ1dHRsZS1yZXBvcnQtd2hhdC1pZi1vdXRsb29rLXdhcy1hLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtNzAyMjYyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Since January, high school students at the Queens School of Inquiry have been playing ""Energetic,"" a new board game that teaches students the complexities of decarbonizing New York’s electrical grid by switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  What You Need To Know ""Energetic"" is a board game teaching kids how to decarbonize New York City's electrical grids    Students learn about the climate crisis and sustainability while playing the game    ""High school students will have a better sense of what the local solutions are, and hopefully, they'll participate in the real ones,"" teacher Adam Zaid said    So far, 13 schools in the city are using the board game in the classroom  ""So we're trying to have a sustainable energy source in New York by 2035, which is 16 gigawatts. And so far we have three,"" ninth-grader Yassin Essa said.  At a time when news of the climate emergency is demoralizing many kids and adults, ""Energetic"" wants to provide knowledge and tools to students so they feel they have a role to play in solving this crisis.  ""Playing this type of electricity game, it kind of opens up your mind to a different type of perspective,"" 10th-grader Lara Joy Jusi said.  Adam Zaid is a math teacher and a member of the Climate Education Leadership Team, a group of over 30 teachers and school administrators that advocate for including climate instruction in the state curriculum.  Zaid thinks ""Energetic"" is a great tool for the classroom.  ""High school students will have a better sense of what the local solutions are, and hopefully, they'll participate in the real ones,"" Zaid said.  The creators of the game wanted to display all the variables in this complicated equation, which include activism, technical difficulties, elections and the influence of public opinion.  ""It was really hard to make people understand the intricacies, the challenges and the details of this energy transition, so this game kind of came out of that frustration,"" Isil Akgul, an architect and lead designer at City Atlas, the organization behind ""Energetic,"" said.  New York state has the goal of an electricity grid with zero carbon emissions by 2040, so the talent to be recruited for that mission might come from schools like the Queens School of Inquiry.  ""I've always wanted to be an engineer. But I think because of this, like it's going to be something based around the climate and like, creating sustainable energy that would help our world,"" 10th-grader Cai Racpan said.  So far, 13 schools in the city are using the game in the classroom. The creators are now in the process of making more copies of the board game. They also want to tailor it to other cities around the country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55MS5jb20vbnljL2FsbC1ib3JvdWdocy9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2JvYXJkLWdhbWUtdGVhY2hpbmctc3R1ZGVudHMtdG8tZGVjYXJib25pemUtbmV3LXlvcmstY2l0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-04-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 01:00:00","The Muck: Does Players Selling Action Impact a Poker Game?  May 18, 2023 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.  Doug Polk admitted on social media that he's considering selling some of his action in the upcoming $1 million buy-in games on Hustler Casino Live. That sparked some debate as some claimed that selling pieces impacts the way a backed player plays, while others argued that poker players should only play a certain game if they can afford the entire buy-in.  Eric Persson, who will also be in those historic cash games at Hustler Casino in Los Angeles from May 26-30 gave his thoughts on Polk's decision to possibly sell action. His response is the basis behind our newest edition of The Muck.  @DougPolkVids Anyone who doesnt think beink staked matters, or changes approach to actual game play should reread Doug's post. — Eric Persson (@IAmMaverick888)  Confusing Staking with Selling Action  Rob Yong, also scheduled to play in the $1 million games, agreed with Persson that ""being staked impacts the game."" But Polk jumped in to clarify the difference between being staked and selling action.  @rob_yong_ @IAmMaverick888 Selling pieces and being staked are fundamentally different and you guys constantly lump… https://t.co/KLDl8MC8ja — Doug Polk (@DougPolkVids)  Being staked, as Polk explained, means that a player either has no or little skin in the game, whereas a player selling action will typically still have plenty of skin in the game. It's common in tournament poker for players, even the top pros in the world, to sell pieces, and it's also common for players to find a staking arrangement with a backer.  Yong and Persson, however, argued that the semantics don't matter. In Persson's mind, he believes that his large bankroll is ""the great equalizer"" against, by his own admission, a more skilled player like Polk. The Maverick Casinos owner thinks he'll have more of an edge if a pro like Polk is playing under more pressure, which could happen if he were in for the full $1 million buy-in on his own dime.  Persson has become a regular in the highest stakes live-streamed shows such as Hustler Casino Live and High Stakes Poker. He's always one of the wealthiest players in the game, and that likely gives him an edge as he can fire away large bluffs without fear of being stacked.  Polk Defends Selling Poker Action  Doug Polk  Polk took offense to the notion that selling action impacts the game. He defended his decision to contemplate selling pieces of his buy-in by writing, ""You have a set bankroll. Sometimes games are bigger than your bankroll. To offset this, most of the best players in the world will sell pieces to make the game appropriately sized.""  The upcoming Hustler Casino Live game will be the biggest live-stream poker cash game in history. With rebuys and add-ons in the mix, it's conceivable there will be $15 million on the table at some point during the five sessions. Even though Polk is likely the most skilled player in those games, variance will play a role in determining the outcome of one or a few sessions. One bad cooler or misstep and it could cost any of those players $1 million or more.  For Persson, and some others at the table, that might not be a huge deal even if they have 100% skin in the game. But some of the players will feel it more if they get stacked.  Still, there are no rules against being backed or selling action on Hustler Casino Live or most other games. Polk is doing something that is common practice at all levels of poker, even in low-stakes games. He used a historic example to defend his decision.  At some point, games are good to play in but they are too large to take all of yourself responsibly. I am tired of… https://t.co/O2SVL8oUvF — Doug Polk (@DougPolkVids)  ""The Corporation"" was a group of top pros such as Todd Brunson, Jennifer Harman, and Phil Ivey who put their money together to battle billionaire amateur poker player Andy Beal heads-up in some seven-figure matches in Las Vegas during the 2000s.  Beal was at a significant disadvantage in terms of skill against every member of The Corporation. But he had the bankroll advantage, which is why none of the players were willing to play him on their own. Instead, they pooled their money together and took turns battling the banker. In the end, The Corporation won millions of dollars including one session in which Brunson reportedly won $5 million.  ""This is an example of one of those players who sold pieces,"" Polk wrote above a picture of Ivey, considered by many to be the best poker player of all-time.  Doug Polk, Charlie Carrel Saga Just Took an Unexpected Turn for the Better  What the Poker Community has to Say  Many poker players and fans chimed in to give their two cents on the staking/backing issue. Is it bad for the game? Does it impact the game as much as Persson and Yong claim? Or is Polk right in that it's an acceptable practice? Let's see what the poker community had to say.  ""My prob with action selling/buying. Not enough transparency for how much or who has action and trust is a huge issue. Can lead to overselling where desperate humans with bills to pay/debts make bad decisions/run ponzis. Need someone to design a public site for % verifications,"" Matt Salsberg wrote.  ""Selling pieces to players not in the game should be fine. But selling pieces of yourself to other players in the game is a problem. It's even worse if you trade pieces with another player in the game. That's because it can affect the probability distributions of the hands in play,"" according to Mason Malmuth.  @CamzillaPoker @DougPolkVids It’s not being scoffed at. @IAmMaverick888 @limonpoker & @rob_yong_ are saying it shou… https://t.co/PM03KVs5GH — LEGION | b33njammin80 (@b33njammin80)  ""The main issue is disclosure. There are many ways that external financial arrangements have the potential to distort play in a way that disadvantages unaware players. Ethical players should err on the side of disclosing if there is even the slightest chance it is material,"" @tonycoxphoto argued, similar to that of Malmuth's take.  ""The biggest issue with this debate is it's being driven by people who are heavily involved in various businesses. Why is getting investment to risk capital in a poker game different from selling pieces in a business?"" a valid point made by @gustheoryoptiml.  Ethan ""Rampage"" Yau, another play who will be competing in the $1 million game, had Polk's back. The popular poker vlogger responded: ""You’re stronger willed than I trying to explain to the masses why selling isn’t a bad thing.""  Rampage has often sold pieces of his action to his fans for the high-stakes games he plays, including the big game coming up later this month. Some poker pros such as Rampage, those who have large followings, often sell pieces so their followers can have a little sweat. Daniel Negreanu, for example, sells action to his fans for his World Series of Poker (WSOP) package.  There isn't much of an uproar when Negreanu sells WSOP action, or when Rampage sells pieces for various tournaments and cash games. But Persson wants his opponents to be fully invested in the game so he'll have an edge even against more skilled players.  Sharelines Should poker players sell action in big cash games? It's the topic of the latest PokerNews The Muck.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3RoZS1tdWNrLXNlbGxpbmctcGllY2VzLXBva2VyLTQzNTc3Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, well over a month later, the Pokémon GO game director Michael Steranka has responded to the fan backlash, acknowledging how the development team has ""definitely taken note"". He goes on to reiterate how it was a tough decision but believes it is necessary for the future of the game and the way players engage with it.  Here's part of his response (via Dot Esports):  “Yeah, we’ve definitely taken note. It’s hard to ignore, right? I’m personally being tagged a lot in a lot of these tweets. So we read everything, and we see everything...That was a very, very painful decision to make even for me. But when we look at sort of the overall health of the game, and the type of behaviors that remote raid passes were introducing, it just really didn’t align with the kind of experience we were trying to create. And I can honestly say even for me personally, it became sort of an unhealthy way to engage with the game. I would just sort of throw money at Poké Coins so that I can spam legendary raids as much as possible.""  ""And we’re talking about legendary Pokémon; they’re supposed to be the epic epitome of all Pokémon content. And this is something that players including myself are doing over a dozen times a day, for some people over 100 times a day. And so that’s something that we really honestly let go on a little bit too long and ultimately needed to course correct.""  Steranka went on to mention how the team would not make compromises on the mission:  ""So again, super, super painful decision that is not something we took lightly. But it’s something that we felt is necessary for the longevity of the game and to also ensure that we’re not really compromising on our mission.""  At the time of this announcement, Pokémon GO VP Ed Wu mentioned how the change was necessary for the ""long-term health of the overall game"" and Niantic's own principles of encouraging players to get outside and explore the world together.  In the 'HearUsNiantic' social media campaign, fans voiced their concerns about this update - labelling it the ""worst decision"" possible and accusing Niantic of restricting the experience.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5pbnRlbmRvbGlmZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3Bva2Vtb24tZ28tZ2FtZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1yZXNwb25kcy10by1oZWFyLXVzLW5pYW50aWMtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLWJhY2tsYXNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Westfield"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 05:35:27","It’s official, Bratz is back in the zeitgeist.  The resurgence of this franchise was brimming well before the 2022 console release of Bratz: Flaunt Your Fashion, with the brand’s official social media accounts amassing over 2.4 million followers combined in recent years. But the title’s positive reception amongst some mainstream gaming outlets serves as proof there are audiences hungry for content reminiscent of the formative media of their childhoods.  An audience so hungry I had to drive across several suburbs to obtain my copy of Flaunt Your Fashion, as two of my local stores were out of stock.  Bratz resonated with me so strongly growing up, as it was one of the first pieces of media that depicted young girls not only having the ability to become anything they wanted, but having fun in the process.  They were fashion designers, journalists, musicians, and great friends to one another, and the franchise represented an important means for me to playfully engage with and embrace themes surrounding ambition in girlhood.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  Dr Stephanie Harkin has beautifully highlighted how video games can be used as a vehicle for exploring girlhood and its complex coming-of-age themes. She explains how titles like Jane Friedhoff’s Lost Wage Rampage lean into rebellious gameplay to communicate how its protagonists re-empower themselves after discovering they are earning less than their male colleagues – describing it as a game that is as playful as it is political.  It’s valuable for young audiences to see these topics depicted in fun, relatable ways that don’t diminish their abilities to seriously discuss them in real-life contexts.  Read: What can games tell us about girlhood?  Passion for Fashion  The peak sales period of Bratz products, in the mid-2000s, also serves as an interesting case study when analysing the impact of media targeted at young girls, as the brand was popular amongst not just pre-teen age groups, but adolescent markets as well. Officially licensed homewares, video games, and film and television programs that went beyond traditional toys made Bratzseem not just appealing in a broader lifestyle context, but genuinely cool for consumers to engage with. ‘Girlhood’ was treated as a legitimate consumer product – and inadvertently, this allowed young girls to claim a sense of ownership of their interests.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  Old media lost to history reveals more about this style of marketing, as Girl Gamer – Nintendo’s mid-noughties published magazine, whilst promoting a somewhat oversimplified take on young girls’ overall engagement with games, did celebrate its readership and their uniquely ‘cool’ interests.  Pages stocked with ‘Who’s The Cutest?’ video game character listicles and ‘Extreme Makeover’ advertisements pushing the latest peripherals for the ‘rock chick’ could read as patronising. But I know for sure that my younger self would have taken pride in celebrating all of my interests through media that wasn’t shaming me for my passions.  This influence has followed me well into adulthood. I’ve adorned my current living space with Bratz memorabilia, filled my wardrobe with branded apparel, have regularly hosted Barbie and Bratz watch parties, and compared notes on Flaunt Your Fashion with friends who wouldn’t have otherwise played a new game that month, if it weren’t for its release.  None of this is performed as an act of irony. It’s genuine self-expression that brings me a real sense of joy to participate in.  frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  This sentiment is sometimes undervalued in a world that is becoming increasingly commercialised, and it’s challenging to make a compelling case for why a Bratz game holds weight in a games media landscape, as so much of the conversation is widely critical, from a technical standpoint.  Games like Flaunt Your Fashion should exist. The Bratz franchise has historically celebrated hyperfemininity and themes surrounding girlhood, and has never looked at how any of the characters present themselves through a shameful or humorous lens.  It has been a beacon of representation for so many young audiences who have carried values of playful femininity and ambition into their adult lives. It’s invaluable for young girls, in particular, to see these values represented positively in the games they play.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  In real-life contexts, audiences have reclaimed once derogatory terms heralded by a resurgence of noughties culture, and it’s empowered newer generations to embrace these ideals as a means for self-expression, and to challenge layers of internalised misogyny.  Senior Lecturer and Author Hannah McCann has also explained the broader impact of ‘Critical Femininities’ in academia, and how lovingly labelled movements like ‘Bimbo Feminism’ have given space for Bratz-adjacent media to be revisited in more progressive contexts.  There is by no means one set way to promote femininity, and it’s valid that not everyone chooses to adopt these traits in their own lives. Bratz is just one example of a franchise that makes it feel safe and fun for a lot of audiences to do so, and that’s something that shouldn’t be overlooked.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JyYXR6LWZsYXVudC15b3VyLWZhc2hpb24tZ2FtZS1iaW1iby1mZW1pbmlzbS1lbXBvd2VybWVudC0yNjE2ODIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 01:47:50","Square Enix officially shut down their popular mobile game, Echoes of Mana, on May 15.  By Jason Collins |  Just months after shutting down its Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, the now-controversial Square Enix decided to pull the plug on yet another video game. This time, the company is pulling a plug on Echoes of Mana, a mobile entry in the popular Mana gaming series—the official support ended on May 15, 2023, making the game inaccessible for players.  According to ComicBook.com, Square Enix announced the game’s official shutdown on May 15, though the plans for a shutdown were made public in February this year. The company expressed its gratitude to all players who joined in on the adventure. They haven’t offered any official reasons as to why Echoes of Mana was shut down.  They only linked to their original post regarding the end of service. So, the Echoes of Mana ended with a whimper, and only after a few years on the market. Such is the fate of live service games, and it makes the fans unhappy.  There’s a lot of disappointment surrounding the end of service for Echoes of Mana, but many fans actually expressed their gratitude to Square Enix for giving the game’s narrative a satisfying conclusion. Giving Echoes of Mana a satisfying conclusion is already more than most mobile games, and their fans can hope for these days. Still, despite being disheartened by the game’s shutdown, most of the fandom actually praised the various aspects of the game instead of expressing their frustration—well, at least it fared better than Marvel’s Avengers.  Of course, skeptics also raised their voices, stating that Echoes of Mana is among the few games in the series that haven’t been ported to other platforms, so this shutdown actually means that the game is likely to be lost to time for those who’d like to experience it. With that said, the Mana series also isn’t a stranger to remakes and re-releases, and given Square Enix’s money-grabbing tactics—with which they actually managed to “out-greed” Electronic Arts—bringing Echoes of Mana back from the video game cemetery isn’t so far-fetched.  The company that gave us Echoes of Mana, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts made a series of questionable decisions, which resulted in some abhorrent gaming titles, such as Marvel’s Avengers or an upcoming NFT video game with over 10,000 microtransactions. The latter will forever remain a testament to the fact that companies can’t just take a mediocre video game, slap a popular brand sticker on it, and expect the fans to love a gaming title that’s essentially ruined by greed.  Echoes of Mana is an entry in the Final Fantasy spin-off gaming series that began with Secret of Mana, released in 1998. That particular series subsequently spawned spin-offs of its own, growing into a full-fledged gaming series that initially launched on Android and iOS platforms. Echoes of Mana was the only one that was released as a free-to-play game supported by microtransactions, which is why it wasn’t ported to other platforms, and the reason for its shutdown might very well lie in poor profitability.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9nYW1lcy9zcXVhcmUtZW5peC1zaHV0LWRvd24tZ2FtZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2019-05-25","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:04:13","4A Games' Metro series is undoubtedly one of the best post-apocalyptic shooter franchises you can enjoy today, with each game sporting excellent writing based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro novels, tense survival shooter gameplay, and stellar visuals and audio. Each one is easily worth their full MSRP, but right now, you won't even have to come close to paying that much to get them. That's because a special Metro Series Sale has officially kicked off on Steam, offering each title for massively reduced prices until May 25.  The highlight of the sale is an incredible deal for 85% off the Metro Saga Bundle, giving you access to Metro 2033 Redux, Metro: Last Light Redux, Metro Exodus, and each game's DLC for a jaw-dropping $12.49 (down from $84.96).  (opens in new tab) Metro Saga Bundle | $84.96 $12.49 at Steam (opens in new tab) For less than $15, you can get every Metro game and all of their DLCs while this sale is active. The bundle includes Metro 2033 Redux, Metro: Last Light Redux, and Metro Exodus, along with the Metro Exodus: Enhanced Edition that every player gets access to when they buy the standard version.  (opens in new tab) Metro Exodus | $29.99 $6.89 at Steam (opens in new tab) Metro Exodus was one of the best shooters of 2019, and took the traditionally linear series into sprawling non-linear open world spaces. Between its phenomenal story, satisfying gameplay, and presentation that goes toe-to-toe with the latest titles, it's nothing short of a masterpiece.  (opens in new tab) Metro Exodus Expansion Pass | $14.99 $2.99 at Steam (opens in new tab) The Metro Exodus Expansion Pass provides access to both of the game's expansions, including the linearly designed The Two Colonels DLC and the more open Sam's Story expansion.

In it, you'll explore the Moscow Metro tunnels and see what happened before the events of Metro Exodus.  (opens in new tab) Metro 2033 Redux | $19.99 $3.99 at Steam (opens in new tab) Metro 2033 is the game that started it all, and the Redux edition makes a slew of improvements much like Last Light's does. It's undeniably a classic, and will introduce players to the early days of Artyom's adventures both in the underground metro and on the irradiated post-nuclear surface.  Metro 2033 introduces players to the story and setting of Metro, putting them into the shoes of series protagonist Artyom. It tasks you with making your way through the underground Moscow Metro that various communities took shelter in when nuclear bombs fell in 2013, with occasional dead ends forcing you to ascend to the irradiated, mutant-infested surface. Your goal is to reach the metro's ""capital"" station of Polis — something you'll only be able to do with careful management of ammunition, gas mask filters, and other supplies — to get help and save Artyom's home station from mysterious supernatural dangers.  Metro: Last Light continues where the first game left off, with several of the metro's factions learning about a special military facility Artyom visited in the first game. You, along with ""Spartan"" peacekeeping companions, must travel through the tunnels and on the surface to discover their plans and stop them if possible. Then, in Metro Exodus, Artyom and the Spartans discover shocking information about the outside world and commandeer a train, exploring the Russian countryside.  Notably, the non-Redux Complete Edition of Metro: Last Light is free for a limited time on Steam, as the developers at 4A Games are celebrating the game's 10th Anniversary. If you download it now, you'll own it forever, even after the promotion ends on May 25.  All three of these games are phenomenal, though Metro Exodus is my favorite of the bunch. Between its fantastic storytelling, its engaging and polished non-linear open world gameplay, and its top-notch presentation, it's nothing short of a must-play masterpiece. Not only is Metro Exodus my favorite open world shooter, it's also one of the best PC games in recent memory.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvZ2V0LXRoZS1lbnRpcmUtbWV0cm8tZ2FtZS1zZXJpZXMtb24tc3RlYW0tZm9yLWFuLWluY3JlZGlibGUtODUtb2Zm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After that thrilling comeback win, the Mets followed it up Thursday by beating the Rays, 3-2, giving them their first back-to-back victories in nearly a month.  And it came against the team with the best record in the sport.  “We needed it,’’ said David Robertson, who picked up the save at Citi Field. “It didn’t matter who we were playing. It just so happened we ran into the Rays, a hot team that’s been good all year. For us to be able to scratch two out of three [against them], it’s big for us and for our confidence.”  Once again, Alonso’s power played a big part in the win.  Despite being under the weather the past few days, the first baseman homered for a third straight game.  Pete Alonso hits a home run in the fourth inning of the Mets’ win over the Rays on May 18, 2023. Charles Wenzelberg/NY Post  His Thursday blast was his 16th of the season, tops in the majors.  “I want what he has,’’ Jeff McNeil joked of Alonso’s success despite not being 100 percent.  “If I’m out there, I’m gonna shoot my best bullet, always,’’ Alonso said. “I approach it like I normally do. … If I’m physically able, I’m willing to go. It’s something I take pride in.”  Even after Alonso’s homer, they needed another run to take the lead for good, and the go-ahead run came on a soft infield single by Tommy Pham in the sixth.  Tylor Megill pitched six strong innings before Brooks Raley and Jeff Brigham each tossed scoreless innings and Robertson closed it.  The Rays got to Megill quickly, as Josh Lowe led off the game with a double and moved to third on an infield single by Randy Arozarena.  Mets starter Tylor Megill pitching against the Rays on May 18, 2023. Charles Wenzelberg/NY Post  Lowe scored on a Harold Ramirez groundout, but Megill escaped further damage when Brandon Lowe grounded into a double play.  The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the inning with a Francisco Lindor walk, a single by McNeil and a walk to Alonso.  Lindor scored to tie the game on a Brett Baty groundout before Pham whiffed to end the inning.  Alonso put the Mets ahead in the fourth with his 446-foot blast to center.  Megill didn’t allow a hit after the first until Lowe’s two-out solo shot to center tied the game at 2-2 in the sixth.  With two on and two out, backup catcher Michael Perez caught Ramirez off first to end another Tampa Bay threat.  In the bottom of the inning, Pham came up with runners on the corners with one out after singles by McNeil and Baty against right-hander Zack Littell, and Pham’s dribbler to third did the job.  Robertson gave up a one-out double to Arozarena, but got Ramirez and Lowe to end the game.  The victory gave the Mets consecutive wins for the first time since winning two straight in San Francisco on April 20-21.  Tommy Pham notched a pair of hits and drove in a run on Thursday. Robert Sabo for NY Post  “We know we’re talented,’’ Alonso said. “Our talent has been here the entire year. It’s just a matter of performing and this performance against a high-quality opponent is a good sign for us. The past few weeks have been tough. You can’t deny that. Hopefully this is a springboard into the next series.”  That comes against the Guardians.  Asked if the series win and a couple of gritty victories over the Rays would provide a jolt to his team, Buck Showalter said, “We’ll see.”  “We have to turn the page,’’ the manager said. “There’s a long way to go and it starts again [Friday].”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L21ldHMtZmluYWxseS13aW4tY29uc2VjdXRpdmUtZ2FtZXMtYWdhaW4taW4tc2VyaWVzLXdpbi1vdmVyLXJheXMv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWV0cy1maW5hbGx5LXdpbi1jb25zZWN1dGl2ZS1nYW1lcy1hZ2Fpbi1pbi1zZXJpZXMtd2luLW92ZXItcmF5cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Games just announced the release of Mortal Kombat 1, a rebirth and reimagining of the Mortal Kombat universe and its characters.  “It’s In Our Blood. Discover a reborn Mortal Kombat Universe created by Fire God Liu Kang,” reads the video description in the official YouTube trailer. “Mortal Kombat 1 ushers in a new era of the iconic franchise with a new fighting system, game modes, and Fatalities!”  Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Announcement Trailer  Players who pre-order the game will receive Shang Tsung for free as a playable character. It’s currently unknown if he will be available for purchase later on. Console players who pre-order the game on the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 can download the beta this August, a month ahead of launch.

Discovery said during a call that Mortal Kombat 12 would be coming this year. He did not give any details about what form the sequel would take. Then, earlier this month, MK social media accounts posted a video where a clock hand approached 12 and then skipped straight to number one.  Advertisement  Now, we’ve finally gotten confirmation that the highly anticipated sequel in the fighting game series is actually a reboot. It sort of makes sense, since Mortal Kombat 11 was centered on a struggle over the power of a magical hourglass, which the heroes canonically use to restore time. This game likely takes place during a new timeline, which gives NetherReam Studios more leeway to flex creatively on such an old and beloved game. These resets are something that the developers have been doing since MK 9, which is probably a smart decision considering the size of the series’ lore up to this point.  Mortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and the Nintendo Switch on September 19. It will also mark the Switch’s second $70 game, following this month’s highly anticipated release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

He’s played the game since he was young and even started his own YouTube channel, where he posts 2K-related content. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But the most recent game, “NBA 2K23,” has shaken his faith.  “Before, I would say I wouldn’t ever leave 2k behind,” he said. “I still somewhat hold onto that thought process. If the trend continues this way with 2K, I could see a time in which I never play it again.”  Jones is not alone. “NBA 2K” fans aren’t happy about the state of the game, especially after developers posted their latest blog post Wednesday, sharing what’s coming in the next six weeks — or, as some fans said, what’s not coming. Mega-fans are concerned that the game isn’t giving them much to do and question whether it’s a sign that 2K isn’t listening to its community anymore.  Advertisement  “I think the community just wants the company to act like they care whatsoever about the consumer,” said Jones, who previously partnered with 2K through the company’s NextMakers initiative, a training program that gives creators access to 2K Games’ intellectual properties and professional development network.  Since “NBA 2K21,” the NBA 2K franchise has taken hints from other video games like “Fortnite” and “Call of Duty” by adding a seasons concept, where players can earn specific in-game rewards and items over a set course of time. (In “NBA 2K23,” seasons last every six weeks.)  The seasonal rewards are vital to one of the modes called “MyTeam,” in which gamers collect digital basketball cards of past, present and future NBA players that they can then use in the game. The digital cards are earned through playing the game, buying them on the game’s auction house or opening digital packs, which can be purchased with real money. A single pack costs about $5 and, on most occasions this year, offers less than a 2% chance at the most valuable cards, which have enhanced abilities in the game.  Advertisement  These packs appear to be the focus of the upcoming Season 7. According to the 2K blog post, the game will make 450 cards available in each new pack for the season. In addition, the packs will feature cards based on NBA players in the league’s playoffs, which began on April 15 and will conclude with the NBA Finals beginning on June 1. Much to the chagrin of fans, no specific events, challenges or in-game competitions to reward gamers (other than the typical seasonal rewards) were mentioned in the blog.  “Now it feels like the only reason to play the game is if you enjoy the thrill of gambling on packs,” said Mick Curley, a 26-year-old from Ireland who runs a YouTube channel under the name “DBG.”  Curley, something of a “NBA 2K” YouTube historian who records documentaries on each year’s games, said he won’t walk away from the game for now because he’s still creating content. “But I can’t see myself ever booting up 2K again” when he’s not running the channel, he added.  Advertisement  Hector Ostolaza, a 41-year-old Twitch streamer from Boston, said he was “anticipating disappointment” from the Season 7 blog post, “and my expectation was right.”  That’s a problem, he said, because it seems 2K wants to “engage less” with fans and not participate in “the general discourse regarding their game.”  One of the biggest issues, Ostolaza said, is that the best player cards are unlocked in the digital packs — not from playing the game. If something is earned through playing the game, it can’t compete with what you may earn in packs.  “Our time is not being rewarded, and neither is our dollar, frankly,” he said, citing the poor odds of the packs.  The 2K community will “get fed up” if there’s more of the same, Ostolaza said. “I’m already less engaged in the game, and many others are in the same boat. The user base feels like it’s being taken advantage of and taken for granted.”  Advertisement  Michael Knight, 29, of Prince George’s County, Md., said he didn’t have a negative reaction to the blog “because I don’t have high expectations for 2K anymore.”  “It honestly felt like they gave up,” he said. “The company shows they don’t care about their product at all and it’s become just too much honestly.”  But Knight may not walk away yet, because “2K still gives me those moments where I feel like this is the best basketball game I’ve ever played.”  The NBA 2K franchise is still played by millions worldwide. The company’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an earnings call Wednesday that “NBA 2K23” has sold more than 11 million units — a record for the series, he said — and had its highest-ever sales of virtual currency, too (which is used for buying packs, accessories and more). The game has about 2.3 million daily active users, he said.  Tyler DeBondt, a 23-year-old YouTube creator and two-time winner of NBA 2K’s online tournament, said 2K needs to address its fan base.  “2K needs to realize that the community and our thoughts are important and should be taken into consideration instead of pushing us away,” he said.  A 2K Games spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

"game","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:09:07","The Panthers outlast the Hurricanes in a marathon Game 1 as Matthew Tkachuk scores the winning goal in quadruple overtime.  RALEIGH, N.C. -- — Back and forth they went, the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes playing a game that seemed destined to have no end while leaving legs growing wobbly with each passing minute.  Then, just as the teams appeared headed for yet another extra period, Matthew Tkachuk pounced on his chance to finish off yet another overtime and road victory for the Panthers in these playoffs.  Tkachuk beat Frederik Andersen in the final seconds of the fourth overtime to give the Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Hurricanes early Friday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final.  Tkachuck took a feed from Sam Bennett after Florida won a battle for the puck as Carolina tried to clear it from the zone, then whipped a shot from the right circle past Andersen with 12.7 seconds left.  That sent Tkachuck racing toward center ice to celebrate with teammates in what turned into the longest game in either franchises' history, as well as the sixth-longest game in NHL history.  “Definitely, tired but I think you're less tired when you win,” Tkachuk said, adding: “I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game, because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch.”  Florida won its seventh straight road game in these playoffs and improved to 5-0 in overtime. Game 2 is Saturday night in Raleigh, less than 48 hours after the teams played more than two full games worth of hockey.  This one ended roughly six hours after the puck drop.  “We didn't even know what overtime we were in,” Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said.  Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe scored in regulation for the Panthers, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 63 saves in what turned into a goaltender battle as the game got more ragged and players racked up the ice time.  Andersen finished with 57 saves for Carolina, which got power-play goals from Seth Jarvis and Stefan Noesen.  “It was a good goalie battle,” Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. “It was unfortuante we just couldn't find one.”  Tkachuk finally ended a game that had multiple wild sequences in critical late moments.  Most notably, there was Lomberg appearing to have the winning goal in his return to Florida’s lineup from injury, beating Jalen Chatfield in a battle and then whipping the puck by Andrersen 2 1/2 minutes into the first OT.  But Carolina successfully challenged the play for goaltender interference. Replays showed Florida’s Colin White — while being bumped by Carolina’s Jack Drury — making skate-to-skate contact with Andersen, then bumping him as Andersen ended up on all fours on the other side of the crease before Lomberg’s shot found the net.  Later in that first OT, Jarvis — who had the game’s first goal on a power-play blast from the slot — nearly ended it on a loose rebound but rang the crossbar.  It turned out, the game was nowhere near its epic finish.  Florida hadn’t been to an Eastern Conference final since 1996, before a large chunk of its roster had even been born. But these Panthers had turned a late surge to qualify for the final wild-card spot into a postseason-shaking moment by taking down Boston following the Bruins’ record-setting 65 wins and 135 points, followed by beating a Toronto team buzzing off its first series win in nearly two decades.  Now the Panthers have handed the Hurricanes — who had the league's second-best regular-season record — their first series deficit of the postseason.  Carolina is in the Eastern final for the second time in five years. The last time, it was a feel-good surprise for a young core that had just ended a nine-year postseason drought. They had since accomplished the goal of building a consistent winner and Cup contender, though second-round exits the past two seasons on home ice had cast a damper on some of that sustained success.  This time, Carolina beat the New York Islanders in six games and then the New Jersey Devils in five to make it back. But on a night when both teams had plenty of chances to end this one in any of the OTs, Carolina ended up losing its ninth straight game in the conference-final round dating to 2009 in brutal fashion.  “It was kind of really who was going to make the last mistake,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “Unfortunately, it was us.”  LONGEST GAME  The longest game in NHL history came on March 24, 1936, when the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1-0 in the sixth overtime on Mud Bruneteau’s goal at 116 minutes, 30 seconds of extra play.  FRANCHISE MARKS  Florida’s previous record for longest game was 104:31 in Game 4 of the 1996 Stanley Cup final against Colorado. Carolina’s previous record was 114:47 for Game 3 of the 2002 Stanley Cup final. The teams each lost those games.  SEMIFINAL SKID  Carolina's losing streak in the NHL semifinals dates to Pittsburgh's sweep of the Hurricanes in 2009 when Maurice was in his second stint as Carolina's coach. Boston then swept the Hurricanes a decade later.  WELCOME BACK  Both teams welcomed back forwards from lengthy injuries.  Carolina’s Teuvo Teravainen hadn’t played since suffering what the team described as a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders. The injury required surgery on April 20 and left him with a scar running the length of his left thumb.  Lomberg had missed eight straight games due to an upper-body injury.  ------  Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap  ------  AP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmhsL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE1NDg0MzHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A release date has just been announced for episode 1 of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, a game that follows the early exploits of Camina Drummer before the start of The Expanse show.  We’ve been hearing rumbles about The Expanse: A Telltale Series for a while, but now we actually know when we’ll get to play it: the first episode releases on July 27.  The Expanse video game is coming in July!  Telltale Games famously made a run of Game of Thrones narrative video games back in the day, which forced players to make difficult choices with long-lasting repercussions. We can expect that trend to continue in The Expanse: A Telltale Series, which will see Drummer and her Belter scavenger crew explore wrecked starships, survive mutinies, and more. Drummer was played by actor Cara Gee in the Amazon series, and Gee will be returning to the role for the Telltale game.  The Expanse: A Telltale Series is being produced by Telltale Games and Deck Nine Games in association with Alcon Television Group. It marks the first new game series from Telltale following a restructure of the company in 2019, and from the early footage we’ve seen, it looks really promising. Drummer will have to utilize iconic Expanse tech like mag boots to traverse wrecks, as well as make the sorts of tough decisions Telltale is known for. Remember when Drummer had to make a split-second decision to amputate one of her polyamorous crewmate’s arms in season 6 of the TV show? Expect more of that sort of stuff in the Telltale game.  In addition to the base game, the release date press announcement also promises DLC (downloadable content) down the road. So not only are we getting the base game with Drummer and her crew, but it sounds like there are even more plans for The Expanse: A Telltale Series after the main story concludes.  The Expanse: A Telltale Series Episode 1 releases on July 27 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC via the Epic Games Store. Four more episodes will follow, with a new one being released every two weeks. Mark your calendars, Beltalowdas!

As reported by NME, the upcoming reality show based on the popular Netflix show Squid Game will give 456 people the chance to win $4.56 million, though no specific premiere date was shared.  “The worst fate is going home empty-handed,” Netflix said when it was announced, making clear the reality show wouldn't be as intense as the original series.. However, they will still be competing in a series of ruthless children’s games, much like the original show.  “Squid Game took the world by storm with director Hwang’s captivating story and iconic imagery. We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment,” said Netflix VP of unscripted and documentary deries Brandon Riegg.  The show hasn't been without controversy, however. Squid Game: The Challenge has already come under fire after a report alleged “inhumane conditions” for contestants.  During filming in a former aircraft hanger outside London, contestants faced freezing temperatures and fatigue after being woken up at 3:30 am. They remained on set for nine hours, unable to move for lengthy periods of time due to the specific game they were playing.  Other reports allege that at least 10 contestants collapsed during filming, while contestants claimed they were getting injured shortly after filming began. Medics were called to the set repeatedly with one contestant referring to the show as a “warzone”.  “The second time the song played, I saw in my left peripheral vision that this girl was swaying,” they claimed. “Then she just buckled, and you could hear her head actually hit the ground. But then someone came on the [microphone] and said to hold our positions because the game is not paused. After that, people were dropping like flies.”  Squid Game: The Challenge will feature multiple games across ten episodes, with a series of challenges inspired by the original show along with some “surprising new additions”.

Following your purchase of any game, app, add-on, or a virtual currency (Fortnite’s V-Bucks, for instance), a reward worth 5% of the total cost will be deposited into your Rewards Balance after two weeks (two weeks marks the end of the platform’s return policy). Epic says that some subscription purchases are eligible to receive rewards, too. You can either spend rewards as you receive them, or bank them for up to 25 months from when they were initially received. These rewards can be stacked on discounts and coupons.  This news comes alongside the launch of the Epic Games Store mega sale, which in addition to marking down the cost on many titles, marks the return of the “Epic Coupon” that will automatically give you 25% off on an eligible game that costs over $14.99.

Many are strangers, some are long-time friends, others even come from the same family. That night they all had something in common – playing their favorite trading card game.  They were all in a Brick hobby shop’s weekly Yu-Gi-Oh tournament. Decks were heard shuffling, strategies were thrown around. Cheerful laughter and banter rung around the tables after the announcer gave all the COVID hygiene announcements.  Above all the cheers of victory and groans of defeat, something else stood out – a father asking his son if he had fun.  Walter Ward, 51, started playing the game around the end of 2003 when it became popular here in the United States. He remembered that his son, who primarily was into Pokemon, developed an interest in Yu-Gi-Oh when the anime was released for western audiences.  “I got into the game with my son,” said Ward. “I learned how to play with him.”  He believes that the stores where the trading card community thrives are great places to meet new people and feel welcomed no matter a person’s background. Also, part of the fun is the competitiveness that these games promote.  The impact of the trading card scene spans worldwide, and has shuffled around the Jersey shore for decades. Magic the Gathering was the first of its kind, started in 1993 and going strong today. It incorporates fantasy worlds similar to Dungeons & Dragons. Pokemon is another popular one, where players collect and duel with “pocket monsters,” just like in the show. Many other licensed properties, from Star Wars to My Little Pony, have been adapted to card games.  Multiple stores around our county give access to enthusiasts of all ages and backgrounds to express their hobbies by trading, collecting, building decks, and then challenging each other with a healthy dose of competitiveness and the occasional saltiness.  Trading card games also help to improve a good bit of tactical thinking, math, and imagination skills due to their spectacular art.  Joseph Coppinger, 22, who started playing when he was 10 years old, shared how he was enamored by how cool the monster cards looked, and that everyone can play their own deck.  When it comes to beginners starting out in the game, Coppinger and Ward share similar advice for new players. When newcomers find something that they like and want to play with, they should stick with it and take the steps until they learn how to play it with ease.  Tournament events provided by the local game stores are the perfect spot for beginners to get a grasp on the game, Cottinger said. During those events, they will be able to see players using different decks and tactics, as well as meet new people. Most stores post their gaming schedule online or in the shop.  A piece of advice he also gives out to parents who might have kids that are interested in the game: “Let them go to events and talk to people… let them have fun,” said Cottinger.  Just like Ward enjoys spending quality father-son time with his boy while playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, he suggests that this can be a great way for parents to get involved with their kids.  And while it might be a challenge at the very start of a person’s dueling journey due to a learning curve, the trading card scene here at the shore has created a close-knit community where everyone is welcome.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplcnNleXNob3Jlb25saW5lLmNvbS9icmljay9nYW1lLWRheS1mb3ItamVyc2V5LXNob3Jlcy1tYWdpY2FsLWNvbW11bml0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sony was having some problems with PlayStation Plus games this week. Commenters in forum posts on Reddit, ResetEra and NeoGAF reported various users being alerted to a notification, reading, “The game will expire in 15 minutes,” and then booting them to the PlayStation home screen. Engadget’s Kris Holt also ran into the issue Wednesday evening while playing Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. However, as of Friday, Sony appears to have fixed the issue.  Users experiencing the glitch said it appeared to happen with any game in the PS Plus catalog. Fortunately, you could still return to the game from the home screen and quickly continue playing. However, the cycle would repeat in regular 15-minute (and possibly other) increments.  It isn’t yet clear how widespread the issue was. (Even before PlayStation stepped in, some users in the Reddit post claimed they were playing PS Plus games without seeing the alert.) Additionally, the bug didn’t have any known fixes, leaving us to wait for PlayStation to step in. We reached out to the company for comment, but it appears to have fixed the issue without publicly acknowledging it.

"game","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Leominster"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:03:30","LEOMINSTER — Here be dragons.  A first-of-its-kind game is coming to the city for live-action play.  “The Quest for the Golden Keys” is an enchanting adventure game setting players on a medieval quest based in the Renaissance. There are eight physical activity games (including an obstacle course and archery) plus riddles to solve over the course of an hour, some of which involve dragons. Players who find and score on the Golden Keys can double their points.  The decor is handmade and hand-painted with mostly wood, stain, and other basic materials to be kept as realistic to the Renaissance as possible. It’s themed like a medieval castle with amazing dragon artwork on the walls.  Games are a medieval twist on yard games and some are completely original, with a cohesive storyline and period music playing for ambiance, so players really become immersed in being a knight.  It doesn’t have to be a one-time thing — participants can return to play the game over and over to compete with friends or improve their personal best. It’s also very family-friendly — ages six and up are recommended, but younger children can participate with a larger group.  The new game is a collaboration between Live Action Escapes in Worcester and The Gate Escape in Leominster. Michael Paquette and Rene Sorette, the respective owners, have been long-time friends.  “They met for the first time at an escape room owners’ meet-up in 2016. They learned very quickly that as much of a competitive business escape rooms are, the owners are also a community of entrepreneurs and artists working together to grow the escape room industry … if players experience the games that one company currently offers, why not send them to go play the games enjoyed at other escape rooms?” said Sabrina Paquin, office manager at Live Action Escapes.  Sharing a game was a natural extension. With “Quest for the Golden Keys”, The Gate Escape had the location providing enough space at 375 Harvard St. in Leominster and Live Action Escapes had the game.  The quest started as a portable rental, a replayable game option offered by Live Action Escapes to accommodate extra-large group events that were too big for their business location.  It now has grown in its permanent base and takes up a 3600 square foot room at The Gate Escape, with alterations and improvements to better fit the new room and improve the overall experience to fit the new location.  But they have other games that can still be rented as portable games to people looking to bring escape games home or to a different venue.  Escape games have grown in popularity since Live Action Escapes and The Gate Escape both started in 2016 with 45-minute games. The former was the 129th escape room in the U.S., and now there are thousands.  “Escape rooms are a fun way to get people together and do something different! They require you to think outside the box and let your imagination run wild. There are endless possibilities in how a puzzle could be solved. Really challenging your brain in ways everyday life might not. These types of games also promote good problem-solving skills, out-of-the-box thinking, and teamwork. You’re stuck in a room with a group of people, whether you know them all or not, you will work together to achieve the same goal, and win!”, said Amanda Paquin, general manager of Live Action Escapes.  She continued, “The setting, solving the puzzles, and the time limit releases dopamine, known as the ‘happy hormone.’ So when you unlock something, that ‘ah ha!’ exciting moment lifts your mood and plays a role in your ability to think, focus, and plan. Escape rooms aren’t just fun, they’re good for your brain!”  Both companies also have other escape games at their respective locations, intricately designed with their own storylines and objectives, usually meant to be completed within a sixty-minute limit, and built by them. All different, but mostly an investigation or mystery.  “The Quest for the Golden Keys” is different because it has more of a “faire or field day” said Amanda, with players competing against each other to score points rather than a typical escape room experience with a team objective, “giving each player a chance to hone their skills” every time they play.  Normally, employees at escape rooms are called the “Game Masters” but at this new game they’ll be “Quest Masters.” They greet players, give them instructions, answer questions, monitor the game, check on activity stations, and give clues as needed to make sure things are running smoothly.  They also reset the game for its next players, which can take only eight minutes for those who know how the game plays and its answers well and have memorized all the passcodes for the locks, but sometimes a group can check or move everything, and then it can take a lot longer.  “With the theme of the game, fans of Renaissance fairs and medieval roleplaying games would [especially] have a blast,” Sabrina said, but “everyone should play at least once.”  The game can accommodate up to 40 players per hour, making it ideal for large groups such as scout troops, family reunions, or a work team-building event.  Game stations require some physical activity like walking, talking, and using a bow, so if groups have players with physical limitations they should reach out before making a reservation to ensure everyone will be able to get the most out of the game.  They have plans to rotate and add stations to keep things “fresh and interesting” and repeatedly playable, Amanda said. “We designed a place that we would want to go!”  The new quest will open on Friday, June 2. Reservations opened on Wednesday, May 17 on questforthegoldenkeys.com. It will run indefinitely year-round.  More new games are to come from both companies, separately and together, in even more locations. In fact, Live Action Escapes will soon open a second location in Worcester with four escape room games, an art gallery featuring local artists, and a new original experience called “SmashLanes.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnRpbmVsYW5kZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9saXZlLWFjdGlvbi1yb2xlLXBsYXlpbmctZ2FtZS1maW5kcy1wZXJtYW5lbnQtaG9tZS1pbi1sZW9taW5zdGVy0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VudGluZWxhbmRlbnRlcnByaXNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2xpdmUtYWN0aW9uLXJvbGUtcGxheWluZy1nYW1lLWZpbmRzLXBlcm1hbmVudC1ob21lLWluLWxlb21pbnN0ZXIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

After a disappointing 4-6 road trip, the Rays are looking to regroup Friday night as they open a three-game series with the Milwaukee Brewers in St. Petersburg, Fla.  ""We just have to move on,"" Rays outfielder Josh Lowe said. ""We'll come out (Friday) and get back after it.""  The Rays dropped two of three at the New York Mets, including a 3-2 setback on Thursday afternoon. Lowe was a bright spot at the plate, collecting a double and home run.  ""I'm just trying to stay within myself,"" Lowe said postgame Thursday. ""Like I've been saying all year -- just get good pitches to hit, and putting good swings on those pitches over the plate.""  Tampa Bay opens a 10-game homestand after being on the road for 10 days.  Shane McClanahan (7-0, 2.34 ERA) will be on the mound for the Rays. The left-hander has never faced Milwaukee.  The Brewers will turn to right-hander Adrian Houser (0-0, 5.19), who has never pitched against Tampa Bay.  Losing close ones was the story for the Rays on the road. They dropped five by one run and the other by two.  ""Two or three games didn't go our way,"" manager Kevin Cash said. ""We were close in a couple, but close doesn't necessarily cut it.""  In recent games, Tampa Bay witnessed one of its top players start to snap out of a slump. Brandon Lowe entered the series with the Mets in a 4-for-48 skid, but in the first two games at New York, he went 4-for-8 with a home run.  For Milwaukee, Houser opened the season on the 15-day injured list due to a right groin strain, and he made his season debut on May 7. This will be his third start, and he has yet to complete five full innings. In his first outing, he worked 4 2/3 innings, and he went four innings in his last outing, a no-decision against the Kansas City Royals.  The Brewers head to Tampa Bay after dropping two of three at the St. Louis Cardinals. The club had a day off Thursday, which gave them a chance to regroup.  Against the Cardinals, the Brewers scored four runs in three games, and endured a tough 18-1 loss on Monday. After pulling off a 3-2 win on Tuesday, Milwaukee was blanked 3-0 on Wednesday.  ""They outplayed us,"" Brewers right-hander Corbin Burns told MLB.com. ""They smacked us around the first night, we responded well (on Tuesday) night and then we came out and played flat.""  Milwaukee played its last two games without Christian Yelich, who has been dealing with a stiff back.  The Brewers, one of the serious contenders to win the National League Central, have been like many of the anticipated favorites this season. They haven't put it all together yet.  ""We have stretches where we play really well, and then we have stretches where we come out and play flat and lose some series that we probably shouldn't lose,"" Burns said. ""We'll regroup. We have an off day and then get after it with (the Rays), on paper the best team in baseball.""  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC9yYXlzLW9wZW4tMTAtZ2FtZS1ob21lc3RhbmQtYWdhaW5zdC1icmV3ZXJzLTIwMjMtMDUtMTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2018-12-05","Not Discerned","{""Kyoto"", ""Kyoto"", ""Japan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:07:32","Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom—the latest iteration of a series created in 1986—is likely the Game of the Year. You may have seen it on the front page of The New York Times or you may have bought one of the 10 million copies it sold in its first three days. For my book All Your Base Are Belong to Us, Shigeru Miyamoto told me he was inspired to create the series after remembering a scouting field trip he took as a child near his home in Kyoto. Tears of the Kingdom comes almost 40 years after the original, and its brilliance is that the hundreds who worked on it know precisely how to lure players into fantasy worlds of excitement and emotion.  That’s seen from moment one when the series leads, elf-human Link and Princess Zelda, find themselves in the murky, subterranean gloom beneath Hyrule castle, where the young royal has been told never to tread. Armed with a torch and descending into the depths (the single piano notes rising in tension with every step), the two discover hieroglyphics which begin to explain the kingdom’s violent history. Immediately, you know you have to solve the mystery of the Hyrulian ages.  It’s happily unusual that Zelda is with you to begin the story. Often, she’s in the background or needs to be found and saved. But now, she’ll share the adventure! Silent, never-speaking Link will have a smart, loquacious pal. Only just as you settle into having a constant partner in crime, she’s taken away by evil forces. In an apocalyptic tragedy of bright red fire and earthquakes, she begins to fall into nothingness. Link reaches out for her, but can’t grasp her hand. (In fact, Link’s right hand seems to be damaged.) Once again, as through video game time immemorial, you must save the princess.  You want to. It’s set up that way. In these first minutes, the game makers have assembled a human bond. Zelda is an intelligent but caring friend, not royalty as much as a peer. There’s a need to find this important compatriot.  After ascending the rocky steps to daylight with a new arm that has a number of powers to unlock, you take a leap off a cliff, a seeming swan dive of doom. Descending from high above through the clouds feels a little like the start of a quick game of Fortnite, but there’s no fighting against 100 others to be the last one standing. It’s just you as Link landing with a loud splash into a lake, which also protects you from enemies while you swim. That descent isn’t Nintendo lifting an idea. It’s Nintendo reinventing the best to create something new that fits perfectly.  There’s also a riff on Minecraft and Roblox present in the vast kingdom of Hyrule: players craft things to move forward. The Ultrahand, your bionic appendage, leads you to lift massive things like walls, put things together, even make weapons. Toys and games that involve making things have been around since well before Lincoln Logs were invented more than a century ago — kids have used sticks for games since prehistoric times. The thing is, no matter if it’s the Fallout or Borderlands series, I’m not a fan of taking the time to construct items to help solve puzzles or beat ever-present forces of evil. I like pushing boxes around to make steps. That’s as far as it goes. Especially in a world as immense as this I want to get to the adventure and explore the expanse of new lands. I also want to listen to the subtle but perfectly spare soundtrack, reminiscent of early Laurie Anderson.  Putting three logs together to cross a broken bridge, as Tears of the Kingdom asks, takes too much time. I’d rather learn about the lore of Hyrule by talking to its varied, often lovable residents. The tales they tell are nuanced and considerable. It seems like every non-playable character has a personalized, compelling story. That’s what kept me going in “Elden Ring,” the wildly idiosyncratic denizens.  Not wanting to create my own things in Zelda may make me sound lazy, or maybe like I don’t want to think while playing. Rather, it’s that I prefer thinking in a different way about the world within Tears of the Kingdom. I got used to my tasks, but using Ultrahand took me out of Hyrule for just a little too long. And placing the items I made I encountered a spatial issue that sometimes led me to drop, say, a sailboat, over a precipice and into the nothingness of sky.  It’s easy enough to get back into Tears of the Kingdom with its puzzles, demons, and layers of Hyrule, the Surface, the Sky and the Depths. While riding vehicles like rockets in the sky is fun, I still like the terra firma best. Peppered throughout is something of a pastoral essence with frogs, birds—all manner of flora and fauna. You notice purple smoke, signals of colorful Great Fairy Fountains, first introduced in Breath of the Wild, but made more beautiful here. These allow you to upgrade your weapons.  The dazzling lands and varied residents along the way keep you going through scores of hours. It makes the price increase to $70 worth it. The successful recipe includes the right amount of humor and nods to other forms of ancient and pop culture. For instance, the one-hour final boss battle is called The Menace Unleashed, an homage to the Star Wars series. But it’s not George Lucas. It’s dreamy and celestial, this battle of all Zelda battles. At the end, without revealing spoilers, it isn’t a castle or kingdom which indicates great wealth or power. It’s something between Zelda and Link, the bond that survives. It’s not corny, not cliche. It’s just about the richness of love and friendship.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvdGhlLWxlZ2VuZC1vZi16ZWxkYS10ZWFycy1vZi10aGUta2luZ2RvbS1yZXZpZXctbGlrZWx5LXRoZS1nYW1lLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, one analyst said there were recent examples of unnamed Take-Two competitors offering discounts on some AAA games “within days and weeks” of their release.  Over two years since the $70 price point was adopted by some publishers for their current-gen games, are players still struggling to come to terms with it somewhat, they asked.  Lego 2K Drive | Director's Cut Reveal Trailer | Coming May 19  “We’re not seeing a pushback on frontline price,” Zelnick responded (transcribed by VGC). “What we’re seeing is consumers are seeking to limit their spending by going either to the stuff they really, really care about, blockbusters, or to value, and sometimes it could be both. And the good news is, we have a bunch of blockbusters and we have a wonderful catalogue.”  One recent example of a Take-Two release that failed to meet expectations was Marvel’s Midnight Suns. It came out last December priced at $70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and $60 on PC, but the publisher discounted all versions of the game by 33% a month after release.  “The other news is we have a robust frontline release schedule and without regard to price, there has been some pressure, as a result, if a consumer sees something that’s interesting but not necessarily yet a huge blockbuster,” Zelnick continued.  “We think that will change. This is a growth business, and this is a unique market, and nothing that’s going on now is inconsistent with the view that we outlined during the pandemic. We said at that time that we were benefitting greatly from people being at home due to an odd turn of events.  “And we set out expectations that post-pandemic, we as an industry would be at a better place than pre-pandemic, and at a worse place than during a time when people were sheltering at home. And that’s exactly what’s happened, exacerbated by a challenging, mixed economy, and what I believe is a recession, at least if you look at it through the lens of people who purvey digital entertainment consumed at home and ecommerce suppliers, there’s a lot of pressure in those markets.”  In August 2020, Take-Two’s NBA 2K21 was announced as the first current-gen game to be priced at $70. Sony and Activision also decided to charge $70 for their big new releases at the start of the current console cycle.  EA and Square Enix soon followed suit, with the Final Fantasy publisher even bringing the new price point to some of its PC games.  Microsoft and Nintendo released their first $70 games this month. Ubisoft has said its long-delayed Skull & Bones will be its first $70 title, and Sega recently said it was considering raising game prices too.  Zelnick said on Wednesday that Rockstar owner Take-Two is forecasting a sharp jump in sales during its fiscal year starting in April 2024, driven by the release of “several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry”.  He also said he thinks it’s likely there’ll be mid-generation console refreshes during the current cycle, and discussed Take-Two’s plans to continue supporting Switch and last-gen consoles","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpZGVvZ2FtZXNjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvdGFrZS10d28tc2F5cy1pdHMtbm90LXNlZWluZy1wdXNoYmFjay1mcm9tLXBsYXllcnMtb24tNzAtZ2FtZS1wcmljaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-18","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 20:45:07","Steamforged Games, the British company behind tabletop crossovers like Elden Ring: The Board Game and Dark Souls: The Roleplaying Game launched and successfully funded a new product Thursday. The Kickstarter campaign for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne The Board Game began at 1 p.m. EDT and has already crossed the finish line with the equivalent of more than $620,000 pledged. The campaign runs through June 1, with an estimated delivery date of November 2024.  The announcement and successful funding of Iceborne comes amid a flurry of news about Steamforged. On Monday, the company said that it had completed shipment of the last 174 copies of Monster Hunter World: The Board Game to eager backers around the world. Then, on Tuesday, Dicebreaker reported that the company had previously laid off some 20% of its staff in March of this year. Steamforged characterized that move as a restructuring, not a sign of financial weakness. The company quickly bounced back Thursday morning by announcing a long-term, four-game partnership with Kickstarter — a first-of-its-kind partnership for the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding pioneer. Steamforged simultaneously launched and funded Iceborne.  Steamforged burst onto the scene in 2016 with Dark Souls: The Board Game. It went on to stack one success on top of the other, using Kickstarter to promote and successfully fund many more video game crossover titles inspired by Resident Evil, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Monster Hunter. It’s biggest misstep, however, has been with the Dark Souls tabletop RPG. The initial print run of the book was so riddled with errors and inaccuracies that the company opted to reprint the book free of charge for its most loyal early adopters.  According to Steamforged and Kickstarter’s joint announcement, the partnership between the two companies will include “collaborating on educational content for emerging games creators as a way to support the next generation of tabletop publishers.”  Kickstarter used the occasion to push back against the idea that Kickstarter is, in some way, detrimental to the ongoing health of small businesses, creating a boom-and-bust revenue cycle that many creators have mentioned to Polygon in the past.  “There’s a common misconception that creators need to ‘graduate’ from Kickstarter but, especially in the tabletop industry, that isn’t the case,” Kickstarter’s chief strategy officer Jon Leland said in the company’s blog post. “This partnership with one of our biggest tabletop games publishers is a testament to the fact that Kickstarter can be part of an ongoing business model that works beyond initial success. This is the first time we’ve done a partnership like this and we’re hoping to continue finding impactful and creative ways to deepen our relationships with creators of all sizes, across all categories.”  Tabletop games remain the single largest source of crowdfunding income for Kickstarter, comprising roughly one third of its total revenue from backers. In 2022 the company saw the first decline in tabletop revenues since 2014.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzI4OTgzL21vbnN0ZXItaHVudGVyLXdvcmxkLWljZWJvcm5lLWtpY2tzdGFydGVyLWxheW9mZnMtc3RlYW1mb3JnZWTSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM3Mjg5ODMvbW9uc3Rlci1odW50ZXItd29ybGQtaWNlYm9ybmUta2lja3N0YXJ0ZXItbGF5b2Zmcy1zdGVhbWZvcmdlZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

So certainly a three-game series against each other ought to have both teams figuring this would be a good time to make some gains. Those matchups begin Friday night in Washington.  The Nationals return home with a three-game losing streak after they were swept in a series at Miami. They lost those three games by a total of four runs.  ""We've got to stay with the good things we did and turn the page (Friday),"" Nationals third baseman Jeimer Candelario said. ""At home, we've got to dominate from the first inning to the ninth.""  The Tigers had an off day Thursday for their second idle day of the week. They went 2-3 on a five-game homestand that ended with Wednesday's 8-0 setback to the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Detroit has been a shutout victim in three of its last seven games. The offense continues to take untimely dips, squashing momentum that tends to be building.  ""We're not all where we need to be yet,"" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. ""We've got to do a lot of work, but the vibe is great.""  Center fielder Matt Vierling had the Tigers' only hit in Wednesday's game. Detroit has been so mundane offensively that only one batter in its most recent game finished with a batting average above .250 for the season.  The Tigers will try to get going against Nationals rookie right-hander Jake Irvin (1-1, 4.11 ERA).  This will be Irvin's fourth big-league appearance since he was called up from Triple-A Syracuse. His only rough outing was the most recent one, when he suffered the loss to the New York Mets, allowing six runs in 4 2/3 innings.  Still, Irvin's contributions have been important across the past couple of weeks.  ""Jake has done well,"" manager Davey Martinez said. ""I want to continue to get him an opportunity. ... With some of our young guys, the innings are going to build up.""  Until splitting with Pittsburgh, the Tigers had won all four series this season against National League opponents.  Those results might bode well for this upcoming season, and they've also put Detroit in a decent situation a month and a half into the season.  ""As we've won a little bit more, I've seen a great spirit and personality on this team build,"" Hinch said.  Left-hander Matthew Boyd (2-3, 6.47 ERA) of the Tigers will try to get back on track. He had a rough stint last Friday, giving up six runs -- five earned -- in 1 1/3 innings to the Seattle Mariners.  Boyd has pitched in 166 career games in the major leagues, but none of those has come against the Nationals. He has only pitched for American League teams.  Joey Meneses had one of the most productive bats in Washington's lineup in last weekend's home series, but he's absent for now as he was placed on the paternity list. That makes it uncertain when he might return to the lineup. His nine-game hitting streak ended Tuesday before he missed the past two games.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC90aWdlcnMtbmF0aW9uYWxzLWVhY2gtc2VlLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LXVwY29taW5nLTMtZ2FtZS1zZXJpZXMtMjAyMy0wNS0xOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

About a month later, Kings sharpshooter Kevin Huerter looked back on Curry’s historic performance and admitted that it played a part in slowly breaking Sacramento’s spirit before being eliminated.  “In the fourth quarter, I think what broke our spirit, like as they continued to make shots -- tough shots -- we weren’t making the ones that we were used to making and we were turning the ball over,” Huerter said on a recent episode of “The Old Man and the Three,"" which was released Thursday.  “And so it was like we wanted it so bad, especially in that fourth quarter trying to make a run, and not shooting well and it was like, ‘Alright, at some point, we’re going to see one go down, we’re going to get a turnover and go on a mini run.' It just never happened.  “And then Steph on the flip side was giving us 50. So I wouldn’t say our spirit broke until we knew, I think when [Kings coach] Mike [Brown] took us out at the end of the game and they just put in our subs and that was it.”  Curry finished the game with 50 points, eight rebounds and six assists on 20-of-38 shooting from the field and 7 of 18 from 3-point range, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50 points in a Game 7 until Boston Celtics star forward Jayson Tatum dropped 51 against the Philadelphia 76ers two weeks later.  Huerter called Curry’s performance “unbelievable” and said Golden State’s ability to get hot at any given moment and go on a deep run was a focus for Sacramento heading into the game.  “Add Klay [Thompson] to that bunch, when Steph gets going it feels like Klay always has a 3 mixed in there too, and Jordan Poole has the ability to do it at times. But for us, it was not letting them get to that point.  “That was a big emphasis for us, especially going on the road, if they make a 3, we need to score a layup on the other end every time they make a 3, cause they’re going to make one and they’re going to celebrate, they’re going to point to the crowd, and if we can lay the ball in, that’ll break their spirit.  “But Golden State is just known to do that. When they go on those runs, they’re impossible to stop.”  Even though their game plan fell apart in their final game of the season, the Kings learned their lessons. Surely, this won't be the last time these teams meet.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYmF5YXJlYS9raW5ncy9ob3ctc3RlcGgtY3Vycnktd2FycmlvcnMtYnJva2Uta2luZ3Mtc3Bpcml0LWdhbWUtNy1rZXZpbi1odWVydGVy0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2tpbmdzL2hvdy1zdGVwaC1jdXJyeS13YXJyaW9ycy1icm9rZS1raW5ncy1zcGlyaXQtZ2FtZS03LWtldmluLWh1ZXJ0ZXI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2018-07-24","22:00:00","{""Redmond"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:29:42","Since its launch in 2017, Microsoft has convinced over 25 million people to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a substantial library of Xbox Game Pass titles. For those not as interested in a monthly subscription, though, Microsoft is now floating a potential model where players could view an ad in exchange for a short period of game time.  The nod toward potential ad-supported game time comes from Xbox Corporate VP for Game Creator Experience and Ecosystem Sarah Bond, who told Rolling Stone UK that she's constantly looking to ""introduce more business model diversity"" for game developers.  ""We’ve talked about how we’re experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile—are there models of that that work well in PC and console?"" Bond said. ""Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that?""  Would players tolerate it?  Bond's tease comes a few months after some Game Pass players noticed a Spanish-language survey gauging their interest in a cheaper Game Pass tier that included ""advertisements before the game"" (reminiscent of Netflix's recent ad-supported tier rollout ). And Insider reported last year that Microsoft was working with ad agencies to ""let advertisers place ads inside free-to-play Xbox games"" (expanding on the current practice of ads running on the Xbox dashboard).  Microsoft's signaled interest in attaching ads to games isn't new; the company bought in-game ad network Massive in 2006 before shutting it down in 2010. That effort was part of a rising wave of in-game ad interest that crested during the early years of the millennium.  Advertisement  But that wave of in-game advertising in console games was overwhelmingly focused on messages placed in game worlds, like messages plastered on in-game billboards or even NPCs hawking other games . One in-game ad study from 2009 warned developers not to interrupt the game experience and found marketing that ""obstruct[s] the game’s flow might ruin the whole effort and generate irreparable damage"" to a brand.  Since then, mobile gamers have widely accepted interstitial video ads as the price they pay to enjoy many free-to-play titles (though the frequency and length of those ad breaks can vary widely). But it's less clear if these kinds of ad breaks would be as welcome during loading screens or between levels of high-end console games.  ""There’s an understanding by gamers that [free-to-play] games will carry ads, but that understanding isn’t necessarily there for AAA-quality games,"" Naavik analyst Fawzi Itani wrote last year. ""How will players react if ads are placed in these experiences? Since Xbox Game Pass already provides so much value as a bundle, these ads have to be very unintrusive to maintain a suspension of disbelief core to the game experience.""  Bond seemed to acknowledge this elsewhere in the Rolling Stone interview, saying that any gaming business model should have ""an endemic link to the nature of the gameplay. ... Providing creators with options and choice enables them to experiment and do what they like and actually create more immersive and creative experiences without having to fit into a mold.""  Finding those new revenue-generating options could be a key focus for Microsoft, which has seen Game Pass subscription growth slow down in recent months. And regardless of subscriber numbers, analyst firm DFC Intelligence recently said that Game Pass ""does not appear to be a sustainable long-term business model,"" largely because of how much valuable first-party content Microsoft has to include to attract those subscribers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2dhbWluZy8yMDIzLzA1L21pY3Jvc29mdC1oaW50cy1hdC1sZXR0aW5nLXBsYXllcnMtd2F0Y2gtYWRzLWZvci10aW1lZC1zbGljZXMtb2YtZ2FtZXMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hcnN0ZWNobmljYS5jb20vZ2FtaW5nLzIwMjMvMDUvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWhpbnRzLWF0LWxldHRpbmctcGxheWVycy13YXRjaC1hZHMtZm9yLXRpbWVkLXNsaWNlcy1vZi1nYW1lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","1996-07-12","Not Discerned","{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:08:42","Thursday’s Game Report: Cardinals 16, Dodgers 8  By Rob Rains  When the Cardinals were swept by the Dodgers in Los Angeles last month, they scored a combined total of six runs and did not hit a home run in the three games.  It was payback time on Thursday night.  The Cardinals tied a franchise record by hitting seven home runs, including two each from Willson Contreras and Nolan Gorman, to pound the Dodgers in the opener of a four-game series at Busch Stadium.  Four of the home runs came in the third inning, including back-to-back-to-back blasts from Juan Yepez, Gorman and Paul DeJong after Contreras had hit his first of the game earlier in the inning.  The Cardinals had a 9-2 lead at one point in the game but the Dodgers pulled within 9-8 before a seven-run eighth inning put the game away, including the second homers of the night from Contreras and Gorman.  Gorman has 12 home runs for the year, tied for third in the NL, and his 36 RBIs ranks second in the league, two more than Arenado.  The big offensive night helped Adam Wainwright pick up his first victory of the season and the 196th win of his career.  It was only the second time the Cardinals hit seven homers in a game at home; the other coming on May 7, 1940 at Sportsman’s Park – against the Brooklyn Dodgers. That was also the last time the Cardinals scored 16 or more runs in a game against the Dodgers, winning 18-2.  The combined total of nine homers were the most in game at Busch Stadium 3.  The win was the ninth in the Cardinals’ last 11 games.  Here is how Thursday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Both of Contreras’ home runs were three-run shots, tying his career high of six RBIs … Nolan Arenado also homered, his sixth in the last seven games, a two-run blast in the fourth that allowed him to match his career high by driving in at least one run in eight consecutive games … Gorman’s first home run of the night was the first of his career off a lefthanded pitcher … Yepez’s home run came as a pinch-hitter … Oscar Mercado, recalled from Memphis on Wednesday, got the start in left field and went 3-of-4 with two stolen bases, including a delayed steal of home, and scored three runs … The only other time the Cardinals hit four home runs in an inning at home was on June 6, 1948 and this was the first time since 1957 the Cardinals had multiple innings in which they scored six or more runs.  On the mound: After allowing two runs in the first inning, Wainwright pitched into the sixth inning, when an error by Goldschmidt led to a third run … After Wainwright left the game, Genesis Cabrera gave up a grand slam to Freddie Freeman and a leadoff homer to Max Muncy in the seventh that reduced the Cardinals lead to 9-8 … Drew VerHagen allowed two hits but got out of the seventh without allowing the tying run and Jordan Hicks retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth, also protecting the one-run lead.  Key stat: The Cardinals have now hit 20 home runs over their seven games and 33 so far in their first 16 games in May, tying them with the Yankees and Braves for the most in the majors this month.  Worth noting: Edman had to come out of the game with what was described as “lower abdominal soreness” after he and Lars Nootbaar collided in the outfield in the second inning while chasing a fly ball, which Edman caught … The last time the Cardinals hit seven homers in a game was July 12, 1996 against the Cubs in Chicago … The errors by Goldschmidt and Paul DeJong were the first committed by the Cardinals in their last 10 games … After losing the first game of each of their first 11 series of the season, the Cardinals have now won the first game of their last four series … The three stolen bases extended the Cardinals streak without having a runner caught stealing to 19 steals in a row, dating back to April 26 … Contreras became the first Cardinals’ catcher with six RBIs in a game since Tom Pagnozzi did it in 1991.  Looking ahead: Steven Matz will get the start on Friday night in the second game of the series.

Register here.  Talofa Games has launched Run Legends, a mobile game that turns walking or running into a game as you engage in co-op fitness battles with friends around the world.  Run Legends is available today on the Apple App Store as well as the Google Play Store, said Jenny Xu, founder and CEO of Cupertino, California-based Talofa, in an interview with GamesBeat.  Run Legends is a movement game where you unleash attacks and special skills as you walk or run. You can use these skills to defeat the villainous Sappers who are draining humanity’s energy. Level up your gear, make new friends, and learn more about the world of Run Legends as you level up your fitness in real life.  “Fitness and gaming do not need to be mutually exclusive, and we are extremely proud to build a game that enables players to improve their health while having fun and playing with friends. We look forward to working with our players to scale this new social fitness experience and create a happier, healthier world,” said Xu.  Event GamesBeat Summit 2023 Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.  Register Here  But what sets Run Legends apart from other fitness games is that it lets you play in real-time alongside your friends in a co-op mode, no matter where they are in the world. Whether running around your neighborhood or walking on the beach, you can control your character’s movements and unleash powerful attacks by moving faster or slower.  “The goal of the game is to run and walk outside to fight Sappers, which are enemies that represent real-life anxieties,” Xu said. “So players are building mental and physical health as they upgrade their gear. They can make friends as it’s a cooperative game, but they can also learn more about the players’ character backstories.”  You can play with different character classes to take on different types of enemies. Each session takes around five minutes to 15 minutes to play.  “It’s short, but meant to get people moving,” Xu said. “You can run or walk to play. What we do differently is that we set the game’s difficulty level to where the player calibrates it. So you can actually play no matter what skill level you’re at in the real world. Somebody who is an Olympic athlete can play with somebody who just got off the couch, and not feel any worse about their performance, because what we reward is consistency rather than physical ability.”  Run Legends takes a unique approach to promoting mental and physical health by using a storyline that involves battling and overcoming symbolic representations of anxiety and fear, like the Critical Grandma.  During the open beta period of the game, friendships were forged between players from South Korea, Ukraine, the U.S., and dozens of other countries, who regularly worked together to defeat enemies by joining the same missions, Xu said.  The most active players have logged hundreds of miles by playing an early version of the game. That’s easy to do when the virtual announcer, the Operator, is calling out your team’s actions and accomplishments, to keep you fully immersed in the midst of epic battles.  “We’ve already had players tell us about how they’ve lost five pounds, found slivers of their former selves, and gotten more quality time with their dogs through Run Legends,” said Xu.  The game has unlockable missions and rewards, events with leaderboards and prizes, invite codes to send to your teammates for co-op battles, collectible resources to craft into new gear that support a variety of movement styles and tactical roles and customizable pace settings so players of any skill level can be the MVP of their team.  You can buy virtual currency in the game and in the future there will be battle passes, cosmetics, and powerups. But for now, the company is going to try to get as many users as it can. Xu said the game is targeting GenZ audiences as well as anyone who wants to exercise.  A long run  I first met Xu when her team won the grand prize for the Niantic Beyond Reality Contest in 2019. For that contest, Xu and her family created Run to My Heart. Then going by JC Soft, the company created a social running game built on the Niantic Real World Platform, where you had to run in the real world to certain locations in order achieve goals in the game.  “This is the spiritual evolution of that game where we won the contest,” Xu said. “It has come a long way.”  As a concept, the game has been in the works for four years. In the middle of that time, Xu decided to reboot the whole project and start again from scratch.  “We had this whole game story world that had to just be thrown away,” Xu said. “That was probably the hardest reset. We had to cut the team and bring in new people. So it was a really hard time.”  When the company pivoted, it shifted to using the Unity game engine.  About the same time in 2021, the company shifted from being a bootstrapped studio to raising VC funding. The company has a team of seven people now, as well as six contractors.  “That also changed how we thought about it. We now want to make this into like a much larger thing and with a much larger team,” Xu said.  The company also went through Apple’s Entrepreneur Camp, and that made it easy to onboard the game onto the iOS platform.  The Talofa team has been built up with game veterans from Riot Games, EA, and thatgamecompany. Xu has created mobile games with over 10 million downloads. The company hasn’t announced how much money it has raised.  “This has just been a dream project for me coming from making indie games for over 13 years. I started when I was 12. I was a runner and a collegiate athlete,” Xu said. “The combination of these two things and my interest in mental health all manifested into this one product. And I think that the authenticity of that love is one of the more special things that our players have picked up on. It’s like, wow, the devs really love this game. And I think that’s what’s going to help us at launch.”  A new audio feature  Run Legends has been in the works since 2019.  Apple welcomed Xu’s company into the camp because it was using audio in a novel way.  “They liked the fact that we use spatial audio, which is a relatively new feature,” she said. “When you have Air Pods, and you turn your head, they allow you to actually move within the virtual space. The game is uses interactive audio and immersive audio. And we rely on that because we don’t want somebody to look at their screen while running outside. They’re actually just relying on audio experience. And when they turn their head, they’ll hear like the enemy in front of them. And then they turn and now it’s on their left side of their head. So that like real world, immersiveness is also really important to like the experience of the game, and making it feel very different from what’s out there.”  The company has been in testing in the U.S., Ukraine, Russia, and South Korea. The company found users through Discord and Twitter, and more than 20,000 people have played it. On Google, more than 25,000 people preregistered to play.  “The community is super interested in it,” she said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL3RhbG9mYS1nYW1lcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1ydW4tbGVnZW5kcy1maXRuZXNzLWJhdHRsZS1tb2JpbGUtZ2FtZS_SAV9odHRwczovL3ZlbnR1cmViZWF0LmNvbS9nYW1lcy90YWxvZmEtZ2FtZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcnVuLWxlZ2VuZHMtZml0bmVzcy1iYXR0bGUtbW9iaWxlLWdhbWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Teravainen, 28, broke his hand on a slash from New York Islanders forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau in Game 2 of their first-round series. He had surgery to repair the hand and missed the remainder of that series and the Hurricanes' six-game second-round series win over the New Jersey Devils.  There were encouraging signs for his progress this week. On Monday, he shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice. Then it became a matter of whether the hand was rehabbed enough to play.  ""I'm not going to throw him in if he can't shoot,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said.  Teravainen was an active participant in the Hurricanes' morning skate ahead of Thursday's Game 1 against the Florida Panthers. He took line rushes with center Eric Staal and winger Martin Necas.

The coach said Teravainen is an elite passer and ""one of our better defenders.""  Teravainen had 12 goals and 25 assists in 68 games this season and was scoreless in two playoff games.

"game","2024-07-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:01:26","Disclosure: Humble Bundle, the publisher of Lost Skies, is owned by Ziff Davis, the parent company of IGN. Humble Bundle and IGN operate completely independently, and no special consideration is given to Humble Bundle announcements or promotions for coverage.  Bossa Games, developer of I Am Bread, I Am Fish, and Surgeon Simulator, has announced its next game. It’s called Lost Skies, and in many ways, it’s a significant departure from Bossa’s previous humorous sandbox efforts.  Loading Play  Lost Skies is an upcoming open-world, co-op adventure where up to six players work together to explore a world composed of floating islands, build flying ships, and take on gigantic monsters. It’s planned for a PC launch in 2024, but will enter what Bossa calls “open development” later this year, allowing the community to access and test vertical slices and offer feedback to shape Lost Skies’ development.  Expecting the Unexpected  According to Bossa Games CEO Henrique Olifiers, Lost Skies is able to be played single player as well as co-op, and single player play is in fact incentivized at times to assist the overall cooperative efforts of a group. He tells us that combat includes two components. One is “ground” combat, where “ground” is used a bit loosely because, per Olifiers, everyone will be hook-shotting around “Spider-Man-style” in very vertical spaces. The other is ship combat, with customizable flying ships built to tackle much larger creatures that serve as both enemies and puzzles.  While he’s not willing to share too many deep details about gameplay just yet, Olifiers described the two “drivers” of gameplay as surviving the world, and fighting these massive “guardian” creatures with friends, one in each of Lost Skies’ regions. With those two drivers, Olifiers adds that he wants players to feel a sense of freedom - similar to the freedom of Bossa's previous smaller sandboxes - that they are “always looking at something on the horizon” that sparks curiosity and strategy. He wants players to feel they can do anything they can imagine.  “I have this saying that ‘A good game is when something that you didn't expect took place,’ ” he says. “The fondest memories I have of multiplayer games was when in Ultima I was standing there when someone exploited the [fire field] bug to kill Lord British in the game, or when I go into raids in World of Warcraft, and my friends ask, ‘Who's got the potions?’ and we look at each other: ‘What potions?’ That's what we go to the pub later to talk about. So we want to create those in Lost Skies. Every hour one of those [experiences] happens, and the only way for us to craft that is to give players the means to play in the way they want.”  When we spoke with Olifiers ahead of Lost Skies’ announcement, we asked why the studio was going in such a grander, more adventurous direction after years of games where you play as a slice of bread trying to make its way to a toaster through a room full of hazards. Olifiers acknowledged that Lost Skies was a shift in “form and theme” from previous Bossa games, and said the studio’s reasoning came out of its long-standing development process of constantly doing internal game jams.  According to Olifiers, every Bossa game is made out of a game jam, and the studio has dozens of internal prototypes that never see the light of day. But, he continues, this means that all of Bossa’s games historically have been started from scratch: because they’re not building on the foundation of something else, development takes a lot of time.  So Bossa Games wants to focus, and through discussion the team found that many of its members were excited by co-op survival games and building such as Valheim, Project Zomboid, and 7 Days to Die. In focusing on that space and game jamming in it very specifically for a time, Bossa came up with Lost Skies.  Returning to Worlds Adrift  Notably, Lost Skies is meant to take place in the same universe as its previously shuttered MMO, Worlds Adrift. Worlds Adrift entered early access in 2017, but was discontinued two years later due to the game no longer being commercially viable. We asked Olifiers why Bossa was revisiting that universe despite the struggles its first endeavor had.  “We tried well to put to good use all the hindsight that we had with Worlds Adrift,” he says. “What worked, and what didn't work, and to create a brand new game in that universe that so many people fell in love with and we never could fully realize…Hindsight is super useful. You have the advantage of going back and doing something again, but, with that experience, it's like riding a bicycle. You never ride a bicycle well the first time you do it.”  “ You never ride a bicycle well the first time you do it.  One way Bossa is working to ensure the success of Lost Skies is by releasing it early in “open development.” Olifiers says that currently Bossa has a group of a few hundred community members with full access to game builds who are giving feedback and actively discussing with Bossa devs what they want to see from Lost Skies. The plan is to slowly grow this community over time.  While this might seem like a risky strategy, Olifiers says it’s one Bossa has a lot of experience with in its past games. It has a website, Bossa Presents, where it shows off “weird and wonderful prototypes” for community feedback, and Olifiers says I Am Fish specifically was the result of a game jam prototype that community members fell in love with.  “I remember we were watching videos of people doing things in Surgeon Simulator that we never thought possible, and then going back to the game, updating it, and putting achievements if someone else did that,” he says. “So, this kind of positive feedback loop is what we are trying to do on Lost Skies from day one.”  Lost Skies is currently in development for a full PC release sometime in 2024, and Olifiers says Bossa is still considering a potential console release. And there are big plans long-term, too. Bossa has a “huge post-launch roadmap” in mind for long-term Lost Skies support, in hopes the game will sustain them for years to come.  “It's meant to be our bread and butter, going forward, right?” Olifiers says. “Our life.”  Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Sophomore southpaw Tucker Novotny (4-5) went 5.2 innings on the mound for the 'U', striking out four and giving up just one earned run. Fellow sophomore left-hander Connor Wietgrefe came in for Novotny in relief, going 3.1 innings with two strikeouts and one earned run, collecting his team-best fifth save.    The Gophers got multi-hit outings from Brett Bateman (3-for-3, BB), Brady Counsell (2-for-4, 2B, RBI) and Jake Perry (2-for-4). Four Gophers delivered RBI singles in the first inning.        HOW IT HAPPENED  Minnesota scored four times in the bottom of the first, including three times with two outs. After Bateman and Boston Merila walked to start the game, Weber Neels delivered the first RBI single up the middle. Brady Counsell , Kyle Bork and Kris Hokenson all laced two-out run-scoring singles to put the home team up 4-0 after one.    Rutgers plated its first run in the top of the fifth off an RBI groundout. They scored again in the sixth off an RBI single with two down.    RU threatened again in the eighth. With a man on first and two outs, Hugh Pinckney doubled off the wall in left. Chris Brito attempted to score from first, but was thrown out at the plate on a relay throw home from Merila to Counsell, who nailed the runner trying to score.    A sacrifice fly from Hokenson (1-for-3, 2 RBI) plated the team's final run in the eighth, putting them up 5-2. Rutgers scored one in the ninth on a sacrifice fly to make the final 5-3.

Cade (Kurland) led off the sixth and we scored the five runs that inning. I think he led off the seventh as well and we scored three. We swung the bats well offensively. We got off to a good start. Their pitcher did a real nice job of throwing the ball in the low part of the zone. We beat a lot of balls into the turf from the second through the fifth. We did a real nice job. They're really tough to beat at home.""On Waldrep's sixth inning…""I told him that before he went out there. It was a really long inning for him. When he went out for the sixth, we scored the five there. The bottom line is I just told him that we're going to turn the lineup over and this is the most important inning of the game. He did a real nice job of stranding a leadoff double. We still made some mistakes. We didn't cover first that one inning and we were late another time. We made the base running mistake with Cade and one out, going on contact. There are some things that we obviously need to clean up like everyone does. All-in-all it's a road win. This time of the year. We're playing for something. You've gotta be pleased with that.""On Kurland's performance…""He's been swinging the bat really good. He uses the whole field. He hit a double to left-center gap, hit the ball the other way tonight. He's done a real nice job. He started the game with a leadoff walk. He's done a really nice job for us.

"game","2017-07-12","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:05:59","(Firmament screenshot)  Firmament feels like it was thrown into a time capsule at some point around 1993, with beautiful vistas, a haunting storyline, and a difficulty curve like the side of a skyscraper. If you’re in the market for a truly difficult puzzle-adventure game, albeit one with occasionally baffling controls, that’s what Firmament’s offers you.  It’s about what you’d expect from the team that made Myst. Firmament is the latest game from Mead, Wash.-based Cyan Worlds, and it’s exactly the sort of game Cyan likes to make. It’s an immersive first-person adventure set in a surreal alternate world, with no violence or danger, but featuring some of the toughest puzzles in the business.  In Firmament, you play as the newest and only living member of the multiverse’s maintenance team. The Keepers used to work behind the scenes to fix and repair the strange machines that kept several worlds running, but something went horribly wrong and only one Keeper was left. Now she’s dead, you’re her replacement, and you’ve got a lot to do.  If I had to sum Firmament’s mood up in one word, it’d be “melancholy.” It’s a game about abandonment, set in and among strange technologies that have run by themselves for too long. Firmament is full of spectacular vistas and surreal imagery, but it’s all overgrown or too quiet or just a little broken, like an art museum after the end of the world. If nothing else, Firmament is a beautiful game to simply look at.  It’s still a game from Cyan, however, and some of Cyan’s trademark sadism has snuck into this project. Firmament was made via a successful Kickstarter campaign, and like a lot of crowdfunded games, it’s laser focused on a specific, narrow niche. Firmament, like Myst, Riven, and Obduction before it, is for people who like tough, borderline unfair adventure games. If your idea of a productive weekend’s entertainment is spending six hours beating your head against two or three puzzles, then Firmament was made for you.  (Firmament screenshot)  In fact, it went too far in that direction. There are a lot of puzzles in Firmament that aren’t difficult so much as obtuse, or maybe just old fashioned. While I played it, I found myself thinking of games from the early CD-ROM era, around the heyday of the original Myst, when developers were still figuring out what the new technology was good for.  It’s not that Firmament has bad controls, but that it occasionally has really backwards controls. There are parts of this game that feel like they’re 30 years old, because they’re making the sorts of mistakes you’d have seen in a bad Sega CD game from 1994.  A good example comes from one of the first puzzles in the game, where you’re asked to use a crane to move a cargo crate into a particular position to use it as a makeshift bridge. It’s a classic.  However, the control panel for that crane is a couple of hundred in-game yards away from the gap you’re trying to bridge and faces in the opposite direction. You can’t actually see what you’re doing, aside from making an educated guess from the control panel’s heads-up display. If you get it wrong, you have to turn around and run towards the gap to check. It’s like trying to parallel-park by remote control.  (Firmament screenshot)  This isn’t the only time it happens. A few different puzzles in Firmament have similar issues, where you have to solve them blind or use some backwards interface just for that section of the game. It’s an exercise in frustration. I was particularly annoyed by a sequence at roughly the game’s halfway point where I had to pilot a drone with a control interface that made it feel like a really big, really broken shopping cart.  I suspect the idea here was that Cyan wanted to preserve the sense of immersion above all else. The idea is that you never leave your character’s perspective under any circumstances, in order to preserve the illusion that you’re actually inhabiting this world. It’s a big part of what makes VR games as absorbing as they are. Immersion and frustration aren’t the same thing, though.  Cyan’s really turned up its art and narrative design with Firmament; even when I was annoyed by a particular puzzle, I put up with it because I wanted to find out more about what had happened to the Keepers, in this strange world between worlds that Cyan’s created.  As it is, Firmament is a throwback to the ‘90s, for better and for worse. It’s unapologetic about its difficulty and does some really clever things with the medium, but at a couple of particular points, it feels like a game that was made by somebody who hasn’t played any other video games since Deep Space Nine went off the air.  Firmament is available now for Windows, MacOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR.  [Cyan Worlds provided a Steam code for Firmament for the purpose of this review.]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIzL3Jldmlldy1maXJtYW1lbnQtbmV3LWdhbWUtZnJvbS1teXN0LWNyZWF0b3JzLWlzLWEtYmVhdXRpZnVsLXRocm93YmFjay10by10aGUtOTBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Embracer, the fresh new owners of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, are licensing the Middle-earth MMO gaming rights to Amazon Games, whose first and only game, New World, was a big bold swing into a crowded massive-multiplayer-gaming space against Grand Theft Auto, Minecraft, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, No Man’s Sky, and of course LOTRO.  This new LOTR MMO game will be a persistent open world Middle-earth set in the third age, but not based or connected to Amazon’s billion-dollar The Rings of Power TV series. Development is currently planning to launch on PC and console.  Reviews for Amazon’s New World currently sit at 6/10 on Steam with 200,000+ reviews, and a Metacritic score of 70. Metacritic is basically Rotten Tomatoes for video games, averaging review scores from professionals and the community. From what we have read, New World was praised for good modern graphics and multiplayer engagement, but with a limited set of innovative game mechanics.  This new game is unrelated to the cancelled LOTR online MMO game that was being developed in China. Amazon is building this in-house with its team from an earlier acquisition of Double Helix, a successful studio responsible for many franchise spinoff games like Enter the Matrix, Star Wars Episode III, Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, Killer Instinct, G.I. Joe, Silent Hill, and more.  Fans may welcome a next-gen Lord of the Rings MMO experience, as one of the common knocks on the hugely successful (and still updating) LOTRO is the dated graphics. Amazon Games will have their work cut out for them to differentiate from Peter Jackson’s cinematic world, Standing Stone Games’ deep lore gaming in LOTRO, and the future secrets from The Rings of Power. LOTRO is still one of the best reviewed MMO games, even after 16 years of fresh expansions.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW9uZXJpbmcubmV0L3RvcndwLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvMTE2NTMwLWFtYXpvbi1zZWN1cmVzLWxvdHItcmlnaHRzLWZvci1uZXctbW1vLW9wZW4td29ybGQtZ2FtZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-13","19:00:00","{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:52:37","The Panthers outlast the Hurricanes in a marathon Game 1 as Matthew Tkachuk scores the winning goal in quadruple overtime.  RALEIGH, N.C. -- — Back and forth they went, the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes playing a game that seemed destined to have no end while leaving legs growing wobbly with each passing minute.  Then, just as the teams appeared headed for yet another extra period, Matthew Tkachuk pounced on his chance to finish off yet another overtime and road victory for the Panthers in these playoffs.  Tkachuk beat Frederik Andersen in the final seconds of the fourth overtime to give the Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Hurricanes early Friday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final.  Tkachuck took a feed from Sam Bennett after Florida won a battle for the puck as Carolina tried to clear it from the zone, then whipped a shot from the right circle past Andersen with 12.7 seconds left.  That sent Tkachuck racing toward center ice to celebrate with teammates in what turned into the longest game in either franchises' history, as well as the sixth-longest game in NHL history.  “Definitely, tired but I think you're less tired when you win,” Tkachuk said, adding: “I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game, because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch.”  Florida won its seventh straight road game in these playoffs and improved to 5-0 in overtime. Game 2 is Saturday night in Raleigh, less than 48 hours after the teams played more than two full games worth of hockey.  This one ended roughly six hours after the puck drop.  “We didn't even know what overtime we were in,” Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said.  Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe scored in regulation for the Panthers, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 63 saves in what turned into a goaltender battle as the game got more ragged and players racked up the ice time.  Andersen finished with 57 saves for Carolina, which got power-play goals from Seth Jarvis and Stefan Noesen.  “It was a good goalie battle,” Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. “It was unfortuante we just couldn't find one.”  Tkachuk finally ended a game that had multiple wild sequences in critical late moments.  Most notably, there was Lomberg appearing to have the winning goal in his return to Florida’s lineup from injury, beating Jalen Chatfield in a battle and then whipping the puck by Andrersen 2 1/2 minutes into the first OT.  But Carolina successfully challenged the play for goaltender interference. Replays showed Florida’s Colin White — while being bumped by Carolina’s Jack Drury — making skate-to-skate contact with Andersen, then bumping him as Andersen ended up on all fours on the other side of the crease before Lomberg’s shot found the net.  Later in that first OT, Jarvis — who had the game’s first goal on a power-play blast from the slot — nearly ended it on a loose rebound but rang the crossbar.  It turned out, the game was nowhere near its epic finish.  Florida hadn’t been to an Eastern Conference final since 1996, before a large chunk of its roster had even been born. But these Panthers had turned a late surge to qualify for the final wild-card spot into a postseason-shaking moment by taking down Boston following the Bruins’ record-setting 65 wins and 135 points, followed by beating a Toronto team buzzing off its first series win in nearly two decades.  Now the Panthers have handed the Hurricanes — who had the league's second-best regular-season record — their first series deficit of the postseason.  Carolina is in the Eastern final for the second time in five years. The last time, it was a feel-good surprise for a young core that had just ended a nine-year postseason drought. They had since accomplished the goal of building a consistent winner and Cup contender, though second-round exits the past two seasons on home ice had cast a damper on some of that sustained success.  This time, Carolina beat the New York Islanders in six games and then the New Jersey Devils in five to make it back. But on a night when both teams had plenty of chances to end this one in any of the OTs, Carolina ended up losing its ninth straight game in the conference-final round dating to 2009 in brutal fashion.  “It was kind of really who was going to make the last mistake,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “Unfortunately, it was us.”  LONGEST GAME  The longest game in NHL history came on March 24, 1936, when the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1-0 in the sixth overtime on Mud Bruneteau’s goal at 116 minutes, 30 seconds of extra play.  FRANCHISE MARKS  Florida’s previous record for longest game was 104:31 in Game 4 of the 1996 Stanley Cup final against Colorado. Carolina’s previous record was 114:47 for Game 3 of the 2002 Stanley Cup final. The teams each lost those games.  SEMIFINAL SKID  Carolina's losing streak in the NHL semifinals dates to Pittsburgh's sweep of the Hurricanes in 2009 when Maurice was in his second stint as Carolina's coach. Boston then swept the Hurricanes a decade later.  WELCOME BACK  Both teams welcomed back forwards from lengthy injuries.  Carolina’s Teuvo Teravainen hadn’t played since suffering what the team described as a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders. The injury required surgery on April 20 and left him with a scar running the length of his left thumb.  Lomberg had missed eight straight games due to an upper-body injury.  ------  Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap  ------  AP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmhsL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTU0ODQzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Murray exploded for 23 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter to help the Denver Nuggets win 108-103 to push the Lakers down to a 2-0 series deficit.  Murray -- who also had 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals -- said he grew up dreaming of clutch fourth-quarter playoff performances like this. It was his fourth 20-plus-point fourth quarter in the playoffs, the most since the play-by-play era began in the 1997-98 season and two more than Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson, who are tied for second, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information.  ""When I was little, I used to count down the seconds off the shot clock and make the shot and talk like Marv Albert and Mike Breen,"" Murray said after the game. ""Just the imagination running as a kid. When you get in that moment and you see your fam in the crowd, see your little brother, see Mike Breen there, all these little reminders, they all pay dividends and make that moment a little more special. Just kind of lock you back in.""  He added: ""Playing in the Western Conference finals against the Lakers and LeBron James. It's an amazing opportunity, and it's something you're going to look back in history and remember for the rest of your life.""  The Nuggets also got a fourth straight triple-double from Jokic, who had 23 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. It was also his fifth triple-double in six games.  But it was Murray who played the role of finisher. He had been battling an ear infection that sidelined him last weekend and prevented him from doing much at all.  But he has scored 31 or more points in both of the Nuggets' home wins against the Lakers. On Thursday night, Murray scored the final 12 points of the game for the Nuggets. That is the second-most consecutive points scored for a team to end a game in a conference finals or NBA Finals win over the past 25 years, according to ESPN Stats & Information.  ""He was special and he won us the game,"" Jokic said. ""His energy, he played 42 minutes, so ... I think he was amazing. Yes, maybe in the first half, he struggled to make shots. But when it mattered the most, he made shots and won us the game basically.""  It was a moment Denver coach Michael Malone cherished. He has seen how hard Murray has had to work to fight his way back from a torn left ACL in April 2021, forcing him to miss the previous two postseasons.  ""I love Jamal Murray,"" Malone said. ""This is not just like I'm coaching him. We've been together seven years and been through a lot of ups and downs, and to see him back playing at the level he's playing at, the first thought for me is just tremendous pride and just so happy for him. Because I saw the dark days coming back from that ACL.  Malone added: ""He needs to continue to do that. Obviously our goal is not done. We have to win this series. Our goal is to win a championship, and he's going to be a big part of that.""  Murray's clutch performance helped the Nuggets bury the Lakers -- who led by 11 in the third but watched Denver score 20 of the first 25 points in the fourth quarter -- when they made seven 3-pointers.  Murray's fourth quarter outscored James' 22 points for the entire game. With Anthony Davis struggling through a 4-for-15 shooting night for 18 points and 14 rebounds, the Nuggets head to Los Angeles looking to add to their series lead.  While the Nuggets continue to surprise some despite their No. 1 seeding and best record in the West, Murray said Denver has become accustomed to this for several years now.  ""We're the Denver Nuggets; we're used to that,"" Murray said. ""Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the Clippers in the bubble, they talk about the other team. Same old, same old. It fuels us a little more and will be sweeter when we win the chip.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjgyMzk0L251Z2dldHMtamFtYWwtbXVycmF5LWJ1cmllcy1sYWtlcnMtMjMtcG9pbnQtNHRoLWdhbWUtMtIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjgyMzk0L251Z2dldHMtamFtYWwtbXVycmF5LWJ1cmllcy1sYWtlcnMtMjMtcG9pbnQtNHRoLWdhbWUtMj9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:46:44","DENVER — The roles were reversed in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals. After being down by as many as 11 in the second quarter, the Denver Nuggets came back to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 108-103.  The star of Game 2 was Denver guard Jamal Murray, who joined elite company with his fourth quarter performance.  Denver remains undefeated at home in the playoffs and is powered by two-time MVP Nikola Jokic, who had his 13th career playoff triple-double in the game, moving him to third most in the playoffs all-time.  The Lakers, now down 2-0 in the series, will host the Nuggets in Game 3 on Saturday and both teams will make their adjustments, even if one side's gets talked about more than the other.  Lakers in trouble?:LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Lakers need more, but do they have it in the tank?  Follow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules  Here are three takeaways from Game 2 of the Western Conference finals:  We haven’t seen the full potential of Jamal Murray, which is scary  Murray was listed as questionable ahead of Game 6 of the second round series against the Phoenix Suns, but he has not missed a game. Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said he still wasn’t 100% ahead of Game 2. Murray showed it as he played lackadaisical in the first half, starting 5-of-17 from the field.  But he woke up in the fourth quarter and had 23 points, finishing as the team’s leading scorer with 37 points. This is his fourth time scoring 20 points or more in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. He joins Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players in the past 30 years to have multiple games with 20 points in the final period of a playoff game.  ""He was special and he won us the game,"" Jokic said. ""He scored 20-something in the fourth quarter. He got us the lead, his energy, he played 40-something minutes, 42 minutes, so I think he was amazing.""  ""The game would have been a lot easier if I made them the first half,"" Murray noted of his performance, ""so just come out focused and knock them down, don't lose any confidence or anything like that. Just play my game and you know that they're going to fall if I keep shooting.""  The 26-year-old is no stranger to adversity as he experienced the NBA bubble with the team and this is his first year back after missing all of last season with a torn ACL. Malone was snarky all day, making comments about his daughter's lengthy graduation and bemoaning the lack of credit his team is getting, but he turned heartfelt when speaking on Murray's development.  ""It's so rewarding. This is not just coach and player,"" he said. ""... I love Jamal Murray. This is not just like I'm coaching him. We've been together for seven years and been through a lot of ups and downs and to see him back playing at the level he's playing at, the first thought for me is just tremendous pride and just so happy for him.""  Rui Hachimura's Game 1 performance was not a fluke  Rui Hachimura was widely credited with slowing down Jokic in Game 1 and he came off the bench to power the Lakers' offense in Game 2. He finished with 21 points and there was a stretch between the first and second quarters where he had 11 of the Lakers’ 13 points. He also scored the last bucket of the first half, an alley-oop dunk from LeBron James that put the Lakers up 53-48 at the half.  James finished with 22 points, tied with Austin Reaves for the team lead, and played stronger in the second half. He didn’t score until a dunk with 6:49 left in the first quarter and massively whiffed a breakaway windmill dunk that had Ball Arena reveling in his embarrassment. He was visibly gassed as the final buzzer sounded.  PAYING TRIBUTE:Rui Hachimura picked Kobe Bryant-inspired number after being traded to Lakers  As James ages and works through his injuries, young stars like Hachimura have stepped up to keep Los Angeles' hopes of an 18th title alive.  ""I'm just trying to be aggressive on both ends, especially (against) their big,"" Hachimura said. ""So I think for this series, the coaches have been telling me it's going to be a big series for me. So I was ready for this.""  The Nuggets do not care that the 'national narrative' is about the Lakers  After the near-comeback in Game 1, the national media talk was about how the Lakers would adjust to try and even the series.  For the Nuggets, this is nothing new. In the 2020 bubble, the conversation was around the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers as Denver outlasted both in seven-game series where it completed 3-1 comebacks.  Michael Porter Jr., who had 16 points and a key shot that tied the game in the fourth quarter, explained the team mentality.  ""We got a lot of dudes who aren't really big into the social media thing, feeding into that,"" he said, ""which I think that plays to our advantage, being the type of small-market team that we are. So I don't think we mind that at all.""  Murray and Jokic echoed the sentiment.  ""The outside noise is outside noise,"" Murray said. ""We're the Denver Nuggets, we're used to it. Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the Clippers in the bubble, they talk about the other team. Same old, same old, it just fuels us a little more and will be sweeter when we win the 'ship.""  ""Since we made playoffs, it's like that, so it's nothing new for us,"" Jokic said. ""To be honest, I like it. We don't care. Whatever.""  Malone had the strongest statement of all.  ""You put that in your pipe, you smoke it,"" he said, ""and you come back and you know what, we're gonna go up 2-0.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbmJhLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvbnVnZ2V0cy1sYWtlcnMtZ2FtZS0yLXRha2Vhd2F5cy83MDIzNDYxMTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Updated May. 18, 2023 4:00 p.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link  After setting the NBA record for points in a Game 7 with 51 as the Boston Celtics cruised past the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday, Jayson Tatum fell short in the pivotal moments in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat.  Tatum failed to register a shot in the fourth quarter and committed three turnovers over a span of four possessions en route to a 123-116 loss for the Celtics on Wednesday.  Tatum scored 30 points on an efficient 9-of-17 shooting from the field while grabbing seven rebounds and a block, but his offensive struggles in the fourth quarterback overshadowed his early success, especially with Boston surrendering a 13-point lead.  FOX Sports' Skip Bayless was among those befuddled by Tatum's latest playoff performance, leading him to question if Tatum is actually a superstar.  ""You have elevated him to the highest pedestal,"" Bayless said to ""Undisputed"" cohost Shannon Sharpe on Thursday. ""He made first-team All-NBA. You have proclaimed him a superstar. I keep saying, ‘I’m trying, but I can't get there,' because, especially through the playoffs, it is a wild roller coaster ride of great game, sorry game, great game, ‘Huh?’ [game], great game and a ‘Where did you go? What happened to you?’ [game].""  Jimmy Butler leads Heat to 123-116 Game 1 win vs. Celtics Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat upset the Celtics in Boston in Game 1, 123-116. Shannon Sharpe breaks down why the Celtics lost Game 1.  As Bayless mentioned, Tatum has had some up-and-down performances throughout his playoff career. Just in the Eastern Conference semifinal against the 76ers, Tatum had several head-scratching performances. In the first half of Game 4, Tatum scored three points on 1-of-9 shooting before finishing with 24 points, 18 rebounds, six assists and four blocks in an eventual Celtics loss.  Tatum got off to a slow start in Game 5, too. He missed his first six shots of that game before scoring 36 points on 11-of-27 shooting in another Celtics loss. Game 6 was Tatum's worst start yet, shooting 1-of-14 from the field through the first three-plus quarters before hitting four 3-pointers in the final minutes to keep the Celtics' season alive and force a Game 7.  ADVERTISEMENT  Bayless isn't sure if the blame should necessarily fall on Tatum for not getting a shot off in the fourth quarter of Game 1, believing some blame might fall on Celtics point guard Marcus Smart and coach Joe Mazzulla. But the one thing he does know is that ""the best player on what many consider to be the best team"" failed to show up in the fourth quarter as a ""prohibitive favorite"" against the eighth-seeded Heat.  ""I don't get it,"" Bayless said of Tatum's up-and-down play. ""He's almost like a Kevin Durant-like figure where we see all the talent, we see all the explosiveness. We saw it in Game 7 against Philly. We saw it at the very end of Game 6 at Philly. We see him explode. He's so long at 6-foot-8 that when he extends to the basket, it's almost like his arms can extend another extra foot, like they're elongated arms. I've never seen anything quite like it.  ""But he can go as cold as anybody in the league. What happened in the playoffs last year? He led the whole playoffs with 100 turnovers. It seemed like he cleaned up some of his act this year in these playoffs until the home stretch of last night's game. Not only is he not taking a shot in the fourth quarter, but with under three minutes left, he had three turnovers, too.""

Please wager responsibly.  A record-setting third quarter propelled the Miami Heat past the Boston Celtics in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference final. What are the odds of that happening two games in a row?  Not very good, according to those charged with the task of setting the odds for Game 2. Miami poured in a club playoff-record 46 points in the third quarter final of Game 1, rallying for a 123-116 victory in the opener of this best-of-seven series. But as the two clubs ready for Game 2 on Friday at TD Garden (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT), bookmakers are doubling down on the hometown Celtics.  Boston is set as a nine-point home favorite, even though the Celtics are 0-4 both straight up and against the spread in the past four games during which they’ve been given such a wide berth in the betting line.  Heat vs. Celtics betting trends  With their Game 1 victory, the Heat are now 8-2 SU and ATS over their past 10 games. Miami is 8-3 SU and 9-2 ATS in the last 11 games in which the club took the court as the betting underdog.  Boston hasn’t exactly been taking advantage of home-court advantage. Since winning and covering in their first two playoff home games against the Atlanta Hawks, the Celtics are 2-4 both SU and ATS at TD Garden.

There might be a rash of ankle injuries with all of the people suddenly abandoning the Boston bandwagon. In the NBA public betting trends, Miami at +9 is pulling 66% of handle and 75% of bets in the spread splits. Public moneyline bettors are divided. While the Celtics are grabbing 64% of handle in the moneyline splits, there’s 52% of bets on the Heat.  The public is seeing the over on the total of 215.5 points as almost a sure thing. It’s garnering 94% of handle and 87% of bets. Nine of Miami’s last 10 games have gone over, as have five of the last six Heat vs. Celtics games played at TD Garden.  Can Celtics cool down Heat?  Boston as a prohibitive home favorite in Game 1 made perfect sense. It was after all a showdown between the No. 2 and No. 7 seeds in the East. Handing Boston an even larger margin in the spread for Game 2 is a puzzling decision to say the least.  What does Miami need to achieve before the experts will begin to back the Heat? They are an NBA-best 9-3 SU in the postseason. Miami is 6-1 ATS this season when an underdog of 8.5+ points. Granted, the one time the Heat didn’t cover was as 9.5-point underdogs in a 134-121 loss at Boston on Nov. 30. In the playoffs, though, Miami’s been money as a heavy underdog.

In Game 3, Jimmy Butler was himself for Miami, which is to say he was outstanding. Playoff Jimmy scored 35 points. What was significant was the backing he received from the Heat’s supporting cast. Bam Adebayo scored 20 points. Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus and Kyle Lowry each contributed 15 points. Boston is supposed to be the team in this series with scoring depth. Miami also dominated Boston from long range. The Heat shot 51.6% (16-of-31) from beyond the arc. The Celtics were a disappointing 34.5% (10-of-29). Tenacious Miami also made 12 steals, compared to six by Boston.  The standard theory in sports betting is to fade the public. In this case, though, go with the flow. Boston probably wins Game 2. But the Celtics won’t win by more than nine points.  Pick: Miami Heat +9 (-110).  Miami vs. Boston same-game parlay  The total points for the Heat in Game 2 is set at 103.5 points, which seems like a good launching point to begin a same-game parlay.

"game","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:44:23","We’ve been here before. A year ago, the Miami Heat had a 1-0 series lead over the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, having come back from 13 points down in Game 1.  This year’s series is the same, but different in that the Heat got their Game 1 victory on the road. So the Celtics, having already lost home-court advantage, should be more desperate to win Game 2. The last 16 Game 2s in this scenario (road team won Game 1) have been won by the home team, with the average margin of victory being 17.3 points.  One of those 16 Game 2s was the Celtics’ 34-point victory over Philadelphia in the conference semis, and two of them were losses from the Heat in these playoffs. But Miami, playing without Jimmy Butler two weeks ago, led Game 2 in New York in the fourth quarter and lost by just six. If the Heat can keep this Game 2 close, they’ll do so believing (for good reason) that they’re the more hardened team in regard to clutch situations.  Here are three things to watch in Game 2 on Friday (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT)…  1. Tatum targeting  Jayson Tatum and Duncan Robinson were both on the floor for about six and a half minutes in Game 1, with the Celtics having 14 offensive possessions in that time. But not once did the guy Robinson was guarding set a ball-screen for the Celtics’ star. Tatum is one of the biggest weak-defender seekers in the league and, among defenders in the Heat’s rotation, Robinson has the biggest target on his chest. So it was a surprise that Boston didn’t seek out that matchup right away.  Tatum still had a strong scoring game, scoring 30 points on 9-for-17 from the field and 11-for-11 from the line. Also, after missing both of his shots in the first half, Robinson didn’t play after halftime. But the Celtics could have been more purposeful with their offense in the fourth quarter, when the window was still open for them to come back.  While Tatum scored efficiently, he had one assist and four turnovers (three in the fourth). Miami showed him extra defenders without committing to a double-team (until he gets into the paint), which didn’t give him obvious decisions to make with the ball…  Tatum did try to attack Max Strus a couple of times in that fourth quarter, but Strus was able to stay in front.  “I know they’re going to keep doing it,” Strus said Thursday, “but these are the moments I want to be in. That’s why I’m on the floor. I’m ready for the challenge and I believe in myself and my team to have my back when I’m in those positions. I’m not going to shy away from the moment.”  2. Heat will (probably) need to find another way  The Heat shot 10-for-15 (67%) from mid-range and 16-for-31 (52%) from 3-point range in Game 1. That’s definitely unsustainable and probably unrepeatable.  “I wouldn’t say we’re accepting that,” Kyle Lowry said Thursday, “because we think we can do it. At the same time, we know we can win games all types of ways.”  Belief in the ability to shoot better than 50% from outside the paint only goes so far, so the Heat will likely have to find other ways to win going forward, either scoring more inside (or at the line) or, more likely, defending better. The Celtics’ 116 points on 97 possessions was the third most efficient performance against the Heat in these playoffs.  “We’ve had to do that all season long,” Spoelstra said. “We’ve had to win with a lot of different identities and different ways to find solutions. And that’s likely what’s going to happen in this series.  “You have to try to get to your ‘A’ game, but [the Celtics] are going to have something to say about that. And if we don’t get to that, we still have to find a way to get the job done.”  3. Big minutes  One game is a small sample size, but it wouldn’t be a surprise if Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla makes a quick change to his starting lineup. The Celtics’ big lineup — with Robert Williams and Al Horford together — was critical to their wins in Games 6 and 7 of the conference semis, but was outscored by 10 points (with rough numbers on both ends of the floor) in 8.7 minutes on Wednesday.  Mazzulla subbed Horford out less than four minutes into the third quarter, with the Heat having begun the second half on a 15-6 run. He didn’t go back to the two-big configuration after that. Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White (the starter for the Celtics’ first 11 playoff games) both played well off the bench, combining to score 30 points on 11-for-20 shooting.  The Heat, meanwhile, struggled without Bam Adebayo, getting outscored by 11 points (allowing 33 points on 24 defensive possessions) in the 11:03 in which he was on the bench. Cody Zeller remains a foul magnet and there was no rim protection in the couple of minutes in which they played Kevin Love at the five.  Butler played more than 43 minutes in Game 1, never coming off the floor in the second half. Adebayo played just 37, but if his off-court minutes continue to be a struggle, they could be reduced quite a bit.  * * *","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy8zLXRoaW5ncy10by13YXRjaC1jZWx0aWNzLWhlYXQtZ2FtZS0y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I wish we saw more playable courses and professional golfers, as well as their own individual swing mechanics. Right now, the create-a-player mode only features 3 possible stock swings. It would be amazing if in the future you had the ability to craft your own swing or even digitally upload your own.  The fact that you can compete in various modes with a career that spans from historic amateur events, Qualifying School, the Korn Ferry Tour and onto the PGA TOUR — and, ultimately, in men’s majors like the PGA Championship — is incredible. There’s also the ability to compete head-to-head with other players from around the world in the online multiplayer mode, earning in-game rewards and climbing the leaderboards to become globally ranked through practice and playing.  EA SPORTS PGA TOUR is by far the best golf video game I’ve come across and undoubtedly countless hours will be spent trying to improve my customized player’s skills and gameplay — and win the PGA Championship!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZWEtc3BvcnRzLXBnYS10b3VyLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtd293cy13aXRoLW5ldy1mZWF0dXJlcy1wZ2EtY29hY2hpbmfSAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2EuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VhLXNwb3J0cy1wZ2EtdG91ci12aWRlby1nYW1lLXdvd3Mtd2l0aC1uZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtcGdhLWNvYWNoaW5nP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2019-02-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 08:02:08","Game Over: Metroid Prime Remastered  I missed out on playing the original Metroid Prime from 2002 on the GameCube because I was knee-deep in my PlayStation 2 while also having to navigate the troubles of being a kid with four older brothers and a busy life schedule. So years went by before I could try it on the Nintendo Switch after the remaster was shadow-dropped on the 8th of February following a Nintendo Direct. I was beyond excited to finally get my hands on this thing because, somehow, I could never secure a copy of the original game despite its various ports. After playing the title, it has earned a spot on my all-time favourite games list, and I can see why so many people loved it all those years ago. Everything about Metroid Prime Remastered is so good, whether it’s the atmosphere, the upgrades, the lore, or THAT music. It is a complete experience. My favourite tracks would have to be the Phendrana Drifts and Magmoor Caverns main themes, but I could’ve picked any song because it’s all amazing. It’s also cool how each area stands out from the rest because of their unique colour palettes, and if you were to show them all side-by-side to someone, that person would easily be able to tell them apart just by looking at their visuals. Now, that is some good game design.  Metroid Prime is a first-person shooter with Metroidvania elements that emphasises agile movement instead of precise aiming. The focus is on isolation and exploration more than anything. I don’t think there is any point in going into plot details because all you do is land on a spaceship, chase Ridley to Tallon IV, and then explore the planet while searching for upgrades. That’s fine, though, because there isn’t any point in cluttering the experience with unnecessary plot details. Plus, all that story stuff can be found in the various lore sections that can be read with Samus’ scan visor. The movement has also been vastly improved over the original release by adding dual-stick analogue controls. I’m not planning on experimenting with other control options because I’ve found dual-stick to be the most comfortable, and Retro Studios did a great job with them.  The upgrades and suit abilities still play and look great after all these years, but the visuals are even more remarkable. I don’t know how they did it, but somehow the developers were able to get this title running at 60 frames per second with graphics that resemble a PlayStation 4 game at times. It’s awe-inspiring for the perceived limits of the hardware and shows the developers still cared about the project that made them famous over two decades ago. Now, I’m a relative newcomer to the Metroid series as my introduction to the franchise was with Metroid Dread, and then I went on to play Metroid Fusion and now the remaster of Metroid Prime. It’s now become one of my favourite videogame series ever, so the amount of support it’s been getting in recent years just warms my heart. I wasn’t around for the franchise’s dark years, and I feel bad for anyone who had to experience that era, but at least we can enjoy this sudden reawakening of the Alien-inspired space epic. Of course, until Nintendo forgets about it for another decade.  One of my favourite parts about this game is how you’re never doing something separate from the core experience. I know that sounds a bit trivial, but in the age of expansive AAA releases, I’ve grown fond of titles that require the player to get good at doing one thing and then build around that thing with upgrades and the like rather than adding on a bunch of pointless gameplay mechanics to support a generic story. It just shows that focusing on what makes your game great in the first place instead of trying to come at it from the outside can pay off in spades. For example, you’re always playing as Samus whilst collecting upgrades throughout the entire experience. You never have to do something separate from that, such as flying a spaceship or driving a vehicle. There are other ways of executing this approach, but it’s something Nintendo and its various studios have always excelled at, and I love it.  If you haven’t played Metroid Prime by now, I genuinely can’t imagine a better way of doing so. The graphics have been updated, the controls are better, and the atmosphere is still top-notch. I believe you should be required to play it if you’re a fan of Metroidvanias or first-person shooters, and I’m incredibly grateful for getting the chance to play it myself. So Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption better get a similar treatment, or I’ll lose it! But at least the future of this series is looking brighter than ever, and I couldn’t be happier about that.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVncmluLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nYW1lLW92ZXItbWV0cm9pZC1wcmltZS1yZW1hc3RlcmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 01:28:00","Players of the video game “The Sims” can now bake a challah or dish up a bowl of matzo ball soup, after updates made by the game’s creator that are designed to increase Jewish representation.  The new updates add traditional Jewish foods to the expansive menu available to users of “The Sims,” a best-selling life simulation game in which players customize characters and build homes and communities. The game’s developers periodically release expansion packs offering additional items for use in the role-playing.  On Tuesday, the developers released an update focused on one family of characters, the Calientes. But it also added Jewish foods that some users had mounted an extended campaign to secure.  “Get ready to dig in because today’s Sims Delivery Express adds matzah ball soup & challah bread to The Sims 4 recipe book for the whole family to enjoy,” the game announced on Twitter. An accompanying GIF showed a table with four loaves of challah, two covered by a tree-motif cover. The table is surrounded by diners scooping soup and speaking with their hands.  A gaming PC keyboard and X Box controller (illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY)  Simmers had been pushing for Jewish additions to the game  The announcement elicited gratitude from the community of players, known as Simmers, who had been pushing for Jewish additions to the game.  “The Sims team HAVE LISTENED and have finally brought Jewish food to The Sims 4!” tweeted a user who goes by HufflePom on social media. “Thank you to everyone who has liked, retweeted, commented and supported my posts over the last 462 days. We did it!”  Later, HufflePom tweeted a picture of a multicolored challah and thanked a programmer who had been working on the addition “for doing such a beautiful, thoughtful and respectful job.”  HufflePom was the leader of a movement to press “The Sims” and its parent company, Electronic Arts, to add more Jewish options to the game.  “Sims” players have long come up with creative workarounds to permit Jewish practice in the game, such as letting their Sims keep kosher by changing their characters’ traits to “vegetarian.” Some players let their Sims celebrate Shabbat by baking bread and setting it on a table and lighting decorative candles. Players who use “custom content” modifications not created or endorsed by the game developers have also long created Jewish content for The Sims, such as kippahs, other versions of menorahs, chuppahs, Torahs, shofars, mezuzahs and dreidels. Some have Sims performing Jewish rituals, such as stomping on a glass at a wedding.  But other than a menorah that permitted players to light individual candles for each night of Hanukkah, there was no Jewish content provided by the game’s creator. HufflePom and others had noted gaps in other additions over time: An expansion set aimed at providing culturally diverse wedding options, for example, did not include a chuppah, or Jewish wedding canopy.  Neither HufflePom nor the programmer responded to requests for comment on Wednesday.  An online petition launched last year by another Sims user noted HufflePom’s advocacy. “For over a year, Simmer HufflePom has been asking for Jewish representation in The Sims 4 by adding Jewish head coverings and food like challa, babka, hamantashen and brisket,” said the petition, which drew nearly 800 signatures. “This has been done for other cultures like Muslims and it’s important for all cultures to feel represented in their beloved life simulation game.”  Some people who signed the petition said they were Jewish and wanted to have more true-to-life options when they played the game.  “I am Jewish and am tired of not being able to have Jewish Sims,” wrote a signer named Michelle Jackson. “Stuck eating just turkey or fish during grand meals.”  But others said their support for the Jewish expansion was less about their own identity than about an abiding belief that their favorite game should offer flexibility for users of all backgrounds.  “Everyone deserves representation. We need more cultural items and gameplay so people from anywhere can play their own lives because that has always been what the Sims is about,” a signer named Madison Graham wrote in November. “We did it with skin tones and pronouns, we can do it for Jewish rep too. No rep is too much or needless.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9qLXNwb3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMzOTbSAS1odHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL2otc3BvdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzM5Ni9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.  Good morning. You’re tempted to try a version of the Harvard newspaper’s headline after the underdog Crimson rallied to tie Yale in a 1968 football game: “Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.” Maybe: “Lakers beat Nuggets 126-132.” Both teams won something last night.  In other headlines:  • The Dodgers couldn’t find big hits against Minnesota and cost Clayton Kershaw a win, but they got encouraging news when Walker Buehler said he thinks he can return to pitch in September.  • The Angels were beaten in Baltimore as Jose Suarez’s replacement in the rotation was hit hard early.  • The NCAA transfer portal has led to important changes on the UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge basketball rosters.  • Jon Wilner reports on a bill in the California legislature that would further shake up college sports by creating revenue sharing between schools and major-sport athletes.  • New Sparks forward Dearica Hamby, whose allegations against the Las Vegas Aces were substantiated by the WNBA, said she expects to be ready to play in Friday’s season opener.  • “Angel City,” a three-part documentary about the founding and first season of Los Angeles’ women’s pro soccer team, takes on misconceptions about women’s sports, Damian Calhoun writes.  • Next week’s LA Grand Prix track and field meet at Drake Stadium will proceed without headliners Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Athing Mu, Scott Reid reports.  The Nuggets’ victory in Denver to open the NBA Western Conference finals was a missed opportunity for the Lakers to steal the first game on the road as they did in their playoff victories over Memphis and Golden State.  But it also should give the Lakers confidence they can get the road win they need as early as tomorrow and can handle the conference’s No. 1 seed.  After beginning the game sluggishly in Colorado’s rarified air and overmatched against the even more rarified Nikola Jokic, and quickly falling behind by 16 points in the first quarter, the Lakers played the Nuggets even-up and then outplayed them to make it a one-possession game late.  Going into the off day, the Nuggets have as much to figure out as the Lakers do.  “Slowing Jokic, a two-time NBA MVP, might prove to be impossible for the Lakers. Or anyone else,” reporter Eliott Teaford writes in the Southern California News Group papers this morning. “But summoning greater energy for Game 2 should be imperative for the Lakers.”  Jokic finished with 34 points, 21 rebounds and 14 assists – accounting for most of the Nuggets’ 15-5 edge in offensive rebounds – and won the anticipated battle with Anthony Davis even though the Lakers center was superb with 40 points and 10 rebounds.  As columnist Jim Alexander points out, making the Nuggets work for the win in a game they led by 21 in the second half isn’t all good news for the Lakers.  “LeBron James played 39:52 (minutes) and Davis 41:50, and accumulated mileage plus altitude plus one day between games does not do the Laker veterans any favors” going into Game 2, Alexander writes.  Catching their breath won’t be the Lakers’ only adjustment, and we saw the beginning of one in the middle of Game 1. After starting with Davis guarding Jokic as Coach Darvin Ham had said they would, the Lakers put Rui Hachimura on him beginning late in the third quarter, allowing Davis to roam. That made a difference, Jokic taking only two shots, missing them both, and committing a turnover when matched up with Hachimura in the fourth quarter.  Playing two games in one – 72-54 Denver for the first half, 72-60 L.A. for the second – gives both teams good reason for hope for the next three to six games.  “We’re up 1-0, so that beats the alternative,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said, sounding relieved late last night.  The Lakers were closing in at the end, and they should feel the same way.

"game","1972-10-12","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Wed 17 May 2023 18:36:00","Welcome to the Hammer Factory. This month we dissect Demons of the Mind (1972).  While Hammer Studios has been in business since 1934, it was between 1955 and 1979 that it towered as one of the premier sources of edgy, gothic horror. On top of ushering the famous monsters of Universal’s horror heyday back into the public eye, resurrecting the likes of Frankenstein, Dracula and the Mummy in vivid color, the studio invited performers like Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt and so many more to step into the genre limelight. Spanning a library housing over 300 films, Hammer Studios is a key part of horror history that until recently has been far too difficult to track down.  In late 2018, Shout Factory’s Scream Factory line began to focus on bringing Hammer’s titles to disc in the US, finally making many of the studio’s underseen gems available in packages that offered great visuals as well as insightful accompanying features. Over the course of this column, I will focus on these releases, gauging the films in context of the Hammer Studio story as well as analyzing the merits of the release. It’s time to highlight the power, impact and influence of Hammer Studios and ignite new conversation surrounding some forgotten classics.  The Context  While Hammer had built its reputation on a foundation of gothic horror, classic monsters and marketable stars, the demands of the 1970’s genre audience challenged their tried-and-true production strategies sparking change and innovation. With a desire to expand the scope of their talent both on screen and off, Michael Carreras and his son and successor James turned their attention to sources outside of their usual circles for pitches and potential productions.  Having worked with the studio tangentially by penning the lyrics to the title song “Strange Love” for Lust for a Vampire (1971), producer Frank Godwin was one such fresh face. Along with prolific screenwriter Christopher Wicking, who had penned AIP favorites The Oblong Box (1969) and Cry of the Banshee (1970) along with Hammer’s own Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb (1971), Godwin approached Hammer with a concept based on a legend of his own fabrication.  Claiming that he read about it in a museum in Germany, Godwin pitched the story Blutlust. A 17th century folk tale chronicling high born families prone to incest and cursed with polluted blood, those infected were supposedly driven by the full moon to revitalize themselves by devouring human flesh. Godwin claimed that the only recourse was to sever the left hand, sapping the soiled blood and to finally drive a cross aflame into the heart of the impure. Based on the story, a screenplay was ordered and a poster commissioned with the intention of leaning on a lycanthropic angle to provide the film a monster to capitalize on in its campaign.  Wicking wrote Blood Will Have Blood in response, a Shakespeare reference that went over producer’s heads and was ultimately altered due to the overuse of the word “blood” in the title. It was a script that expanded upon Hammer’s tradition of gothic moviemaking, embracing moral ambiguity in the face of conservative righteousness and seeking out psychological terror in the place of monsters and cavernous castles. Steeped in metaphor and melodrama, what became Demons of the Mind (1972) was truly an original, modern take on the classical gothic and more in line with Roger Corman’s AIP Edgar Allan Poe cycle of films than anything Hammer had made with Frankenstein or Dracula in the title.  Peter Sykes was invited to direct in light of his horror film Venom (1971) and Hammer staple Arthur Grant was brought on as cinematographer in what would be his final credited film. Casting had its complications as Eric Porter, James Mason and Paul Scofield all turned down the leading role of Zorn before Robert Hardy finally accepted the mantle. Elizabeth was cast as Marianne Faithfull but she too had to be substituted at the last minute with Gillian Hills, as her openness about her drug use made it impossible to insure her on set. The casting delays pushed production back several months. In the meantime, Michael Carreras requested the removal of all werewolf adjacent narrative components for fear of a similarly poor box office reception to Hammer’s only other werewolf outing The Curse of the Werewolf (1961).  When all was said and done Demons of the Mind emerged as a fresh and distinct imagining of Hammer’s traditional gothic style. With Sykes’ experimental, strikingly beautiful visuals and Wicking’s anthropological approach to the mythology, characters and science of the story, the atmospheric poeticism of the classic gothic evolved onscreen, ready to meet a new audience. Unfortunately, distributor Anglo-EMI had ordered a Hammer movie and had received a movie which lacked all of the studio’s hallmarks. It seemed the very elements which made it artistically successful would be its commercial doom.  The film was shelved for over a year and finally released as the bottom half of a double bill with gratuitous slasher Tower of Evil (1972). It wouldn’t see US distribution until 1974 and would ultimately land to unenthusiastic reviews, relegated to the exploitation drive-in circuit. It would take decades for Demons of the Mind to be rediscovered and reappraised, finding acknowledgment long after the studio it was meant to help rejuvenate had met its unfortunate demise.  Still, few of Hammer’s efforts, especially those that came in its final years, represent the metamorphosis and creative revolution the studio was capable of like Demons of the Mind. A Freudian psychological terror that bridged the smaller thrillers and grander gothic pictures of Hammer’s past, ushering in a new, almost modern approach that might’ve welcomed the sort of audience that Hammer Studios so desperately needed had it been given the chance.  The Film  “‘Blood will have blood,’ they say. Well, there must be no more blood on our souls.”  A bustling carriage makes its way through the wood as its driver whips the horses to haste. A young woman inside reaches through the window but is pulled back by her caretaker who forces medicine upon her. The young woman’s consciousness blurs as the surrounding world dilutes as though filtered through a watery prism. Visions begin to penetrate the carriage ride as the woman finds herself running through the trees, disoriented and afraid, before coming upon a young man and a cottage. The ride continues as the burgeoning romance flashes in and out of the young woman’s memory, finally halted by a hulking man and the carriage in question. She’s taken to an old manor where her father awaits, praying over his deceased wife’s grave and pleading that his flesh and blood might bring him light instead of darkness.  From the beginning, Demons of the Mind is a different breed of Hammer horror movie. With its quiet, introspective and near wordless opening, the film ushers in a psychological undercurrent that moves hand in hand with the mesmerizing visuals. Taking full advantage of Christopher Wicking’s thought provoking script and Arthur Grant’s eye for lush visualization, director Peter Sykes uses every frame and set piece to tell a story in pictures and mood, crafting a metaphorical fantasy-like gothic the likes of which Hammer had never seen.  The story concerns Baron Zorn, a repressed man of a long decayed nobility, torn asunder by the neurotic madness that can only come from generations of incest and isolation. Convinced of a centuries-old evil that plagues his bloodline, Zorn imprisons his incestuous children, Emil and Elizabeth, and hires a doctor named Falkenberg to help root out the psychological demons inhabiting the minds of his accursed offspring. All the while, the nearby village is under assault from an unknown killer targeting young women who bear a striking resemblance to Elizabeth.  Channeling themes of class, generational trauma and corruption, the story offers a modernized, allegorical approach to the conventional gothic dynamic. Mental and intellectual complexity accompany key sequences, like when Zorn is being hypnotized by Falkenberg with a slowly rotating candle as images of violence and sexual duress play with liquidity over Zorn’s struggling eyes. It’s this sequence that sheds light on the origins of Emil and Elizabeth’s manias, for it reveals that Zorn’s wife killed herself in front of them after years of forced sexual repression and mental abuse.  The cast is made up of performers mostly new to Hammer, an effort that was purposeful and perhaps detrimental to its eventual release. Robert Hardy plays Zorn, a role akin to Vincent Price’s Roderick Usher and one that might have been better suited to Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee had Hammer been willing to consider it. Hardy’s take is heightened and exaggerated, at times feeling like an unflattering imitation of a gothic horror patriarch rather than an authentic performance embodying one. While serviceable throughout and a fine actor on the whole, Hardy’s turn in Demons of the Mind is easily its weakest element.  Conversely, Shane Briant and Gillian Hills are wonderful as Emil and Elizabeth. Briant’s lustful desperation and emotional confusion comes through with every pale and pathetic glance while Hills’ otherworldly disconnectedness and fluctuating emotional frailty shimmers throughout the film. Patrick Magee as Falkenberg is also a standout. Based on the real life story of German physician Franz Mesmer, Magee brings a pointed confidence and acuity for curiosity that a man pushing the boundaries of human understanding and consciousness would most certainly require. Rounding out the core cast is the great Yvonne Mitchell’s Aunt Hilda, obeying Zorn’s insane demands with cult-like belief and understated pathos.  Instead of supplemental, the nearby village serves as its own world, separate from the walls Zorn has constructed around himself. In this way, the film can explore the greater impact of the murders and the belief systems which arise to protect those that do not have the luxury of wealth or title. A traveling Priest presides there, played wonderfully by Michael Hordern, Hellbent on ridding the village of the terror that haunts it. There’s even a sequence depicting a ritualistic ceremony, born out of actual practices, complete with chanting, jeering and the burning of a pagan totem in the face of the village’s most sexually active occupant Inge, as portrayed by Virginia Wetherell. The scene is the type of proto-folk horror that one might expect to find in The Blood on Satan’s Claw (1971) or The Wicker Man (1973) and serves to further diversify the genre-bending approach Demons of the Mind takes to gothic horror.  Even the death sequences are handled with artistic care as the killer always sprinkles the bodies with rose petals, calling attention to the fragility and beauty of life and the physical form. The flowers seem to represent the stunting of a life in bloom, the pieces of potential lost in blood red shreds just as they achieve peak physicality. Emil is soon revealed to be the perpetrator, murdering Inge in the heat of passion after he was tricked into believing she was his sister Elizabeth.  The crux of his violent acts hangs on one fact. His broken, forbidden lust for his sister drives him to seek women who resemble Elizabeth. The truth of who they are shatters his fantasy and then he kills.  The film climaxes and concludes in tragedy, a nihilistic finish that has our fractured protagonists find no reward. Carl, played somewhat blandly by Paul Jones, is the closest thing the film has to a traditional hero, but he amounts to a non-entity in the film, an afterthought and reverie for Elizabeth to cling to but that offers little comfort against the horrors of her heritage. It’s a decision that feels purposeful and in line with the motivations of the story— it’s not about good triumphing over evil, rather the poisonousness of hysteria and its capacity for ruination.  Demons of the Mind contains some of the most grotesque and affecting sequences in Hammer’s canon, but not because of the onscreen effects. Rather, it’s the burrowing nature of its psychological horrors that make it so affecting along with the dreamy lyricism of its visual pallet. Like Elizabeth’s disorienting carriage ride in its opening moments, the film is a vision dancing in and out of darkness and light, unable to find footing in either shadow or sun.  The Special Features  This release comes equipped with the 2017 StudioCanal transfer that was released in the UK in its 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The transfer handles contrast well, accenting both the shadows and vibrant splashes of color that coexist throughout. The DTS-HD Master Mono track is crisp, servicing the dialogue and atmospheric score. A solid presentation for this underrated gem from Hammer’s vast catalogue.  Audio Commentary, by Steve Haberman  (Shout! Factory, 2020)  Author and film historian Steve Haberman returns to deliver an insightful track chronicling the history of the production and the many creatives who coalesced to bring the film together. He details Frank Godwin’s faux legend of Blutlust and the way in which Christopher Wicking and Peter Sykes transformed it into what would become Demons of the Mind. He provides a detailed history of the actors and crew along with his own personal analysis of the film’s themes and evolved gothic stylings. It’s a wonderful, informative listen that any fan of Hammer or the film would benefit from hearing.  Audio Commentary, by Director Peter Sykes, Writer Christopher Wicking, Actress Virginia Wetherell— Moderated by Author Film Historian Jonathan Scott  (Anchor Bay, 2002)  Ported over from the original US DVD release, this commentary collects many of the film’s key creatives to provide a more anecdotal history of Demons of the Mind. Virginia Wetherell recalls working with Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sykes muses on the creative decisions at work on the screen, not to mention the purported criminal who owned the manor they were shooting in. From Christopher Wicking’s dealings with Vincent Price at AIP to his efforts to connect Hammer with Marvel Comics, a great deal of stories are told. It’s a fun and fascinating track that offers an inside look into the film, the studio and the industry at the time.  Blood will have blood: Inside Demons of the Mind (15:42)  (StudioCanal, 2017)  A collection of renowned Hammer historians, including Kevin Lyons, Jonathan Rigby, Alan Barnes and John Johnston, discuss the film and its place in Hammer history on this brief reflection ported over from the UK StudioCanal release of the film. Beginning with the disparate elements that formulated the script to the film’s eventual issues with release and distribution, this high level discussion covers a lot of ground. As is usual with these types of vignettes, it offers a satisfying and digestible overview.  Interview with Camera Operator Neil Binney (3:41)  (Shout! Factory, 2019)  Excised from an interview that was included on Shout! Factory’s release of Blood From the Mummy’s Tomb, this chat with Neil Binney provides a short and sweet recollection. He recalls shooting the rotating candle, issues with laughing on set and the consummate professionalism of Arthur Grant. It’s quick and airy, but a nice inclusion.  Theatrical Trailer (2:57)  “What madness lies like a curse upon this family?” the voice asks as people hurry down a hallway while a caretaker fumbles with keys in hot pursuit. Images of a man cornering a woman in the woods and a spinning candle accompanied by odd, off-putting music passes by whilst the same voice speaks of secrets and conspiracies binding brother and sister together. A pagan ritual unfolds “as old as the druids” as the players are introduced with title cards, leading to the bold, red words: A NIGHTMARE OF TERROR. An eye fills the frame as a girl runs out of breath in the background— DEMONS OF THE MIND.  Final Thoughts  Despite Hammer’s efforts to escape their gothic laden past as the 1970’s dawned, it seems that their future could well have been solidified in embracing and progressing their foundational design rather than suppressing it. The creatives behind Demons of the Mind understood that sentiment, even if the studio and distributors did not.  Shout! Factory preserves this piece of somewhat forgotten Hammer history for the US audience in a release that ports over the transfer and special features from the StudioCanal UK Blu-ray of the film. Steve Haberman’s commentary track is the standout benefit of the disc, arriving as an invaluable resource to those seeking to understand the machinations and thematics of the film and its production. All told, this is a fine release and an essential title for any Hammer enthusiast’s collection.  Over the years, Hammer’s horror films delved ever deeper into the murky depths of morality and the magnetic allure of the occult. Still, their key titles and directors tended to stick to more conservative perspectives, as is the case in something like Terrence Fisher’s The Devil Rides Out (1968). While the 1970s brought about the studio’s downfall, it also marked the exciting collision of their classic “Golden Age” methodologies with a more modernized approach to psychological terror that traversed far more ground than “right” or “wrong”.  With movies like Countess Dracula (1971), Twins of Evil (1971) and eventually Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974), Hammer was combining fresh voices with their signature style and forging new genre possibilities out of tired trends. Demons of the Mind is further proof that, even toward the end, Hammer was a studio with something to add to the broader creative conversation and one can’t help but wonder what might’ve been had the audience been given the opportunity to properly hear what they had to say.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5LWRpc2d1c3RpbmcuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzM3NjI1OTAvd2h5LXdheWZvcndhcmRzLTIwMDktaG9ycm9yLWdhbWUtbGl0LWRlc2VydmVzLWEtc2Vjb25kLWNoYW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Based on the Marvel comic book universe, it casts players as an accidental hero that must team up with famous Marvel heroes, clean up crime in their neighbourhoods, and fight supervillains in the process. It’s now available on the Australian iOS App Store, and Google Play Store.  The Australian soft-launch of Marvel World of Heroes comes shortly after the global launch of Niantic’s Tamagotchi-inspired game, Peridot.  Like Peridot and Pokemon GO, Marvel World of Heroes encourages you to go out into the real world (the ‘Real-World Metaverse,’ as Niantic puts it).  Patrolling your neighbourhood will reveal packs of bad guys to fight in cinematic, turn-based battles with flashy animations.  The combat system is relatively simple – each character has an armour meter and a health meter, and players will need to use a mix of ranged and melee attacks to strategically whittle away the assailants. Players can bring two teammates into battle – the game prominently features newer Marvel heroes such as Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), and America Chavez, though much-beloved characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Venom, and several of their associates are also available to eventually unlock.  The game’s progression revolves around a gacha/loot box system, which randomly provides you with currency, weapons, costume parts, and health replenishment – which allows you to keep taking on battles. Loot boxes can be found after various battles, though they will need keys to unlock – keys which are gradually granted over time, or can be purchased from the store.  From initial impressions, Marvel World of Heroes looks like a far more involved and action-packed twist on Niantic’s augmented reality game concepts. Given the strong appeal of Marvel properties, it’s likely the company has high expectations for its success when it eventually sees a global release.  However, it’s worth noting the company’s foray into Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, was shut down after just three years in operation.  frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  On the opposite spectrum, Pokemon GO remains a force to be reckoned with, years after its initial boom.  A recent report from Mobilegamer suggested Niantic’s monthly revenue from the title had dropped to its lowest point – reportedly US $34.7 million in April – though Niantic disputed this claim. ‘Our revenue so far in 2023 is up on last year,’ the company told Eurogamer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MvbWFydmVsLXdvcmxkLW9mLWhlcm9lcy1wb2tlbW9uLWdvLW5pYW50aWMtaXBob25lLWFuZHJvaWQtMjYxNjU4My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Thursday, the Dodgers placed May on the injured list with a ""right forearm strain.""  After the game Wednesday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters that May was diagnosed with a flexor pronator strain in his throwing elbow and that there's no timetable for a return to the rotation, but said ""the floor"" would be a month off. The injury did not appear to involve May's surgically reconstructed UCL, a source tells The Athletic's Fabian Ardaya.  May, 25, had surrendered a hit and struck out two batters on 16 pitches during his abbreviated outing. Despite those results, he had shown greatly diminished velocity on his pitches. Statcast had him averaging 94.7 mph on his sinker, a two full ticks below his season average. Additionally, his cutter was down 2.2 mph from his norm and all of his offerings had reduced spin rates.  May has already missed significant time in recent years. He underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2021 and was able to return to game action last August, when he ended up pitching six times down the stretch. (Tommy John surgery is often considered to include at least a 14-month recover these days, with some teams taking an even more conservative approach.)  May has tallied a 2.63 ERA (167 ERA+) and a 2.13 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 48 innings over his first nine starts.  The Dodgers, who are now 28-16 record on the season and in first place in the National League West, are already without several other key pitchers. Walker Buehler is hoping to make a September return following his own Tommy John surgery. Young starters Ryan Pepiot (strained oblique) and Michael Grove (strained groin) have both been sidelined since earlier this year. The Dodgers are also playing without several veteran relievers, including Blake Treinen and Daniel Hudson, among others.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL21sYi9uZXdzL2R1c3Rpbi1tYXktaW5qdXJ5LWRvZGdlcnMtc3RhcnRlci1sZWF2ZXMtZ2FtZS13aXRoLWZsZXhvci1wcm9uYXRvci1zdHJhaW4tY291bGQtbWlzcy1hdC1sZWFzdC1hLW1vbnRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It starts with the opening: a gorgeous, pre-rendered movie of pure eye candy tastefully showcasing events from the game; no spoilers, just promises of what was to come with elegant characters capable of expressing emotion amid beautiful landscapes and environments. And it wasn’t just the opening: Each character’s introduction cutscene was full of life, making them instantly memorable and charismatic despite never speaking an actual voiced word.  On original, period-appropriate hardware, Final Fantasy VIII’s real-time polygon characters sat perfectly against the pre-rendered 2D backdrops—and in a way that the current Remastered version does not replicate (it’s making me rethink my current playthrough of the modern release in favor of the original). In select sequences, FF8 would also do this wondrous thing where the characters would be controllable over a pre-rendered cutscene, making it feel like you were actually playing amid those gorgeous visuals. Leaving the infirmary is a great example early on, but so is the Edea sequence in Deling City.  Final Fantasy VIII’s environments were a beautiful dreamy landscape of science fiction meets fantasy. The Lunatic Pandora, Sorceress Memorial, the halls of the Ragnarok, and more were all brought to life with delightfully clear pre-rendered backdrops that felt like real, lived-in places. The game weaves its gorgeous riddle of a fantasy tale through that fantastic visual fidelity, and is a large part of why I’m becoming more and more convinced that Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite of the era. — Claire Jackson","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va290YWt1LmNvbS9iZXN0LWdhbWUtZ3JhcGhpY3MtcHM1LXhib3gtbmludGVuZG8tc3dpdGNoLXBjLWFsbC10aW1lLTE4NTA0NDQ3NjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Discover GG  Gala Games announced this week that it has removed or “burned” almost 21 billion GALA tokens after completing its V2 token airdrop—more than $637 million worth at the time of the burns—from its own reserves in an effort to reduce concerns surrounding a possible “dump and exit” scenario.  “The tokens we hold we have received as ecosystem rewards over the last several years,” the Gala Games team wrote in a blog post. “While they have always been tokens we were to use to fund the growth and curation of the ecosystem, we know that many people see them as a fundamental risk to the overall tokenomics of the project.”  AD  AD  In short, Gala Games believes that the massive token burn will help reduce concern among holders who may worry that the company could sell off mass amounts of its token—a move which could lead to a decline in price.  Gala detailed its approach to the burn in the post, noting that it had already planned to burn 2 billion GALA tokens as part of its “2023 Vision Paper” for the year. Another 3.96 billion tokens were then burned, which Gala Games said was “equivalent to the total revenue in GALA we have ever received.”  The additional and largest burn of 15 billion tokens represents Gala’s response to community concerns over the noted “dump and exit” possibility. Gala pointed to on-chain Ethereum network transactions for each part of the overall token burn, and wrote in the post that it represented $660 million worth of tokens. According to CoinGecko data, the tokens were collectively worth approximately $637 million at the time of the burns.  Gala Games—the publisher behind Web3 games like Mirandus, Grit, and The Walking Dead: Empires—also burned the tokens with its future in mind, the firm’s President of Blockchain Jason Brink told Decrypt in a message.  “At a fundamental level, we believe that if the ecosystem is going to work and be sustainable in the long-term, we need to be able to live off the rewards we receive from the ecosystem as well—not have a gigantic pile of GALA we could dip into whenever,” Brink said.  The executive added that post-burn, Gala’s own treasury is now “almost completely eliminated.”  “It also means that rewards for Founders Node operators will go up roughly 4x because the halving is supply-based,” Brink added of the rewards for those who operate Gala nodes, which validate crypto transactions for the network.  Just an update on the $GALA v2 upgrade. The upgraded $GALA has been received by 158,560 addresses, with 82,047 remaining. Every address with more than 315 $GALA has received their v2. — Jason Brink aka BitBender (@BitBenderBrink) May 17, 2023  AD  AD  Brink shared Wednesday that nearly 160,000 different wallets received upgraded tokens as the firm finalizes the contract upgrade and deprecates its old token.  Earlier this month, Brink confirmed that Gala is sending new GALA “V2” tokens to holders of GALA “V1” tokens, because various technical upgrades were made possible via a reissuance of the token. Major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase made a public announcement that it would not support or facilitate the Gala V2 airdrop—but did not share a reason as to why.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xNDA1MzkvZ2FsYS1nYW1lcy1idXJucy1vdmVyLTYwMC1taWxsaW9uLXdvcnRoLWdhbGEtdG9rZW5z0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzE0MDUzOS9nYWxhLWdhbWVzLWJ1cm5zLW92ZXItNjAwLW1pbGxpb24td29ydGgtZ2FsYS10b2tlbnM_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Kraken blocked 21 of Dallas’ shots Monday night — 13 of which came in the first period. Kraken defenseman Adam Larsson had a team-high six blocks, including four in the first 20 minutes.  During Dallas’ first-period power play, Seattle blocked seven shots and did not allow a single attempt on goal during the only man-advantage the Stars had that night, despite Dallas keeping the puck in their offensive zone for almost the entire two minutes.  Though frustrating, Dallas wasn’t fazed. It proceeded to take a lead during the second period on Roope Hintz’s goal and put the game away in the third with a score from Wyatt Johnston.  Ticket Ticker Get the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  But as the Stars prepare to face the Las Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference finals beginning Friday, blocked shots could once again be a determining factor.  Vegas led the NHL in blocked shots per 60 minutes this regular season with 17.94 a game. In the playoffs, it increased that average to 18.87, good for second in the league.  That’s a significant increase from the Kraken, which ranked 25th in the league in blocked shots in the regular season and fifth in the playoffs.  Meanwhile, Dallas ranks 13th in the postseason in that same category.  As playoff hockey intensifies, the window to get off shots closes. Against a speedy Vegas team, finding those openings will be crucial for the Stars, head coach Pete DeBoer said.  “They’re going to block shots,” DeBoer told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “I don’t have a magic plan that we’re gonna go, and all of a sudden, they’re not gonna block a bunch of shots next game, but we’ve got to find a way to get enough through to win games.”  Stars forward Jason Robertson has specifically put focus on the number of his shots that have been blocked. Back in the 2021-22 season, he ranked 13th among NHL forwards with 107 of his shots blocked. He spent the offseason watching all 400 shots he took the season before, studying how to prevent those blocks from continuing.  According to statistical website Hockey Reference, Robertson ranked second on the Stars in the regular season in total shots and unblocked shots. In the postseason, he dropped to third in total shots and fourth in unblocked attempts.  MoneyPuck.com’s advanced statistics have Robertson ranked second on the Stars in the regular season with 153 of his 565 attempts (27.1%) blocked. That number has risen slightly in the postseason with 23 of his 82 shots stopped by defensemen (28%).  The Stars also finished with the highest percentage of shots blocked as a team in the regular season at 28.18%. In the postseason, 29.65% of Dallas’ shots have been blocked, which ranks seventh.  Given Seattle’s ability to block 44 of Dallas’ shots over the last two games and Vegas’ success in that category, DeBoer said Wednesday that is one of his opponent’s strengths the Stars have identified heading into the series. But he’s confident how the team overcame the wall the Kraken put up in Game 7 will bode well for its success in the conference finals.  “That Game 7 we played against Seattle will translate to anybody we play the rest of the way here,” he said.

BEARS IN GAME 3  HARTFORD, CT – The Hartford Wolf Pack have their backs against the wall for the first time during the 2023 Calder Cup Playoffs. Tonight, the Pack will look to keep their magical season alive as they try to stave off elimination against the Hershey Bears in Game Three of the 2023 Atlantic Division Finals.  Puck drop is set for 7:00 p.m. and coverage is available on both AHLTV and Mixlr.  Tale of The Tape:  The Wolf Pack and Bears met six times during the 2022-23 regular season, with the Bears taking four of the six meetings. Hershey ended the season series with a 4-2-0-0 record, while the Wolf Pack posted a mark of 2-3-0-1. The Bears won two of three meetings at the XL Center, going 2-1-0-0. They claimed a 2-1 victory on November 25th and a 1-0 shootout decision on November 26th.  Hartford won 4-2 on October 28th, their lone home-ice win in the season series. That victory was their first of the season.  The Bears won each of the final three regular-season meetings between the clubs and have since extended the winning streak to five games with victories in Games One and Two. In Game Two, the Bears put the Wolf Pack on the brink of elimination with a 4-2 triumph.  Mason Morelli opened the scoring 3:12 into the tilt, converting on the first powerplay attempt of the game. Will Cuylle drew Hartford even at 11:32, burying a centering pass for a powerplay goal of his own. The goal was Cuylle’s first career Calder Cup Playoff tally.  The draw would last just 72 seconds, however.  Beck Malenstyn sprung into the offensive zone and snapped a shot by Dylan Garand to give the Bears a lead they never lost. Mike Vecchione potted the eventual game-winning tally 8:48 into the middle stanza, making it 3-1 at the time. Hendrix Lapierre would then convert an odd-man rush at 13:14 of the third period, putting the Bears ahead 4-1 and cementing the 2-0 series lead.  Adam Clendening scored at 15:09 for Hartford, firing home his second goal of the postseason. It would not be enough to spark a rally, however.  Hartford’s last victory against Hershey came on November 20th by a score of 4-2 at the Giant Center.  Wolf Pack Outlook:  The Wolf Pack have dropped back-to-back games for the first time since a four-game losing streak (0-3-1-0) that spanned from March 5th through March 11th. After going 1-for-2 on Saturday in Game Two, the Wolf Pack powerplay is 3-for-6 in the Atlantic Division Finals. They had been 2-for-16 through five prior playoff games.  Cuylle’s powerplay goal in the first period of Game Two was the first goal of his Calder Cup Playoff career. He became the tenth Wolf Pack player to score his first career playoff goal this spring.  Tanner Fritz, who racked up two assists in Game Two, leads the club in playoff scoring with ten points (1 g, 9 a) through eight games. It was Fritz’s third multi-point game of the postseason. Lauri Pajuniemi, meanwhile, paces the club in goals with four.  Bears Outlook:  The Bears finished second in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference with a record of 44-19-5-4 during the regular season. Their 97 points placed them fourth overall in the entire AHL during the 2022-23 regular season. The Bears received a First Round bye in the 2023 Calder Cup Playoffs, then eliminated the Charlotte Checkers in four games (3-1) in the Atlantic Division Semifinals.  During the regular season, the Bears were the stingiest defensive team in the Eastern Conference, allowing just 184 goals. Only the Calgary Wranglers (174) allowed fewer goals in the entire league.  The eleven goals allowed by Hershey through six playoff games are tied for the fewest allowed by any team with a minimum of five games played. They are tied with the Texas Stars.  Aliaksei Protas (3 g, 4 a) and Sam Anas (2 g, 5 a) are tied for the team lead in points with seven each. Protas, Morelli, and Connor McMichael are all tied for the team lead in goals with three each through six games.  Game Information:  WATCH: AHLTV  LISTEN: Mixlr  Play-by-play voice of the Wolf Pack Alex Thomas will have ‘Wolf Pack Pregame’ starting live at 6:45 p.m. on both AHLTV and Mixlr.

In an interview with Rolling Stones UK, Bond was asked how developers can see success on Xbox. She said, ""Game Pass is an option for developers,"" then explained how Game Pass is just one of many business models by saying, ""You have pay-to-play, then there was free-to-play, and then we introduced Game Pass.""  Bond says Xbox is looking into other strategies, too.  ""We've talked about how we're experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile--are there models of that that work well in PC and console? Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that? Providing creators with options and choice enables them to experiment and do what they like, and actually create more immersive and creative experiences without having to fit into a mould.""  It's also worth mentioning that Xbox does have another model that doesn't revolve around Game Pass, but both require you to have a Gold membership. One is called Games with Gold, giving Gold members two games per month which they can keep so long as they have an active Gold membership. In addition to that, there are also Free Play Days which allow Gold members to play selected games for a couple of days.

Firebirds’ director of hockey operations Troy Bodie confirmed Tuesday afternoon that Kartye and Driedger were are being reassigned from the Seattle Kraken following Seattle’s elimination from the Stanley Cup Playoffs Monday.  Bodie also said that Jesper Frödén would re-join the Firebirds, provided he clears waivers. Frödén cleared waivers Wednesday.  Kartye, the American Hockey League rookie of the year, was a breakout star for the Kraken after joining the team in their first round series against the Colorado Avalanche. He and Frödén combined for 55 goals and 54 assists for the Firebirds this season.  Kartye, a 22-year-old forward, scored three goals and added two assists in 10 games for the Kraken this postseason. He scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game, becoming just the eighth player to do that in the playoffs.  Frödén, a 28-year-old forward, played one playoff game with the Kraken. He was the Firebirds’ leading goal scorer until he was called up to Seattle on Feb. 23, having recorded 47 points (25 goals, 27 assists) in 44 games.  Driedger is a goaltender who has started 60 NHL playoff games. The 28-year-old will serve as a second option to Firebirds’ starter Joey Daccord, who recorded a career-high 60 saves Monday in a triple overtime win that helped Coachella Valley extend its lead in the five-game series to 2-1.  Game 4 is set for Wednesday at Acrisure Arena. Puck drop is 7 p.m.  ""It's huge if we can get a full line of players back,"" Bodie said. ""Like, an AHL top line. That's massive. And an NHL goalie, too. Too bad you can only play one. Joey's been playing very well but it's good to have (Driedger) as an option.""  The Firebirds could use some reinforcements and free bodies after Monday’s thriller. Players were cramping on the bench and fatigued after playing 111 minutes.  Coachella Valley will also benefit from Monday’s return of AHL all-star Andrew Poturalski, a 29-year-old center who has won a pair of Calder Cups and led the league in points last season.  With a win, the Firebirds would move on to the Western Conference Finals. A loss would force a Game 5 on Friday inside Acrisure Arena.

They have split the first two, with Baltimore winning 7-3 last night.  The Orioles (27-15) remain 4.5 games behind Tampa Bay, which won again Tuesday night. Overall, the Orioles are 5-3 on this 10-game homestand; they are 14-7 in home games for the season and 9-2 in their last 11 games versus the Angels.  They have won five of the last seven games, 10 of 16, 18 of their past 26 and 23 of the last 33 games.  In two games this series, their offense has hit five homers, scoring 12 runs on 15 hits. But over the past nine games, the Orioles have scored 28 runs, or just 3.1 per game. Baltimore batters have hit five homers in two games and seven in the last four. The O’s have gone 10 straight games without a game of 10 hits or more.  But the O’s pitching has been solid over the past 11 games dating back to the start of their series at Atlanta, with a team ERA of 3.05 during that span. The O’s pitching staff has allowed 28 runs the past nine games (with a 2.70 team ERA), and 37 in the last 11. The rotation ERA is 3.56 in this 11-game stretch, with five quality starts. The Orioles are 10-1 this season when they get a quality start.  The Angels (22-21) have lost three of their past four, five of seven and seven of their last 10 games. They are 12-12 in road games.  Right-hander Dean Kremer was the winning pitcher last night, allowing three runs over 5 2/3 innings. He improved to 5-1 with an ERA of 4.94. Kremer threw 95 pitches, 63 for strikes. He has won three straight starts for the first time in his career, going 3-0 with a 2.04 ERA in that span.  Tonight, right-hander Kyle Bradish (1-1, 4.56 ERA) will make his seventh start. He has thrown 25 2/3 innings for the year, allowing 28 hits with 10 walks to 24 strikeouts. He has a 1.481 WHIP, a 3.5 walk rate and 8.4 strikeout rate.  The Orioles are 4-2 in his starts, and Bradish is coming off a really good one. He allowed one unearned run and three hits on Friday night versus Pittsburgh, with one walk and six strikeouts on 89 pitches.  Lefty batters have hit .289 off him with an OPS of .762, and right-handers are batting .260/.755. He is 0-1 with a 7.56 ERA in two home starts, allowing an OPS of .841 in his games at Oriole Park.  Right-hander Griffin Canning (2-1, 6.38 ERA) will make his sixth start for Los Angeles. In 24 innings he has allowed 24 hits with nine walks and 21 strikeouts. He has a 1.375 WHIP with a 3.4 walk rate and 7.9 K rate.  In his last outing, the 27-year-old pitcher allowed five runs in 3 2/3 innings last Wednesday versus Houston. Over his past two games, he has given up 11 hits and 10 runs in 8 2/3 innings. The Angels are 3-2 when he starts this year.  The O's 27-15 overall record ranks second in MLB to start the season.

"game","2023-05-17","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:04:51","As a fan of the Bayonetta action franchise, I admittedly had low expectations for “Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.”  I say that as someone who has played countless spin-offs of popular games that proved to either be underwhelming or were blatantly obvious cash grabs.  Once in a while, however, you get gems such as Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance that do justice to the popular franchise that they were born from. Now we have another game to add to the list with Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.  More:Is the Dream Controller worth the price?  It’s the spinoff game that I didn’t know I needed — until I played it, that is.  The story of a younger, less confident Bayonetta  Chesire, we’re not in Kansas anymore.  More accurately, we’re not in the same type of Bayonetta game anymore as Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon serves up a different gameplay style from the fare that franchise fans have come to know and love.  Gone are the 3D models based on stylized realism as well as the kinetic action that the main line Bayonetta games are known for. Instead, you have a storybook approach that uses narration and visuals that emulate dreamy watercolors and pastels.  It’s an approach that is reminiscent of games such as “The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince” and “The Cruel King and the Great Hero” from Nippon Ichi Software — two games that I absolutely love, by the way. It’s also an approach that is likely to be polarizing for some Bayonetta fans, especially those who expect something more similar to the typical Bayonetta action games.  Such a reaction would be understandable.  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon looks like a complete departure from the games that inspired it. Instead of the confident and sensual Umbran Witch, Bayonetta Origins shows a much younger and even much less confident witch apprentice filled with plenty of fear and self-doubt.  Some might not like to see this particular Cereza. As someone who loves storytelling, however, seeing this more vulnerable side of her while knowing the kind of powerful and confident character she ultimately turns into in the future was quite heartwarming.  Many times, I found myself going, “aww, hang in there little one” as young Cereza struggles to find her way out of the forbidden Avalon Forest while looking for a mysterious power to save her mother. In this case, knowledge of the three original Bayonetta games instantly grants character development for Cereza in this game among fans who know her full story.  Equally heartwarming is her relationship with Cheshire, the wayward demon from hell who Cereza accidentally summons into her stuffed toy cat. What starts as a partnership of convenience ultimately turns into a powerful bond of friendship — one that ultimately drives the heart-wrenching culmination of Bayonetta Origins’ tale.  The original Bayonetta games gave me excitement and chills as I played through the awesome sequences of those games. In contrast, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon never got my heart pumping but it did do one thing. The dang thing actually made me almost cry. OK maybe I cried just a little bit. Either that or a bunch of onion-cutting ninjas invaded my living room. Dang it, now I think I’ve got something in my eye.  In some cases, the narrative of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon — while seemingly understated — ends up being more powerful than the storytelling in the original games. It’s certainly one of the game’s strengths for sure.  Don’t sleep on the action in Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon  One of the more surprising things about Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is just how solid the action is.  While action is the calling card of Bayonetta 1, Bayonetta 2 and Bayonetta 3, I didn’t expect Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon to have compelling gameplay.  Boy, was I wrong.  While Bayonetta Origins doesn’t have the same fast-paced action that the original Bayonetta games were known for, its more deliberately paced gameplay proved to be fun in its own way. It’s honestly what sets it apart from the Liar Princess and Cruel King games, which boasted excellent storytelling but weren’t as polished when it came to their gameplay.  A mix of adventure, puzzle-solving and action, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon conjures a pretty fun experience as you try to explore the many twists and turns of the mysterious Avalon Forest.  As the sanctuary of mischievous and even devious scheming faeries, Avalon Forest can be a magical maze filled with deadly creatures, traps and illusions. As you venture through the forest, you’ll have to figure out how to traverse and reach various places while collecting resources that you can use for crafting potions and other items. Along the way, part of your job is to also break the illusions from otherworldly realms known as Tir na Nogs, which essentially serve as dungeon trials for Cereza to overcome.  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon also serve up several optional activities throughout its many chapters. These include acquiring collectibles or doing sidequests such as rescuing wisps to gain various rewards. There’s certainly a lot to do for folks who like trudging off the beaten path.  The biggest surprise for me, however, was the action, which is quite solid.  Instead of the fast-paced, combo-driven action of the original games, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has you controlling both Cereza and Cheshire at the same time. This can be done independently via the two analog sticks, with the left one controlling Cereza and the right one controlling Cheshire when the demon is summoned.  Unlike her adult version in the Bayonetta games, this game’s Cereza is not a fighter but more of a support character who backs up Cheshire. Cereza, for example, can be used to hold foes in place via spells while Cheshire beats them up with brute demonic force. There will also be times when you need to control both of them while taking different paths so they can meet up again.  Admittedly, controlling both at the same time can be discombobulating at first, kind of like learning to drum with a double bass. Once you get used to it, though, it turns out to be quite the fun session. Cheshire can also do things when unsummoned and hidden in Cereza’s cat plushie. These include triggering bear traps or helping our little witch vault over gaps.  Add a skill tree for both Cereza and Cheshire and you have a pretty deep system for a story-based adventure game. It’s something I honestly did not expect and it’s a big reason why I like this game even more.  Granted, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is not perfect. The game can be susceptible to difficulty spikes that can be exacerbated by having to control two different characters at the same time. It can also be quite wordy during its narrative sequences, which I personally don’t have a problem with but others might react differently. The game’s map could be better implemented as well as it can be confusing at times.  The biggest issue, however, will arise from Bayonetta fans who get this game expecting it to feel more like a traditional Bayonetta game, which it is not. This is an action adventure puzzler — and a good one at that — so it’s important to be aware of just exactly what this game is.  That being said, while Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a marked departure from the aesthetics and fast-paced action of the main series, it still emanates the Bayonetta franchise’s soul.  In an industry where it can be risky to experiment, it’s nice to see developers take that risk and come up with something new and different. This honestly plays like an incredibly polished indie game, one that likely would have been lauded if it wasn’t attached to a well known IP. Just like I think Capcom should be commended for coming up with something like Monster Hunter Stories 2, I think Platinum should be commended for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.  I originally started out unsure of this game when I first saw it. Now I’m glad that I gave it a chance and actually played it. I just hope the game does well so we get a sequel.  Final thoughts on Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a totally different take on the Bayonetta formula, eschewing the series’ kinetic action for a story-driven game that’s part action adventure and dungeon puzzler. Fans expecting good, old Bayonetta action might feel disappointed with it. Folks who aren’t married to classic Bayonetta, however, will find a great experience with a compelling story and surprisingly solid tandem action between Cereza and her rambunctious demon summon Cheshire. It’s certainly one of the best gaming surprises of 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZ2ouY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9iYXlvbmV0dGEtb3JpZ2lucy1jZXJlemEtYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWRlbW9uLWlzLWJheW9uZXR0YS1nYW1lLWktZGlkbnQta25vdy1pLW5lZWRlZC83MDIyNjI4ODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-10-01","Not Discerned","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:48:13","Most NFL teams have signed the free agents they sought, the draft is in the rearview mirror and OTAs are beginning next week. So now is the perfect time to break down the Browns’ 2023 schedule.  Using strength of schedule as a barometer, a tabulation that takes into account the aggregate 2022 record of the opponents on the 2023 slate, the Browns have the seventh-easiest schedule (26th of 32 teams) in the league. Their upcoming opponents were a combined 131-154-2 last season. The Bengals’ strength of schedule ranks 17th (146-140-2), the Ravens 21st (138-147-2) and the Steelers 25th (134-151-2).  Weeks 1-4  Bengals home Sept. 10, at Pittsburgh Sept 18, Titans home Sept. 24, Ravens home Oct. 1.  The Browns are the only team in the NFL playing half their division schedule in the first four weeks of the season.  “I think it’s a unique thing to have the three division opponents in the first four weeks,” Coach Kevin Stefanski said. “I believe we’re the only team that has that in the NFL, and I look at it as a great opportunity.”  The heavy AFC North schedule to start the season might tempt Stefanski to play his starters in the preseason more than he normally would. He said he isn’t ready to make that decision yet.  The Browns have won their season opener only twice since 1999, but one of those victories came last year when Cade York kicked a 58-yard field goal on the final play to beat the Panthers, 26-24. The other was in 2004 when they beat the Ravens, 20-3.  • Cincinnati is 22-11 over the past two seasons, and Joe Burrow has the best set of receivers in the league with Ja’Marr Chase, Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins. But Stefanski is 5-1 vs. the Bengals.  The revamped defense with Juan Thornhill at safety plus Za’Darius Smith at end and Dalvin Tomlinson at tackle is going to get the chance out of the gate to prove how much better it is.  The Browns finish the regular season in Cincinnati the first weekend in January on a date to be determined.  • The “Monday Night Football” game with the Steelers Sept. 18 and a Thursday night home game with the Jets on Dec. 28 are the only prime-time games on the Browns’ schedule. That could change late in the season if they are playing well enough to have a game flexed.  The Browns haven’t won in Pittsburgh since they beat the Steelers, 33-13, in a Sunday night game in 2003 when Tim Couch was the quarterback. Deshaun Watson was 8 years old at the time.  Running against the Steelers is always difficult. They gave up only seven rushing touchdowns in 2022, and they improved by drafting cornerback Joey Porter Jr. in the second round and defensive tackle Keeanu Benton in the third round.  Watson is 0-2 in his career vs. the Steelers. He was sacked seven times as the Browns’ starting quarterback in the season finale last year. Except for James Hudson starting at right tackle in place of injured Jack Conklin, Watson will be playing behind the same offensive line.  The Browns will host the Steelers on Nov. 19.  • The Titans drafted quarterback Will Levis from Kentucky with the second pick in the second round last month. Ryan Tannehill is the veteran starter. Titans coach Mike Vrabel, a hard-nosed linebacker in his playing days, won’t just hand the job to Levis. The Browns should expect to see Tannehill, especially since they’re playing Tennessee so early in the season.  *The game with the Ravens at Cleveland Browns Stadium on Oct. 1 features two very rich quarterbacks — Watson vs. Lamar Jackson, who after two years of haggling signed a five-year, $260 million contract with the Ravens. Watson is in the second year of his five-year, $230 million deal.  Both teams are vastly improved at wide receiver. The Browns traded for Elijah Moore, signed Marquise Goodwin in free agency and drafted Cedric Tillman. The Ravens signed Odell Beckham Jr. plus Nelson Agholor. They used their first draft pick (22nd overall) on Zay Flowers from Boston College.  The Browns are on their bye Oct. 8. They play the Ravens in Baltimore on Nov. 12.  Weeks 6-9  49ers home Oct. 15, at Colts Oct. 22, at Seahawks Oct. 29, Cardinals home Nov. 5.  • The 49ers expect quarterback Brock Purdy to be ready for the regular season. Purdy suffered a right elbow injury that required surgery to repair when he was sacked on the first series of the NFC championship game with the Eagles in January.  San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan, a former Browns offensive quarterback, recently told an audience of 49ers fans “I think (Purdy is) gonna be a lot better” than last year when Purdy was 5-0 as a starter with 13 touchdown passes and four interceptions.  Purdy was selected with the 262nd and final pick in the 2022 draft, making him Mr. Irrelevant. Trey Lance and Sam Darnold are the quarterbacks behind him.  • The Colts are in a massive rebuild. Shane Steichen, formerly the offensive coordinator of the Eagles, is in his first year as head coach in Indianapolis. The Colts used their first draft pick, pick fourth overall, on quarterback Anthony Richardson from Florida.  Steichen wants to pattern the Colts’ offense after the way the Eagles played. But he doesn’t have Jalen Hurts at quarterback, nor the Philadelphia defense that allowed the Eagles to play from ahead most of the time.  • Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is in his 50th year of coaching. He will be 72 by the time the Browns play his team in Seattle.  The Seahawks are riding quarterback Geno Smith, who last season had the best year of his career. He completed an NFL-best 69.8 percent of his passes (399/572 4,282 yards) with 30 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. Still, the Seahawks were only 9-8.  Seattle had four selections among the top 52 picks in the 2023 draft. They took Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon fifth overall and Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba 20th.  • Bet on it — Stefanski will say the Cardinals are a very good team before the Browns host Arizona on Nov. 5. But this could be the easiest game on the schedule. Quarterback Kyler Murray has a long road of recovery ahead of him after undergoing knee surgery in late January.  Colt McCoy, a third-round draft pick by the Browns in 2010, David Blough and rookie Clayton Tune, a fifth-round pick from the University of Houston, are vying for the starting quarterback job while Murray mends.  Weeks 10-13  At Ravens Nov. 12, Steelers home Nov. 19, at Broncos Nov. 26, at Rams Dec. 3.  This figures to be the toughest part of the schedule with three of the four games on the road. The Browns are planning to spend a week in Los Angeles after playing in Denver rather than flying home and returning to the west coast six days later.  • The NFL will know weeks before the Browns play in Denver whether the problem with the Broncos last year was coaching or whether quarterback Russell Wilson has a bad case of diminishing skills.  The Broncos hired Sean Payton to revive Wilson, who was 4-11 as a starter last year with 16 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. He was sacked a league-high 55 times. He has been sacked 183 times over the past four years.  Denver did not use a draft pick on an offensive lineman until they selected Oregon center Alex Forsyth in the seventh round. They did, however, sign offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey (49ers) and guard Ben Powers (Ravens) to four-year deals on the first day of free agency.  • The Rams went from Super Bowl champs in the 2021 season to 5-12 last year. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is healthy after missing eight games with a back injury in 2022 when he was 3-6 as a starter.  Star defensive tackle Aaron Donald missed the last six games because of an ankle injury and wide receiver Cooper Kupp needed ankle surgery after being injured in the ninth game. The Rams are healthy again, but they are eyeing 2024 to contend with the 49ers for the top spot in the NFC West.  Weeks 14-18  Jaguars home Dec. 10. Bears home TBD, at Texans Dec. 24, Jets home Dec. 28, at Bengals TBD.  *The Jaguars won the AFC South last season, albeit with a 9-8 record. They are counting on Coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Trevor Lawrence to continue to improve together.  Wide receiver Calvin Ridley is new to the Jaguars. He was suspended all of 2022 for betting on games when he was with the Falcons in 2021. The Jaguars acquired him in a trade with the Falcons for a sixth-round pick in 2023 and a fourth-round pick in 2024 while he was suspended.  The Jags want to improve their pass rush, but failed to do that in free agency or the draft. The Jaguars had only 28 sacks last season. Notably, they signed former Browns running back D’Ernest Johnson in free agency.  • The Bears earned the first pick in the draft by finishing 3-14 last year. They traded it to the Panthers. Carolina used it on quarterback Bryce Young from Alabama.  The trade was a show of faith in Justin Fields as the Bears quarterback. The trade with the Panthers sent wide receiver DJ Moore to Chicago. The Bears strengthened their offensive line by signing guard Nate Davis in free agency and drafting Tennessee tackle Darnell Wright 10th overall with a pick acquired in the trade with the Panthers.  • Houston would have had the first pick in the draft, but the Texans beat the Colts, 32-31, to finish 3-13-1. Having the second pick meant settling for the second-best quarterback in the draft — C.J. Stroud from Ohio State.  The Texans are betting favorites in only three games this season. They are four-point underdogs to the Browns on early betting lines.  Houston had the third pick in the draft and used it on edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. from Alabama.  • The Dec. 28 Thursday night game might be the last chance for Browns fans to see Aaron Rodgers in person in the NFL.  The Jets are expected to make the playoffs. They finished 7-10 last year, but they lost their last six games because they didn’t have a legitimate starting quarterback. Rodgers changes that.  • Ending the season the way it started, with a game against the Bengals, this time in Cincinnati, could define the Browns’ season. The Browns may have already clinched a playoff spot or they might need to win to make the postseason.  There is one other possibility. It will be an interesting offseason if the Browns are out of contention on the final weekend.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2Jyb3ducy0yMDIzLXNjaGVkdWxlLWJyZWFrZG93bi1nYW1lLWJ5LWdhbWXSAVdodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9icm93bnMtMjAyMy1zY2hlZHVsZS1icmVha2Rvd24tZ2FtZS1ieS1nYW1lL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2004-07-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 19:00:59","As long as there have been videogames, there have been penalties for dying in videogames. In the earliest days dying meant losing out on a high score or having to put another coin in the arcade machine. As technology progressed, so did our protections against the harshest deaths—we got saves, checkpoints, bonfires. But a few game developers decided all that progress was nonsense. Games didn't just need to be harder, actually—they needed to be mean as hell.  And thus the cruelest game mechanic of all time was born: XP debt.  I first came across this abomination of game design playing 2004’s otherwise outstanding MMO City of Heroes. The twisted idea behind XP debt is this: if you die, a percentage of your XP bar is turned into debt. As long as you're in debt, your XP gain is reduced, usually by half, until the debt is repaid. From there, you can resume your merry way leaping from building to building doing hero stuff, battling baddies, saving citizens, having your dial-up connection severed because someone needed to make a phone call…  XP debt and dial-up were a truly agonizing combination.  Now, as an ancient MMO guy myself, I can hear all you other ancient MMO guys lurching from your Aeron chairs ready to ‘Well, akshually’ me about how other death penalties were just as brutal. I’ve been there: I’ve bound my EverQuest toon at the Temple of Veeshan, fallen asleep during a Vulak standoff, and woken up to my character losing a month’s worth of progress as he respawns, dies, respawns, dies, respawns, cries. I’ve carefully taken my nascent Jedi in Star Wars Galaxies to the ends of the galaxy to try to level him up, only to lose one of my precious three lives to a lag spike. I’ve failed to notice the iron maiden on some skelly knights doing my eight thousandth Diablo run on hardcore and had my barb instantly splattered across the wall.  (Image credit: Daybreak Games)  We had it all kinds of rough with online games back then.  But man, there is nothing quite as disheartening as seeing your whole XP bar lit up in red. A grim, inescapable, ever-present reminder of your failure as a gamer and a human. A trophy, of sorts, to the kind of catastrophe that hurts in the way that only something you brought upon yourself can hurt. A promise, written in blood, that the next chunk of your life grinding experience for your character will literally take twice as long and there’s not a thing you can do about it.  Because what are your options? Do you go on tilt, chasing the highest reward missions and experience, trying to burn it off as fast as possible? Those are the most dangerous, so you can soon find yourself dining at the table of compound interest as your frustration leads to poor play leads to more deaths leads to more debt.  Or do you play it safe and settle in for the long grind? Your paltry experience gains will get you out of the red, to be sure, but when you’re paying half of your points to the alimony of gamer fail, it’s not a fun place to be.  Perhaps XP debt was intended to be a gentler penalty than losing experience and de-leveling. After all, at least with XP debt there’s a cap—at a certain point you’re as indebted as you’re ever going to be. You can’t lose your level, it doesn’t take away your gear. But tell that to the poor bastard knifing komodo dragons in the head on a remote planet playing Icarus for the 10,000th time because a bear charged him while he was trying to make a campfire (it's me; I'm the poor bastard).  Somehow two decades on devs are still using this mechanic! It was in 2004's EverQuest 2, which came out not long after City of Heroes. EverQuest creator Brad McQuaid liked it so much that he then used it in his next MMO, the ill-fated Vanguard: Saga of Heroes in 2007. I know those are both ancient history, but more recently it resurfaced in the survival genre in 7 Days to Die and Icarus. Somehow in their quest to design systems that punish players for failure, they settled on something even the old testament provided relief from.  Death should matter in games. Not all games have to be hardcore, high skill ceiling, deathgrip-on-the-mouse extraction games, but much of the enjoyment from gaming comes from there being stakes. Ultimately games are a kind of story, and a story with no stakes isn’t much of a story. If there’s no chance the hero fails, then we don’t really care that much whether or not they succeed. Even cozy games like Stardew have systems in place to encourage good play, gently frustrating the player or nudging them in the right direction.  I’ve sunk countless hours into early roguelikes like Stone Soup and Nethack, love a Hades playthrough, and occasionally roll a hardcore Path of Exile character because there is value in striving. Great games encourage you in that journey—no matter how painful it is losing a bunch of runes in Elden Ring, you know that you gathered them once. Despite your setback, you can do it again.  XP debt actively discourages you from this striving. Whatever you were trying to do at the moment of your untimely demise, whether it was mining for rocks, battling a supervillain, or just walking from point A to point B, is now half as rewarding. It ups the stakes, but also saps the joy out of any success that comes off the back of failure. It’s one thing to take something away from me, and quite another to tell me that my effort in the future is less valuable. It’s just so much more discouraging.  I still get a thrill out of games that make death scary, but XP debt isn't The Exorcist scary, it's ""you're being audited"" scary. I hope XP debt's appearance in Icarus doesn't lead to a resurgence of some kind. Let it stay dead and buried—or at least sequestered to the City of Heroes private server where it can't hurt anyone who isn't asking for it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3hwLWRlYnQtZWFybHktbW1vcy1tb3N0LXBhaW5mdWwtZ2FtZS1tZWNoYW5pYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-11-01","22:00:00","{""Sweden"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 00:14:47","Video games have the ability to tell unique immersive narratives that is unlike any other medium. Whether they are fictional tales like the father-son journey in God of War or the depiction of heroism during World War One in Battlefield 1. 198x explores the appreciation for video games and what they mean to us through the scope of retro games.  This indie title, developed by Hi-Bit Studios in Sweden, puts players in the shoes of a character that resonated with many, including me.  In-game Screenshot  Why is 198x Important?  198x follows the story of the protagonist, titled The Kid, as they navigate the challenges of growing up and maturing into young adulthood. The local arcade becomes a refuge for The Kid, where they cope with the changes of life through the machines. The unique combination of story and character allows players to relate to the game and understand the protagonist’s emotions from beginning to end.  For me, 198x is an inspiring game that has changed my perception of gaming. It has shown me that gaming is not just a niche activity to be looked down upon, but a coping mechanism for many people. After a long day, gaming can provide a form of escapism, bringing players into a new world for the duration of the session. This sense of immersion inspires a feeling of confidence and acceptance, promoting gaming as a passion rather than a bad habit.  Playing through the levels of 198x opened my eyes to the gaming world and its transformations both on screen and behind the scenes. It was an experience that I had never considered before taking the game’s journey.  In-game Screenshot  Appreciating the Past  In my perspective, there are two significant strengths associated with 198x. Firstly, it offers players a nostalgic experience of 80s/90s games inspired by real-life counterparts. Throughout the story, The Kid engages with five distinct titles that have universal appeal. Games like Outrun, Final Fight/Streets of Rage, and Gradius pay homage to the foundational genres of gaming. This significance lies in the beauty of nostalgia itself.  As a new generation of gamers emerges, it is essential to not only anticipate the future and the innovative limits games can reach but also to reflect on the past and acknowledge the games that laid the groundwork. By immersing oneself in the world of 198x, one might discover hidden gems and be inspired to explore the rich history of gaming. It is worth noting that each level in the game faithfully replicates a real-life counterpart, a testament to the developers’ remarkable tribute.  In-game Screenshot  Understanding Emotion in Video Games  Another notable strength of 198x lies in its writing, which reflects the perspective of game developers who, at their core, are passionate gamers themselves.  Spoiler Warning: In the level “The Getaway,” which draws inspiration from Sega’s arcade racer Outrun, The Kid delivers a monologue. Imagine driving a sports car late at night, spotting lights on the horizon as the city comes into view. During this sequence, The Kid expresses, “Another life was just one credit away,” accompanied by captivating synthwave music, as you continue your journey towards the city. This moment resonated deeply with me, followed by the phrase, “Nothing could beat the rush of the highway. Speeding cars reminds me that there was a way out.” It felt as though the game understood my emotions.  Playing through this level, I experienced a sense of liberation, embarking on a long and thrilling adventure under the night sky. I sincerely hope that other players can have a similar experience, fostering a profound love and appreciation not only for the unique worlds crafted by games but also for the games themselves and the people who create them.  In addition to what has been mentioned, 198x also shines a spotlight on indie titles, which have been steadily gaining popularity in recent years. Despite its relatively short gameplay, this game has left an enduring impression on me, one that I will carry with me for years to come.  I will continue to keep an eye on Hi-Bit and eagerly anticipate more remarkable releases for others to enjoy. I sincerely hope that more people have the opportunity to play 198x and discover new genres along the way.  You can purchase 198x on Steam for US$9.99 / AU$ 14.50.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVjcmF0ZXIuY29tLzE5OHgtaG93LWl0LWluc3BpcmVzLWEtZGVlcGVyLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24tZm9yLWdhbWVzLXBlb3BsZS1jcmVhdGUv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ2FtZWNyYXRlci5jb20vMTk4eC1ob3ctaXQtaW5zcGlyZXMtYS1kZWVwZXItY29ubmVjdGlvbi1mb3ItZ2FtZXMtcGVvcGxlLWNyZWF0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The definitive edition on Switch is now celebrating its two-year anniversary (how time flies) and the developer has today revealed that there is more to come from the Tako saga as it provided a first look at Tako no Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets.  This game will see you playing as a group of six heroes who set out on a journey to defeat the shadow monsters that have plagued the land. In the process, truths will be exposed, shining a light on some tough themes in the characters' lives up until this point. Deneos has cited a number of inspirations for this one including Eastward, CrossCode and Undertale, and has even gone as far as to say that the game is ""like if Golden Sun met Illusion of Gaia"" — no pressure then, eh?  Ocean of Secrets is currently still in development and the team will be launching a Kickstarter later this year with a Switch version of the game as one of the fundraiser's stretch goals. You can find the game's Kickstarter page here, though note that it is not live just yet.  Once again, Deneos is drawing inspiration from the GBA era, and today's reveal trailer (above) gives a good look at the pixel art visuals that we can expect from this one. The developer has described the upcoming title as ""a spiritual sequel of Save Me Mr Tako"" and we are starting to see why (the cute little octopi weapons were a bit of a giveaway).  For a little more information about the game's story and a look at some screenshots, check out the following from the developer:  In a world where shadow monsters are appearing, the discovery of an octopus will put a light on the lies that the people in power wanted to hide. Start a great adventure with colorful characters and try to save this world slowly consumed by the secrets of its past.  We understand that the game is being targeted for a 2025 release, though nothing is set in stone at these early stages. You can find even more details over on the game's Steam page.  From the little that we have seen so far, the game is certainly a pretty one to look at and promises to tackle some tough themes as it progresses — always a strong combo. We will be keeping an eye out for more information over the coming months and have our fingers crossed that it makes its Switch stretch goal quickly.  What do you make of this one so far?

After stealing two big victories in Toronto, the Rochester squad knows tonight will be the toughest battle yet.  “This is going to be Toronto’s best effort — physically, mentally, and execution-wise,” Amerks head coach Seth Appert said this morning. “At the same point in time, you understand that, but you don’t worry about that.”  “We try to keep most of the focus on ourselves: what do we need to do to prepare ourselves to be the best version?”  A narrow focus has been the mindset that the coaching staff has given the players since Round 2 against the Syracuse Crunch. It’s important to look at each game, no matter the circumstance, as the one game you need to win.  “How do we execute our team play? How do we execute the adjustments we want to make against Toronto?” Appert asked the team. “If we do those things at a high level, we’ll give ourselves a chance to win. It doesn’t guarantee anything, though. We’re playing a great team.”  LINEUP NOTES  Linus Weissbach is out of the lineup for the second-straight game, but he’s close, according to Appert: “He’s headed in a good direction, and he’ll be back sooner than later.”  Appert noted that they’ll use the same 11 and 7 lineup tonight as in Game 2, which means that Mitch Eliot will be the seventh defenseman.  That also means the top line of Brett Murray, Mason Jobst, and Michael Mersch will likely see a lot of ice time again tonight. “He’s the best he’s ever been in his career,” Appert said of Murray. “The most consistent. The most physically engaged. Look what he does now: he’s first line, physical presence, power play. He’s penalty killing.”  Jobst and Mersch both lead the team with nine points a piece in the seven postseason games so far. Mersch, who tallied a Round 2, Game 3 hat trick, has five goals so far. Jobst has tallied seven assists.  Rookie forward Jiri Kulich has five goals as well: one in every playoff game he’s suited up for. “I don’t think pressure gets to him,” Appert told Sabres live today. “He seems to perform extremely well when the lights are bright.”  Appert also explained that both Syracuse and Toronto targeted Kulich, and fellow rookie Isak Rosen, but that they both haven’t got caught up “in the nonsense.”  WORTH MENTIONING  Kulich leads all AHL rookies with five goals. He also paces the league with four power play goals and two game-winning goals in the postseason.  Lawrence Pilut, who scored the game-winning overtime goal in Game 5 against Syracuse, ranks third in scoring amongst all AHL defensemen with seven points (3+4). He also carries the longest active point streak by a defenseman, currently sitting at five games.  A win tonight would give the Amerks a series sweep for the first time since eliminating Hamilton in the opening round of 2005. It would earn the team a trip to the Conference Finals for the first time in 19 years.  Rochester has a 10-4 record when they have a chance to sweep an opponent in the postseason, and have won each of their last seven games to sweep an opponent.  ABOUT THE OPPOSITION  The Toronto Marlies ran away with the North Division with over a month left in the season. They defeated the Utica Comets in four games in Round 2.  The Maple Leafs returned goaltender Joseph Wall to the Marlies on loan after Woll appeared in Game 3 and started Games 4 and 5 for the Leafs in the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.  When asked if he was worried about Woll’s return on The Sports Bar, Appert responded, “I don’t worry about things I can’t control. I didn’t even look at their ‘clear day’ roster; I have no idea who they could’ve sent down. I don’t care.”  Appert explained that the team is not preparing for one player — whether they’re in the lineup or not. “My focus is on us and getting our guys to play the right way.”  Forward Bobby McMann could return to the Toronto lineup as well tonight after missing 29 games. McMann tallied 21 goals in his 30 games played during the regular season.  The Marlies owned the second-best power play throughout the regular season, and scored on four opportunities during Game 2. The Amerks, who have seen an excellent penalty kill for most of the second half of the season, have made a few tweaks to their special teams ahead of tonight’s game.  “We’ve made adjustments every game of the playoffs,” Appert said. “That’s the nature of the playoffs. It’s not like we’re going to go away from our identity… but it’s our job as a coaching staff to bring solutions to them in areas of the game that maybe we’ve struggled.”  GAME NIGHT INFORMATION  Very few tickets remain for tonight’s Game 3 at Blue Cross Arena. The first 5,000 fans will receive red Round 3 Amerks rally towels.  Fans can enjoy $2 draft beers until puck drop at Pregame Happy Hour in the Genesee Brewhouse inside Blue Cross Arena.  The Sports Bar is live from Blue Cross Arena until 7pm! Say hello to Gene Battaglia and Mike Danger behind section 119 before puck drop as they broadcast on The Fan Rochester.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJrcy5jb20vbmV3cy9kZXRhaWwvZ2FtZWRheS1ub3Rlcy1xdW90ZXMtcm91bmQtMy1nYW1lLTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 20:23:03","ABC’s broadcast of last weekend’s XFL championship game drew 1.43 million average viewers, the league’s highest TV audience since its regular season opening weekend.  Saturday night’s title game on ABC and ESPN Deportes peaked at 1.8 million viewers, according to The Athletic. The XFL’s two opening weekend games on ABC in February averaged 1.5 million and 1.6 million viewers.  But viewership slumped after the first weekend, as the XFL’s 10-game regular season averaged 622,000 viewers per game on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, FX, ESPN+, and ESPN Deportes. The eight ABC games averaged 1.13 million viewers.  Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson’s 2023 XFL drew fewer viewers than the league’s 2020 season cut short by the pandemic. The 2020 XFL—whose TV partners spanned ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, FOX, FS1, and FS2 had three million viewers during its opening weekend, followed by an average of 1.87 million viewers per game in its season that lasted just five weeks of play.  And neither the 2020 nor 2023 XFL came close to replicating the success of Vince McMahon’s original XFL debut broadcast in 2002 of an estimated 54 million viewers on NBC. Ratings for subsequent games plummeted as the league folded after just one season.  The modern XFL competes with FOX’s USFL, as the two spring football leagues began overlapping on April 15. But for now, The Rock’s XFL is gearing up for a second season next year, which is further than the league’s 2001 or 2020 interactions ever reached.  “Renewals are going out now for ’24 season tickets, and we still have data coming in from this season,” Janet Duch, the XFL’s chief marketing and team business operations officer, told FOS. “What is the engagement? Where is the growth? For us right now, we are taking all the learnings from ’23 and applying them to ’24.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL3hmbC10aXRsZS1nYW1lLXNjb3Jlcy0xLTQzLW1pbGxpb24tdmlld2Vycy1hcy1sZWFndWUtcHJlcGFyZXMtZm9yLXNlY29uZC1zZWFzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:05:21","For millions of Americans, playing some type of video game is a daily occurrence. Games can be a welcome form of entertainment and relaxation for many, and the internet can even make gaming a social activity. However, excessive video game playing to the point of isolation, addiction or changes in mood or behavior are growing concerns with this pastime. These possible negative effects may also contribute to anxiety and depression in some people and gaming may have varying effects on social connections.  A new study published in Sociological Focus builds on existing research hinting at the importance of social connectivity and support for online gamers. In this study, Dr. Tyler Prochnow and Dr. Meg Patterson of the Department of Health Behavior at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health, along with colleagues from the University of North Carolina and Baylor University, used social network analysis to examine the social structure of an online gaming site at two points in time. The goal of this analysis was to see how social support, sense of community and symptoms of depression affect social connections over time.  The research team analyzed a social network consisting of members of an online football simulation gaming site, surveying members at the beginning and end of the game’s season. In the game, players play as the head coach of a football team and compete against other members of the site over 10 months. Members are able to communicate directly with each other through the site’s forums, chat and direct messaging capabilities.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Prochnow said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  There were 37 members who responded to the survey at the beginning and 40 who responded at the end, with 30 members represented in both samples. The researchers collected data on age, sex and other demographic factors as well as the number of hours members spent on the gaming site and playing other video games. Members also answered survey items on depressive symptoms and perceived ability to talk to someone about problems. The researchers also asked members to list people in real life and on the gaming site that they talked to about important life matters.  Research has found correlations between social network strength and depression, with stronger social networks giving people more opportunities to find support. Informal social networks, such as those found in online gaming, could play a crucial role in coping with stressors and seeking formal help for anxiety or depression. This, combined with research finding that people turn to social networks for help in times of trouble, add to the relevance of this study.  The study found that social support, sense of community and depressive symptoms played a role in changes to the game’s social structure over time. The researchers observed that people who reported more social support online, and those who reported less real-life support, were more likely to reach out to other members. They also found that communication ties were more likely to form when communications were reciprocated or transitive (involving three people groups or clusters). In addition, players who spent more time on the site were more likely to have communication ties.  The researchers also found that members who reported feeling a greater sense of community and placing value in being a part of the site were more likely to form communication ties over time. In addition to being more likely to connect, these members might feel more comfortable with conversations about real life issues. This points to the importance of a sense of community in online gaming sites; however, online communities can carry some downsides such as the potential for sites to serve as political and ideological echo chambers.  The study noted that although members with less real-life support were more likely to form communication ties, those reporting greater depressive symptoms were less likely to send communication ties over time. This could indicate a need for more formal support for members experiencing depressive symptoms, including telehealth mental health care options.  This study’s findings reinforce existing research on connections between mental health, social support and online gaming and point to the need for more research into the complicated relationships in these areas. More research into these areas and their interactions could help inform interventions to improve social connection and mental health for socially isolated communities and populations living in socially isolating times such as the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdG9kYXkudGFtdS5lZHUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9jb3VsZC1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtaW5nLXNvY2lhbC1uZXR3b3Jrcy1oYXZlLWEtcG9zaXRpdmUtaW1wYWN0LW9uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:45:00","Gaming monetization company Xsolla launched operations in Israel in April, bringing various services to local game developers. During that time, Xsolla’s Justin Berenbaum and Sam Gaglani paid Start-up Nation a visit to further explore opportunities in the local ecosystem.  Global video game market revenues are expected to reach over $221 billion by the end of 2023, with mobile games having the largest market volume with revenues of more than $172b. The Israeli market continues to grow as a part of that ecosystem, with estimated revenues of more than $427 million by year’s end.  Xsolla President Chris Hewish talked to The Jerusalem Post about the biggest trends in gaming, cultural differences between American and European gamers, and how Israel fits into the global gaming market.  From your experience working with developers in the US and Europe, what would you say were the biggest trends in gaming over the last year?  Working with American and European game developers over the past year, we have seen some astounding improvements, such as the growth of cross-platform game usage, greater interest in cloud-based gaming platforms, and comprehensive social elements within today’s interactive landscape.  Despite critically examining environmental factors, game developers are aware that success depends on offering unique yet thrilling experiences for players worldwide. Sustainability practices are driving indie gaming communities higher than ever before. The importance of inclusive game design is growing as developers work to include players of all abilities and portray a variety of cultures in their narratives. This is made possible by technological advancements, so Xsolla is pleased to support creators who push the boundaries of technology.  GRIME promotional image. (credit: CLOVER BITE)  What kinds of trends should we expect to see in the industry this year?  This year’s many noteworthy developments are furthering the Metaverse, as creators experiment with new forms of related content that go beyond the confines of traditional video games. Subscription services offering access to a library of games for a fixed monthly charge are anticipated to gain widespread popularity as the number of people who own smartphones increases and mobile internet speeds improve. We also foresee a rise in the use of NFTs and blockchain technology in games, making it possible for developers to implement novel ways of making money off of their creations. We hope to see a continuous dedication to making games featuring people, themes and settings that reflect the diversity and inclusivity the gaming industry strives for.  How would you describe the differences between American and European gaming at the moment?  Comparing the rising expansion of the American and European gaming industries offers important insights into how different cultural quirks translate into various gameplay experiences worldwide. Numerous contributing factors significantly impact the landscape of this ever-expanding industry across regions, from subject matter selection to production methods to player preference.  While many memorable video games played around the world are inspired by one ancient legend, American game developers place more emphasis on contemporary issues affecting Americans today, such as pop culture trends or controversial political barbs. The populace’s attitude when sitting in the player’s seat greatly influences their gaming choices.  There are considerable differences in gaming preferences between different geographic areas. European gamers like strategy and simulation games with deep story lines, whereas American players favor first-person shooters with lots of action.  As for Israel – where do you think the Israeli gaming industry fits into the global gaming ecosystem?  Israel has differentiated itself by making significant recent advancements across various elements of contemporary video game design, despite being relatively minor compared to well-known worldwide marketplaces like Europe or America’s Game Development community.  Another feature generating headlines recently was their significant influence on properly offering top-notch quality products focused on Mobile gamers one after another while supporting local economies through successful business ventures.  The innovative Game Network infrastructure on which the adtech market sub-sector primarily relies to provide analytical data metrics and customer acquisition benefits and grow the local scheme, while competing against global industry leaders frequently results in sizable rewarded corporatized Investments along with successful Acquisitions. Israeli game creators, studios, start-ups, and IT corporations are increasingly collaborating with foreign businesses; this is a relatively recent trend.  Given Israel’s exceptional workforce’s wealth of technical know-how and unparalleled creativity, both crucial building blocks for creating long-term success, it is not surprising that these well-known international organizations have chosen to collaborate with Israel. As time passes, their cooperation is mutually beneficial, further solidifying Israel’s standing as one of the major global hubs for developing video games.  What are the biggest opportunities for Israeli gaming developers this year? What are some of the challenges they will face?  This year, the opportunities for young Israeli game makers are limitless. Innovative business owners have many opportunities to develop engaging experiences globally thanks to expanding global markets accessible through mobile platforms and partnerships with well-established international gaming outlets.  In addition to the difficult task of obtaining vital capital that enables them to transform their notions from concepts on paper into reality, these visionaries must contend with fierce competition within a cutthroat sector. Israeli game makers face a complex web of data privacy laws and content limitations when attempting to expand their abilities outside their native market.  Israeli developers can establish a perfect workplace that attracts top talent and frees them up to concentrate on innovation and quality with the help of Xsolla. Through our investment and partnership programs, we can secure funding and resources for game development while ensuring compliance with regional laws and regulations through our platform. Israel is currently one of the hotspots in the gaming industry due to its growing number of tech specialists and state-of-the-art infrastructure.  As a result, many regional studios are looking for new methods to engage with gamers worldwide, but doing so necessitates overcoming some particular challenges. Enter Xsolla, a company that provides developers looking to enter new markets outside of their native country with anything from efficient payment processing options to all-encompassing marketing solutions.  The best part is that we’re dedicated to assisting Israeli game developers in developing settings that draw and keep top industry talent, which is essential for remaining competitive in today’s gaming business.

The only true power Nintendo has over your adventure is the start and end point of its main story, with the former needing to be expertly curated in its direction to give you everything you'll need to flourish from that point onwards. It’s a level of bold authorship that trusts the player to write the rest of their story.  Crafting an opening as strong as Tears of the Kingdom’s is no mean feat, and while many games of the past have wowed with their introductions, I’m not sure any have quite nailed it like Nintendo has here. Breath of the Wild was close, delicately introducing key gameplay mechanics scattered around its Great Plateau. The Last of Us kicks off a story like no other, masterfully reaching narrative highs as Joel sinks to personal lows. Bioshock and its sequels craft a sense of place like no other, the fallen utopias of Rapture and Columbia welcoming you with states of unease. But, magically, Tears of the Kingdom manages to hit on all three of these fronts, combining them to create a video game opening like no other.  Loading Play  Mechanical Engineering  Nintendo has long been the master of naturally introducing gameplay mechanics into the early levels of its games. From Mario's first 8-bit jump onto a Goomba, through the GameCube era and Metroid Prime's all-action opening, to Breath of the Wild and beyond, Nintendo is a master of setting out rules that never feel restrictive, but are there to nurture the fun. There are obviously parallels to be drawn between both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild’s opening hours, from the reawakening in a cave to the inescapable tutorial area full of lessons to be learned. But the echoes seem stronger with games in the Metroid series this time around, and not just due to the literally heartbreaking intro scene in which Link has his maximum health decimated.  Metroid loves nothing more than to tease you with a full arsenal of abilities only for them to be torn away as you spend the following hours collecting them all back as you battle physical amnesia. It’s essentially what Tears of the Kingdom is doing here, but instead of removing all of the special skills you’ve become accustomed to over dozens of hours in Breath of the Wild and tasking you with getting them back, it replaces them with a whole new suite of physics-based gadgetry. Thankfully, Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t make you wait anywhere near as long as Metroid Prime, for example, instead granting you the inventive and endlessly fun Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall abilities within its first couple of hours.  By carefully spreading these abilities out across the tutorialised Great Sky Island, each shrine and journey between them in this relatively limited space is there to teach you the basics of how these powers work before setting you free to unleash them on its wider world. It’s a delicate balance pulled off perfectly, as you’re forced to use them to solve basic puzzles – like building a raft to cross unswimmable waters – but also rewarded for exploring and experimenting with them, such as using Ascend to acquire handy warm-weather clothing.  “ Great Sky Island is only the tip of the iceberg of what Tears of the Kingdom has to offer, but gives you so much to play with.  Although ‘rules’ are set out when you’re granted each new ability, like Breath of the Wild you’re encouraged to break them. Great Sky Island is only the tip of the iceberg of what Tears of the Kingdom has to offer, but gives you so much to play with so early that what might take less than an hour to complete could easily blossom into three or four. The pacing of how quickly you get the powers, as well as their geographical spacing, is masterfully executed as Nintendo keeps things consistently fresh without ever threatening to overwhelm. Playing at your own pace is part of the joy of open-world Zelda, and mastering these new abilities will only be to the benefit of unlocking more fun later on. Of course, this sense of starting again is not only bound to gameplay systems but intrinsically linked to the story it's trying to tell.  Tale as Old as Time  Loss is the catalyst for many great tales. Whether it’s the deeply personal loss of a loved one as depicted in The Last of Us, or the galaxy-ending threat posed after the iconic tragedy of the Normandy at the beginning of Mass Effect 2, loss is something we’ve all experienced. It’s a specifically painful and relatable event in terms of Tears of the Kingdom as the Hyrule you got to know so intimately well in its predecessor is changed forever within minutes of playing.  Loading Play  Of course, Tears of the Kingdom threatens to inflict both personal and world-threatening disasters. The beginning of Link’s latest adventure takes us on an expedition into the bowels of Hyrule Castle as Princess Zelda searches for clues as to what’s causing the mysterious gloom. It’s an immediately engaging introduction that delivers mystery and spectacle, and births a dangerous new threat all in the space of under 10 minutes.  The Princess may once again be in another castle, but there’s something about TOTK’s introduction that doesn’t feel as scripted or plagued with cliche as it could so easily be. It’s an altogether more exciting start to the story than Breath of the Wild because it holds you back before setting you free, which gives more of an emotional charge to spark your mission. Losing Zelda – seeing her slip away, just out of grasp – powerfully highlights the emotional connection between her and Link, and now it’s severed. It’s a fantastic sequence that culminates in the ripping up of the Hyrule you've been familiar with and an introduction to its stunning new Sky Isles.  A Sense of Place  Some of the most effective game openings use the trick of starting in the familiar but quickly plunging into somewhere wholly strange and wondrous. Tears of the Kingdom’s transition from Breath of the Wild’s well-known Hyrule to its new, devastated form is the perfect example, as Link leaps onto the Great Sky Island as the majestic score swells. It’s a more serene dive compared to Bioshock's bathysphere into Rapture, but one that serves as much purpose. In Irrational’s 2007 masterpiece, the familiar is a passenger aircraft, and the firmly unfamiliar an underwater city gone to hell. In Tears of the Kingdom, the familiar is waking up in a cave, just like you do in Breath of the Wild, but the yellow grass outside is nothing like the lush fields found below in Hyrule. It’s simple, but something as subtle as changing the colour of the grass can have as much effect as a transition from a burning plane to an ocean metropolis.  Of course, its Sky Isles conjure up images much more akin to those found amongst the clouds of Columbia in Bioshock Infinite. Booker's walk through a Utopia harbouring dark layers plays out expertly and is one of my favourite opening stretches of any game. The world-building is second to none as a vivid sense of place is developed at every turn. NPCs tell tales of the city's history, serving as both a welcoming smile to your new surroundings but also a warning of the sinister secrets lurking behind them. While the Great Sky Island isn’t a bustling city complete with barbershop quartets, it has non-hostile Constructs to talk to. Their main purpose is to aid with gameplay tips, but they also offer unique insight into the land they inhabit. The same can be said for Rauru, your Zonai guide, who serves as both a storyteller and worldbuilder during these opening moments.  Loading Play  This new layered Hyrule is a world that at first feels foreign and to an extent daunting, but soon becomes the playground for Tears' jewel in the crown – its gameplay, something Nintendo has historically valued more than anything else. Breath of the Wild was a fantastic example of gameplay limited only by your imagination, set in a vibrant open world, but its story was a lot shallower. The Last of Us gave us an all-too-familiar world-turning-to-hell-before-our-eyes tale but its gameplay roots were well-trodden. Tears of the Kingdom achieves a rare feat: its spellbinding opening pays equally close attention to the trifecta – or Triforce, if you will – of story, world, and gameplay.  Near the end of your time on the island, one last masterstroke is played. You return to the cave where your story began, in a place that feels familiar yet exciting, but this time with a fresh suite of skills begging to be experimented with. It’s a poetic nod to your newly-acquired Recall ability, which allows you to unlock new doors of discovery. It completes a cadence expertly constructed in an opening hour or two that sets the foundations of adventure for hundreds more to come.

It’s called Despelote and is described as a “beautiful slice-of-life adventure” about childhood and the world’s favorite sport. Created by Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, the title’s set in Ecuador in 2001, which was when the country had its first succesful qualifying run for the World Cup.  Gameplay involves exploring the city of Quito, playing soccer and engaging in “playful, funny interactions” with various townspeople. It boasts a first person perspective and a highly unique art style that merges grainy photo realism with flourishes of animation. Not sure what that means? There’s a teaser trailer.  Panic says the game was inspired by co-creator Cordero’s childhood and it boasts full voice acting in Spanish with the option for localized subtitles. Much of the dialogue was actually captured in real life on the streets of Ecuador to give it a bit more flavor. The same goes for the background ambient noise.  It’s worth noting that this is a narrative title first and a soccer game second, so don’t expect a full-on sim like FIFA. There looks to be plenty of opportunities to kick things, pass things and dribble, however, as you explore the town, “getting caught up in mischief and soaking in the local culture.”  Despelote first appeared on the scene in 2021 at that year’s Summer Games Fest, but there wasn’t an official publisher or release platform back then. As for Panic, the company’s been busy meeting the demands of Playdate portable console owners in addition to publishing nifty indie titles.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9wYW5pYy1hbmQtc29ueS1kcm9wLXRyYWlsZXItZm9yLXVuaXF1ZS1zb2NjZXItZ2FtZS13aXRoLWEtbmFycmF0aXZlLXR3aXN0LTE2NDAxNzc3MC5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL2FtcC9wYW5pYy1hbmQtc29ueS1kcm9wLXRyYWlsZXItZm9yLXVuaXF1ZS1zb2NjZXItZ2FtZS13aXRoLWEtbmFycmF0aXZlLXR3aXN0LTE2NDAxNzc3MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

No. 1-seeded Castle View and No. 2 Mead both scored 1-goal wins over the last two Class 4A girls lacrosse state champions to punch their tickets to the title game.  Castle View scored its game-winning goal with 17 seconds against defending state champion and No. 5 Green Mountain to grab a 10-9 victory in the first semifinal. Mead put in its game-winning goal with 5 seconds remaining versus the 2021 state champion and No. 3 Evergreen for a 13-12 win in a game that ended at 10:50 p.m. due to a more than an hour and a half lighting delay.  The Sabercats and Mavericks will square in the 4A state championship game at 5:30 p.m. Friday, May 19, at the University of Denver’s Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium.  (1) Castle View 10, (5) Green Mountain 9  Castle View senior Evie Tanella sent the Sabercats back to the Class 4A girls lacrosse championship game with a game-winning goal Wednesday night at Randy Penn Stadium.  Tanella scored the eventual game-winning goal with 17 seconds to play in the first state semifinal. Top-seeded Castle View came away with a 10-9 victory over Green Mountain — 4A defending state champions.      “It was really stressful,” Tanella said about Green Mountain tying the game 9-9 with 61 seconds left in regulation-time. “On the next draw I just knew that had to be our ball. The draw is all that mattered to me.”  Tanella was able to win the draw against Green Mountain sophomore Avery Freedman. Tanella eventually got the ball back and rifled a shot past Green Mountain senior goalie Gretchen Hoffman with 17 seconds left to give Castle View a 10-9 lead.  Green Mountain (12-6 record) had one last chance to tie the game after getting control on the next face-off, but the Rams couldn’t get a shot on net before time expired.  “It’s hard to be back at the same field you were at last year and we didn’t make it happen,” Castle View coach Samantha Silverman said about the semifinal loss to Thompson Valley a year ago. “We held it together this year which was awesome. We’ve been working a lot of the situations we might see here. We were able to hang onto the ball for three minutes. The last two years helped us be prepared for this.”  Castle View jumped out to an earlier 5-1 lead in the first 15 minutes of the opening half. The Sabercats (17-1) never trailed, but the Rams rallied pouring in three goals in the final 10 minutes.  Freedman, who finished with four goals on the night, put one into the back of the net with 1:01 left to tie the game at 9-9.  “They put everything on the field today,” Green Mountain coach Gia Lombardi said. “I’m so proud of them. Especially how we started this season. Making to semifinals with a 16-player team. I’m so proud of them.”  The Rams had their Cinderella story run to the 4A state title last year, also as the No. 5 seed. Green Mountain defeated the No. 4, No. 1 and No. 2 on its way to its first girls lacrosse state title.  Castle View also has some rich state history. The Sabercats were the state runner-up in 2021 as the No. 10 seed and advanced to the semifinals last season.  “We have been talking about that all season,” Silverman said of the Sabercats’ run to the title game in 2021. “It is very different being that No. 1 seed. We have kind of let that go and just played our game.”  Tanella had a team-high four goals and junior Tessa Boehm added a trio of goals for the Sabercats. Senior Riley Schultz had a pair of goals and senior goalie Gabby Goodwin made a huge save with 13:30 left in the second half that kept Castle View in the lead.  “We were playing team ball and no one was playing hero ball,” Tanella said. “We wanted everyone to get a touch.”  Castle View will attempt to win it first girls lacrosse title Friday night at the University of Denver.  “We are such a better team now and it is really just mental,” Tanella said. “Last year we were so far in our heads and almost against each other. This year we are all a team. We work well together and we are a family. This is a true team.”              (2) Mead 13, (3) Evergreen 12  Mead midfielder Allie Hartman literally dropped the ball before putting in the game-winning goal into the back of the net Wednesday night against Evergreen.  With the semifinal tied 12-12, the Mavericks (15-2) held the for nearly two minutes after winning a key face-off. Mead coaches call ‘Raptor” for the final play, a play for Hartman — senior at Silver Creek High School who’s mascot is the Raptors — to drive and score.  Hartman started her drive with about 10 seconds to play. She dropped the ball for a split second before regaining it and getting past Evergreen senior Averi Gardner for an open look.      “We got the look that we wanted. I take pride in my drives,” said Hartman, who scored four of the Maverick’s six second-half goals. “It worked out.”  Hartman and junior Sierra Ryan carried the load offensive for Mead in its 12th straight victory.  “We have so many sets,” Mead coach Katie Coleman said. “We always say that if we call out something that they don’t feel comfortable with that’s OK. We like to have options for them.”  The Mavericks used the right options after trailing by as many as three goals in the first half against the Cougars (11-7). Evergreen held a 6-5 lead with 7:37 remaining in the first half when the game went into a lightning delay.  It took nearly two hours for the lightning and driving rain to clear, but Mead made the most of its time in the locker room.  “With the postseason you never know how much time you have left,” Coleman said. “This group loves each other so much it was just bonus time for them to hangout with each other.”  Mead is in its first year with a girls lacrosse program.  It was the second meeting this season between the Cougars and Mavericks. Mead took a 13-8 win two weeks ago on May 4. Hartman led the way for the Mavericks in the first meeting with a game-high five goals.  “We knew we would have to face (Evergreen) again,” Coleman said. “I’m really good friends with Rachel Sanford (Evergreen coach). She has been a part of my lacrosse journey and coached me. She is a phenomenal coach and it’s hard to beat a great team twice.”  It was the final high school game for Evergreen seniors Averi Gardner and Bella Reece, who both will be heading to Boulder to play for the Buffaloes next season. Gardner and Reece were both key parts of the Cougars’ 2021 state championship team.  Evergreen won CHSAA’s first-ever 4A girls lacrosse state title in 2021 dominating the rest of the field with double-digit wins in all three state tournament victories.  Gardner finished with over 200 goals and 100 assists in three seasons. Reece missed the majority of games this season due to injury and gutted out playing during the postseason.  The championship game Friday will be a rematch from the season-opener for both Castle View and Mead on March 9. The Sabercats edged the Mavericks 7-6.  “Friday isn’t going to be easy, but we’ll be better prepared for it,” Coleman said of rebounding after falling behind early against Evergreen and going through the long delay.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2hzYWFub3cuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE3LzRhLWdpcmxzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLWFkdmFuY2UtdG8tc3RhdGUtdGl0bGUtZ2FtZS5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It's hard not to be excited if you're a Nashville fan. After 13 games, they're in third place in the Eastern Conference. Hany Mukhtar is off to his best start to an MLS season, just one behind Atlanta United 's Thiago Almada with 12 combined goals and assists. And most importantly, Nashville's defense has been elite, conceding just eight goals and putting them on pace for the best single-season defense in league history.  ""I'm certainly not going to get too excited at this point in time,"" he said following the match. ""There's too much football, too many things that can happen, too many scenarios that we just don't have answers to.""  ""We've seen so often in this league that you can be in a very good place and complacency sets in,"" reflected Smith. ""I don't think that'll happen to this group, but you can never be sure. It only takes one bad result, one poor result, and all of a sudden people are questioning what's going on. So while we're in this run, we want to try and reinforce some of the football that we've played.""  And while the soccer Nashville have played hasn't always been the most aesthetically pleasing in years past, it's hard not to enjoy what they've put on the field in 2023. Fafà Picault has been a vital attacking addition this season and the fans have taken notice.

If you try when the world isn't ending, then you probably won't get an accurate impression, given that the world isn't really ending. If you try while the world is actually ending, people won't be that interested in the results given their ""other concerns"" at the time. When an asteroid is about to dinosaur the humans, it's probably going to be difficult to get people to check out your preprint.  One team, attempting to find another way to study humans during the end times, tried to get around these problems using a computer game analogue. The team used the open world, massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) game ArcheAge for their experiment. In the study, which took place during a beta test, players were left to play as normal, completing quests, exploring, leveling up, and hoarding equipment as they wished. However, at the end of the 11 weeks players knew that the server would be deleted and all their progress and characters lost.  Advertisement Advertisement  ""And thus,"" the team wrote in their non-peer reviewed preprint paper, ""the outcome (or penalty) of players’ in-game behaviors in the last few days loses its meaning.""  The team believed that the deletion of the world provided a good proxy for the end of the real world, giving players no consequences to their actions. They believed it would help them answer age-old questions of whether humans would abandon moral ideals as the apocalypse looms.  The team analyzed over 270 million records of player behaviors in the game, such as leveling-up data and quest logs, to see if behavior of the players changed when they knew the ""world"" was ending. The game was surprisingly peaceful, bar a few outliers who chose to go on killing sprees.  ""Our findings show that there are no apparent pandemic behavior changes, but some outliers were more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior (e.g., player killing),"" the team wrote. ""We also found that contrary to the reassuring adage that 'even if I knew the world would go to pieces tomorrow, I would still plant my apple tree,' players abandoned character progression, showing a drastic decrease in quest completion, leveling, and ability changes at the end of the beta test.""  Advertisement Advertisement  Essentially, when the world is ending you probably won't spend much time on self-improvement (e.g. jogging). The team write that the people who stayed to the end of the game tended to be the most peaceful, perhaps having the most loyalty to the game. Meanwhile people who left the game earlier of their own volition, who the team called ""churners"", tended to exhibit the most antisocial behavior such as killing other players, as they lost ""their sense of responsibility and attachment to the game"".  Overall, though the team stress the study is of course limited by the fact that it took place in a video game, the end of this world was fairly peaceful, and at times even positive, with an emergence of pro-social behavior towards the end.  ""Our findings that the sentiment of social grouping specific chat channels trend towards 'happier' as the end times approach is a first indication of this pro-social behavior: existing social relationships are likely being strengthened,"" the team concluded. ""Further, we saw that players that stayed until the end of the world exhibited peaks in the number of small temporary groupings: new social relationships are being formed.""  The study is published in the Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web Companion, and a preprint version – which is not peer reviewed – can be accessed via arXiv.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlmbHNjaWVuY2UuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWUtc3R1ZHktc2hvd3Mtd2hhdC1wZW9wbGUtZG8td2hlbi10aGUtd29ybGQtZW5kcy02ODk2MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Eagles and Irish are tied for seventh overall in the conference; two games back of Virginia and Miami, who sit atop the Coastal, for fourth. BC is ranked for the 10th consecutive week, peaking at No. 21 in the USA Today Coaches Top-25 and NCBWA writer’s poll. Senior center fielder Barry Walsh leads the BC lineup with a .310 batting average and 12 stolen bases. He has hit leadoff in each of the last five games and homered twice in that stretch. Junior first baseman Joe Vetrano is slugging a team-high .590 with 15 home runs, including three at No. 2 Wake Forest, and nine doubles to go with a .295 average. Graduate right-hander Chris Flynn leads the pitching staff with a 6-2 record, 3.96 earned run average and 74 strikeouts. Fellow grad transfer RHP, Andrew Roman, occupies the closer spot and has a 1.77 ERA with eight saves.  THE BC-ND SERIES  Boston College trails the all-time series against Notre Dame, 18-35. The series began in 1996 when the Fighting Irish joined the Big East. When the two sides reunited in the ACC in 2014, the Eagles won the initial match-up; 4-1 in 11 innings at Chicago State.  Postseason Positioning: Despite having already clinched a spot in this year’s ACC Championship, BC faces Notre Dame on the final weekend of the season for the third time since 2017. In the final games played on Shea Field, the Eagles swept the Irish in 2017 to earn a trip to the ACC Championship. In 2019, BC clinched its postseason berth at home behind 7.2 innings of one-run ball from Dan Metzdorf.  Last Time They Met: Boston College claimed game one in South Bend as Joe Mancini gave the Eagles seven innings of one-run ball in a 7-4 win over the No. 18 Fighting Irish. ND scored eight runs in the first inning of game two to even the series and used an 11-run sixth on Sunday to overcome an 8-5 BC lead in the rubber-match.  RESUME NOTES  • The Eagles enter the final week of the regular season with the No. 13 RPI in the nation and No. 27 strength of schedule.  • BC’s 21 road/neutral wins tied for the most in the Power 5. Seven of the Eagles’ road/neutral wins have come against Q1 opponents; the most in the country.  • BC is the only program in the country with 12-plus Q1 wins (13) and 12-plus road wins (18).  • The Eagles first 18 games were played away from home as they amassed a 14-4 record over that stretch.  • A Northeast school last hosted a NCAA Regional on campus in 1991 when three-seed Maine hosted the Northeast Regional.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYmNlYWdsZXMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE3L2Jhc2ViYWxsLWdhbWVkYXktYWxzLWF3YXJlbmVzcy1nYW1lLWZyaWRheS1hdC1mZW53YXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The free trial and refund policy combined effectively allow someone to play three-and-a-half hours of a game while still being able to get their money back.  Free trials for new triple-A games are sure to be popular, and especially so with Steam Deck owners who will appreciate being able to test how well a game runs on the handheld before deciding to buy it. If the trials also allow for smaller downloads, all the better for Steam Deck owners.

Standing Stone Games said.  Standing Stone went on to say that Middle-earth Enterprises, the company that controls the rights to the Lord of the Rings series, continue to be ""huge fans"" of The Lord of the Rings Online. The game is now in its seventeenth year of continuous operation, and Standing Stone said the game is ""evergreen.""  ""LOTRO is like the long-lived Ents, Elves and Dwarves; and we mere mortals, are the stewards of LOTRO and its community,"" Standing Stone said.

It combines elements of platforming and exploration, while it’s described as a mix between Metroid and Minecraft.  What to Look for in Android Games  The Google Play Store is the primary place where Android users find and download games with nearly four million apps available. It may sound daunting to search for games, but Google’s most popular free and paid games lists are a good place to start. Here’s what to look for in Android games.  The first thing you should do is check to see if the mobile game you want to play is compatible with your Android device. Most apps in the Google Play Store require that your smartphone is running, at least, Android version 4.4 KitKat—which was released in October 2013. Older mobile devices might not be able to run most modern games.  You should also consider how much storage space is available on your device. While some games have small file sizes of only a few hundred megabytes, there are others that have very large file sizes of up to 20GB. Luckily, there are Android devices that are designed with an expansion card slot built-in. If you run out of space, you can always pop in a microSD card to add extra storage. But if your device doesn’t have an expansion slot, then you’ll have to delete a few apps, photos, or videos to free up some space or get a new smartphone with a larger capacity altogether.  Meanwhile, when it comes to price, the Google Play Store divides games into two categories: Free-to-play and paid. And while free-to-play sounds self-explanatory, it doesn’t mean these games are completely free. Free versions of games might have commercial breaks or some limitations to gameplay, while in-app purchases can upgrade or remove restrictions. For example: Cooking Craze: Restaurant Game includes in-app purchases for additional items and bundles, but purchases are not required to play this game.  Additionally, most paid games download to your Android device completely unlocked. But, it might also include in-app purchases for upgrades. For example: Monopoly has in-app purchases to unlock special editions of the game. There’s also a gaming subscription called Google Play Pass for Android users. Games available for the service include zero ads and in-app purchases, so you’re free to play without restrictions for $5/mo.  Finally, the most important thing about picking an Android game is if it’s fun to play. Whether you’re going to spend a few minutes or hours upon hours playing it on your smartphone or tablet, games have to look like a fun and immersive challenge to conquer.

"game","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:39:00","New York Yankees pitcher Domingo German has been suspended 10 games and fined by Major League Baseball for violating the rules regarding foreign substances, it was announced Wednesday.  German will not appeal and began serving the suspension Wednesday. He cannot be replaced on the roster and the Yankees will be forced to play with 25 men instead of 26.  The right-hander was ejected in the fourth inning of Tuesday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays for having his hand coated with something tackier than rosin, umpire James Hoye said.  ""The instant I looked at his hand, it was extremely shiny and extremely sticky,"" Hoye told a pool reporter Tuesday night. ""It's the stickiest hand I've ever felt. My fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.""  German denied Hoye's accusation, saying he didn't have anything on his hand other than rosin.  ""It was definitely just the rosin bag,"" German said through an interpreter. ""It was sweat and the rosin bag. I don't need any extra help to grab the baseball.""  Hoye's crew examined German during an April 15 start against Minnesota but allowed him to stay in that game after Hoye had asked German to wash rosin off his hand and some had remained on the pitcher's pinkie.  The suspension and fine was announced Wednesday by MLB senior vice president Michael Hill. Barring rainouts, German will be eligible to return May 28 against San Diego.  ""He went over the line that umpires deemed and now we've got to live with the consequences of that,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday in Toronto. ""No one player needs to carry this load. We'll share it all and we'll do it together.""  Yankees right-hander Luis Severino, 29, who hasn't pitched this season due to a right lat strain, is expected to be activated off the injured list Sunday to take German's spot in the rotation against the Cincinnati Reds.  A two-time All-Star, Severino has not pitched for the Yankees this season because of a right lat strain. He allowed two runs and six hits over 3⅓ innings Tuesday in a rehab start with Double-A Somerset.  Also on Wednesday, the Yankees put reliever Ian Hamilton on the 15-day injured list because of a strained right groin. New York recalled left-hander Nick Ramirez from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  In other news, left-hander Carlos Rodón threw from 90 feet without pain Wednesday. He has not pitched this season because of a sore left forearm and an ailing back.  German's ejection was the fourth since Major League Baseball started its crackdown on prohibited grip aids two years ago and the second this season.  New York Mets pitcher Max Scherzer was suspended for sticky stuff on April 20, and Seattle's Hector Santiago and Arizona's Caleb Smith were suspended in 2021.  The Associated Press contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21sYi9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjcyNDgyL3lhbmtlZXMtZG9taW5nby1nZXJtYW4tc3VzcGVuZGVkLWZvcmVpZ24tc3Vic3RhbmNlLXJ1bGXSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9tbGIvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY3MjQ4Mi95YW5rZWVzLWRvbWluZ28tZ2VybWFuLXN1c3BlbmRlZC1mb3JlaWduLXN1YnN0YW5jZS1ydWxlP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2024-06-01","Not Discerned","{""Apex"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:38:34","The Kickstarter campaign for the official Apex Legends board game has launched, and if funded, the game is expected to arrive in June 2024. Developer and manufacturer Glass Cannon Unplugged is raising funds until June 8, and it’s hoping to secure at least $244,491 to move forward with the project. In case you were wondering, the company’s credentials include the board game adaptation of the video game Frostpunk, which secured close to $3 million during its 2020 Kickstarter campaign.  The Apex Legends board game is a team-based, tabletop skirmish game for up to four players, anchored by some great-looking miniatures in three-dimensional terrain. Each game takes around 60 minutes to complete (you can see some gameplay here), and the gameplay is about using abilities, resource management, and clever maneuvering, all of which mirror many of the aspects of the popular battle royale shooter.  Anyone who’s looking to secure a copy of the game can pledge their support starting at the core tier for $87, which saves you roughly $37 off the planned retail price. The core tier gets access to the boxed copy of the game when it launches (or if it launches — this is Kickstarter, after all). The base game includes four legends (Bangalore, Bloodhound, Wraith, and Gibraltar) represented with highly-detailed, unpainted minis. The company has plans to launch additional characters in future expansions.  Apex Legends board game $86 Prices taken at time of publishing. Developer Glass Cannon Unplugged plans to launch the game in June 2024 $86 at Kickstarter  For those willing to contribute to the stretch goals of the game, additional tiers are available to back that include more cool extras. For instance, the $125 Full Team tier will include additional minis for Pathfinder and Lifeline, in addition to extra terrain and props, while the $256 Gameplay All-in tier gets all of that, plus two additional squad expansions, card sleeves, a playing mat, and a supply minis pack. Investing in the Full Team or All-in tier in advance will save you $54 or $113, respectively, versus their planned retail prices.  As an added bonus, backers of any tier of the board game will get a free copy of the planned Loba expansion pictured below when it launches (the launch date hasn’t been announced). Some of the other characters planned for future expansions include Caustic, Revenant, Octane, Wattson, Crypto, and Mirage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL2RlYWxzLzIzNzI1NjU1L2FwZXgtbGVnZW5kcy1ib2FyZC1nYW1lLWtpY2tzdGFydGVyLXRpZXJzLXByZS1vcmRlctIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC9kZWFscy8yMzcyNTY1NS9hcGV4LWxlZ2VuZHMtYm9hcmQtZ2FtZS1raWNrc3RhcnRlci10aWVycy1wcmUtb3JkZXI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But premium subscriptions and other in-app upgrades are tempting some gamers to spend over $200 per month, Money reported.  Discover: Keep an Eye Out for Rare Dime Worth as Much as $2,000 — How To Spot It  Learn: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a first-person shooter available to play for free online, is played by more than 5 million people every month and made an average of $3.2 million per day in March. Money says the popular battle royale-style game Fortnite made over $20 billion in its first four years through cosmetics alone. Candy Crush saw $1 billion in revenue in 2022 from purchasing extra lives and power boosts.  These numbers are impressive, but only a small fraction of players spend money on in-game purchases.  The 2021 study “No Such Thing As a Free App” by Imam Salehudin, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Indonesia, and his research partner Frank Alpert, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Queensland, shows that only about 5% of users spend money on in-app purchases. About 70% of all “freemium” app revenue comes from the top 10% of spenders, Salehudin says. But Money noted that those who do spend money, spend a lot of it. The study found that the average Pokémon Go user spent $267 in July of 2016, the month it was released.  Salehudin says that the biggest spenders tend to be the ones who can’t control their spending — especially children.  Nara Ward, a mother to two young children in Barbados, told BBC News that keeping track of her kids’ spending when playing games is a full-time job. When her 12-year-old son started playing Roblox, a game with a largely young fanbase, he spent $200 in Apple credit in a few days.

"game","2023-05-17","07:58:00","{""Calgary"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:52:45","Not even the return of two star players could push the Coachella Valley Firebirds to a decisive victory over a desperate Calgary Wranglers on Wednesday.  Facing elimination from the Calder Cup Playoffs, the top-seeded Wranglers held off the Firebirds with a 1-0 Game 4 win in their best-of-five series in front of 7,758 inside Acrisure Arena.  American Hockey League rookie of the year Tye Kartye and Jesper Frödén, who led the Firebirds in goals before being recalled by the NHL’s Seattle Kraken, were back in the valley Wednesday. It was their first Firebirds action in weeks after joining the Kraken on their Stanley Cup Playoffs run.  They returned to the valley on Tuesday along with goaltender Chris Driedger, an NHL veteran.  But the Wranglers, the AHL’s top team during the regular season, evidently weren’t quite ready for their season to come to an end. Coming off what appeared to be a physically and emotionally draining Game 3 triple overtime loss, Calgary scored the first goal of the game in the second period and held on to stave off elimination.  The best-of-five series is now tied, 2-2.  ""You've got to give them credit with the way they played,"" Firebirds head coach Dan Bylsma said of the Wranglers. ""They were backs against the wall and they came out pedal down and they put pucks behind our defense and made it tough on us.  ""They came with a lot of gas and we didn't deal with it very well,"" Bylsma added.  Just as most suspected, the series between the AHL’s two top teams during the regular season will now head to a winner-take-all Game 5 on Friday inside Acrisure Arena. Puck drop is set for 7 p.m.  Both Kartye and Frödén, who combined for 55 goals and 54 assists for the Firebirds this season, started Wednesday, along with forward Cameron Hughes, blueliners Brogan Rafferty and Gustav Olofsson and netminder Joey Daccord.  It was Frödén’s first game in a Firebirds’ jersey since Feb. 20, and Kartye’s first since April 23. The two played with the Kraken, Coachella Valley’s NHL affiliate, until the Kraken’s postseason run came to an end Monday night in Dallas.  The game was the second since all-star Andrew Poturalski returned for the Firebirds following an absence since Jan. 26. Poturalski spent more than three months rehabilitating from a leg injury before returning to the lineup Monday.  With their full lineup back in action for the first time in months, the Firebirds had chances to score but couldn’t get the puck into the Calgary net. Perhaps their best chance came on a power play with 8:30 remaining in the game. Coachella Valley had multiple good looks at the net yet came up empty against AHL MVP Dustin Wolf, the Wranglers’ goalie.  After allowing the game-winning goal in the third overtime of Game 3, Wolf had a gutsy performance Wednesday. He saved 27 shots and recorded just the second shutout against the Firebirds inside Acrisure Arena.  ""Obviously, we didn't capitalize, but we'll be back Friday and do a better job,"" Frödén said.  Despite the loss, Daccord recorded 31 saves in the game. Calgary’s second-period goal ended a remarkable streak for Daccord, who went 123 minutes and 17 seconds spanning Monday and Wednesday's games without allowing a goal.  The Firebirds were 0-for-3 on the power play and 1-of-3 on the penalty kill in the game.  Kartye and Frödén will now be a part of a second elimination game this week, in a different league and for a different team. Kartye emphasized one key that the Firebirds will need to focus on Friday.  ""A fast start is going to be key on Friday,"" Kartye said. ""In the NHL it was the same thing. Dallas had a fast start (Monday) and ended up winning the game. I feel like if you can gain control of the game early and get up, it's hard to come back in those games because of the tight checking.""  In three previous elimination games this postseason, the Firebirds came out fast. They led 4-0 after one period in the first round and led 2-0 and 3-0 in the first period in two elimination games in the second round.  ""It seems like a story,"" Bylsma said with a smile, ""and one we have to write on Friday night.""  The goal  1-0, Wranglers: At the 12:40 mark of the first period, Cole Schwindt fired the puck past Daccord to give Calgary the lead. The goal came at the end of a power play after Carsen Twarynski was called for hooking.  Firebirds goal waived off  The Firebirds put the puck into the back of the net to take the lead in the first period, but referees waved off the goal due to goaltender interference. Play was paused for a few minutes while referees discussed the play and then explained it to Bylsma.  ""Clearly we were in the crease to start the power play there and there's pushing and shoving from their goaltender to our player and there's a bump that ensued as the play went off to the right of the goalie,"" Bylsma said. ""The referee's explanation was that the goaltender wasn't allowed to play his position to his ability.""  Bylsma wouldn't go as far as to say that he didn't agree with the call.  ""Let's just say that his explanation and my viewpoint weren't the same,"" Bylsma said. ""But he's the referee and he gets to make that call. Our guy was clearly in the blue paint to start with and there was contact there, for sure, and the play kind of ensued as a result of it. I can argue with it, but he made his call.""  Out of town scores  In the other Western Conference series, Milwaukee topped Texas 4-3 on Wednesday to take a 2-1 lead in that series. The winner of that series will face the winner of the Firebirds-Wranglers series for a spot in the Calder Cup final.  In the Eastern Conference, both series ended Wednesday night in 3-0 sweeps. Hershey defeated Hartford 3-1 to sweep that series and Rochester beat Toronto 8-4 to sweep that series. That means the Hershey Bears (Washington Capitals affiliate) will face the Rochester Americans (Buffalo Sabres affiliate) for a spot in the Calder Cup Championship.

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Discover GG  Step aside, xenomorphs—a new alien is in town, and his name is Reyu.  Reyu is the first playable character NFT to emerge from Random Games’ upcoming Unioverse franchise. So far, the team has released one Reyu comic book, 20,000 Reyu NFTs on Ethereum scaling network Polygon, eight short fiction stories with visual illustrations, and “The Proving Grounds”—an immersive mini-game of sorts in which players can race through a dystopian game environment and destroy bots as they try to top the leaderboard.  AD  AD  But this is no Dookey Dash—the Proving Grounds is an incredibly beautiful, cinematic experience, and feels like the beginning of a AAA game.  Take a look inside the Unioverse:  It’s unsurprising that the Proving Grounds looks so good—Random Games has a team of veteran game developers and writers. Random CEO Tony Harman helped create Grand Theft Auto while president at original developer DMA Design, and Random Games writer Brent Friedman has worked on narrative development for games like League of Legends and Call of Duty, as well as for TV series like “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” and “Star Trek: Enterprise.”  “With the Proving Grounds, we wanted to showcase what our Unioverse heroes can do in a gameplay environment and provide a taste of what’s to come,” Random Games CTO and co-founder Wyeth Ridgway told Decrypt via email.  Image: Random Games.  During Decrypt’s Proving Grounds playtest, the lighting was realistic and detailed, the character movement was smooth and polished, and the environments looked reminiscent of an “Alien” film. The music was immediately appealing, while the maze-like map of the Proving Grounds itself felt a bit like a 3D puzzle—like if Valve’s 2007 smash hit game Portal became the world from which Reyu must escape.  Reyu himself is a highly-detailed model and is equal parts menacing and chiseled, with a muscular exoskeletal armor, what appears to be a magic laser sword, and a gun that feels like part rifle, part crossbow.  Reyu in the Proving Grounds. Image: Random Games.  The Unioverse website describes Reyu as a “warrior monk,” and the company plans to release more characters from its franchise in the coming months and years. To me, Reyu looks like a human-xenomorph hybrid… imagine the intergalactic peace—or chaos—such an alliance would bring!  AD  AD  All comparisons aside, Ridgway told Decrypt that the Unioverse will be more like “a Roblox for AAA gaming” than a closed-source Web2 franchise. In fact, he emphasized that anyone can download the Unioverse assets and tell their own stories based on the parent lore.  What’s next for the ambitious franchise? The studio is taking a game-first and community-first approach.  “The next step is the multiplayer, battle royale game, then we’ll share an SDK with all the assets and tools,” Ridgway said, “and continue adding heroes and functionality so the community can build whatever they want.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xNDA0NzQvZW50ZXItdW5pb3ZlcnNlLWNpbmVtYXRpYy1zY2ktZmktZ2FtZS10YWtlcy1zaGFwZS1wb2x5Z29u0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzE0MDQ3NC9lbnRlci11bmlvdmVyc2UtY2luZW1hdGljLXNjaS1maS1nYW1lLXRha2VzLXNoYXBlLXBvbHlnb24_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Maybe it’s the best game, maybe it’s the most influential game, or maybe it’s the game that best reflected the current trends. Collectively, these individual chapters explain gaming history for experts and novices alike.  Each chapter includes an alternate choice, too.

An EA Sports representative confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday that it has contracted with OneTeam Partners to ""facilitate collegiate athletes' names and likenesses"" into the game, solving one of the major questions about college football's return to the video game space.  The partnership will include the chance for all eligible FBS players to opt in to have their likenesses in EA Sports College Football, the representative said. Those players will receive compensation for being placed in the game.  Details -- such as how much an athlete will receive and the structure of payments -- are still being finalized, but the EA Sports representative said the goal is to be ""as inclusive and equitable as possible."" On the OneTeam website, the company stated that if the influence of individual sales couldn't be figured out -- including for video game licensing -- then ""revenue will be divided equally among the athletes included in each licensing program.""  If a player does not want to be in the game, EA Sports would create a generic avatar and player in that athlete's place.  For participating players, it is possible a face scan of their likenesses could be in the game, the representative said, though not every athlete will receive a face scan because there are thousands of FBS players across the country. The representative said more than 120 FBS schools have committed to being in the game -- along with all 10 FBS conferences and the College Football Playoff -- with the goal remaining to have every FBS school in the game.  When EA Sports announced the return of its college football series in 2021, questions surrounding name, image and likeness were among the biggest it needed to answer. At the time, Notre Dame was among a small number of schools that indicated through statements or news reports that it would not agree to participate until NIL compensation was worked out.  Much has happened since many of those declarations, including the passage of NIL legislation and college athletes making money off their name, image and likenesses.  Following Wednesday's agreement, officials at Wisconsin, Northwestern, TCU, Fresno State and Tulane said their schools would now opt in to the game.  A Notre Dame source told ESPN on Wednesday that the school had been in touch with EA Sports to help with NIL integration for the video game. It doesn't seem, though, that Notre Dame has made a decision on being in the game.  OneTeam, which has partnerships with players' unions, including the NFLPA, MLSPA and USWNT Players Association, has previously worked with EA Sports on the Madden football and FIFA (now EA Sports FC) franchises.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2ODA4OS9lYS1zcG9ydHMtbGV0dGluZy1mYnMtcGxheWVycy1vcHQtMjAyNC12aWRlby1nYW1l0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjY4MDg5L2VhLXNwb3J0cy1sZXR0aW5nLWZicy1wbGF5ZXJzLW9wdC0yMDI0LXZpZGVvLWdhbWU_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The win puts Seattle up three games to one in the best of seven series and leaves them one victory away from winning the Ed Chynoweth Cup. Their first chance to win it is Game Five Friday, also at the accesso ShoWare Center. Game time is 7:05 p.m.  The goal was Guenther’s league leading sixteenth of the postseason. Reid Schaefer and Luke Prokop had the assists.  “It was just kind of a fast break out of the D zone,” explained Guenther of the game winner. “Reido made a nice play. I cut to the middle; I really didn’t see a lot of support. Kopper (Prokop) was there, he made a nice play to Reido, a nice pass to me. There was some traffic in front and around me, so I just decided to get the shot off and it went in. It’s a pretty exciting goal.”  Seattle continues to win the third period in the playoffs, adding two more goals to their postseason total in the Game Four win. They’ve outscored their opponents 38-11 through their first eighteen playoff games. Thunderbirds head coach Matt O’Dette called it their best period of the night.  “It needed to be,” he said. “There were some good stretches, but also some bad stretches through the first forty (minutes). They’re a good team. They’re playing well and they made it hard on us. Sometimes you just have to stick with it, keep your composure and wait for your opportunity to score a big goal.”  For the third time in four games, Winnipeg opened the scoring when Carson Latimer struck at 16:25 or the opening period. Seattle responded when Kevin Korchinski fired home his third of the playoffs with just seventeen seconds remaining in the first.  “Sconer (Lucas Ciona) made a good play,” said Korchinski of his goal. “Working down low, heads-up play. He found me. There was a great screen in front from Dacher (Colton Dach) I think. He took away the goalie’s eyes and I found the back of the net.”  The teams traded goals in the second period. The Thunderbirds got their first lead on a Gracyn Sawchyn power play goal at 4:31 with Jeremy Hanzel and Kyle Crnkovic assisting. The ICE tied it four minutes later when Evan Friesen scored.  That brought us to the third period and Guenther’s game winner. Nico Myatovic then put the game away with an empty netter with eight seconds left.  “Both teams are going to play extremely hard Friday,” remarked O’Dette on Game Five. “We’ll have to play extremely well and give our best effort to win that game.”  If Game Six is necessary, it would be Sunday in Winnipeg. Should the series go the distance, Game Seven would be next Monday in Winnipeg as well.  T-BIRDS EXTRAS  With an assist on the game winning goal, Reid Schaefer extended his point streak to seven games.  Thomas Milic got the win in net with a thirty-one save effort. The win was his fifteenth of the playoffs, one more than he had last spring in the postseason.  With an assist on the empty net goal Jared Davidson now has fifty-two career playoff points with the Thunderbirds. He is three points back of Ethan Bear for second in franchise history.  The is the first time in Thunderbirds history they will have a chance to clinch a league title on home ice. In 2017 when they won the Ed Chynoweth Cup, they won on the road in Regina.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vc2VhdHRsZXRodW5kZXJiaXJkcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90aHVuZGVyYmlyZHMtY2FwdHVyZS1nYW1lLWZvdXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Games have announced the next Mortal Kombat game will be officially revealed on Thursday, 18 May 2023, following a number of major teasers. A post on Twitter confirmed these grand plans with an ominous message: ‘Tomorrow is a new dawn.’  An accompanying teaser video confirmed it’s now ‘time’ for the game’s grand reveal. As for what form this will take, it remains a mystery – but we can expect a formal trailer of some kind, potentially with meatier details than prior teasers.  So far, NetherRealm has taken a more symbolic approach to the game’s reveal, with early teasers revolving around the motif of time. The first contained an hourglass with exploding grains of sand. The second featured a ticking clock counting up from 9, 10, 11 – and then skipping 12 entirely, to hit 1.  This led many to assume the next Mortal Kombat wouldn’t be Mortal Kombat 12 – but rather a reboot, following previous events in the franchise which saw protagonist Liu Kang gaining the ability to re-write time and history.  Read: Mortal Kombat 12 could be ‘Mortal Kombat 1’ per leaker  A subsequent leak suggested this was exactly the case, as reliable insider billbil-kun claimed the next game in NetherRealm’s beloved franchise would be a total refresh actually known as ‘Mortal Kombat 1‘. Tied to these leaks were rumours that characters including Homelander from The Boys and Peacemaker from The Suicide Squad could be guest fighters.  So far, these leaks have yet to be confirmed, but we won’t have to wait long to discover more about the upcoming game. The official reveal for the next Mortal Kombat is currently set for 18 May at 6:00 am PT. Here’s a quick rundown of how that translates to local timezones:  Australia – 11:00 pm AEST | 10:30 am ACST | 9:00 pm AWST (18 May)  – 11:00 pm AEST | 10:30 am ACST | 9:00 pm AWST (18 May) New Zealand – 1:00 am NZST (19 May)  – 1:00 am NZST (19 May) United States – 6:00 am PT | 9:00 am ET (18 May)  – 6:00 am PT | 9:00 am ET (18 May) United Kingdom – 2:00 pm BST | 3:00 pm CET (18 May)  Stay tuned to see what NetherRealm Studios has in store.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xMi1nYW1lLXJldmVhbC1tYXktMTgtMjAyMy0yNjE2NTc0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Since the schedule was announced, we've examined the entire slate, chosen the top matchups and looked at Denver's prime-time games.  Now, it's time to go game by game through the 2023 schedule.  Week 1: Broncos vs. Raiders (Sunday, Sept. 10, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting in Denver: 2022 season – Raiders 22, Broncos 16 (OT)  A year ago: Las Vegas finished 6-11 and missed the playoffs (third in AFC West)  Player to know: RB Josh Jacobs. The bruising player broke out in 2022, as he posted 1,653 yards and 12 touchdowns. He's always proved difficult for the Broncos to stop.  Major storyline: Sean Payton will coach his first regular-season game as Broncos head coach as the team tries to snap a six-game skid to the Raiders. A new quarterback will be under center for Las Vegas, as Jimmy Garoppolo takes over for Derek Carr.

Combined with Jaylen Waddle (1,356 yards in 2022), Hill is a formidable threat.  Major storyline: The Broncos will face off against their 2018 first-round pick, Bradley Chubb, and former head coach Vic Fangio. Miami head coach Mike McDaniel is also a former Broncos staffer.  Week 4: Broncos at Bears (Sunday, Oct. 1, 12 p.m. CT, CBS)  Last meeting: 2019 – Bears 16, Broncos 14  A year ago: Chicago finished 3-14 and missed the playoffs (fourth in NFC North)  Player to know: QB Justin Fields. The 11th-overall pick in 2021 came on strong in 2022, finishing ninth in the MVP voting. He provided highlight plays seemingly every week, particularly with his legs.  Major storyline: Cornerback Pat Surtain II will face off against Fields for the first time as Denver travels to Chicago. In 2021, Surtain was selected two picks ahead of Fields, who recorded 25 total touchdowns last year but threw 11 interceptions and was sacked 55 times.  Week 5: Broncos vs. Jets (Sunday, Oct. 8, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting: 2022 – Jets 16, Broncos 9  A year ago: New York finished 7-10 and missed the playoffs (fourth in AFC East)  Player to know: QB Aaron Rodgers.

Following the Aaron Rodgers era in Green Bay, Love will get a chance to show off his first-round pedigree. He has just one career start to his name.  Major storyline: The Packers are as big a mystery as any team, as Love takes the reins for Green Bay and leads them into Denver.  Week 8: Broncos vs. Chiefs (Sunday, Oct. 29, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting in Denver: 2022 – Chiefs 34, Broncos 28  A year ago: Kansas City finished 14-3 and won the Super Bowl (first in AFC West)  Player to know: TE Travis Kelce. The 33-year-old player shows no signs of slowing down, as he caught a career-high 110 receptions and 12 touchdowns in 2022. A first-team All-Pro selection, Kelce posted 1,338 yards in 2022 and nabbed his eighth consecutive Pro Bowl appearance.  Major storyline: The Broncos and Chiefs finish their season series early, as both matchups come within three weeks and ahead of the Broncos' Week 9 bye.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcmJyb25jb3MuY29tL25ld3MvYS1nYW1lLWJ5LWdhbWUtbG9vay10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1icm9uY29zLTIwMjMtc2NoZWR1bGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Butler, the leading scorer in this NBA postseason, scored 34 points along with seven assists, a playoff career-high six steals and five rebounds.  Trailing by nine at halftime, Miami turned the tables in the series opener in the third quarter, outscoring Boston 46-25 and opening up a 102-91 lead. The Celtics cut the lead to 114-110 with 2:30 left, but Butler drove the lane, got doubled and found Caleb Martin for a clutch triple. After back-to-back traveling violations by Jayson Tatum, who finished with 30 points but struggled down the stretch, Butler buried the dagger 3 from the right wing.  Miami moved to 3-0 in Game 1s in this postseason, all of them coming on the road.  Stat to know: While the Celtics outscored the Heat 62-40 in the paint, that’s not how the game got decided. This Miami team, ranking 27th in 3-point percentage in the regular season, has been in the top-five of the league in that department in the playoffs. On Wednesday, the Heat were as good as they’ve been, shooting 16-for-31 and outscoring the Celtics by 18 points from beyond the arc.  Play of the game: Butler sucking the life out of TD Garden with a cold-blooded triple with just over a minute left.  Up next for the Celtics: Joe Mazzulla said it in his interview during the broadcast: The Celtics lost their focus and took their foot off the gas pedal. You need 48 minutes to beat this Miami team. Boston really sagged off defensively and allowing 123 points is eye-opening. The other element? Late-game offense. Boston has to get Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the same page.  ADVERTISEMENT  Up next for the Heat: Miami should not change a thing. They can go for the dagger in Game 2 and will play with house money. Just keep it close for Butler time. One big thing: keep getting Bam Adebayo involved offensively. He had 20 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the win and his activity inside rattled Boston.

"game","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:56:00","Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla points to the third quarter as the reason the team let Game 1 slip away vs. the Heat. (0:42)  BOSTON -- At halftime of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, things looked pretty darned good for the Boston Celtics. They'd controlled the paint, taken care of the ball and made shots, and as a result they had a 66-57 lead over the Miami Heat 24 minutes into this best-of-seven affair.  Then the third quarter started. And, yet again, the Dr. Jekyll version of Boston disappeared and the Mr. Hyde version took over.  By the time those 12 minutes had expired, the game had been turned on its head. The Heat had outscored the Celtics 46-25, turning a nine-point deficit into a 12-point lead, and Miami was on its way to a stunning 123-116 win to steal back home-court advantage in this series and leave the second-seeded Celtics reeling from how quickly things got away from them.  ""It's a choice. It's a decision,"" Jaylen Brown said when asked what happened in the second half. ""Just come out and play with a different mentality. We came out too cool. It was just almost like we were just playing a regular-season game. It's the Eastern Conference finals. Like, come on.  ""We've got to play with more intensity than we did today. We've just got to be better, including me.""  If there was something that could have shifted from the first half to the second, it did. Boston had 15 assists and five turnovers in the first half; it had seven assists and 10 turnovers in the second. On the other side, Miami took much better care of the ball, going from nine assists and 11 turnovers in the first half to 11 assists and four turnovers in the second.  The Celtics dominated points in the paint in the first half, outscoring the Heat 40-16. In the second half, Miami edged Boston 24-22. There was a similar change in second-chance points, for which Boston had an 11-2 edge in the first half compared with a 10-7 advantage for Miami in the second.  Sprinkle in the Heat shooting 16-for-31 from 3-point range on the night and Boston found itself, for the second straight series, stumbling out of TD Garden trailing 1-0 to an underdog.  ""The only thing we need to adjust to is picking up our physicality and playing some damn defense,"" Marcus Smart said. ""That's the only thing they switched. They didn't change anything from the first half that they weren't doing, they just upped their physicality and that's it.  ""There's nothing tactical, X's and O's, it's just come out and guard your yard. They scored 46 in that third, and they got going, and they made us pay, and they led into the fourth quarter.""  And while Boston's defense cost the team dearly in the third quarter, it was the offense that fell apart in the fourth. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla tends to make observations and adjustments with an offensive mindset -- unlike predecessor Ime Udoka, who would typically lean into more physical and defense-oriented lineups. Mazzulla typically goes the other way: smaller, quicker lineups with more spacing and more shooting.  Going to reserve guard Payton Pritchard in both halves Wednesday night over Grant Williams, who was a key part of last year's playoff rotation but has disappeared this year, was a prime example. It also shows up whenever Mazzulla explains what is giving Boston issues in a game, his answers typically centering on problems on offense.  After Boston's strong ball movement in the first half disappeared down the stretch, with the team failing to make a field goal over more than four minutes late in the fourth quarter, Smart -- who had 10 assists in the first half and just one in the second -- said Boston got ""antsy,"" trying too hard to make plays individually rather than collectively.  No one exemplified that better than Jayson Tatum, who had 30 points but didn't take a shot in the fourth. He made three of his four turnovers inside the final three minutes, including on back-to-back possessions with under two minutes to go.  ""I turned the ball over, threw it to Jimmy,"" Tatum said, referring to his turnover out of a Mazzulla timeout with just under three minutes remaining. ""That was on me. Doing a shot fake, I just got sped up a little bit. Just got to slow down a little bit in those moments.""  Mazzulla chose not to call any timeouts in that disastrous third quarter, reviving a season-long storyline around his penchant for letting his players sort things out themselves.  ""I called two in the first quarter,"" Mazzulla said when asked about his lack of timeouts in the third.  When asked again, he said, ""Don't call two in the first quarter. Save it for the third-quarter run.""  Smart defended Mazzulla, saying it's not on the coach to bail the players out.  ""Joe is real big on a lot of times not bailing us out on stuff when we're playing like s---,"" Smart said. ""So, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout, and then what? We come out and do the same thing? It's on us.  ""Joe and his coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a game plan and put us in the right spots to succeed, but they're not out there playing. We've got to come together and we've got to start helping each other out on both ends.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3Njc0NDUzL2NlbHRpY3MtY29tZS10b28tY29vbC0ybmQtaGFsZi1nYW1lLTEtbG9zcy1oZWF00gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmJhL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2NzQ0NTMvY2VsdGljcy1jb21lLXRvby1jb29sLTJuZC1oYWxmLWdhbWUtMS1sb3NzLWhlYXQ_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:49:04","BOSTON — For the third time in these playoffs, the Miami Heat have won Game 1 on the road. On Wednesday, they came back from a 13-point deficit to steal home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference Finals from the Boston Celtics with a 123-116 victory.  Jimmy Butler led the way once again, filling the box score with 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and six steals. He was, simply, awesome. And having a star on your team like that certainly makes it easier to deal with a double-digit deficit.  “You know, there’s just a settling effect that is impossible to quantify,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said afterward. “Like, all right, we are in striking distance. Let’s just settle into our game, and Jimmy will make a bunch of plays, Bam [Adebayo] will make a bunch of plays, and everybody will be all right and everybody will just fit into their roles. But what’s that the great players do.”  The Miami offense went beyond Butler. Five of the other six Heat players who logged at least 10 minutes also scored at least 15 points, as the team registered its most efficient offensive performance (123 points on 97 possessions) since Game 1 of the first round.  The Celtics were more efficient than that in the first half, but couldn’t get stops in the third quarter and couldn’t stop turning the ball over in the fourth.  “I thought we just let go of the rope in the third quarter,” head coach Joe Mazzulla said, “lost that sense of urgency.”  Here are some notes, quotes, numbers and film from a game that dropped the Celtics (who were 32-9 at the TD Garden in the regular season) to just 4-4 at home in the postseason.  1. Outside game  In the regular season, the Heat ranked 20th in mid-range field goal percentage (40.8%) and 27th in 3-point percentage (34.4%). Those numbers were up through the first two rounds of the playoffs, but the Heat hit another level on Wednesday.  Miami shot 10-for-15 (67%) from mid-range and 16-for-31 (52%) from 3-point range in Game 1. Their effective field goal percentage of 73.9% on shots from outside the paint was their third-highest mark of the season in 96 total games.  Butler was the man from mid-range, shooting 6-for-9 from between the paint and the 3-point line. But he was just one of six Heat players who made at least two 3-pointers and one of four Heat players who had at least two assists on 3-pointers.  The Celtics can be pretty confident that their opponent won’t shoot that well from the outside again. But this was not just a lucky shooting night from the Heat. And the Celtics had some defensive issues, particularly in the first 12 minutes after halftime.  2. Third quarter of doom  Boston won three of the four quarters in Game 1. But they lost the third by 21 points, allowing the Heat to score an amazing 46 points on just 25 possessions, the second most efficient quarter for any team in these playoffs. And those 46 included almost half (18) of the Heat’s 40 points in the paint.  A couple of those nine buckets in the paint came off live-ball turnovers, including what would have been a beautiful dime from Robert Williams III to Kevin Love if they played for the same team. The Celtics were slow to get back against an incredible outlet pass from Love. They also got beat to the glass.  And on the Heat’s final possession of the period, Malcolm Brogdon somehow chose to guard Cody Zeller at the 3-point line instead of Max Strus:  3. Rolling below the switch  While the Heat shot ridiculously well from the outside, the Celtics dominated the paint. They scored 40 of their 62 points in the paint in the first half, when they had some success rolling below the switch.  Miami was switching more ball screens than they did in their conference semifinals series against New York. That should flatten the Celtics’ offense out, but Boston was able to get into the paint by having the screener quickly roll to the rim below the initial ball defender.  Late in the second quarter, Marcus Smart set a ball screen for Jaylen Brown along the left sideline. Strus switched it, but Caleb Martin stayed with the ball. Smart rolled into the paint, drew weak-side help, and kicked the ball out to Al Horford for an in-rhythm corner 3:  A few possessions later, Brown set a ball screen for Smart and rolled below the switch. The Heat had to rotate and Jayson Tatum was able to attack Gabe Vincent off the dribble. And on the Celtics’ last possession of the half, Smart hit Williams with a lob after Adebayo switched a screen and Williams got below the other defender (Strus):  After giving up 40 points in the paint in the first half, the Heat held the Celtics to just 22 in the second half, in part because they did a better job of getting between the roll man and the rim when they switched screens:  4. The open man  Martin is going to get some shots in this series. These are the playoffs, when more attention gets paid to the stars and more open shots are available for the role players. And in the fourth quarter on Wednesday, a couple of open shots were available for Martin.  With the Heat up five and about four minutes left, Vincent collapsed the defense with a baseline drive. He kicked the ball out to the right corner, where Martin had a great look that was off the mark, part of a five-possession scoring drought for Miami.  That drought was ended by what was probably the biggest shot of the night. And that shot was from Martin in the same exact spot. He was being guarded by Smart, who left him to double Butler in the paint. Butler found the open man and Martin drained the shot:  Martin isn’t a pure shooter. Sometimes, he’ll run himself off an open 3 and try to attack the basket. He had an incredible reverse finish late in the second quarter watching Smart (weirdly) fly by him at the 3-point line. But there was no hesitation on that one with a little more than two minutes left in the fourth.  “I knew I was shooting that one,” he said afterward, “because I missed the one before, but I knew why I missed it. I knew they were going to [leave him open] again. I knew the ball was going to come back. So I had my mind already made up.”  The Heat play a lot of close games, where every possession and every shot matters. Martin was on the floor down the stretch in place of Kevin Love on Wednesday, taking 11 shots in his 30 minutes.  “You got to be ready to knock those shots down,” he said. “That’s what the playoffs are about, for guys to step up. When your moment comes, you take advantage of it. That’s the only way you’re going to be able to overcome those moments and continue to thrive in those moments.”  5. Celtics go big again    A big reason the Celtics came back from a 3-2 deficit in the conference semis was a lineup change: Williams starting instead of Derrick White in Games 6 and 7. This is a very different series, but Mazzulla stuck with the double-bigs look for Game 1.  It didn’t work. The starting lineup was outscored by 10 points in nearly nine minutes on the floor. And like the Heat, the Celtics had a reserve — Brogdon instead of Williams — on the floor down the stretch.  The Celtics weren’t able to come all the way back from what was a 12-point deficit at the start of the period, in part because they committed four turnovers on one critical stretch of five possessions. But the Brogdon lineup was a plus-11 in its 12.0 minutes, and the Celtics looked crisper offensively when they played four guards/wings with just one big.  We’ll see if Mazzulla goes back to smaller look in Game 2 on Friday (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT). The Celtics have been in this spot before. They lost Game 1 of the conference semifinals at home to Philadelphia. And exactly one year ago, they lost Game 1 of the conference finals to this same opponent. They won both of those series in seven games.  * * *  John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here, find his archive here and follow him on Twitter.

Jauhari struck a minute into the first additional period after Yotsakorn Burapha had netted in the dying seconds of normal time to take the game into extra time with Rahman and Putra adding the gloss on a dramatic victory.  Ramadhan Sananta's first-half double had looked set to earn Indonesia the gold medal, the 20-year-old opening the scoring in the 21st minute when he steered a long throw by Alfeandra Dewangga beyond Thai goalkeeper Soponwit Rakyart.  The 20-year-old doubled the lead in first half stoppage time in spectacular fashion, lobbing home from 25 yards with Soponwit stranded on the edge of his penalty area.  Thailand, looking to claim the title for a record-extending 17th time, halved the deficit when Anan Yodsangwal headed in a 65th minute corner and then dramatically pulled level deep into stoppage time through Yotsakorn.  However, Jauhari put Indonesia back in front when he deftly lifted the ball over Soponwit before a bench-clearing brawl on the touchline raised tensions further.  Soponwit and Indonesia's Komang Teguh were sent off for their involvement in the altercation while the Thais were reduced to nine men in the 101st minute when defender Jonathan Khemdee received a second yellow card.  Rahman hit his side's fourth two minutes into the second period of extra time and Putra put the result beyond all doubt in the final minute to earn Indonesia gold for the fourth time.

Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4  WORCESTER, M.A. — A pair of rehabbers on the mound and a trio of home runs gave the Worcester Red Sox (20-20) a 9-4 win over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (19-20) on Tuesday night at Polar Park.  Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4 IP, 5 H 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K on 49 pitches (35 strikes). The lone run allowed against him came in the third, a solo shot to Jake Cave. Whitlock reached 95-miles-per-hour on his sinker and recorded four swing-and-misses on his changeup.  Kutter Crawford followed, also on rehab, and delivered a strong outing in relief: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K over 41 pitches (26 strikes). Lehigh Valley’s run against the right-hander also came on a long ball, a solo home run by Jordan Qsar in the sixth. Crawford's four-seamer topped out at 95.6 miles-per-hour, as he mixed in all five of his pitches. He recorded eight swing-and-misses, including three with his changeup.  Offensively, the WooSox scored in five consecutive offensive innings to take a stranglehold on the game.  Bobby Dalbec opened the scoring in the second, smashing a 112 mile-per-hour, 471-foot home run to center for his fifth of the Triple-A season. Dalbec now has 11 extra-base-hits in 23 games with Worcester.  In a 1-1 game in the third, David Hamilton delivered his team-leading eighth homer, a solo blast to right. Including tonight, Hamilton has 19 RBI in 35 games.  In the fourth, Greg Allen doubled off the Worcester Wall in right, plating Jorge Alfaro. After a walk, Nick Sogard came up with two in scoring position and drove both runners home with a single to center, putting the WooSox up 5-1.  Ryan Fitzgerald drove home two in the fifth with a moonshot of his own, his seventh of the season. Six of Fitzgerald’s seven home runs have come in the month of May, and he has 16 total hits in 12 games.  Worcester made it 8-1 on a wild pitch in the sixth that allowed Sogard to score. Manager Chad Tracy was also ejected in the inning, arguing a foul tip call with Hamilton at the plate.  In the eighth, Hamilton made it his sixth multi-RBI game of the season with a run-scoring groundout.  Out of the bullpen, Cam Booser allowed a run in the eighth on an RBI double play, while A.J. Politi got the final four outs while allowing one run to seal the home team's win.  The WooSox continue the homestand on Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 p.m. against the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.

"game","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 14:38:00","Celtics Redemptive Game 7 rout put to rest some misconceptions about the Celtics Any discussion of redemption must begin in one place: with Jayson Tatum’s career-defining, climb-on-my-back-boys tour de force. Jayson Tatum went 4 for 4 on 3-pointers when guarded by 76ers big man Joel Embiid. Barry Chin/Globe Staff      The shriveling Sixers weren’t the only thing the Celtics put to rest with their rousing 112-88 rout Sunday in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal.  They also buried an assortment of negative narratives and perceptions — some fair, some never fair at all — about themselves. And that’s another fulfilling victory in itself.  Any discussion of redemption must begin in one place: with Jayson Tatum’s career-defining, climb-on-my-back-boys tour de force.  You may know the stats by heart now: 51 points, the most in a Game 7 ever. (Even more impressive, Tatum scored 67 points since the start of the fourth quarter in Game 6.) A game-high 13 rebounds. A team-high 5 assists. Tatum knocked down 17 of 28 shots, including 6 of 10 threes, and that latter stat felt more like 9 of 10.  Advertisement:  Beyond the breathtaking numbers, Tatum played a remarkably poised and intelligent game. He did not commit a turnover in 41:40 of action. For parts of the series, he would become flummoxed when coming face to face with Joel Embiid in the lane, leading to altered and awkward shots.  Sunday, he put Embiid in the blender, blowing past him at will and going 4 for 4 from three when the big man was his primary defender, including a pair of threes within about a minute of each other early in the third that put the Celtics up, 65-55, and planted the seed that this might be a runaway. It was, largely because Tatum solved the Embiid mystery.  Tatum struggled mightily at points in this series, including shooting a combined 1 of 24 — that’s 4.2 percent — from the field in the first quarters of Games 4-6. He is long proven as a superb player, having made first-team NBA two years running, but his struggles (particularly in the Finals against the Warriors last season) tended to overshadow his big-moment success (46 points on Game 6 on the road against the defending champion Bucks in last year’s East semis).  It got so tiring hearing from fans that called him soft or said he was, to paraphrase, dispassionate. But it was tough to push back on that when he was essentially absent from the first quarter in multiple games in this series.  Advertisement:  Tatum is just 25, works relentlessly on his game, and there’s still room to grow (Paul Pierce didn’t become a champion until he was 30), but as the weight on his shoulders got heavier as this series went on, it began to feel like a referendum on his status among the NBA elite and his place in Celtics lore.  Let’s just say the referendum passed in a landslide. I saw Larry Bird’s entire career, and Pierce’s too, and I’m not sure I ever saw either of them dominate a game quite like this, and that’s even without considering how Tatum’s reputation was at stake.  There’s no perfect comparison for his performance, but it reminded me of various spectacular moments in Celtics lore. It was a little bit of the Bird-Dominique Wilkins shootout in Game 7 of the ‘88 Eastern Conference semifinals … and a little of Larry’s 60-point game against the Hawks in March 1985 … and a little of Pierce’s 41-point gem in Game 7 against the Cavaliers in 2008 … and, in a team sense, of the Celtics’ 36-6 run in the third quarter against Atlanta in the clinching Game 5 of the 1986 conference semis.  Whenever you’re reminding someone of the 1985-86 Celtics — the best single-season team I’ve ever seen — you’re doing something extraordinary.  Advertisement:  (There is a common thread through those aforementioned games, by the way. Doc Rivers was involved in all of them. Isn’t that wild?)  Funny, but no one has texted or messaged me today that Tatum is soft. Hopefully that nonsense is over for good.  As for other perceptions that were proven to be either misguided or no longer existent during this series, how about this one, the notion that Tatum and Jaylen Brown don’t bring out the best in each other. I thought Game 7 was the best they have ever played in tandem, with Brown setting the tone early, scoring 25 points in total, and tormenting first-ballot Hall of Fame quitter James Harden up and down the court.  The energy, as they say, shifted when Harden whacked Brown in his unmasked face with 8½ minutes left in the second quarter and the Sixers up, 35-27. The Celtics tore off an 8-0 run after that, playing with a relentless pace that you knew would eventually wear down the Sixers. (The Celtics were the far better- conditioned team.)  I thought it was telling in all the right ways at the end of Game 6 when no one was happier for Tatum after his breakout 16-point fourth quarter than Brown. Some stars would be annoyed that their teammate kept shooting through a miserable slump with the season on the line. But Brown, who would have had every right to want the ball down the stretch, greeted Tatum with a grin, an elaborate handshake, and a big hug afterward. There is no doubt. Those two are in this together.  Advertisement:  We’ll save the discussion of Joe Mazzulla’s standing after this series for another day, and just note one more change in perception for now.  It seemed at times during the season, and even in the first-round series against the Hawks, that both Al Horford and Marcus Smart had lost a step defensively. I don’t know if they were aching or pacing themselves or what, but it became clear in this series that both remain forces on the defensive end.  I’m not sure there’s another player in the league who enjoys beating a specific team the way Horford enjoys beating the Sixers, and the 36-year-old wore down and wore out Embiid. And Smart seemed to pester, agitate, and lock down every Sixer at one time or another; he was back in his Defensive Player of the Year form from a season ago.  If Horford, Smart, and Brown too continue to set the tone with their defensive intensity, and Tatum can keep playing like a Celtics legend in his own time, anything isn’t just possible with this team. It might just be probable.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Jvc3Rvbi1jZWx0aWNzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvY2VsdGljcy1zaXhlcnMtZ2FtZS03LWNvbHVtbi1jaGFkLWZpbm4v0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9uLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYm9zdG9uLWNlbHRpY3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9jZWx0aWNzLXNpeGVycy1nYW1lLTctY29sdW1uLWNoYWQtZmlubi8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It might have been a couple of sloppy plays in the field that led to several runs. The lack of hitting certainly didn’t help, and neither did a dose of plain bad luck.  In the end, it all added up to a 6-1 loss to Manchester Academy in Game 1 of the MAIS Class 3A baseball championship series that put the Trojans’ backs to the wall.

I feel like we’ll bounce back and make a game of it. I think we’ll get back here,” King said.  Tallulah never got out of the blocks offensively against Walker. The left-hander retired the first 10 batters he faced and only gave up one hit through the first six innings.  Walker also helped himself with his glove. After Wyatt Bedgood singled with one out in the fourth inning for Tallulah’s first hit, Dee Morgan followed with a hard grounder back up the middle. Walker stuck his glove down to snag it, and threw to second to start an inning-ending double play.  The double play helped Walker face the minimum number of batters through five innings. Another runner was caught stealing to end the fifth inning.  “They threw their ace at us and he was better than us tonight,” King said.  Tallulah wasn’t blessed with the same kind of luck. In the top of the fourth inning, Burton led off with a double and Ryan Johnson followed with a ground ball to shortstop, right into a defensive shift. Tallulah’s Landry Tweedle caught Burton off of second base, but the Manchester runner made it back to the bag on a close play.  Two batters later, Reed Roberts and Mills Paul hit back-to-back RBI singles to put the Mavericks ahead 5-0.  Manchester added a run on a passed ball in the fifth inning. Roberts also had an RBI single in the third, and Burton had one in the second.  “Baseball is a game of momentum. If you’ve got the momentum they’re 7 foot tall. If they don’t they’re about 3 foot tall. As a coach it’s my job to keep them level, but that’s not as easy as putting the game plan together,” King said.  Tallulah finally got on the board in the bottom of the seventh inning. Tweedle led off with a walk, went to second on an infield single by Bedgood and third on an error, then scored on a groundout by Morgan.  Hayes Hopkins kept the rally going with a single, but Walker struck out the last two batters to end the game before it blossomed into anything more.  “Our game, we’re not a big home run, gap hitting team. We have to get on base, steal bases, bunt. It’s just the way it is,” King said. “When you fall behind 6-0, even 3-0, in the later innings you have to change your game plan a little bit.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvdGFsbHVsYWgtYWNhZGVteS1kcm9wcy1nYW1lLTEtb2YtY2xhc3MtM2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXNlcmllcy12cy1tYW5jaGVzdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He finished it off by contributing to a slump-breaking victory.  After striking out twice and misplaying a line drive into a triple, Duran homered, singled in a run and stole a base to help Boston snap a four-game losing streak by beating the Seattle Mariners 9-4 on Tuesday night.  “It’s baseball. I punched out the first two at bats and I was like, ‘I’ve got to flush it,’” said Duran, who is batting .351 and already matched his career high of three home runs. “Just pick up my boys and just think about the guys. Like, it’s not all about me.”  Masataka Yoshida doubled, tripled, scored on a wild pitch and drove in three runs for Boston. Justin Turner and Triston Casas also homered for the Red Sox, who were swept by the last-place St. Louis Cardinals and lost the series opener to Seattle.  Nick Pivetta (3-3) allowed four runs on six hits and four walks, striking out six in 5 1/3 innings.  Taylor Trammell homered for Seattle, which had won three out of four and 10 of 14 since starting the season 11-16. Luis Castillo (2-2) allowed seven runs — five earned — on six hits and two walks while striking out six in five innings.  Yoshida tripled and Turner and Casas homered in Boston’s four-run first. But Seattle tied it in the fourth, thanks in part to Teoscar Hernandez’s sinking liner to center that Duran dove for and missed; the ball rolled past him toward the wall.  “He’s trying to make a baseball play. I’d rather have that than lack of effort,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “He’s in a great place. He’s going to make mistakes, but overall his game has been a plus everywhere.”  Trammell followed with a two-run homer to make it 4-4. Alex Verdugo doubled leading off the bottom of the fifth, and Yoshida’s one-bounce, ground-rule double in the right field corner broke the tie. The Japanese left fielder took third on a flyout and scored on Castillo’s wild pitch before Duran homered for a 7-4 lead.  Duran singled in another run in the seventh and improved to 7 for 7 on stolen bases.  “He’s a game-changer,” Turner said. “He’s got power. He’s got speed. He uses the whole field and plays great defense in the center. So it’s good to see him having success hitting the ball all over the place and running the bases like it is.”  Yoshida made it 9-4 in the eighth on a bases-loaded groundout.  TRAINER’S ROOM  The Red Sox put RHP John Schreiber on the 15-day injured list with a right shoulder strain.

Attendance in Oakland has been, say, problematic, for a significant period of time.  The reasons for the erosion of fan support are multi-faceted. Partially due to ownership disinterest, fan disinterest and the worst stadium in professional sports.  But whatever little interest remains has been even further reduced in recent weeks.  Team ownership essentially announced their intention to move the A’s to Las Vegas by agreeing to purchase land off the strip.  That agreement has somehow already changed, but the overall plan remains.  READ: OAKLAND A’S ALREADY CHANGING VEGAS STADIUM PLANS DESPITE PREVIOUS BINDING AGREEMENT  That announcement combined with the longstanding issues has brought fan support to an unbelievable low.  So low, in fact, the A’s announced an attendance figure of just 2,064 for Monday’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  And given video from inside the stadium, that figure may have been inflated.  Oof.  OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 06: A general view of play between the Oakland Athletics and the Texas Rangers at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum on August 06, 2020 in Oakland, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)  Oakland A’s Embarrassing MLB  That announced attendance, almost certainly an over-estimate, marked a new low for Oakland.  How low? The lowest announced crowd size for a home game since 1979. 44 years ago.  It also ranks as one of the least attended MLB games in the league’s recorded history. Just two other games have seen fewer fans, outside of the 2020 lockdown season.  One of those two games had a game time temperature of 34 degrees. It was not 34 in Oakland on Monday.  The attendance to see the A’s and Diamondbacks play was lower than the average of 97 different minor league franchises.  For a major league team.  Quite simply, this is an unacceptable embarrassment. And fans aren’t to blame.  The A’s organization has essentially told locals they no longer care. Investments in talent have been nonexistent. They’ve stopped pretending to want to stay in Oakland, while openly admitting to be focused on Las Vegas.  Oakland has by far the worst record in the league, on pace for historic ineptitude.  Why should anyone support them by spending money on tickets, concessions or transportation?  The fact that it’s gotten to this point is a disaster for MLB, especially considering the team has many, many more home games to play before leaving for the desert.  Given this is just May, we may see some new attendance lows set the rest of the season.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL3RoZXJlcy1oaWxhcmlvdXMtdmlkZW8tb2Ytb2FrbGFuZC1hcy1sb3dlc3QtYXR0ZW5kZWQtZ2FtZS1zaW5jZS10aGUtMTk3MHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:00:48","By Phil Sheridan  As experiments go, this was the kind that leaves you with test tube fragments in your hair and a gaping hole in the laboratory wall.  Trying to help starting pitcher Bailey Falter get past his first-inning woes, Phillies manager Rob Thomson decided against anything so basic as letting the big lefthander work on his problems himself. Thomson’s plan: Have relief pitcher Connor Brogdon pitch the first inning and bring Falter in after an inning or two.  It was not a good idea, as illustrated by the Phillies’ 6-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants Monday night in the opener of a 3-game series.  Thomson wound up desperately turning to Falter with 2 outs in the first inning. Brogdon, who “opened” one game in his 130 career appearances, gave up two singles and a walk to load the bases with 2 out. With lefthanded-hitting Brandon Crawford due up, Thomson brought in Falter.  Instead of facing the top of the order with no one on base, Falter was facing a veteran All-Star with the bases loaded. And what do you know? Falter struck Crawford out to end the threat. So no harm, no foul, right?  Wrong, Opener-Breath.  As Ricky Bottalico pointed out on the pregame show, whenever Falter comes in, that’s the first inning for him. The bottom of the second appeared to be the first inning – ever – for Falter and his teammates.  After Falter gave up a couple of singles, second baseman Bryson Stott forgot to keep his glove open until the ball is actually in it. This was on a potential double play-starting throw from shortstop Trea Turner. It was Stott’s first error of the season. But that was just the warmup act.  With the bases loaded, the Giants’ Wilmer Flores stroked a line drive to right field. Nick Castellano held his glove out but had the same procedural difficulty as Stott. The ball bounced off his closed glove. Castellanos was able to pick up the ball and throw out the runner who had stayed at first expecting Castellanos to catch the ball.  That came up huge when Falter gave up a 3-run home run to Michael Conforto on his next pitch. That was the first of four consecutive hits Falter surrendered. When the smoke cleared and the glass bits were all over and there was a big old hole in the wall. Falter had given up 6 runs on 6 hits. The Phillies’ early 2-0 lead was a distant memory.  “I don’t think he was executing that inning,” Thomson said.  But at least Falter’s first-inning ERA wasn’t a problem! Success!  In fairness, Thomson wasn’t wrong to identify Falter’s vulnerability. After that second-inning generosity, Falter did pitch the way Thomson envisioned when he decided to delay his entry into the game. Falter did not allow another run in 3 more innings of work. He gave up a triple to Thairo Estrada in the third and a double to Casey Schmitt in the fifth.  “Credit to him, he settled in and gave us a little bit of life,” Thomson said. “He didn’t give up another run. He kind of kept us right there.”  Thomson said no decision has been made on Falter’s next start.  The question is whether Falter would have been better off just working through his early-inning woes from the mound instead of the bullpen. As it turned out, he was singled out as the guy who needs a teammate to start his game, and then gave up 6 runs in his first full inning of work. Meanwhile, the Phillies fell behind 6-2 early and were never really able to get back into it. Which just goes to show you, as Bailey Falters, so falter the Phillies.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhL3BoaWxsaWVzL3BoaWxsaWVzLWZhbHRlci1waXRjaGluZy1leHBlcmltZW50LXJvYi10aG9tc29uLWdvZXMtd3JvbmctZ2lhbnRz0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvcGhpbGxpZXMvcGhpbGxpZXMtZmFsdGVyLXBpdGNoaW5nLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtcm9iLXRob21zb24tZ29lcy13cm9uZy1naWFudHM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

James Derflinger and Jack Sand each added an RBI in the fifth to give the Saints a 9-2 advantage.  Sand was on the mound in the top of the seventh for Crean Lutheran and struggled to find his rhythm in the seventh. After Sultans leadoff batter Chris Manley reached safely on an error, Sand hit three consecutive batters and was replaced by Garcia.

For the Bears, finishing 9-8 would certainly be respectable after finishing with the worst record in the league in 2022. Overall, Chicago has a favorable schedule. Not that it’s worth much given the turnover in the league. Aside from some juggernauts, including the Chiefs and Chargers, there are plenty of winnable games on this schedule for the Bears. We’ll see how things shake out with a Chicago team with plenty to prove heading into 2023.  Brendan Sugrue: 8-9  Things may look bleak to start the year with the Bears going 1-4, but they’ll rally to climb back to .500 by the middle of the season. Their schedule is favorable on paper, minus a few matchups. For example, having to travel to Tampa Bay in September could mean dealing with scorching temperatures. But given they will have plenty of rest throughout the season, the Bears will make huge strides from their record a year ago and be in the playoff hunt all the way until the end. Whether it’s enough to actually make the postseason is another question.  Ryan Fedrau: 8-9  8-9 is a great place to start, given the chance that a few games can go their way and they’re in the playoffs. I believe the Bears are a year away from being a playoff team. This is their year where they mold everything and next season, they put everything together and become a contender. Still, a few games bounce their way and they can be a wildcard team in 2023. If that happens, I wouldn’t be surprised.  Nate Atkins: 8-9  Possibly optimistic, but if Justin Fields makes the next step as a passer, I could see the Bears winning eight games. The Bears split the divisional matchups and won the games they should. Maybe with a couple of lucky breaks, they could win ten games by upsetting Kansas City and Los Angeles or winning both matchups with a divisional opponent.  Jarrett Bailey: 9-8  I really like what Ryan Poles is building in Chicago. They recognized their needs going into the offseason and addressed them. The linebacker position is dull? The Bears added two of the best off-ball linebackers available in Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards. Right tackle a weak spot? Chicago drafts Darnell Wright. With the NFC North changing tides with the Packers transitioning out of Aaron Rodgers, and the Vikings saying goodbye to a lot of veterans, the Bears pounce and make a big leap in 2023 and earn the final wild-card spot.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vYmVhcnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9jaGljYWdvLWJlYXJzLWdhbWUtYnktZ2FtZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy0yMDIzLXJlZ3VsYXItc2Vhc29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We have to fall behind them whichever way we can.”  The teams will play a winner-take-all Game 3 today at Keyser with a trip to the state tournament on the line.  Aside from simply keeping the season alive, it also gave the Bears six seniors one more win at the Field of Dreams Complex as it was their final home game regardless of the result today.  After being held off the board until the seventh in Game 1, the Golden Bears (24-9) wasted no time in getting on the board in Game 2.  Sarah Brown started a two-out rally in the first with a single, then, after the first of three Keyser (23-6) errors, scored when Carter singled to make it 1-0.  That would have been enough for Kell.  The Golden Tornado perhaps had its best chance to score in the top of the fifth when, after a dropped pop up in foul territory with two outs kept the inning alive, Averi Everline hit a hard-liner with runners on the corners that seemed destined to score at least one run — but senior Liv Munoz made a jumping, acrobatic snag and held on after falling to the ground to preserve the 1-0 lead.  In the bottom half, again with two outs, Carter put another ball into the outfield grass, plating two runs to provide the final margin.  Keyser’s Charity Wolfe finished with a double and Susie Cosenza two singles.  “We just couldn’t get anything going offensively,” Keyser head coach Colton Jones said. “Our pitching and defense weren’t bad. We need to execute a little bit better and put the ball in play.  “Game 3 is at our place, you definitely want to play for all the marbles at home.”  WVSSAC Class AA  Region 1 Championship Series  Game 2 at Oak Glen High School  Oak Glen 3, Keyser 0  Keyser 0-0-0 0-0-0 0 – 0 4 3  Oak Glen 1-0-0 0-2-0 x – 3 7 1  KEYSER (23-6): Mongold (LP, 6IP, 3R, 2ER, 7H, 7K, 1BB) and Likins.

"game","2023-04-17","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:15:00","TORONTO - Domingo German might have been baffled by his ejection Tuesday for a sticky substance on his pitching hand, but two things were abundantly clear.  ""It's the stickiest hand I've ever felt,'' said umpire crew chief James Hoye, telling a pool reporter that ""it was definitely not rosin,'' despite German's claims.  And the Yankees are in deeper trouble as a pitching staff, with German facing an automatic 10-game suspension.  ""That's Domingo's responsibility,'' manager Aaron Boone said of German's use of, well, whatever he's applying to his pitching hand during a start.  ""The reality is, we should all have a very good idea what the line is and apparently Domingo crossed it.''  David Wells' perfect game:25 years later, teammate David Cone tells us how it impacted 1998 season  And for the second straight night, the Yankees became steeped in a controversy against the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre.  After three perfect innings Tuesday, the right-handed German was ejected following a routine inspection of his pitching hand.  Yet, in another test of the Yankees' resolve, a wearying bullpen - and another clutch, go-ahead home run by Aaron Judge - sent them toward a 6-3 victory against the tough Toronto Blue Jays.  ""Just another gutsy effort by that group out there that keeps competing,'' said Boone.  Anatomy of another Yankees controversy  At least, the Yankees should have Luis Severino back in their rotation Sunday at Cincinnati.  Sidelined since spring training due to a lat strain, Severino made his second minor league rehab stint Tuesday, going 3.1 innings (58 pitches, two runs, six hits, one walk, three strikeouts) for Class AA Somerset.  That determination should be made Wednesday, when German - barring appeal - would begin his suspension.  ""I’ve got to apologize to my teammates,'' German said through an interpreter. ""I’m putting them in a tough position right now, and how much the bullpen is being used.''  It was Hoye's crew that warned German of excess use of rosin, April 15, in a game at Yankee Stadium against the Minnesota Twins.  At that time, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli felt that German should have been ejected since the umpires told him to clean off the excess rosin and he came back out with some sticky substance still on part of his hand.  German, through an interpreter, said it was because he works the rosin bag between innings, in the dugout.  Mindful of that, with Hoye's umpiring crew Tuesday, German only used the sandy rosin bag exclusively and he only used it on the mound, not in the dugout.  Domingo German disputes umpires' claims  First base ump DJ Reyburn checked German after the first inning, but not again until German came out to pitch the bottom of the fourth inning, with the Yankees leading 2-0.  ""(German's) hand was clearly shiny on the palm and his fingertips, and it was extremely sticky,'' said Hoye, who confirmed Reyburn's claim, as did the other two umpires.  ""We all had the same opinion: shiny, extremely sticky, and it's the worst hand we've ever felt during a game,'' said Hoye. ""So, we got together, we decided we were going to eject him at that point for foreign substance.''  Hoye insisted it was not rosin, which ""usually is kind of like a little tackiness. This was sticky, as in my fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.''  German says he ""didn't get a pure explanation at the moment'' of his ejection. He expressed confusion about not getting ""a clear direction from them to find out what’s appropriate and what’s too much'' with what he insisted was rosin and sweat and nothing else mixed in.  As to the substance TV cameras caught on his pants, German smiled and said: ""That was chewing tobacco.''  After the game, an unsmiling Boone said he had ""a good conversation,'' with German. ""I’ll just leave it at that.''  More Yankees headaches, controversies  Ian Hamilton replaced German, who is now likely headed to the injured list.  Given all the time he needed to warm up, Hamilton loaded the bases with two out and exited the game due to groin tightness. He's headed to New York for tests and he's likely ""going to be down a little bit,'' Boone said.  Before the game, MLB officials became involved with the Yankees and Blue Jays, regarding the positioning of Yankees base coaches Travis Chapman and Luis Rojas following Monday night's 7-4 Yankees win.  In the eighth inning of that game, TV cameras caught Aaron Judge's eyes darting toward the Yankees dugout right before several of reliever Jay Jackson's pitches, the last of which Judge crushed for his second homer of the game.  During the third inning of Tuesday night's game, umpires seemed to warn Rojas, the Yanks' third base coach, about straying beyond the coaching lines.  After some apparent heated moments between Rojas and the umpires, and a back-and-forth with Toronto's coaches in their dugout, Rojas resumed his place along the third base coaching lines.  The Yankees appeared to use the same complaint in the fourth inning to prevent Toronto third base coach Luis Rivera from straying beyond the lines.  By the fourth inning, both the first base coaches of the Yanks and Jays were standing at least 10 feet beyond the coaching line.  Hoye said MLB directed the crew to keep the coaches in their boxes.  ""(Rojas) was a couple steps off and so there seemed to be some disagreement about that,'' Hoye said. ""We made sure he was in,'' as they also did later with Rivera at the Yankees insistance.  “It’s just silliness. It’s ridiculous,’’ said Boone. “And I think everyone, I hope on both sides, realizes that.’’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbWxiL3lhbmtlZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9kb21pbmdvLWdlcm1hbi1lamVjdGVkLXBpdGNoLXlhbmtlZXMtdnMtYmx1ZS1qYXlzLzcwMjI1ODc4MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-09-01","Not Discerned","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:31:01","Last night, the Los Angeles Angels joined the Tampa Bay Rays as the second team this year to win a series-opening game against the Orioles. The Birds are now 12-2 in such games. The Angels 9-5 win was led by Shohei Ohtani, who gave up three home runs on the mound but hit a three-run homer at bat as part of a 4-for-5 game where he came up a double short of the cycle.  Adam Frazier and Anthony Santander hit two-run homers off Ohtani and Cedric Mullins added a solo shot. In two career starts against the Orioles, Ohtani has allowed nine runs in 12 innings and has given up six homers, including two each to Mullins and Santander. His five runs allowed last night tied his season high.  But the O’s starter, rookie right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, allowed nine hits and eight runs over 3 1/3 innings. That is the most runs allowed by a Baltimore starting pitcher this year. Coming into this series, O’s starters had a 1.74 ERA their previous eight games, allowing two earned runs or less seven times.  The Orioles bullpen allowed just a single run over 5 2/3 innings last night. The Baltimore bullpen has a 1.48 ERA (five ER/30.1 IP) over the last eight games.  Best bullpen ERAs in MLB in 2023  2.76 – Seattle  3.00 – Orioles  3.14 – Cleveland  3.18 – New York Yankees  3.21 – Houston  After allowing a career-high-tying three earned runs on Opening Day in Boston, Bryan Baker has allowed just one earned run over his last 19 appearances (19.1 IP). Among pitchers with at least 18 innings pitched since March 31, Baker's 0.47 ERA (one ER/19.1 IP) ranks second in MLB, behind only teammate Yennier Cano (0.00), and just ahead of fellow O's hurler Félix Bautista, whose 1.00 ERA (two ER/18.0 IP) in that span ranks fifth.  The Angels won for just the third time in nine games last night, improving to 22-20. They are 12-11 on the road and 4-7 versus American League East teams.  The Orioles (26-15) are now 4.5 games behind Tampa Bay for first in the AL East. Toronto is in third place, 6.5 back, with New York 7.5 out and Boston nine games back of the Rays.  Right-hander Dean Kremer (4-1, 4.97 ERA), who has thrown 11 straight scoreless innings, takes the mound for Baltimore tonight. On Wednesday versus Tampa Bay he pitched six scoreless on four hits, all singles, throwing 95 pitches. He walked two and fanned four, earning the win as the Orioles beat the Rays 2-1 to win that series.  In the start before that at Atlanta, Kremer allowed one run in the first inning, but then threw five scoreless to conclude his outing. So he’s put up 11 straight scoreless versus the Rays and Braves, who rank one and two in the majors in team OPS at .856 and .804, respectively.  Kremer, who has three quality starts, has a 1.464 WHIP this season, allowing 10.4 hits per nine with a 1.5 homer rate, 2.8 walk rate and 6.9 K rate.  Lefty batters have fared much better against him this season than right-handers. Lefties are batting .350 with an OPS of .927 versus Kremer while right-handers hit .238/.697. The Orioles are 5-3 in his outings this year.  Right-hander Chase Silseth (0-0, 3.24 ERA) will make his fifth appearance and first start of the year for the Angels. He has thrown just 8 1/3 innings in the majors this season, allowing five hits and six runs (three earned). He began this season ranked by Baseball America as the Angels’ No. 3 prospect.  The 22-year-old right-hander was drafted by Los Angeles in round 11 of 2021 and got an overslot $485,000 bonus. He then became the first player from the 2021 draft to make the majors.  He has made four Triple-A starts this year for Salt Lake City, going 2-0 with an 0.90 ERA. He was the Pacific Coast League Player of the Week for the period from April 3-9.  He has made one career start against the Orioles, going 0-1 with an ERA of 9.00. On July 7, 2022 he gave up six hits and four runs over four innings in a start at Camden Yards.  He throws his fastball 52 percent at an average velocity of 95.8 mph, and it’s a heater that can touch the high 90s. He uses his cutter 23 percent, slider 14 percent and split-finger pitch 11 percent.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc25zcG9ydHMuY29tL2Jsb2cvby1zLWdhbWUtYmxvZy1kZWFuLWtyZW1lci1mYWNlcy10aGUtYW5nZWxzLWluLWdhbWUtMi1vZi1zZXJpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Take, for example, John Carbone of Norwood.  Most days, Carbone's basement is filled with the sounds of daughters Bella and Gabby playing Lego surrounded by green decor. But on Celtics game day, it transforms.  Friends and neighbors fill the room, their names on plaques at the ""bar."" During game breaks, Carbone hosts trivia, and the winning answer gets a piece of priceless Celtics history.  ""I look at everything from like a historical perspective,"" Carbone told WBZ-TV.  He has bricks from the old Boston Garden, pieces of the floor, Larry Bird signed memorabilia, and more. Plus, it all sits next to his kids' tee ball hats – because he wants to show them that they, too, can sit next to the greats.  For Carbone, the passion began at a young age, when his father offered to volunteer at autograph signings for the athletes.  The Carbones would be paid in autographs for their time. The catch? John's dad didn't even love sports; he just saw his son's passion and created the pathway to a lifetime of love for the game.  Carbone later worked at the Garden Pro Shop, and now manages a Celtics collector's Facebook page with thousands of members. He's the go-to person when people need to determine if something they're buying is legitimate.  Carbone is preparing to host friends and newcomers for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Wednesday. His prediction?  ""Knowing the Celtics and seeing them, I think they can beat the Heat handedly. But I can see them having like a 40-point lead and then maybe losing by one in one game.

"game","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:55:11","Doc Rivers won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics back in 2008. The only active head coach who has won more games than him is Gregg Popovich. But at this point, when NBA fans think of Rivers, one of the first things that usually comes to mind is his not-so-storied history of blowing series leads.  Toward the end of their blowout Game 7 loss to the Boston Celtics (a series in which they once held a 3-2 series advantage), The Athletic’s Mike Prada tweeted out this eye-opening statistic:  Assuming Philly doesn't rally, Doc Rivers-coached teams will fall to 16-33 when they have three wins in a seven-game series. — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Rivers is 16-33 in playoff games where his team already has three wins. That’s a win percentage of roughly 32.7%, which is right around the same win percentage the lowly Charlotte Hornets mustered up during the regular season (32.9%).  Now, high-stakes playoff games are much more difficult to win than banal regular season matchups, so comparing Rivers to the Hornets isn’t 100 percent fair. But when you compare his record to that of other coaches in those situations, the disparity in his performance compared to theirs becomes far more pronounced.  Here is a look at some other win-loss records of coaches with three wins in a playoff series (all the data provided by Prada):  Now, it isn’t completely fair to compare Rivers to the likes of Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, and Erik Spoelstra. Those guys are some of the best to ever do it. Of course, they will have incredible win-loss records in these sorts of games.  However, what is very telling is that even George Karl – a coach with a similar reputation to Rivers in regards to his affinity for blowing series leads – has a 50% win percentage in these situations.  To put some even more context on the matter, here are some of the highlights (or rather lowlights) of that 16-33 record:  Doc Rivers teams have also now blown three 3-1 leads, four other 3-2 leads, one other 2-0 lead, and have lost Game 7 at home four times (five if you count the bubble).    He's now 6-10 in Game 7s. https://t.co/ha0spYfvUa — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Arguably the craziest of all those blown leads is the fact that he’s conceded three 3-1 leads. In the history of the NBA Playoffs, a team has come back from a 3-1 series deficit only 13 times. That means that about 23.1% of all 3-1 collapses in NBA history have happened under Rivers’ watch.  Now, this isn’t to say Rivers is a bad coach or anything or that his legacy is set in stone. He’s got an NBA title to his name, and he’s still only 61 years old, with another two years left on his contract.  All told, Rivers is still a good coach (you need to be to get a chance to blow that many series leads!), and he’ll hopefully get another shot to nip his lead-blowing demons in the bud. But in the meantime, brother, that is a tough record to have.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNibmF0aW9uLmNvbS9uYmEvMjAyMy81LzE2LzIzNzI1MzY2L2RvYy1yaXZlcnMtbmJhLXBsYXlvZmZzLWhpc3RvcnktYmxvd24tbGVhZHMtZ2FtZS03LXJlY29yZNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNibmF0aW9uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvbmJhLzIwMjMvNS8xNi8yMzcyNTM2Ni9kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLW5iYS1wbGF5b2Zmcy1oaXN0b3J5LWJsb3duLWxlYWRzLWdhbWUtNy1yZWNvcmQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The game was in development at Industrial Toys, a studio founded by Bungie veteran Alex Seropian and acquired by EA in 2018. Seropian told MobileGamer.biz that at the start of development on Battlefield Mobile, things were looking ""super good"" due to the shooter genre growing on mobile, the strength of the Battlefield franchise, and the caliber of the team.  However, the tepid reception to Battlefield 2042's launch in 2021 combined with Apple's changes to its ""identifier for advertisers"" (IDFA) system, and other factors, contributed to EA making the call to close up shop.  The community reaction to Battlefield 2042, which was not good, led to a ""bunch of introspection"" about the future of the Battlefield series, Seropian said. As for the IDFA changes, in essence, it made user acquisition ""a lot more expensive,"" Seropian explained.  ""So organics eroded away with 2042's release, and paid distribution got an order of magnitude more expensive because of the IDFA rules,"" he said.  EA also canceled Apex Legends Mobile, another title that many believed could be a big success and help expand the brand beyond console/PC in a way that Call of Duty Mobile did. Seropian said people can ""fill in the blanks"" and make some educated guesses as to why EA pulled back from Apex Legends Mobile, too.  ""I don't know if EA has talked about why they canceled it, whether it was economics or whatever, but without me saying, you could fill in the blanks, I guess,"" he said.  Battlefield Mobile's soft launch in a number of territories apparently performed well, but Seropian's team needed more time and money to get the game ready for a global rollout. Battlefield Mobile was also not planned to be a ""connected"" experience with other versions of Battlefield in a way that skins for a game like Fornite, for example, also move with players across devices. Battlefield Mobile was going to be a ""bespoke experience for mobile,"" with the gameplay tailored to a mobile experience.  The challenges of Battlefield 2042, Apple's IDFA rule changes, the team needing more time and money, and the bespoke nature of Battlefield Mobile all contributed to EA eventually calling it quits, Seropian said.  EA isn't abandoning the Battlefield series, though. Battlefield 2042 is in a much better state these days and the game continues to get new updates. Looking further out, EA has outlined a strategy for a Battlefield connected universe that includes multiple titles from multiple teams. And it's not just about multiplayer, either, as Halo veteran Marcus Lehto's team at Ridgeline Games is making a Battlefield single-player campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iYXR0bGVmaWVsZC1tb2JpbGUtZGV2LW9uLXdoeS10aGUtZ2FtZS1hbmQtaXRzLXN0dWRpby1zaHV0LWRvd24vMTEwMC02NTE0MjE0L9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hbXAtYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmF0dGxlZmllbGQtbW9iaWxlLWRldi1vbi13aHktdGhlLWdhbWUtYW5kLWl0cy1zdHVkaW8tc2h1dC1kb3duLzExMDAtNjUxNDIxNC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-05-01","19:00:00","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 15:23:00","JJ Redick explains why he is not surprised about the Sixers firing head coach Doc Rivers. (0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.  ESPN's Tim Bontemps contributed to this report.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjYxNjIwL3NvdXJjZXMtNzZlcnMtZmlyZS1jb2FjaC1kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLXRocmVlLXNlYXNvbnPSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2MTYyMC9zb3VyY2VzLTc2ZXJzLWZpcmUtY29hY2gtZG9jLXJpdmVycy10aHJlZS1zZWFzb25zP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Boulder"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:16:01","By VERNON ROBISON  The Progress  The Moapa Valley High School softball team ended its 2023 season with a 16-5 loss against the Boulder City Eagles in the semifinal game in the 3A Southern Region playoffs on Thursday, May 11.  The loss dropped the Pirates out of the tournament just a game short of qualifying for this week’s state tournament in Mesquite.  The game against Boulder City came immediately after the Pirates had fought their way through a huge win against Clark High School to advance to the semi-final. The Pirates began that game from behind as Clark had stepped out to a 2-1 lead in the first inning.  But the Pirates took the lead with three runs in a critical third inning. Tyelar Anderson brought one of those home with a ground out. Kyndall Longman hit a single that scored another run in the frame.  The Pirates kept the lead from there, scoring two more runs in the top of the final inning. The final score was 6-3.  The win advanced the Pirate girls to the big game which immediately followed against the Eagles. Though they were tired in this second game of the day, after a week of rigorous competition, the Moapa team gave their all. The Pirates ended up outhitting the Boulder City team 6-5. But they struggled to put runs on the board.  The fatigue showed specifically on defense where the Pirates gave up 16 runs in the game.  Moapa pulled ahead early in the game scoring 4 runs in the top of the first inning. Boulder City answered with 3 runs of their own in the bottom of the frame.  The Moapa team managed another run to start the second inning. But the Eagles answered with five runs in the bottom of the inning and six more in the third to take a commanding lead that they would not give up. This seemed to take the wind from the Pirate sails. The team didn’t score again and the game was called on the mercy rule in the fifth inning.  The Pirates had begun the tournament with a 3-2 loss to Clark on Monday afternoon in Las Vegas. They spent the rest of the week marching their way through the consolation bracket.  Moapa blanked Canyon Springs on Tuesday for a 15-0 victory. Then they battled with Pahrump Valley on Wednesday for a close 14-13 win. That brought them to the long Thursday double-game schedule with Clark and Boulder City.  The Pirate team ended as 3rd in the Southern Region, just short of the state championship running.  MVHS Head Coach John Stastny said that the season had been full of learning life lessons for both girls and coaches.  “During the tournament we realized that all of the little things really matter and m,ake the difference against good teams in intense situation,” Stastny said. “It takes a group of individuals, willing to work on those small things in their own positions, who come together and give 100 percent to their team in order to experience success.”  Stastny added that he loved working with the girls of this year’s team. “I loved our mix of 4 seniors, 5 juniors, a sophomore and a freshman,” he said. “I hope that the girls form a bond and enjoy working with each other, even if they aren’t best friends off of the softball diamond.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbXZwcm9ncmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9waXJhdGVzLWZhbGwtb25lLWdhbWUtc2hvcnQtYXQtcmVnaW9uYWxzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2018-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:04:00","It’s time we stopped thinking of cybersecurity as a problem. Instead, it’s a game, with each side trying to outthink and outmaneuver the other. Bad actors can choose when and how to exploit vulnerabilities, but defenders need to know all possible inroads and be prepared for a range of outcomes. Threat intelligence (TI) can give agencies a meaningful advantage by providing situational awareness in context.  Still, gathering knowledge is only part of how the game is played. Staying ahead of adversaries essentially comes down to three elements: visibility, capabilities, and governance, and all are tied to the impact of TI on your security posture.  Awareness delivers a decision advantage  TI is about predicting the future, not explaining the past. Its job is to give you greater awareness, helping you anticipate an adversary’s next move. By correlating internal data, open-source information and third-party inputs, TI helps you spot obscure connections and patterns. This is crucial to identifying threats early enough to do something about them; TI is vital for rationalizing strategies, placing bets, and dynamically rethinking countermeasures.  A smarter defense looks at all the angles  Some attackers are after a specific prize, but in some cases, you might actually be a target of chance, not a target of choice. This means intruders aren’t looking for something specific, and if blocked in one direction, they may simply try another.  That’s why generating intelligent responses to threats takes diversity of thought and perspectives. Angles are not just technical; they are informed by people with different functional, operational, and even life experience backgrounds. Responses today are less about suppressing a single alert and more about stringing alerts together to look through the eyes of the adversary, informing a broader community defense model.  Augmenting the human touch  AI-based automation can play a critical role across the three stages of TI: collection, analysis, and dissemination. AI empowers human decision makers to keep pace with, if not get ahead of, attackers.  AI can also lift long-standing burdens that many agencies face. First, there’s the issue of alert fatigue; if each alarm represents a top priority, how can analysts, who are already spread too thin, choose which fire to fight first? Next, the siloed or bespoke systems found throughout government require too many separate queries, which adds a complexity and time barrier to cyber defense. AI can enable higher confidence, faster, and better coordinated processes, so you can quickly identify the threat and mount an appropriate response.  Governance is everyone’s business  Zero Trust embodies the rules and principles that govern security across the agency. A Zero Trust approach also supports every player on the defensive team, making everyone across the agency essential to security.  Under Zero Trust principles, TI informs a common operational picture of your threat landscape, and surfaces threats that would most likely impact your agency’s operations. This enables you to focus on the bad actors and threat vectors most likely to impact your agency’s operations.  The best strategies are intelligence-led  We’ve all worked tirelessly dealing with threats, and while as an industry, we’re getting better, the challenge is getting harder faster than we are getting better. We need to start thinking differently: we need to find ways to get more defenders in the game, we need Zero Trust to protect people and data across government (and keep bad actors from looking like good ones), we need AI to grow the effectiveness of our cyber strategies, and we need threat intelligence to inform and drive our priorities. Going forward, this is how the game of cyber security will be played.  Read more about integrating security intelligence tools to defend against modern threats.

"game","2023-05-20","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 08:15:47","Quarto is so easy to learn that I was both introduced to it and taught the rules over the course of a single, brisk, Tiktok. It's a two-player board game that plays out on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns putting pieces on the grid. The objective is to get a line of four pieces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, across the board.  This sounds like Connect 4, but rather than using pieces of different colours - I'm red and you're blue - Quarto's pieces are little towers that have a mix of four different characteristics. Pieces can be tall or sort, square or round, can be solid or hollow, and can be dark or light. Every piece is some of these things, so one will be dark, short, hollow, and round. Another will be solid, short, dark and square. The objective is to ensure that every piece in the line of four pieces you make shares at least one characteristic. You don't have to place all the pieces in the line, but you do have to complete it, at which point you shout ""Quarto!""  One final rule. Your opponent chooses the piece you play each turn, and you choose the piece they play.  To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings  Quarto is extremely good. God, it's quick, too. Our set arrived last night and my daughter went from bemusement as I tried to explain the rules to absolutely flattening me in the space of ten minutes. I love the simplicity of it, but also the fiendishness. That 4x4 grid? Not a lot of real estate there, so you're elbow to elbow from an early point in the game. I also love the ritual of politely handing your enemy the absolute most useless piece you can find, smiling at them sweetly, and wishing them well.  Deep down - maybe not so deep down, actually - I think Quarto's about zugzwang, a word I might be badly misusing, but which is so much fun to type I'm going to take the risk. From my understanding zugzwang comes from games like chess, the idea being that it's a state in which you have to make a move, but any move you make will damage you significantly, and you know this.  That's Quarto. There gets a point where you're going to have to hand your opponent a piece that will win them the game, or a point at which you've maneuvered your opponent into a position where they have to hand you a winning piece. So it's all about tempo. It's also all about your options disappearing. After about four turns each the board will often be in a state where nobody wants to play a light piece or a square piece anymore, say, as both are contributing to lines that are almost complete. You're trying to screw over your opponent, but in this weird world of total information.  I've been after a game like this for some time, a game which is simple, quick, and sort of self-contained, by which I mean it draws you and the person you're playing with so deeply into a shared world that you might as well both be sitting in the drum of a washing machine as you play. The rest of the world disappears. Strangers have no clue what you're doing. And then the game turns against you and your enemy shouts, ""Quarto!""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvcXVhcnRvLWlzLWEtYm9hcmQtZ2FtZS10aGF0LW1ha2VzLXp1Z3p3YW5nLXRoZS1zdGFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now, as the Amerks return to Rochester in Round 3, they’re leading the series by two games. While the situations are in stark opposition, the focus is still the exact same.  Just win one game.  That’s been the message from the coaching staff — and from the leadership group in the locker room — for the last five games. As the Amerks faced elimination in three-straight games, the mindset stayed the same: just win one game. And the Amerks did.  They won one game.  And then they won one game, again.  And then they won one game to advance to the North Division finals.  Tomorrow, in front of the home crowd, the Amerks will try to win one game. And they’ll try to eliminate the Marlies from the Calder Cup Playoffs as they do so. It won’t be an easy task against the top-seeded Toronto team, even with a 2-0 series lead.  “Our guys know how hard it is to end someone’s season,” Amerks head coach Seth Appert said after practice on Tuesday. “We have a tremendous amount of respect for Toronto, but our focus is just preparing to just win a game.”  The preparation for the game comes in having good habits at practice, it comes in productive video sessions, and it comes with rest, too. “What can we do today, on a Tuesday, to get ready, to put ourselves mentally and physically in the best position to win one game,” Appert said.  There have been adjustments since the two games in Toronto, aimed at finding ways to exploit Toronto’s weak spots and take away their strengths. There have also been adjustments made to the Amerks’ game, and a focus on tweaking the penalty kill.  Before assessing the PK, though, Appert made sure to give credit to Toronto, who had the second-best power play in the league throughout the regular season. “At the end of the day, it’s really important you stay out of the box,” he explained. “You can kill off two or three, but if you’re giving them four, five, or six, usually a good power play like Toronto is going to get you.”  Rochester is also seeing a good power play during the playoffs so far. The Amerks’ unit ranks second in the league, converting on 34.6% of power plays in seven games. Rookie Jiri Kulich has scored four of his five postseason goals on the power play.  Jiri Kulich has scored a goal in every playoff game he’s played in…    The rookie is HOT 🔥 pic.twitter.com/anldTns8GR — x-Rochester Americans (@AmerksHockey) May 13, 2023  In fact, he has a goal in every playoff game he’s suited up for. Kulich’s 5-game goal streak matches the longest in an AHL postseason since Peter Holland for Toronto in 2014.  “We’re all extremely impressed with Jiri,” Appert said. “I think that it’s just a biproduct of the work he’s been putting in, especially in the second half of the season.""  ""His habits, the maturity to his game, competing for the puck, those things started to take off at a high level and his offensive numbers went with it.”  Kulich led the Rochester squad with 24 goals, and 17 of those came in the second-half of the season. His nine power play goals were also best on the team. “A player of his caliber, when you have the puck, good things can happen,” Appert said.  The Amerks are hoping for a few good things tomorrow night, but one thing is certain: the crowd is going to be electric. Wednesday night’s game is very quickly approaching a sellout, with over 9,500 tickets out.  The team is excited to play in front of the rowdy home crowd and to use the home ice to their advantage. “I thought in the Syracuse series, we did a great job of bringing the fans into the fight,” Appert said. Big hits, fights, and early goals: “Those are things that really get a crowd going. Let’s make sure we do those things early and often.”  And just win one game.  Only a handful of tickets remain for Game 3 at Blue Cross Arena on Wednesday night. The first 5,000 fans will receive a red Round 3 rally towel, and fans can enjoy Pregame Happy Hour, presented by the Genesee Brewery: get $2 beers until puck drop at the Genesee Brewhouse inside Blue Cross Arena.

Irreverent Labs' official statement on what's happened reads as equal parts misleading and delusional (opens in new tab). It also says absolutely everything about this corner of the industry that the first two pages (of four) are dedicated to the risk of scams around Sol 4 Cocks, before going on to moan about those pesky regulators and how they made the NFT cockfighting dream impossible.

Do Literally Anything in 'Tears of the Kingdom'  I grew up playing video games that you loaded into a computer from a tape, and I always dreamed of a game where you could wander the world and interact with pretty much anything. In Zelda, that's exactly what you can do. In fact, you could pretty much make up your own game within a game, building a house, keeping a horse, and foraging for dinner every day. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.  Everything in Tears of the Kingdom has been upgraded. The basic contours of the world are the same, but the world itself has grown and changed. New characters join existing ones, and of course, there are new missions to complete. The world has also expanded up into a shoal of Sky Islands and down into underground cave systems. The visuals are better, the character dialog improved, and the world feels more populated and real.  But the biggest change, and the one that takes this game over the edge, compared to any other game, and will turn Zelda from a game into a meme machine, is the Ultrahand.  TotK Ultrahand and Korok Torture  The Ultrahand is an update to BotW's Magnesis, a special power that lets you use a magnetic beam to lift and toss around metallic objects of any size. The Ultrahand extends this ability to pretty much everything around you. Use the beam to lift, turn, and otherwise manipulate fallen tree trunks, apples, swords, boats, and more. And here's the neat part. You can use the Ultrahand to glue things together.  Nintendo  The Ultrahand is essential to completing some puzzles, and you can use it to do practical things like sticking wheels to an old wooden board and attaching a fan to make a car or repairing broken machinery.  But the possibilities are endless. I built a wooden screen on wheels that I rolled past a huge creature sleeping on a bridge, so it wouldn't see me behind it. And other players have gotten a little darker with their creations. One created a giant phallus from a tree trunk and a pair of rocks and used it to beat a creature to death. Another popular pastime, apparently, is torturing Koroks.  Koroks are cute little woodland creatures, and in Tears of the Kingdom, one diversion has you reuniting separated Koroks. Usually, this involves the Ultrahand, which can grab Koroks because they are wearing backpacks. And players are torturing them, crucifying them, tying them up and dragging them behind horses, cooking them on automatic (player-built) rotisseries, and attaching them to rockets.  It's grim stuff, but it shows the creativity possible inside the game. You could literally build a hut by a lake, go fishing, and start obsessively counting things, like in Henry David Thoreau's Walden. In some ways, it's like a basic version of Minecraft, set inside an existing game world. Although given that one person has recreated 'Breath of the Wild' in Minecraft, it seems that Minecraft will still have the edge.  Nintendo  ""My daughter is mostly about taming all kinds of horses. She also finds out glitches to lead her horse into deep water and stuff,"" said Zelda player and parent Dr. K in a forum thread participated in by Lifewire.  Even if you're not into building things for the sake of building them, this single new dynamic totally changes how you inhabit the world in Tears of the Kingdom. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some shelves to put up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS95ZXMtemVsZGEtdGVhcnMtb2YtdGhlLWtpbmdkb20tcHJvYmFibHktaXMtdGhlLWJlc3QtZ2FtZS1ldmVyLTc0OTg2NTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Universal has released the first teaser for the Blumhouse horror film, giving viewers their first look at how the popular survival horror video game’s terrifying animatronics will be brought to life.  “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is based on the video game franchise created by Scott Cawthon, which released its first entry in 2014 and quickly rocketed to massive popularity. Throughout the different games, players are tasked with surviving the onslaught of hostile animatronic characters inside the haunted Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza restaurant, using security cameras, lights and doors to survey the area.  The new teaser reveals how those game mechanics have been incorporated into the adaptation, with film starring Josh Hutcherson as a hapless security guard.  Cawthon first announced the film adaptation in 2015 to much excitement from fans. But from there, it was a rocky road. Warner Bros. acquired the rights, but, after two years of silence, Cawthon announced that the project was “back to square one.” After losing a series of directors, Jason Blum announced he would be adapting the project through his Blumhouse production company in 2017.  Earlier this year, Universal announced that “Five Nights at Freddy’s” would debut on the streaming service Peacock on the same day of its theatrical release, replicating the day-and-date release strategy by other high-profile Blumhouse productions such as “Halloween Kills” and “Halloween Ends”  Directed by Emma Tammi, “Five Nights at Freddy’s” also stars Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, Kat Conner Sterling, Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard, as well as animatronic designs and technology by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.

That’s how it goes from game to game and season to season.  Whether they like it or not, that’s also been especially true for the Petoskey baseball team this season.  Splits have been a common occurrence for the Northmen throughout the year and it’s been reflected honestly in their 2023 record.  When they welcomed in Alpena for a Big North Conference doubleheader Tuesday at Turcott Field, another split came their way.  The Northmen dropped a 2-1 opener, then leaned on the pitching of senior Max Ferrin to collect a 3-0 victory in game two.  The split moved Petoskey to 11-11 overall and 4-4 within the Big North, with one matchup vs. TC West left on the schedule.  While they've collected 11 losses on the season, the margin for error has been razor thin for Petoskey. They've dropped eight of those 11 games by a single run, including three of their last four and three of their four BNC defeats have come by a lone run.  In the opener Tuesday, both sides found opportunities on the base paths, though runs were tougher to come by.  Grant Slater went seven innings with seven hits and no walks allowed, while striking out six batters.  Both teams plated a run in the sixth, before Alpena then put one on unanswered in the seventh.  Slater also singled twice and Peyton Harmon also added a single for the Northmen. Tyler Goeldel also had an RBI.  In game two, Petoskey spread runs across the first, third and sixth innings and that was plenty for what Ferrin was dealing to the dish.  The senior went all seven innings with one hit and no walks allowed, while also striking out six.  Ferrin allowed a first inning double to the Wildcats, then didn’t allow an Alpena base runner over the next six innings, as the Wildcats went three up, three down the rest of the way.  It dropped Ferrin’s season ERA to 2.10, with 41 strikeouts across 33 and a third.  Petoskey’s run production came behind just four hits, with Ferrin, Harmon, Haden Janes and Kam Horn all singling on.  The Northmen hit a busy stretch ahead to try to pull away from the .500 mark, as they head to Rudyard on Wednesday, May 17, then down to Bay City Western on Saturday, May 20.  They’ll also wrap up BNC play with a visit from Traverse City West on Monday, May 22.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldG9za2V5bmV3cy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvbm9ydGhtZW4tZWFybi1hbm90aGVyLXNwbGl0LWxlYW4tb24tZmVycmlucy1nZW0taW4tZ2FtZS10d28vNzAyMjYwMDcwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2023-01-16","Not Discerned","{""Tampa"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:10:40","TAMPA, FLORIDA - JANUARY 16: Mike Evans #13 of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers carries the ball against the Dallas Cowboys during the third quarter in the NFC Wild Card playoff game at Raymond James Stadium on January 16, 2023 in Tampa, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)  Todd Bowles admits he only looks at three things on Bucs schedule by Josh Hill  While listing each NFL team’s one must-watch game this upcoming season, The Athletic missed the mark on its pick for the Buccaneers.  Now that the NFL schedule has finally been released, we can fill the upcoming dead period on the football calendar with rampant speculation about how games four months out will go.  That’s not a knock, either. Despite what Todd Bowles says, part of what makes the schedule so much fun to look at is the blank slate of promise and hope it represents. Who looked at the Cincinnati Bengals 2022 schedule and had them in the Super Bowl? Did anyone outside of Philly look at the Eagles schedule and predict an 8-0 start?  Hitting a bit closer to home, so many folks had the Bucs as a 12-win team this time last year, only to watch the team finish under .500 and limp into the playoffs.  Breaking down the schedule is fun because there’s no way to actually be right. Is there a more Extremely Online thing than that?  While it’s impossible to be right about predicting a team’s schedule this time of year, it is possible to be wrong — or at least misguided — about how it’s interpreted.  The Athletic lists one must-watch game for Buccaneers in 2023  A recent piece in The Athletic picked one must-watch game for each team in the NFL, selecting the Week 3 game against the Eagles for Tampa Bay. While the game is one of the Buccaneers two primetime matchups this year — assuming they don’t get flexed later in the season — it’s not the one must-watch game on the schedule.  Dan Pompeii argues the intrigue revolves around what it will tell us about kind of team Tampa Bay will be this season.  Pompeii writes:  The Bucs’ first prime-time game in 2023 will tell us everything we need to know. After opening up at Minnesota and hosting Chicago, they play the defending NFC champions on a Monday night. If the Bucs can give the Eagles a game, it will be an indication that the obituaries were premature.  He’s not entirely wrong, but the Buccaneers will not be making or breaking their season three weeks in.  There’s a chance the Bucs get their doors blown off by a vastly superior team, which would tell us in the moment that they’re not contenders. Writing off a team in September is foolish, even a team with seemingly as little to look forward to as Tampa Bay.  How many times have teams encountered early season turbulence only to later turn it around. Last year Tom Brady navigated a season full of turbulence before crashing out in the playoffs, and we’ve seen teams find ways to turn it around after slow starts.  It’s fair to question whether the Bucs have the right pieces to pull that off, but to suggest a what could be an 0-3 start means the season is over is simply wrong. If that’s the case, why even play the remaining 14 games on the schedule and skip right to picking No. 1 overall in April?  Week 3 will border on a must-watch if the Buccaneers come into the game with one or more wins, but it’s certainly not the hinge on which the season will swing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGV3dGVycGxhbmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvYnVjY2FuZWVycy1zY2hlZHVsZS0yMDIzLW11c3Qtd2F0Y2gtZ2FtZS_SAVNodHRwczovL3RoZXBld3RlcnBsYW5rLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2J1Y2NhbmVlcnMtc2NoZWR1bGUtMjAyMy1tdXN0LXdhdGNoLWdhbWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:38:00","A once-popular Steam game is back, but in a new form and with some major changes. Each generation many of the most popular games are multiplayer games. The problem with multiplayer games is when people lose interest, the cost of maintaining servers outweighs the money coming in. When this happens, the servers are promptly shut down, and in cases where the game requires an online connection and/or is strictly multiplayer, it becomes unplayable. And because of this, it ends up being removed from sale. This is the fate of many multiplayer games, including 2012's free-to-play first-person mech shooter Hawken That said, Hawken is coming back tomorrow as Hawken Reborn.  The news comes the way of 505 Games, the developer and publisher of the original game and the developer and publisher of this comeback. The game is set to debut in early access form via Steam Early Access and PC on May 17. When it will fully release, there's no word. There is also no word of it coming to console. What there is word of is that like its predecessor it will be free-to-play.  ""Welcome to the world of Illal, a planet once thought to be humanity's future utopia, turned into a grim dystopia driven by corporate corruption and greed,"" reads an official blurb about the game. ""Illicit terraforming poisoned the atmosphere and a terrible accident gave birth to the 'Giga,' a nanite plague that ravaged half the planet. Become a mercenary pilot, pitting your mech against the dangers of Illal, gaining fame, fortune, and resources to reach the truth behind its bodyguard of lies.""  Right now there's no word of what type of Steam Deck compatibility there will be when the game releases tomorrow in early access. It will presumably be playable on the handheld machines but it remains to be seen whether work has gone into making sure it's verified in time for release.  As always, feel free to leave a comment or two letting us know what you think. Are you interested in checking out Hawken out on PC five years after the game's servers went dark in 2018 or have you moved on from the free-to-play mech shooter in favor of other, newer multiplayer experiences?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY29taWNib29rLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvbmV3cy9zdGVhbS1nYW1lLWRvd25sb2FkLXNhbGUtaGF3a2VuLXJlYm9ybi_SAU1odHRwczovL2NvbWljYm9vay5jb20vZ2FtaW5nL2FtcC9uZXdzL3N0ZWFtLWdhbWUtZG93bmxvYWQtc2FsZS1oYXdrZW4tcmVib3JuLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","1932-08-09","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 03:01:34","Tuesday’s Game Report: Brewers 3, Cardinals 2  By Rob Rains  Jordan Montgomery had the bad luck to be pitching for the Cardinals the night after they scored 18 runs. That meant, of course, that they likely were going to struggle to score.  That indeed was what happened on Tuesday night as the Cardinals were held to just two runs, one coming on another Nolan Arenado home run, and saw their four-game winning streak come to an end with the loss to the Brewers at Busch Stadium.  The loss extended a longer streak for Montgomery as he fell to 0-6 in his last seven starts, all of which the Cardinals have lost. Montgomery has not won since his second start of the season, on April 8 at Milwaukee.  In five of those losses, including Tuesday night, Montgomery did not allow more than three runs. The Cardinals have scored a combined 10 runs while Montgomery was in the game in his last seven starts.  Here is how Tuesday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Arenado homered for the fifth consecutive game, one off the longest streak of his career, which he did for the Rockies in 2015 … The Cardinnals other run scored in the fourth on a two-out double by Tommy Edman and a single by Brendan Donovan … The Cardinals left at least one runner on base in every inning except the first inning, including two in both the eighth and ninth innings. They left 12 runners on base for the game and were just 1-of-9 with runners in scoring position … Nolan Gorman’s streaks of an extra-base hit and an RBI both ended at five games.  On the mound: Montgomey gave up a run on a pair of doubles in the first inning, then allowed solo homers in the fifth and sixth. He struck out seven and was able to get out of a bases-loaded jam in the fifth. He had allowed only two home runs against 96 batters faced at Busch this season prior to Tuesday night … Jordan Hicks, Andre Pallante and Drew VerHagen combined to allow just one hit over the final 3 1/3 innings.  Key stat: Despite falling back to nine games under .500 at 17-26, the Cardinals have a plus-six run differential for the year. They are just 2-9 in games decided by one run.  Worth noting: The alignment of Donovan in left, Lars Nootbaar in center and Edman in right was the 16th different combination of outfielders to start for the Cardinals in their first 43 games. They have not used any alignment in more than six games … Gorman made his first start against a lefthander but that lasted only one at-bat before Wade Miley had to come out of the game because of a lat strain. Gorman hit into a fielder’s choice in that at-bat and did get another at-bat against a lefthander later in the game and struck out, leaving him 0-of-9 this season against lefthanders … Dylan Carlson (sprained ankle) is still considered day to day. He was able to take swings righthanded in the batting cage on Tuesday and manager Oli Marmol said “we’re going to give it another day and see where he’s at. There was definite progress today.” … Further research after Monday night’s game found that the last time the Cardinals had three players each drive in at least four runs in the same game was on Aug. 9, 1932.  Looking ahead: It was announced after the game that Matthew Liberatore will be recalled from Memphis to start against Corbin Burnes in the final game of the series on Wednesday night.  Adam Wainwright and the rest of the starters will move back a day in a temporary six-man rotation  Follow Rob Rains on Twitter @RobRains  Share this: Twitter  Facebook  Skype  Email    Like this: Like Loading...","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3Rsc3BvcnRzcGFnZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi90dWVzZGF5cy1nYW1lLXJlcG9ydC1icmV3ZXJzLTMtY2FyZGluYWxzLTIv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9zdGxzcG9ydHNwYWdlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L3R1ZXNkYXlzLWdhbWUtcmVwb3J0LWJyZXdlcnMtMy1jYXJkaW5hbHMtMi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Boston Celtics displayed their resiliency, rebounding from a 3-2 series deficit to take out the Philadelphia 76ers in a seven-game second-round series.  For the Miami Heat, they’ve maintained control throughout their first two series. The Heat have never trailed in beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games and taking out the New York Knicks in six games.  All of that serves to make Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final perhaps a little bit bigger than an opening game might seem during a seven-game set. The Heat have opened both playoff rounds with road victories. What happens to Miami if Boston were to whip the Heat in Game 1?  Oddsmakers are expecting exactly that to happen. It’s the Celtics who are set as eight-point home favorites in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference final on Wednesday at TD Garden (TNT, 8:30 pm ET).  Heat vs. Celtics betting trends  Miami is 2-0 both straight up and against the spread in Game 1 of playoff series this spring, winning both on the road. The Heat covered as 10-point road underdogs in Game 1 of their opening-round series at Milwaukee, beating the Bucks outright 130-117.  Boston is 1-1 both SU and ATS when playing Game 1 of a playoff series this year. The Celtics opened the postseason by winning outright at home over Atlanta as 10-point home favorites over the Hawks in successive games. However, since that time, Boston has been favored by 8+ points three times. The Celtics are 0-3 both SU and ATS in all three of those games.

The Heat are 1-0 SU and ATS as the betting pick over the Celtics.  The total for Game 1 is set at 201.5 points. The total has gone over in eight of the last 11 games for both the Heat and the Celtics. Eight of the last 10 Miami vs. Boston games at TD Garden have also gone over.

At the outset of the playoffs, with the Bruins setting NHL regular-season marks for wins and points and the Celtics challenging for top spot in the NBA standings, there was talk of Boston sweeping the NHL and NBA titles. Caesars Sportsbook even put forth a prop bet on a Boston title double. No city has ever won both championships in the same season.  However, the Bruins blew a 3-1 series lead and were bounced in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Florida Panthers, who also call South Beach home. Now, with the Panthers in NHL final four, it is Miami which is poised to do this unique double.  DraftKings Massachusetts $150 Bonus Bets! CLAIM OFFER 21+. Physically present in MA.

To do their part, the Heat will have to overcome both history and the odds. As a No. 8 seed, Miami is seeking to emulate the 1999 New York Knicks, the only eight seed ever to reach the NBA Finals. The Knicks were quashed in five games by the San Antonio Spurs.  Boston is set as overwhelming -525 favorites to win the Eastern Conference title. Miami is a +400 long shot to beat the Celtics, and the +1400 fourth betting choice to win the NBA Finals. Boston is the +105 chalk to lift the Larry O’Brien Trophy.  Heat can’t match Celtics depth  As impressive as Miami’s run has been, the worrisome part is that it’s been mostly done on the broad shoulders of Jimmy Butler. Last season, when the Heat pushed the Celtics to seven games, Butler scored 41 and 47 points in two of Miami’s three victories.  With Tyler Herro (hand) out, can anyone consistently provide a second scoring option for Miami against Boston’s stifling defense? That’s the issue the Heat are facing.  Meanwhile, Boston can count on double dipping in elite scoring talent with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Tatum poured in 51 points in Game 7 against the 76ers. Brown is averaging 24.6 points per game in the playoffs.  Pick: Boston Celtics -8 (-110).  Heat vs. Celtics same-game parlay  After surviving the stern test provided by Philadelphia, there’s a sense that Boston is more ready for the next test than Miami, which had it easy against the relatively defenseless Knicks. A blowout Celtics win in Game 1 doesn’t seem to be an unreasonable outcome, so we’ll set out assembling a same-game parlay by going with Boston -8 in the point spread at odds of -110.  Let’s couple that with a Tatum prop. No, he’s not going to score 51 again, but will he go over his points prop for Game 1 of 28.5? He’s only done so twice in his last six games, but is averaging 30.8 ppg against the Heat this season.

A lot of them, too. In fact, in 99 at-bats in April, Robert Jr. recorded 20 hits for a .202 batting average. He struck out 28 times and walked just four times in 105 plate appearances.  He went through one of the worst hitting slumps of his career. Mixed in with that, he was benched during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays for jogging to first base on a groundball he could've beat. He wasn't in the lineup the subsequent game either.  But all of that changed in May. What's the secret to his recent success?  He's somewhat adapted to the new hitting coaching staff's method of incorporating technology, specifically the iPitch machine, into the practice routine. But Robert is instinctually hesitant to delve into the numbers too far.  ""There is too much information that I don’t like to look at,"" Robert Jr. told James Fegan of The Athletic. ""To me, the simpler the better. Once you are at home plate, you can’t be thinking of all that stuff. You have to be thinking of the pitcher, what pitch and the speed of the pitch that he has, nothing more than that.""  Whatever he's doing, it's working. In the 14 games the Sox have played so far in May, Robert Jr. is hitting .408 from the plate with 20 hits, seven home runs, 15 RBIs and 17 runs scored. He has just as many walks as he had in the previous 26 games and just 10 strikeouts in 46 at-bats.  Let's not forget. Robert is arguably the best defensive center fielder in the game right now. He holds defensive runs saved (DFRS) value of 7, well above the rest of the competition. At this rate, he could be in the mix for a Gold Glove in the outfield, which would be the second of his career.  But right now, the rest of the White Sox are riding off Robert Jr.'s energy, taking it in as they watch from the dugout. If Robert Jr. homers on Wednesday, he will tie A.J. Pierzynski's franchise record for the longest streak with a home run.  ""It's incredible,"" Gavin Sheets told the media after Tuesday's win over the Cleveland Guardians. ""I've been hitting behind him most the games and what he's been doing, he's been locked in. It's been a lot of fun to watch. It doesn't surprise me one bit with the talent he's got but whenever a guy like him gets hot it's a lot of fun to watch.""

Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert’s solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland’s Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Manager Terry Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBIs, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan’s double, which ended Lynn’s night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated another run.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, manager Pedro Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Indians: RHP Aaron Civale (oblique strain) is expected to throw 50 pitches in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday. ... Francona said RHP Triston McKenzie, (teres major strain) is expected to be assigned “somewhere” to pitch on Saturday.  White Sox: Returned LHP Garrett Crochet (Tommy John surgery) from his rehab assignment from Charlotte and optioned RHP Nick Padilla. The 6-foot-6 Crochet, who hasn’t pitched in the majors since Oct. 1, 2021, was expected to be available from the bullpen. ...

Yesterday, Amazon Games announced that it's taking another stab at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, a little more than two years after its previous effort with Chinese tech giant Tencent was canceled. Now, the same team behind Amazon's New World is developing a new Lord of the Rings MMO in partnership with Embracer Group, which owns the IP rights to the franchise. The project is in early development, so details are light, but we did learn a bit about what to expect from its story and setting in an interview with GamesIndustry.  Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann said there's already plenty of internal debate about how to approach adapting the iconic story of The Lord of the Rings to a modern MMO format.  ""We have some die-hard Lord of the Rings fans, and already [they're saying], 'We can't do that' or Middle-earth [Enterprises] is not going to allow it, and we're not going to be able to alter the story, and introduce new characters, or rewrite the books,"" Hartmann said.  ""But for me, it's still very important that it's first a game, and then a reflection of the books second. So while I need to stay true, I always, and I'm reminding the team already, 'I get it, but it's not about every person going and pointing out if that detail is 100% perfect.' Let's say the way [Tolkien] describes the world, maybe the landscape looks a little bit different because either we can't get it going or the art people feel it might look a little bit different than what people assume it is in the book.""  Of course, The Lord of the Rings Online is going on its 17th year and still receiving substantial updates, including last year's Before the Shadow expansion. Hartmann said he has ""a lot of respect"" for the developers at Standing Stone Games but clarified that, chiefly due to technological advancements, Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO will be ""worlds apart.""  In the meantime, here are the best MMORPGs you can play today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1hem9ucy1sb3JkLXJpbmdzLW1tby1nYW1lLTE4MzgwODk2My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For the third time this season,  Corpus Christi, TX – The Tulsa Drillers pitching staff has been lighting up the Texas League this season, but that was not the case on Tuesday night as the Corpus Christi Hooks offense accomplished something that has happened just two other times this season. For the third time this season, the Drillers gave up at least seven runs in a 7-3 game one loss at Whataburger Field.  Tuesday marked the first game for the Drillers in Corpus Christi since the 2019 season and was the opener of a six-game set with the Hooks.  BOX SCORE  All of the Drillers offense came in the first inning as Jose Ramos gave Tulsa an early lead with a three-run homer.  Tulsa starting pitcher River Ryan also had a great start to his night as he kept the Hooks hitless through the first three innings but ran into trouble in the fourth. Following two walks, Quincy Hamilton tied the game with his three-run homer. A single from Chad Stevens gave Corpus Christi two more runs and a 5-3 lead.  In the fifth inning, the Hooks plated two more on Kenedy Corona’s two-RBI double to take a 7-3 lead.  The game remained scoreless over the next three innings as Jake Pilarski and Lael Lockhart combined to record the final ten outs, and Tulsa's offense earned just three hits after the first inning.  HIGHLIGHTS AND HAPPENINGS:  *All five of Tulsa's hits were recorded by just three batters, as Eddy Leonard and Ramos recorded two hits, and Jorbit Vivas earned one.  *Hooks pitcher Colton Gordon earned a four-inning save as he pitched the final four innings following five innings from starter Rhett Kouba.  *Houston Astros infielder José Altuve made a rehab appearance in the game. He finished 0-5 with one strikeout. Altuve is expected to make two more rehab starts for the Hooks.  *Before the game, the Drillers announced a series of roster moves.

Peacock will present an NFL Wild Card Playoff game in primetime on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2024, starting at 8 p.m. ET under a deal announced by NBCU and the NFL. The Peacock-exclusive Wild Card game will immediately follow a late afternoon NFL Wild Card Playoff game on NBC and Peacock (4:30 p.m. ET on Jan. 13).  With the two Saturday NFL Wild Card games and a Sunday primetime NFL Wild Card game (on NBC and Peacock), NBCU will be the first media company to present three NFL playoff games in a single weekend. In addition, Peacock will carry its first-ever exclusive NFL regular season game on Dec. 23, featuring the Bills at Chargers.  Peacock’s exclusive NFL Wild Card game and regular-season game will be broadcast on NBC stations in the two competing teams’ local markets, per the NFL’s usual requirement. Both games also will be available on mobile devices to subscribers of NFL+.  “We are thrilled to partner with the NFL on this industry milestone, bringing to Peacock the first ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game,” NBC Sports chairman Pete Bevacqua said in a statement. “With America’s No. 1 primetime show for a record 12 consecutive years, the terrific regular season ‘SNF’ schedule revealed last week, and today’s announcement, we can’t wait for the 2023 season to kick off.”  NFL Media chief operating officer Hans Schroeder commented, “We are excited to work with a great partner in Peacock to present the first-ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game this upcoming season. Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League, and bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  For the 2023 NFL season, Peacock will once again stream all NBC “Sunday Night Football” games, including the playoffs, and the “Football Night in America” studio show. The exclusive Peacock “Sunday Night Football Final” will return with expanded postgame coverage following “SNF” each week.

As a result of this, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now play FIFA 23.

At this point, if you don't know the deal about FIFA then you're not interested in it, which means you're not going to be interested in this additon. One of the longest-running series in gaming, and one of the best-selling, FIFA 23 debuted on September 30, 2022, but has only now been added to EA Play. That said, the installment, in particular, is notable because it marks the end of the 29-year partnership between EA and FIFA.

Will FIFA 23 ever be added to standard Xbox Game Pass? No, probably not.

"game","2023-02-20","Not Discerned","{""Paris"", ""IleDeFrance"", ""France""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:06:00","Victor Wembanyama shows off his full skill set as he leads the Boulogne-Levallois Metropolitans 92 to a win. (2:00)  PARIS -- Hours before finding out his likely destination in the NBA, Victor Wembanyama drew a star-studded crowd in his last regular-season game in France and delivered another game-winning performance in the fourth quarter.  Soccer star Kylian Mbappé and popular French actor Omar Sy were both on hand to watch Wembanyama put up 22 points as his Boulogne-Levallois side won 93-85 in a local derby against Paris Basketball. The French phenom -- and much of the basketball world -- then turned their attention to the NBA draft lottery in Chicago later Tuesday, when he watched the San Antonio Spurs win the No. 1 pick.  Wembanyama, 19, showed a glimpse of why as he scored 14 of his game-high 22 points in the fourth quarter, with the crowd of about 4,000 chanting ""Wemby, Wemby"" as he turned it on late after a slow start.  ""He seemed elsewhere early on, probably at the lottery,"" Metropolitans 92 coach Vincent Collet said. ""But he responded so well. ... He's 19 and his life is going to totally change. Can you understand that? Tonight is a massive moment in his career. It's totally understandable that things were going on in his head.""  Wembanyama treated the crowd to a late one-handed dunk, then tapped his own head repeatedly in appreciation.  One fan responded by bowing with his hands held out when another two-handed dunk with just six seconds left made the teenager the game's top scorer.  Wemby clenched his fist and let out a yell at the final buzzer and then hugged his teammates as the crowd rose to gave the French league's leading scorer a standing ovation at the Palais des Sports Marcel Cerdan.  The 7-foot-5 Wembanyama then did a lap of honor high-fiving fans -- or low-fiving, really, given his height -- and signing autographs.  Wembanyama still has the French league's playoffs to focus on -- starting this weekend -- before he can fully turn his eye to the NBA. But the French crowds are taking every chance to see him while they can, knowing that a similar talent is unlikely to come along soon.  ""I believe he's going to be a Hall of Famer,"" said Paris Basketball coach Will Weaver, a former assistant with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. ""I coached Kevin Durant, Jarrett Allen. I've been around a lot of good, big men that have a lot of unique skills. I just see his professionalism and competitiveness.""  Mbappé, France's World Cup star, is a huge basketball fan and arrived just in time -- about 30 seconds before the start of the game -- to watch another prolific scorer in action.  Though it wasn't a vintage performance from Wemby early.  He got into foul trouble and looked a little tense at times, perhaps because of the occasion. He pointed to his forearm and said ""Mais non!"" (""Not at all!"") when a refereeing decision was not given his way. He bowed his head, then shook it when missing a 3-pointer late in the first quarter.  During one break early in the second quarter, a camera crew on the opposite side rushed to interview Mbappé, who sat on the same row as Wembanyama's parents and close to Sy. Mbappé was still posing for photos seconds before the start of the third quarter and threatening to steal the spotlight.  But then, Wemby, showed again who the main attraction was, taking over the fourth quarter.  Collet, who also coaches France, said he will stay up late to watch the lottery with Wembanyama.  ""Tonight he will know his destination,"" he said. ""I think the team that has the first choice isn't going to get it wrong.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2VzcG4vc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2NDI1MS92aWN0b3Itd2VtYmFueWFtYS1zaGluZXMtZmluYWwtZ2FtZS1uYmEtZHJhZnQtbG90dGVyedIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2VzcG4vc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2NDI1MS92aWN0b3Itd2VtYmFueWFtYS1zaGluZXMtZmluYWwtZ2FtZS1uYmEtZHJhZnQtbG90dGVyeT9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

North told reporters last week that the Cincinnati Bengals lobbied to host the Black Friday game as an annual fixture. During his interview with Schefter, he mentioned the Jets as another team interested in being an annual host of the holiday game, similar to the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys traditionally hosting nationally televised games on Thanksgiving.  ""I hope I'm not speaking out of turn when I mentioned to people that the Bengals volunteered,"" said North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning. ""There were others that kind of raised their hands for Black Friday as well.""  The league announced last week that this year's Black Friday game would be hosted by the Jets, who will be featured in five additional prime-time games in 2023 with Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback.  ""The Jets, once they found out they were the host team, then started to think about, 'Hey, is this something we could make a permanent fixture as part of the NFL schedule?'"" North said. ""Maybe they didn't raise their hands in February, but now that they have been selected as the Black Friday host, I think they might be interested in it, too.""  Amazon, which will distribute the game on Prime Video, reached out to the league about having one of the NFL's New York teams involved in the inaugural Black Friday game. Amazon suggested that its positioning as a giant retailer and having a game in the top retail market in the country could be a ""fun way"" to introduce the concept. North said last week that the NFL also looked at a potential matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants before settling on Dolphins-Jets.  North told Schefter that the NFL also considered Black Friday rivalry matchups featuring the Bengals hosting either the Pittsburgh Steelers or Baltimore Ravens. He emphasized that he doesn't have the final word on whether the league will implement a permanent host for the Black Friday game, saying that decision will fall on ownership and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.  ""I don't think we were looking for this season to commit to a permanent home for Black Friday,"" North said. ""Let's play one first and let's see what we learn and let's see what makes sense and let's see if it works for our fans, I don't think we were looking on day one to deploy this with a permanent home.  ""But it's certainly something we should talk about. Let's see what happens this year, let's see what the fan reaction is to that day, and I'm sure we'll go back to ownership, we'll go back to membership and we'll talk about would we be interested in it. Is that a good idea for the NFL? I'm sure there's pros and cons to both.""  The Jets acquired Rodgers in a blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers last month, two weeks before the NFL released its full 2023 schedule. North said the protracted Rodgers trade talks did not have much impact on the league's scheduling plan for the Jets, who he referred to as a ""good football team"" with ""exciting skill position players.""  ""I think you would still see a lot of Jets games on national television,"" North said. ""That was a good football team. ... Those games had to be used in national TV windows somewhere.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjYwOTU0L2pldHMtc2V2ZXJhbC10ZWFtcy1pbnRlcmVzdGVkLWhvc3RpbmctYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LWdhbWUtYW5udWFsbHnSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uZmwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2MDk1NC9qZXRzLXNldmVyYWwtdGVhbXMtaW50ZXJlc3RlZC1ob3N0aW5nLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1nYW1lLWFubnVhbGx5P3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The shift to $70 games for the “next-gen” consoles has been slow but steady, and another major publisher could soon be making the jump. Sega said in its latest earnings report that it’s currently reviewing its games to see where price increases make sense, moving in the direction of 2K Games, Square Enix, and other big companies that have already adopted $70 as the new standard price point for blockbuster video games.  “In the global marketplace, AAA game titles for console have been sold at $59.99 for many years, but titles sold at $69.99 have appeared in the last year,” Sega said in a newly translated transcript of the company’s April 28 earnings call (via VGC). “We would like to review the prices of titles that we believe are commensurate with price increases, while also keeping an eye on market conditions.”  Read more  Sega’s most recent blockbuster, a remake of the Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin!, was cross-gen and priced at $60. So was last year’s ambitious Sonic Frontiers, which came to every platform including the Nintendo Switch. It now sounds like the next Yakuza and Sonic games could be the first to tick up to $70. Like a Dragon 8 (as the Yakuza series is known in Japan) is slated to arrive sometime in 2024.  Read More: Sonic Maker Sega Is The Video Game Industry’s Next Union Battleground  After over a decade of prices for high-end games stagnating at $60, Take-Two was the first to race to make NBA 2K21 $70 when it came to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Other companies like Activision, Sony, Square Enix, and Ubisoft followed suit. Redfall was Microsoft’s first $70 game, while The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was Nintendo’s, though the Mario maker says some of its games will remain at $60 for now.  Interestingly, the price changes have mostly only been on consoles. With the exception of Forspoken, PC versions of recent blockbusters like the Dead Space remake and The Callisto Protocol remained $10 cheaper than their counterparts on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. AAA game budgets are out of control, though, so it’s unlikely to stay that way for long.  Story continues      More from Kotaku  Sign up for Kotaku's Newsletter.

With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with  Beloit, WI - Entering Tuesday evening in Beloit, the South Bend Cubs continued their 12-game road trip held exclusively in the state of Wisconsin. With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with both Peoria and Cedar Rapids. With a 9-4 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday, the Cubs are in striking range in the West Division and started their most important series of the first half in a big way.  South Bend sent starter Connor Noland to the mound on Tuesday night, and Noland continued his strong work in his first pro season. Pitching his third career game already against Beloit, Noland worked a 1-2-3 1st inning, and set the Cubs up for success at the plate.  Kevin Alcántara was hit by a pitch on the first offering of the game by Holt Jones, and then stole second base. He was left in scoring position, but the Cubs didn’t miss out on their opportunities from then on.  In the 2nd, still facing Jones, who came into Tuesday with an ERA over 11.00, he was also facing the Cubs for a third time this year. His first start in the home opener at Four Winds Field went well with 4.2 shutout innings. That same series, he pitched in the finale and surrendered seven runs in 3.2 innings.  Tuesday in Beloit looked like the latter, as Jones ran into trouble first in the 2nd. South Bend received a double by Bryce Ball, Ethan Hearn walked, Scott McKeon got hit by a pitch, and Christian Franklin singled. Alcántara brought home his first two RBI of the night on a solid single, and that was followed by another RBI-hit from Ezequiel Pagan.  Jones continued on the mound into the 3rd, and that’s when the big blow was dealt. James Triantos was the third man that Jones hit on the night to start the frame, Yohendrick Pinango walked, and Fabian Pertuz took Jones deep on a three-run homer to give the Cubs a 6-1 lead. It was the third round tripper of the season for Pertuz.  The inning continued with RBI hits from Hearn and McKeon. In a short matter of time, it was an 8-1 Cubs lead.  That was all the pitching staff would need as Noland finished off his start with four innings pitched, no walks, and five strikeouts. It ended up being the third straight start that Noland did not walk a batter.  Out of the bullpen, Jarod Wright earned the win with three strong innings and only one run allowed. Beloit mounted a comeback effort late against Adam Laskey, singling in four consecutive at-bats. But Laskey got a double-play ball and a strikeout to end the threat. He locked down the final three outs and South Bend picked up the win.  With the victory, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels beating the Peoria Chiefs, the Cubs and Kernels will enter Wednesday both just 1.5 games back of Beloit for 1st place. It will be an afternoon matinee on Wednesday at ABC Supply Stadium, as the two clubs play again at 12:05 PM ET.  Chicago Cubs 2022 first-round pick Cade Horton will start his second game in the Midwest League for South Bend.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGIuY29tL3NvdXRoLWJlbmQvbmV3cy9jdWJzLWdhaW4tZ2FtZS1vbi1iZWxvaXQtYnktY3J1c2hpbmctc2t5LWNhcnDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Week 18 is the last game of the regular season. What's most exciting is what comes next – the start of the playoffs.  PJ's Pick: Week 2 vs. Seahawks  The Lions are looking to avenge four 2022 losses this year, but to me, the home opener against the Seahawks is by far the most important. As I'm sure many remember, Detroit lost a 48-45 shootout at Ford Field in Week 4 of last season, a game that eventually led to Seattle earning a playoff berth with the same 9-7 record as the Lions.  Even outside of last year's results, it's hard to find two teams more alike in circumstance than the Lions and Seahawks - both are young teams with improved rosters that they believe are ready to compete in the NFC.

CHICAGO -- — Luis Robert Jr. homered for the fourth straight game, Gavin Sheets and Jake Burger went deep off Shane Bieber in Chicago’s six-run fifth inning, and the White Sox beat the Cleveland Guardians 8-3 on Tuesday night.  Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert's solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  In 14 games in May, Robert is hitting .408 (20 for 49) with seven homers and 15 RBI.  “He got a good pitch up in the zone and he's not missing those right now,” Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. “And they're going a long way. He's shrinking this ballpark, he's shrinking any ballpark right now.”  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  “You've got a matchup like Lance and Bieber going at it and both guys were throwing the ball really well,” Sheets said. “So to have that inning was huge for us.”  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  “It was a weird, weird game,” Cleveland manager Tony Francona said. ""The first four innings he scattered hits, but kept them off the scoreboard, kind of typical Bieber style. Bobbed and weaved a little bit, but made pitches.  “Then we got two quick outs (in the fifth) ... and it was like the roof caved in.""  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland's Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBI, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan's double, which ended Lynn's night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated the second unearned run charged to Lynn.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Indians: Francona said he'd know more on Wednesday about the extent of Naylor's injury, sustained when he dived after a ball. ... RHP Aaron Civale (oblique strain) is expected to throw 50 pitches in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday. ... Francona said RHP Triston McKenzie, (teres major strain) is expected to be assigned “somewhere” to pitch on Saturday.  White Sox: Returned LHP Garrett Crochet (Tommy John surgery) from his rehab assignment from Charlotte and optioned RHP Nick Padilla. The 6-foot-6 Crochet, who hasn’t pitched in the majors since Oct. 1, 2021, was expected to be available from the bullpen. ...

"game","2013-01-01","11:00:00","{""CherryCreek"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:04:48","(1) Colorado Academy 17, (4) Cherry Creek 7  Despite lightning and weather delays, the Class 5A girls lacrosse state semifinals were completed on Tuesday night at Englewood High School's Randy Penn Stadium. In the first game of the night, No. 1 Colorado Academy took down No. 4 Cherry Creek, and in the second, No. 6 Regis Jesuit upset No. 2 Valor Christian to advance to its first-ever state championship game.Defending state champion Colorado Academy will play Regis Jesuit in the state championship game at University of Denver's Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium Friday night at 7:30 p.m.  ENGLEWOOD - One of the Colorado prep sports’ greatest streaks continued Tuesday evening, when the Colorado Academy girls lacrosse team earned its now accustomed spot in the Class 5A state championship game.    It is absolutely nothing new for the Mustangs, who won an incredible 30th consecutive postseason contest dating back to the 2014 season and now have a chance to win a state championship for an eighth consecutive time after a 17-7 win over fourth-seeded Cherry Creek in a game twice delayed by lightning at Englewood High School.  “Pressure is such a privilege and I’m so grateful to carry the CA name because it means so much in the lacrosse community,” said junior midfield Charlotte Corkins, who was one of eight different players to score goals as Colorado Academy improved to 18-0.  “The best thing CA has is that everybody buys into our culture and our team,” she added. “I think it’s just great that we have this tradition and that people have such pride to play for the team.”  That culture and tradition helped the beat go on despite the arrival of a new coach, as Sonorah Hunter took over for former coach Laura Sandblom prior to the season.  Hunter put her own stamp on how the program is run, but she credited the mentality and coachable nature of the returning players as how the Mustangs have again reached the cusp of another title.  “I think it is really easy to get caught up with where the team has been in the past, but since the beginning of the season, we really have focused on the details and how we play together as a group,” Hunter said. “We have a lot of amazing, talented individuals on this team and to be able to shape that and watch them buy into that and get so much better since the beginning of the season has been great to see.”  To get back to the state championship game, Colorado Academy had to go through a Cherry Creek team it beat by a 16-2 count back on April 6.  As expected with both teams having a full regular season and playoff games under their belts, it was a different result, at least for the first 20 minutes.  The Bruins (14-4) — who were seeking their first trip to a state championship game since 2019 — were undaunted in the early going, as they took a lead at 2-1 and after trailing for a bit, forged a 5-5 tie with 8:47 left in the opening half.  Colorado Academy got three key goals in the final 3 minutes, 52 seconds, of the half — including back-to-back scores by Corkins — to take a three-goal edge into halftime. It was particularly meaningful to contribute in a key moment for Corkins, who was on the sidelines watching last season with a torn ACL.  “This is a real, cool full circle moment for me; a year ago I was on crutches and I can remember standing over there on the sideline,” said Corkins, who finished with four goals in the first half. “It feels really good to come back and make an impact for my team.”  The game broke for the first lightning delay with 17:24 remaining in the second half and by that time, Colorado Academy had added goals by juniors Zoe Martin, Skylar May, Alex May and Estella Gellar to up the advantage to 12-5. Another goal on the other side of the break by senior Anna Colpack made it a streak of eight straight scores for the Mustangs before Cherry Creek stopped the run with a goal by senior Becca Zerr just before the second delay.  The remaining time elapsed quickly as the Mustangs reached the 10-goal barrier to invoke the running clock and then could prepare for yet another trip to the state championship game.  The distribution of offense in the semifinal showed how dangerous Colorado Academy can be, as Martin — who came into the game with a staggering 73 goals — had to score just twice, while several others shouldered the scoring load.  “We have so many great goal scorers, so anybody can have their best game on any given day,” said Corkins, one of five players with 29 or more goals coming into the game. “I think that’s what makes us so good, there are so many offensive threats.”  By knocking out Cherry Creek, Colorado Academy has a chance to creep even closer to the Bruins’ lead in the all-time state championship category since the sport debuted in Colorado in 2000.  Cherry Creek has won 10 state championships (the last came in 2013), while the Mustangs now have a chance to win their ninth.  Colorado Academy will be playing a team in the final that has never won a title before and Hunter expects to get their best effort.  “All of these girls are going through so much this week with finals and everything,” Hunter said. “We beat them during the regular season, so we know we can win, but we know they are going to be super hungry. They are definitely going to be coming for us.”  (6) Regis Jesuit 11, (2) Valor Christian 7  ENGLEWOOD - In sharp contrast to its next opponent, the Regis Jesuit girls lacrosse team doesn’t know what it is like to play for a state championship.The Raiders will know that feeling for the first time on Friday when they take the field at the University of Denver to go against Colorado Academy, which will be after its eighth consecutive Class 5A state championship. Regis Jesuit, meanwhile, will have a chance to win its first thanks to an 11-7 semifinal victory over Valor Christian late Tuesday night at Englewood High School.Coach Crysti Foote’s sixth-seeded Regis Jesuit team continued its trend of fast starts and avoided the second half struggles it had in a few games this year to finally get over the hurdles of the semifinals, which had stopped it in both 2019 and 2021. In the process, the Raiders avenged a loss by the identical 11-7 score early in the season to the second-seeded Eagles, who were in search of their third straight trip to the state championship game.“Our goal this season was to get to the state championship, but I didn’t know we hadn’t been there before,” said Foote, who is in her second season as head coach. “It was just something we were working towards. I’m super proud of this team.”Senior Ava Rogala and sophomore Maddy Jokerst scored four goals apiece for Regis Jesuit (12-4), which also got two scores from junior Phoebe Rogala and another from senior Carly Kennedy as it set up a championship contest against top-seeded Colorado Academy, a 17-7 winner over No. 4 Cherry Creek in the previous semifinal.In a game delayed by a couple of hours because of two lightning delays in the previous game, the Raiders came out strong and built a lead of four goals at 5-1.Valor Christian answered with three straight goals to get within one when senior Kaley Kakac converted a free shot opportunity.Regis Jesuit got the momentum back with Ava Rogala’s third goal of the opening half followed by Phoebe Rogala’s first tally, which came with just nine seconds left on the clock.“As a team with a history of not coming out the strongest in the second half, we left that first half with passion, with energy and with hope,” Phoebe Rogala said.The Raiders never really wavered in the second half, although consecutive goals by speedy Valor Christian junior Eliza Osburn tightened the game up in the opening five minutes of the half.Phoebe and Ava Rogala again had consecutive goals to restore a four-goal edge and from there, freshman goalie Rayn Parker made a few key saves and the Regis Jesuit defense played aggressive and physical as it limited the chances for Valor Christian in the remainder of the half.A point-blank stop by Parker on Kakac inside the final four minutes essentially sealed the victory.Regis Jesuit will get another chance to play Colorado Academy, which it lost to 12-8 in the regular season finale May 6.The Raiders believe the Mustangs are “beatable” and look forward to the challenge of playing a team that will be heavily favored.“CA is an amazing team, but we’ve played a lot of great teams this year to prepare for this moment,” Foote said. “I think we’re going to go watch video, prepare and be ready to go again.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY2hzYWFub3cuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE2LzVhLWdpcmxzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLWNvbG9yYWRvLWFjYWRlbXktYWR2YW5jZXMtdG8tc3RhdGUtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLWdhbWUuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"game","2006-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 14:00:08","Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40K is the most popular miniature wargame in the world, and its gothic science fiction setting – much more unique than Warhammer Fantasy’s – is greatly responsible for that. Unsurprisingly, it’s also nurtured tons of video games over the decades.  40K models are typically gorgeous, and its tabletop qualities are enticing for anyone willing to learn the ropes, but its universe gradually became attractive on its own as well. In the distant future, a dogmatic human civilization is under siege from all sides, fighting off armies of hostile aliens and terrifying supernatural forces. It’s grand and gritty in equal measure, and despite the many franchises it’s influenced over the years, there’s nothing quite like it.  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Many Warhammer fans are familiar with 40K’s large body of novels, but it was video games that truly started to advance on soon-to-be Warhammer diehards. The medium’s unparalleled interactive possibilities have allowed the IP to flourish in both traditional and unexpected ways. With Warhammer 40K: Boltgun (opens in new tab)'s imminent release, we thought now would be a good time to look back at the best Warhammer 40K games from across the years.  If you’re looking for other specific gaming picks, you might want to check out our list of the best space exploration games or maybe the all-spooky best space horror games list. And, if you want to get into Warhammer 40K but don’t know how to cut down costs, we’ve got you covered with some recommendations on how to save money on Warhammer 40K too. For the Emperor!  10. Warhammer 40K: Darktide  (Image credit: Fatshark)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Fatshark  Warhammer 40K really lends itself to first-person shooters filled with bullets and blood, and we’re surprised Games Workshop hasn’t explored that genre more often, but we’re getting there. Darktide launched only a few months ago, and it’s already caused a strong impression despite an overall lack of polish that’s being fixed as we speak.  The key here is that Fatshark’s natural talent for punchy and brutal combat is all there, brought over from the two Warhammer: Vermintide games they made before. Darktide follows the watertight four-player co-op FPS formula that was popularized by Valve’s Left 4 Dead back in the day, so you know what you’re getting into. Just make sure your PC is up to par or wait for the (delayed) current-gen Xbox release.  9. Space Hulk: Tactics  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One  PC, PS4, Xbox One Developer: Cyanide Studio  2018 brought us a pretty solid adaptation of the tabletop miniatures board game Space Hulk. This is a two-player versus game that distills Warhammer 40K into a cheaper, quicker, and tighter experience set in derelict spaceships and other pieces of space junk floating adrift and run over by Tyranids.  The game features two single-player campaigns, competitive multiplayer, and a skirmish mode. Moreover, it packs an impressive map builder that allows players to cook up and share their own maps. Just be aware that this one is very punishing.  8. Warhammer 40K: Battlesector  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S  PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S Developer: Black Lab Games  Battlesector is another recent 40K game release that flew under the radar. However, both veteran gamers and fans have praised its take on turn-based tactics on a larger scale than usual, which results in a slower-paced and more meditative approach too.  The mission design can often be monotonous, but the moment-to-moment gameplay and the systems gluing everything together work well enough to achieve one of the best digital representations of the miniature wargame around. We’d love to see a bigger and better sequel of this one.  7. Warhammer 40K: Gladius – Relics of War  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, Linux  PC, Linux Developer: Proxy Studios  Gladius – Relics of War mixes Warhammer 40K and 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) systems. On paper this sounds like a match made in heaven and it largely succeeds at doing Sid Meier’s Civilization but 40K. If that sounds attractive, give it a fair shake.  While its older 4X brothers are far more addicting, Gladius’ more fast-paced nature and strong commitment to the 40K universe (diplomacy ain’t an option) make it an oddly relaxing – and unsurprisingly darker – take on a well-trodden formula.  6. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Tindalos Interactive  If you like spaceships (which is likely if you’re an avid reader of our site) and real-time tactics in your games, then Battlefield Gothic: Armada 2 is a safe bet. It adapts the 40K miniature wargame of the same name, and it does so with style.  This one features three narrative campaigns and 12 playable factions, with the option of doing co-op multiplayer as well. Even if you’re not well-versed in the Warhammer 40K universe, anyone into space strategy games should check this one out.  5. Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus  (Image credit: Kasedo Games)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch  PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch Developer: Bulwark Studios  Mechanicus is yet another turn-based video game that follows a very specific faction of the human Imperium. This time around it’s all about the Adeptus Mechanicus, a group of cybernetically enhanced warrior priests. That sounds rad, and we promise that the game is rad too.  It’s also one of the few turn-based 40K titles that stick more closely to the obvious XCOM inspiration, so it might be an easier recommendation for players who are looking for that specific take on tactical battles. On top of the solid gameplay, the flexible customization and notable worldbuilding are highlights.  4. Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters  (Image credit: Frontier Foundry)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Complex Games  Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters was released in 2022, but it’s already become a favorite among fans thanks to its strong focus on the Grey Knights, a chapter of Space Marines composed of psychics whose purpose is the combat and eradication of the daemonic forces of Chaos.  Daemonhunters is a single-player, turn-based strategy game that does way more than just replicating XCOM with Space Marines; it’s largely unforgiving and deceptively deep. The audiovisual presentation is also top notch, making the (at times) seemingly impossible battles a blast to watch play out.  3. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War II  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux  PC, macOS, Linux Developers: Relic Entertainment  Dawn of War diehards never fully embraced Dawn of War II, but it’s still one of the franchise’s finest gaming efforts and deserves its own spot in the list. It can’t be denied that it cemented itself as a sequel that can stand on its own thanks to a heavier focus on RPG elements.  Dawn of War II received two major expansion packs plus a fair amount of DLC that rounded out the experience, eventually nullifying complaints about the removal of the base-building element and the repetition found in some missions of the campaign. If you’ve exhausted the first Dawn of War’s options, give its first sequel a chance. We don’t talk about the third one though.  2. Warhammer 40K: Space Marine  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360  PC, PS3, Xbox 360 Developer: Relic Entertainment  With Space Marine 2 (opens in new tab) slated to release later this year, there’s never been a better time to play (or replay) the 2011 original, especially after the free anniversary upgrade (opens in new tab) it got on PC in 2021.  Even before the announcement of a sequel, Space Marine has always had many fans. This was with good reason as it perfectly represents the brutality of the Space Marines up close and personal through a third-person view and visceral melee and ranged combat. Some of the Imperium’s biggest enemies are featured heavily in this one, and the plot is easy to follow, so it’s a nice entry point for newcomers too.  1. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC  PC Developers: Relic Entertainment  40K fans and real-time strategy veterans alike agree that the original Dawn of War is one of the best PC games ever, period. Relic Entertainment once cracked the code and delivered an all-timer which is both accessible and unique. It perfectly adapts many of the miniature game and its universe’s nuances into a modern classic that nailed both the base-building aspect and the relentless combat across desolate scenarios.  Furthermore, Dawn of War packed spectacular story campaigns, a solid roster of units for all factions, and the option to customize the armies’ colors plus basic aesthetics. And, since it was a massive commercial hit, it received three chunky expansion packs which we 100% recommend. More specifically, the second expansions, Dark Crusade, which still to this day feels like a high point for the RTS genre.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9iZXN0LXdhcmhhbW1lci00MGstZ2FtZXMtb2YtYWxsLXRpbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Dynamo played with 10 men for 57 minutes against the Sounders following a video review of a challenge by forward Amine Bassi. The Dynamo played the final 12 minutes with nine players after midfielder Héctor Herrera received his second yellow card of the match. Seattle scored the game-winning goal in the 87th minute, and Houston closed a three-game home stand with a 1-1-1 record in league and Open Cup play.  Both Bassi and Herrera will miss Wednesday’s game due to a one-game suspension following Saturday’s game. This is the second red card suspension for Herrera, who missed Houston’s last road trip, a 1-1 draw with the New York Red Bulls on April 15. This is the first suspension for Bassi and the first game he will miss since the season opener on Feb. 25. The 25-year-old missed the match against Cincinnati due to injury.  Houston looks to snap a five-game losing streak against the Loons. Minnesota won both matches in 2022 and swept the series in 2021.

"game","2023-09-26","19:05:00","{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:05:00","The Orioles continue to have a pretty darn good record. This is not enough to stop people from getting grumpy after losses like last night’s. I get it. The Grayson Rodriguez outing was a real downer, and added to that, it feels like quite a waste to have scored five runs off of Shohei Ohtani and still lost the game by a grand slam. I hope they can halt the losing before dropping a third straight game.  As is true of every game, the starting pitcher will have a lot to do with the chances of the Orioles winning. That’s Dean Kremer tonight. His last two games have been pretty good, with just one run allowed combined across 12 innings pitched against the Braves and Rays. Those are two great offenses so far this season. Kremer has had some rocky outings this year but we can hope, not unreasonably, that the last couple are a sign he’s heading in a more positive direction.  For another game in a row, the Orioles have made a move to summon fresh bullpen reinforcements. After Rodriguez didn’t go deep into the game last night and a number of relievers needed to be used, they wanted some long relief insurance. That’s turned out to be Cole Irvin, erstwhile starting rotation member, who’s done better with his control after a demotion to Norfolk. I hope he’s not needed, like they didn’t end up needing Drew Rom over the weekend, but it’s good they brought him in case.  Orioles lineup  Cedric Mullins - CF Adley Rutschman - C Anthony Santander - 1B Austin Hays - LF Gunnar Henderson - 3B Adam Frazier - 2B Terrin Vavra - RF Jorge Mateo - SS Ryan O’Hearn - DH  A lot of days I’ve looked at the Orioles lineup this season, I’ve thought to myself, “Is this really the best they can do?” They’ve won a number of those games, so it’s been working out. Still, here’s that reaction again. Vavra in right field, really? If this is going to happen - and this is now the second straight game it has - it is a lot tougher to defend, say, Colton Cowser remaining in Norfolk with his 1.044 OPS.  Also, O’Hearn had a nice spring training but that’s not carrying over into the regular season in the slightest, so, you know. It would be nice to do something different there. Ryan Mountcastle getting a game off is part of why the lineup looks like this, of course.  Angels lineup  Mickey Moniak - RF Mike Trout - CF Shohei Ohtani - DH Taylor Ward - LF Matt Thaiss - C Brandon Drury - 1B Gio Urshela - 3B Luis Rengifo - 2B Zach Neto - SS  The Angels starting pitcher is Chase Silseth, who has pitched in four games this year but yet to make a start. Though Trout and Ohtani are fearsome presences in this lineup, it feels like the Orioles lineup ought to be better than these guys. They weren’t last night, so, you know, hopefully they can change that today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWRlbmNoYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvNS8xNi8yMzcyNTg4NC9vcmlvbGVzLWFuZ2Vscy1nYW1lLXRocmVhZNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWRlbmNoYXQuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMTYvMjM3MjU4ODQvb3Jpb2xlcy1hbmdlbHMtZ2FtZS10aHJlYWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The start of the game was delayed 44 minutes due to lightning in the area.  Jackson Mayo (St. Johns) went 3-for-4 with a home run in the loss for South Florida.  Stetson broke the scoring seal and took a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the third inning. The Hatters added two to their lead with a handful of seeing-eye singles in the top of the fourth for a 3-0 advantage.  The Hatters plated four more runs in the top of the fifth inning to pad their lead to 7-0 and made it a 9-0 affair with two more in the sixth frame.  After being limited to just two hits through the first five innings, USF finally put together a rally to scratch the plate in the bottom of the sixth. Drew Brutcher (Lakeland) walked with one out, and two batters later with two outs, Rafael Betancourt (Deltona) extended the inning with a base hit. John Montes (Toa Alto, Puerto Rico) then drove in Brutcher with an RBI-single.  Travis Sankovich (Uniontown, Pa.) added a run-scoring double by the Bulls in the bottom of the seventh inning.  The Hatters hit back-to-back solo homers in the top of the ninth inning before the Bulls tacked on three runs in the bottom half of the frame.  Mayo tagged a solo home run, Bobby Boser (Wesley Chapel) drilled an RBI-triple to the gap in right-center field, just missing his 16th homer of the year, and Brutcher added a sac fly to chase home Boser and account for the final score.  Notable  Boser extended his hitting streak (11) and on-base streak (15) on Tuesday night.

The game distributor appears to be mulling the idea of a free 90-minute trial, beginning with this popular new remake.  Just below the thumbnail carousel and the “Add to Wishlist” button sits a narrow box titled “Try Dead Space - Free Trial.” From there, it’s clear this is an experimental feature for Steam: The box says you can “Play this title for up to 1 hours” but also that you have “1 hour 30 minutes remaining.” Clicking the “Play Now” button kicks off a full-game download, but once your 90 minutes are up, you must either purchase the game or get out.  Many Steam games offer demos—the Steam Store has an entire section for them. But demos typically contain in-game restrictions rather than time restrictions. You might only get to complete a couple of objectives or explore a small section of the game’s world before being invited to purchase the game. Although this is still a brilliant way to ensure you want a title before committing (an invaluable opportunity, given game prices nowadays), it doesn’t always offer a full picture of what a playthrough experience will look like.  Credit: Adrianna Nine  Steam has toyed with several free trial formulas, offering entire weekends where users could play games like Crusader Kings III for free. Models like this only work for games you’d conceivably play over and over, though; story-driven games like Dead Space aren’t a great fit, as players could complete a full playthrough within that free weekend. From Steam’s perspective, 90 minutes is enough to offer curious users an enticing taste without giving away the whole story.  As of writing, it appears that Dead Space is the only game offering a timed free trial; other major titles lack the box entirely. It could be that Steam is testing the feature before conducting a wider rollout, or Dead Space publisher Electronic Arts just wants people to get into this title.

Most video games of the time were unapologetic about pushing 3D graphics forward, even if it wasn’t a fully realized concept yet. Meanwhile, as a society, we were worried sick about what Y2K might do to our computers while so obsessed with the upcoming millennium that roughly half of all media produced in 1999 had a ‘2000’ at the end of the title. They even gave the guy that made The X-Files some other show based entirely on how fucked up it was that the millennium was approaching. With the notable exception of one child screaming about the Nintendo 64 he’d received as a Christmas gift, we were too focused on the future to enjoy the present.  The irony here is that many of the things society was obsessing over later became a blip on the radar. Y2K was a bust, and as of this writing, none of the three dozen prominent streaming services currently feature Chris Carter’s Millenium (67 episodes across three seasons). Yet we all know GoldenEye, Mario 64, and Knife Edge: Nose Gunner!  Okay, maybe not Knife Edge: Nose Gunner.  The Nintendo 64 is many things to many people, probably more so than other consoles. To some, it was the gateway to a new, fully realized world of possibilities, in-depth adventures, and precision controls. To others, it’s overrated nostalgia, home to lifeless worlds the player often struggled to navigate thanks to that wonky controller and frequent camera issues. As always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. With 296 games released in North America, its library is somewhat scarce compared to other similarly beloved consoles. Yet despite this, a half dozen titles routinely mentioned among the finest in gaming are found in its catalog. Rightfully, these and a handful of others have been discussed throughout the years as variations of “The Best 25 Nintendo 64 Games of All Time” lists permeate the internet.  We here at Hard Drive have never seen a party we didn’t want to invite ourselves to, but we also wanted to shine a light on the games that haven’t been endlessly ranked and re-ranked over the subsequent 25 years. We wanted to pay homage to both the stone-cold classics of the era (meaning the wrestling games with Steve Austin on the cover) and the outliers, the dubious games given as well-intentioned gifts by aunts and stepparents. These ghastly licensed titles and inexplicable originals often shaped our collective gaming experiences as much as anything else. And even if we say some pretty mean things, we just really love video games, man. It beats talking about anything else.  So here you go; all 296 North American Nintendo 64 games ranked and reviewed, as well as way too many references to our fathers, video stores, and 9/11. We hope you enjoy reading it — it’s the biggest thing we’ve ever done (not that it will impress our dads).  — Mark Roebuck  List by: Chris Colman, Patrick Crooks, John Danek, Chandler Dean, Kyle Duggan, Seth Finkelstein, Luca Fisher, Ryan Fleishman, Jeremy Kaplowitz, Michael Katz, James Knapp, Naomi Krause, Walker MacDonald, Ashley Oh, Kevin Podas, Gabe Porter, William Quant, Mark Roebuck, Matt Saincome, Joe Tilleli, Brad Waters, Thomas Wilde, and a guy who is stuck in a hole.

Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker    December 13, 2000  Kemco  Ubisoft  $65.99 on Amazon  A devastatingly bad brawler that’s as devoid of redeeming qualities as Bruce Wayne is parents. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker suffers from lightning quick animations that make it seem like Terry Batman is moving faster than the camera can keep up with, which is frustrating but also kind of hilarious. Batman’s move set mostly consists of kicking and punching, and several strikes can be strung together to form “combos” in the way that eating a bowl of barbecue sauce at 6:30 PM could loosely be considered “eating supper.” The game consists of five levels, and the score consists of five notes. The cinematics in between levels literally go by too fast to keep up with, which is probably a good thing, as I’m assuming this game’s story is as insulting as every other aspect of it. One of my favorite examples is that level two, Wayne Enterprises Building, is the exact same as level one, The Gotham Air & Space Museum, except the hallways have potted plants in them now. On the bright side, it’s all over in about an hour. It’s fucked up that this is the only Batman game they made for the Nintendo 64, because it really sucks. — Mark Roebuck  #295. Carmageddon 64  July 26, 2000  Stainless Games/Software Creations  Titus Interactive  $124.99 on Amazon  Somewhere, someone is going through an actual car crash, doomed to have to go through physical therapy for the next two years as a result of their injuries to have some semblance of their full range of motion back, on top of an unholy amount of medical debt. And that person would still be having more fun than me playing this abomination of a racing game. I was hoping that this game’s infamy was some kind of hyperbole; that perhaps people were harsher on it in its time and that modern days may have actually vindicated it like some of these other old games we played. But no. This one is just as dreadful as everyone says it is.  Besides creeping to the framerate of a slideshow on basically every turn, nothing works the way it’s supposed to and it all just feels like ass. The worst part is there’s no point to any of it! The game presents itself as some kind of apocalyptic race where you must ‘race or die’ as the opening narration spells out, but your only objective is to complete the race. No other racer is competing against you and yet you’re prompted to kill all other drivers you see. Also, there’s zombies everywhere as some sort of alternate win condition that is impossible to complete. And if I don’t want to destroy or maim anything in your apocalyptic demolition derby race, then what’s the point of it all? — William Quant  #294. Superman: The New Superman Adventures  May 31, 1999  Titus Interactive  $25.49 on Amazon  Look, you don’t need me to tell you this game sucks. We all know it sucks. It’s not even the developer’s fault that it sucks (the licensing team at WB hated the devs and tried to make them turn this into a SimCity clone). The controls suck. The gameplay sucks. The graphics suck. You don’t really do Superman things, you just do minigames all day with extremely strict time limits. Did you know you get to fight Darkseid in this game? He’s in a hallway. They’re all in hallways in this game! You know what? That’s enough. I’m going to spend the rest of this review begging someone, anyone, to make a Superman game. I don’t want to hear anything about how he’s too powerful and no one can hurt him. Figure it out! Have him fight Titano, the giant robot ape. Hey, and while we’re at it, let’s make another Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. You can make car boxing gloves in that. Man, what a fun game that was. — Seth Finkelstein  #293: B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S.    May 19, 1998  Midway  B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. is a travesty. This fighting game is set in Neo Amerika, where escalating tech overlords have caused the nation to break down in the Techno-Industrial Civil War (great naming convention, really nailed it). Every character is a variant of unholy cyborg abomination named something like KillFucker because of how much they like Killing and Fucking. Honestly, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. would be a The Room­, ­so-bad-it’s-good type game if the name of the flagship character on the cover wasn’t a racial slur used as a play on words (he has an actual zipper on his head, so funny). This checks out since the game as a whole feels targeted towards your dipshit cousin that still says the f-slur.  In terms of actual gameplay, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. characters control like a Walmart mobility scooter. The game is comically unbalanced, mainly due to a shield mechanic that makes characters invulnerable by removing all the textures on their already-ugly polygons. The game also blatantly cheats by reading your inputs so the computer enemies can easily beat all your attacks, which is why you can find multiple videos of content creators hopelessly trying to beat the BS final boss of Arcade Mode. The next time you want to complain about modern fighting games, pop in B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. and thank god you’re getting another Street Fighter sequel instead of this roadkill. — Ryan Fleishman  #292. Monster Truck Madness 64  August 31, 1996  Terminal Reality  Microsoft  $37.99 on Amazon  Monster Truck Madness 64, Rockstar’s third release, long before they created Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, opens with a caffeine-addled announcer screaming “ARE YOU READY?!” followed by a dick-crushing industrial metal track, so it’s clearly among the best games ever conceived. But alas, no amount of personality and testosterone can compensate for messy gameplay.  MTM 64 is both slippery and heavy, like trying to deadlift a sea lion. Or, in this case, like trying to push a monster truck with tires made of butter across a track made of soap. One must imagine their opponents laughing as their truck keels over into the mud on its side, a metaphor for life’s inevitable cruelty.  There is also a distinct lack of car-crushing — a crushing disappointment in its own right. Battering fences and tombstones is fun, but it doesn’t compare to the raw, primal thrill of man-hicular vehicle-slaughter that monster trucks bring to mind. And unlike the game’s trucks and corny announcer, the environments are almost entirely devoid of personality and largely identical to one another. Even the stage called DEATH TRAP was pretty nonlethal. I was expecting both DEATH and a host of booby TRAPs, or perhaps wild bears for flavor, but found neither.  Like Sisyphus making sweet love to the boulder that binds him in eternal punishment, I mindlessly chased an ever-returning ball (or puck) in the identical Soccer and Hockey minigames. Through all of it, the emcee’s commentary helped me to stay strong — he was there for me in each of these miserable game modes, even as I slipped all over the place and ate the dirt. My fondest memory of this game will be the exact moment I hurtled into an enemy vehicle in Summit Rumble, prompting the emcee, my only friend in this wasteland, to shout “Hell hath no fury like a monster truck scorned!” — Luca Fisher  #291. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie    November 8, 2000  Avalanche Software  THQ  $21.24 on Amazon  Rugrats in Paris is a beautiful kids movie that made me confront the grief of what it’s like to have lost a parent and learn how to welcome new familial love into your life. The video game adaptation of the film explores different thesis surrounding how I wish everyone around me was dead. It opens with selecting your favorite baby and then lets you explore its theme park overworld in a manner not unlike pushing a stroller without wheels. They seriously gave these babies tank controls. They cannot turn. The babies can only move forward, leaning slightly toward one direction or the other, and require stopping to turn and walk backwards at a crawl. If the dev’s goal was for me to re-experience learning to walk for the first time, well then I guess they succeeded.  The gameplay is structured as a series of carnival minigames so you can win enough tickets to buy the helmet that controls Reptar—then fight his arch-nemesis, RoboSnail. I never got to RoboSnail. These minigames range from a clunky ‘hit the targets with a baseball’ game where the hitboxes are incomprehensible to an almost-serviceable minigolf course that would maybe work if you didn’t have to run your baby from your previous stroke to the next with the same overworld tank controls that make me feel glad the vibrant orange and greens of Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, have been painted over beige and its presence erased from the earth. — Joe Tilleli  #290. Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.    December 9, 1999  Acclaim Studios London  Acclaim  $26.99 on Amazon  When I began Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M., I was greeted with a cheesy B-movie style plot of alien invaders. I thought it would be good for a few laughs. Unfortunately, the game ended up laughing at me. I couldn’t move for the first few minutes of gameplay, only to learn that you move with the C-buttons, which is just as confusing and difficult as you’d imagine. Also, you cannot see anything in this game. You just keep barreling headfirst into darkness, hoping that the horrible bug enemies that you are unable to aim at for more than a second aren’t about to kill you. The worst part, however, is when you finish a level, only to be told you didn’t do one of the obtuse missions, leading to an instant game over and you needing to redo everything. And I still am completely lost as to what the fuck an Armorine is. — Gabe Porter  #289. NBA In The Zone ‘98    February 16, 1998  Konami  $22.49 on Amazon  This is one of those games where the graphics aren’t so much ‘weird but forgivable demonstration of growing pains in three dimensional graphics’ as they are ‘vaguely humanoid creatures made up of uneven shoulders and blurry textures who’s every movement and action invoke unease and terror.’ Nothing about this game looks, sounds, or feels good. Factor that in with weird features like the ability to trade players in the pre-game setup menu (I think these guys are dressed for the game already, fellas) and omissions like the ability to call plays, you have the worst basketball game on the Nintendo 64. Anyone that’s played Fox Sports College Hoops ‘99 knows I’m talking mad shit right now. — M. Roebuck  #288: South Park Rally    January 5, 2000  Tantalus Interactive  Acclaim Entertainment  $99.99 on Amazon  I wanted to go to bat for this game. I consistently saw it toward the top of every ‘Worst N64 Games’ list—and that puzzled me. I thought, “Shouldn’t even a middling kart racer be worth playing if it means I get to enjoy some irreverent South Park vibes in the process? Shouldn’t the fun of PLAYABLE CHEF alone be enough to get this thing to a 6/10!?”  And sure enough, when I started navigating the menu—with fart noises accompanying my every click—I had reason to hope. Between a full 3D rendition of the iconic theme song (complete with obligatory Kenny death) and a surprisingly wide array of playable characters, I dared to ask myself: for Acclaim Entertainment’s South Park games, could the third time have been the charm?  Then I started playing it. And I came to realize that in other racing games, we often fail to appreciate how wonderful it is to know where you are supposed to be going and how you are supposed to get there. Instead of simply circling around a set path, South Park Rally is one of very few racing games to embrace FromSoftware-style open world hostility; you’re free to go wherever you want, but you’re fucked if you don’t take one highly specific route. Other things we’ve taken for granted? Controls that work, sound that’s audible, AI that’s beatable, and most of all: a game that’s playable. South Park Rally succeeds only as an exercise in cynicism. Acclaim took this beloved franchise, chopped it up, fed it to us, and licked up our tears. Jesus Christ, dude. — Chandler Dean  #287. Deadly Arts    September 29, 1998  Konami  $64.99 on Amazon  Deadly Arts may be the most authentic fighting game ever created, given how its shit show mechanics force it to so closely match the pace of most fights that occur in real life.  I started working on this review by inviting over my unemployed friend Tad, and we drank fourteen Michelob Ultras each to prepare. As the first round of martial combat began, we were amped and ready to have at it. We smack-talked and boasted about how badly we were going to beat one another. At one point we just straight up started spitting at each other. Then, some time later, the first awkward punch finally landed thanks to the absolutely appalling frame rate in the game. It was at this time that Tad threw down his controller and quit, no longer wanting to be a part of this painful and pointless exercise. I’d rather go watch the fights outside of Shady McGrady’s at 2 AM on a Sunday. — James Knapp  #286. ECW Hardcore Revolution    February 17, 2000  Acclaim  $40 on Amazon  Since some Hard Drive readers might not be wrestling fans, let me spin you a yarn. In the same year this game came out, ECW – which stood for Extreme Championship Wrestling and was famed for their no holds barred, car crash style of wrestling – put on a Pay-Pew-View show called Living Dangerously that was also sponsored by Acclaim and this very game. At this event, a wrestler named New Jack, famous for being an absolute legitimate psychopath, dragged another wrestler to the top of a scaffolding to perform an unplanned stunt that resulted in them both crashing 20 feet unprotected onto a concrete arena floor. They both survived, but not without injuries and for New Jack, not without losing a fuckton of vision in one eye. Watching this horrific accident unfold was still a more enjoyable experience than playing ECW Hardcore Revolution. — W.

"game","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:05:00","Humanity was inspired by a throng of bodies. Specifically, the mass of people queueing for Comiket, the longstanding comic and pop culture convention in Tokyo. As its director Yugo Nakamura explains over a video call from the city, he was intrigued by the “orderly manner” in which these people were milling about. “We have our soul and mind,” he says, “but it was almost like they were moving without thinking.” The challenge the designer set himself and his colleagues at the award-winning Japanese studio tha ltd. was to simulate this gently surging crowd, the ebb and flow of the collective.  Yugo Nakamura  The resulting puzzle game does something unusual for the genre. Yes, it stretches your grey matter in ways that will make you feel like an idiot and then a genius, but its hundreds, sometimes thousands of people moving in unison are capable of stirring up surprising emotions: delight, awe, even fear. The setup is simple: direct an endlessly spawning mass of people towards the light in a series of self-contained levels. The execution is anything but: a luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader, scampering about brutalist architecture suspended high in the clouds. You are given the ability to manipulate the group in different ways with commands such as turn, jump, and branch, which siphons the roving mob into two. When it goes right, Humanity is the stuff of dreams; one wrong instruction, however, and the game turns into a Freudian nightmare, its mass of figures tumbling into an infinite abyss.  This strange, compulsive game is the product of a collaboration between tha and Enhance, the video game studio founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, celebrated designer of 2001’s Rez (another game inspired by heaving bodies) and 2019’s Tetris Effect. Mizuguchi, who simply goes by “Miz” to most people who know him, first saw Humanity in 2017 while sitting on a judging panel at a Unity showcase in Tokyo, back when it was still just a tech demo. It grabbed of his attention and then wouldn’t let it go, inspiring a series of searching questions. “Where is this going? What is this trying to get to?” he recalls asking himself, over a video call from his Tokyo office. Six years on, the game elements of Humanity have been fleshed out, but its confusing emotional impact hasn’t changed. “Even today, when I see what we’ve come up with, it’s quite shocking visually,” he says.  A luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Six years is a long time to spend making any kind of video game, let alone a puzzle game (for comparison, that’s how long the new open-world behemoth Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom took to produce). Nakamura admits sculpting the crystalline idea into a meaningful interactive experience was a fraught process. There was a loss in direction, a stutter in development: “To be quite honest … I didn’t even want to show up to work,” Nakamura says. Then Enhance stepped in to offer direction – how to make Humanity “interesting, fun, and entertaining to play”.  Tetsuya Mizuguchi  Mizuguchi is modest about his studio’s input, casually describing it as “helping out with level design”. Like some of the very best puzzle games in recent memory, Humanity gradually ratchets up its complexity. You navigate levels filled with inky blocks that can be pushed around, fans that suspend your minions in mid-air and then, later in the game, grey-skinned figures dressed in black called “the others”. A boldly metaphorical narrative unfolds alongside this symbolic gameplay. During one set of levels collectively titled Fate, there’s no way to alter the path of your followers once they’ve started moving, forcing you to think 10, 15, sometimes even 20 moves ahead. During these puzzles, humankind’s course is preordained.  That said, Humanity is more often than not a game of improvisation and creativity, not least for players who choose to take advantage of the game’s in-built level creator. As producer Mark Macdonald explains, this also contributed to the protracted development, a feature requiring not only the development of easy-to-use tools but an entire network within which fan-made levels could be hosted, shared, and rated. “It’s kind of like creating Netflix and Twitter at the same time,” says Macdonald. During the game’s demo period in March, inventive players made levels based on the recent hit Vampire Survivors, stealth classic Metal Gear Solid, and even baseball, ideas the development team would never have conceived – in other words, “exactly what you’re hoping to see”, he says.  Creating levels is as much of a puzzle as those found in the actual game. Both tickle parts of the brain that enjoy tinkering and experimentation – seeing computer software come alive thanks to human input. As such, Nakamura sees Humanity as an extension of the web design work that made his name in the late 1990s – then cutting-edge sites like MONO*craft, which took advantage of the era’s nascent Flash software. He speaks of the user coming into “touch” with a site, a “reaction”, and this generating an “aha moment”. Of course, websites tend to occupy their users’ attention for only a few minutes; video games have to sustain a player’s attention for many hours. This proved to be one of the biggest challenges for Nakamura. “I would feel that maybe [we had] enough to satisfy the user,” he says. “But I didn’t know what the upper limit was.”  Ebb and flow of the collective … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Nakamura has used the medium’s length to produce a game that is both playful and profound, evoking two works that could scarcely be more different. On the one hand, Lemmings, the seminal 1991 puzzle game that sees you leading strange tiny humanoid figures through underground environments; on the other, Godfrey Reggio’s 1982 masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi, a cinematic tone poem that casts a panoramic, God-like gaze over humanity and its increasingly fractious relationship with Earth. Reggio’s film eludes a single straightforward interpretation, and Humanity will likely inspire similar existential musings.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Free weekly newsletter Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He recalls watching US coverage of the accompanying public unrest and demonstrations while working in Japan, “unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my lifetime”, he says. “Then I’m seeing these giant crowds of people [in the game] flowing, interacting, sometimes competing and fighting, and it’s surreal.”  Nakamura, meanwhile, speaks philosophically of social media and the ways in which it has distorted our perspective before zeroing in on a single question: “Why do things happen when suddenly we’re part of a crowd, part of a larger society, or part of a larger community?” In the surreal, visual story he has crafted – one that only a video game could tell – a dog leads a pack of humans who have “lost their sense of direction, and maybe even hope”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2FtZXMvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTYvbGVtbWluZ3MtbWVldHMta295YWFuaXNxYXRzaS1odW1hbml0eS10aGUtZHJlYW0tbGlrZS1wdXp6bGUtZ2FtZS10aGF0LWluc3BpcmVzLWRlbGlnaHQtYW5kLXVuZWFzZdIBjwFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2FtZXMvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTYvbGVtbWluZ3MtbWVldHMta295YWFuaXNxYXRzaS1odW1hbml0eS10aGUtZHJlYW0tbGlrZS1wdXp6bGUtZ2FtZS10aGF0LWluc3BpcmVzLWRlbGlnaHQtYW5kLXVuZWFzZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pomona, N.Y. – (May 16, 2023) – The Fordham Rams and Manhattan Jaspers have exchanged pleasantries on the baseball diamond for over 150 years, dating back to 1870, and have never played a game beyond 12 innings.

"game","2019-10-05","15:00:00","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:21:48","Overwatch 2’s long-awaited hero missions PvE mode is no more. In a developer livestream, game director Aaron Keller said that the team is canceling the game’s PvE-based hero missions in favor of continuing on with seasonal, story-focused events.  When Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2, the developers teased that the game would have two PvE campaign modes adjacent to its traditional competitive modes.  In the presentation announcing Overwatch 2 during Blizzcon 2019, former game director Jeff Kaplan spoke of hero missions and story missions that encompassed the game’s PvE elements and drove the game’s narrative. Story missions would be like the story-focused events the original Overwatch already had. Players would group up and fight against AI-controlled enemies instead of teams of other players. These kinds of missions would either cover Overwatch 2’s overall story the way Uprising, Retribution, and Storm Rising dug into events in original Overwatch or be fantastical side stories outside Overwatch canon like the Halloween event Junkenstein’s Revenge. These story missions would also be seasonal, rotating out every few months.  Hero missions, however, were presented as this always-available, always-replayable mode that featured talent trees that would grant different buffs to heroes, giving this part of the game more RPG-like qualities.  But as Overwatch 2 suffered from delays and development issues, Blizzard announced that hero mode (known then as simply PvE mode) would not launch with the game and come at a later date. In today’s developer livestream, it seems that the hero mode version of Overwatch 2 PvE is being shuttered due to development constraints and shifted priorities.  “With everything we’ve learned about what it takes to operate this game,” said executive producer Jared Neuss. “It’s clear that we can’t deliver on that original vision for PvE that was shown in 2019.”  After Overwatch 2 was announced, the game entered a kind of “dead zone” where no new content was being released save skins and rehashed holiday events. Even though a new game was forthcoming, players started disengaging from original Overwatch. Ahead of the game’s release in 2022, Keller put out a video promising a steady cadence of releases and new content so players would never again have to wait years between new heroes or events.  In an interview with GameSpot, Neuss and Keller went into detail about the reasons for hero modes’ cancellation, talking about how it would’ve taken pulling developers off the live game in order to create hero mission PvE as it was originally conceived and how that wouldn’t square with the team’s commitment to keeping the game fresh and exciting.  In reality, what we were looking at was running two separate games at the same time with a set of heroes as the piece that is shared between two of them. And as we started to get further and further into it — obviously our players could realize that we were pulling focus away from the live game — but it just didn’t look like there was a definitive end date in sight where we would finally be able to put that stamp on [it], or that end date was years away and it no longer felt like we could be doing that to our players, or we could be doing that to the live game that we were running. And that’s when we took the moment to shift strategy and put everything into the live game.  Losing hero missions is a big bummer, but Overwatch 2 PvE isn’t totally gone. Story missions have been traditional events within both games, and the developers shared that Overwatch 2’s first big story event is coming in season 6.

Log on to Minecraft clone OPCraft and—through the magic of decentralized cryptography—experience true gaming freedom.  The pixelated world closely resembles its role model both in aesthetics and gameplay. As in Minecraft, the environment that OPCraft players explore is made up of blocks, which players can move, destroy, and combine to produce new materials.  OPCraft was built by crypto devotees who disdain the format of the most popular crypto games, which generally take conventional game designs and add a cryptocurrency element on top, often centered on making money exchanged as digital currency or NFTs.  The creators of OPCraft are trying to establish a new genre of games shaped more fundamentally by blockchains. Their rules and core mechanisms are encoded into smart contracts—software applications that encode an agreement—linked to the Ethereum blockchain. The game, which debuted in October for a two-week test period, is meant to demonstrate a vision its developers call an autonomous world—a digital space owned and controlled not by a single, centralized entity but by a decentralized network of people interacting with a blockchain.  OPCraft is not the first on-chain game, and dozens more are in the works, setting out to build gaming worlds their creators describe as “sovereign” or “eternal.” At a time when the games industry is more lucrative and corporate than ever, these projects are trying to show that it’s possible to rethink some long-established patterns—like the fact that a game’s code typically lives on a privately owned server and can be changed or removed on a whim by its owners.  The challenge now for these crypto idealists is to build games that demonstrate and prove out those ideals. If they can do that, they might change the conventional wisdom about what blockchains can do, too, by showing that they’re useful for more than just cryptocurrency and NFTs.  In-game screenshot of OPCraft. Courtesy of Lattice Labs Ltd.  On-Chain Game Theory  Justin Glibert, cofounder of the blockchain research nonprofit 0xPARC, is quick to acknowledge that the idea of online games offering a new canvas for self-expression might not sound very new. But he argues that the freedom offered by conventional games is partly an illusion.  Players of the 20-year-old space-themed game Eve Online, like devotees of other online multiplayer games, invest huge amounts of time and energy into their play, creating and running sophisticated organizations and maintaining genuine relationships. Players feel like they’re free to shape their own destiny inside the game. But Glibert says that freedom can in fact be yanked away at any moment by CCP Games, Eve’s owner.  “They believe that CCP is not running the game world,” when in fact it retains total control, says Glibert, who runs a division of 0xPARC called Lattice that builds on-chain games. He says that games built on blockchains can be designed to prevent any one entity from controlling a world’s fate, while also offering new freedom for users to customize and expand on a game’s design.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hdXRvbm9tb3VzLXdvcmxkcy1haW0tdG8tZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtZXMtZnJvbS1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:59:56","DENVER — A collective sigh of relief wafted through Ball Arena, as fans flooded the exit stairways celebrating the Nuggets’ survival of Tuesday’s 132-126 thriller over the Lakers in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals.  “We are up 1-0, so that beats the alternative,” said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. “We protected our home court, and wins are hard to come by this time of the season.”  Nikola Jokic certainly eased the burden in logging his third consecutive triple-double of the playoffs — 34 points, 21 rebounds, 14 assists — and sixth of the club’s current run. In doing so, Jokic ties Magic Johnson (1982) and Draymond Green (2019) for the second-most triple-doubles in a single postseason. The Nuggets’ center now ranks as the only player in NBA history to tally multiple 30-point, 20-rebound triple-doubles (Hall of Famers such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar accomplished that only once).  Jokic did it through relentless aggression from the onset, pouring in 19 points with 16 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks during a first half in which Denver stacked an 18-point lead. The big man now ranks as just the second NBA player to produce 15-plus points and 15-plus rebounds in the first half of a playoff game (Tim Duncan scored 22 points with 16 rebounds against the Lakers in the 2002 West semis).  “It’s a playoff, we need to be aggressive,” Jokic said. “We need to win the game, especially in front of our home crowd because [the Lakers] won two Game 1s [on the road]. Being aggressive, it’s normal right now.”  It also proved crucial toward building a little cushion for a fourth-quarter drought during which Jokic didn’t make a single field goal, as the Lakers closed to 124-121 on an Austin Reaves 3-pointer with 3:23 left to play. Los Angeles’ lone lead of the night (2-0) came on a LeBron James drive to the bucket to start the game, but the Lakers climbed uphill the rest of the way, closing strong with 72 points over the third and fourth quarters.  Here are five quick takeaways from Tuesday’s Game 2:  1. Battle of the bigs  Jokic receives the nod here for his Game 1 performance in arguably the most compelling, and likely decisive, matchup of this entire series. Anthony Davis scored a game-high 40 points (his third career 40-point postseason showing), but the Nuggets’ big man asserted most of the force early in gobbling up 12 rebounds to the visiting team’s total of four in the opening frame, as Denver stormed to a 16-point lead on the strength of a combined 16 points from the two-time Kia MVP and Aaron Gordon. Denver outscored the visiting Lakers 18-12 in the paint in the first quarter, connecting on 50% (9-for-18) from that area, as Jokic set an early tone of physicality that the visitors wouldn’t match until late in the contest.  Keep in mind, the Nuggets entered Game 1 having taken 53% of their shots up to that point from the paint, which ranked as the highest rate for any team in the playoffs, and they connected on 57.2%. It’s also worth noting Los Angeles marched into the conference finals limiting teams to 50.9% shooting from the paint (second lowest in the NBA), and that mark fell to 47.9% with Davis on the court.  Apparently, Jokic wasn’t aware or didn’t care about the latter in the first half because the 28-year-old made it a point to aggressively attack his Lakers counterpart. Jokic smashed the gas on multiple powerful drives resulting in two dunks in the first half, even surprising Davis on a couple by taking him off the bounce.  “On his first post-up, they double-teamed,” Malone said. “They were sending an extra body at him early on. We had a great example we showed at halftime where they double-teamed him, [Kentavious Caldwell-Pope] cut to the basket and got a layup. Then, they started guarding him 1-on-1. When he felt there was 1-on-1 coverage, [he was] facing up, getting to the basket, and using that understated athleticism to finish in traffic. That was great to see.”  The diversity of Jokic’s attack in the first half left Davis guessing in trying to anticipate the Denver center’s next move, and that likely played a role in the 28-year old running up a near triple-double over the first two quarters.  That’s a win for the home team.  “I don’t think you can shut any one aspect of his game down and expect to be OK,” said Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “You just have to come in and have a great initial defender on him and the other four guys being ready to pitch in and just do their job, and again, being early to your spots, because if you have to play catch-up they’ll kill you every time.”  Despite Denver’s fast start, Malone pointed out the team’s lapses in the second half. The Nuggets outscored the visitors 30-24 in the paint in the first half and 16-8 in second-chance points over that span, while outrebounding the Lakers 36-13. The second half told a different story with the Lakers authoring leads in rebounding (17-11), points in the paint (24-20) and second-chance points (5-2).  “We were kind of imposing our will on the glass [in the first half], but that’s got to be for four quarters,” Malone said. “It just can’t be for a half.”  2. Key 2nd-half adjustment  Los Angeles threw multiple looks at Jokic throughout the first half with little success as the Nuggets center carved up the Lakers over the first two quarters, before finishing the night with 34 points on 12-for-17 shooting with 21 rebounds, 14 assists and two blocks. But Ham tossed out an adjustment late in Game 1 that Jokic and the Nuggets should count on seeing again throughout this series.  After Jokic poured in 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting with five assists in the third quarter, Ham deployed Rui Hachimura as a primary defender on the Nuggets center, while letting Davis roam the paint freely to help on Jokic drives.  “Something that we just went to, a little adjustment,” Davis said. “We did end up liking it.”  In a fourth quarter in which Los Angeles pulled to within three points, the Lakers limited Jokic to 0-for-2 from the field as Jamal Murray closed out the game. Murray scored eight points in the fourth quarter, finishing with 31 (on 12-for-20 shooting).  “They definitely had us on our heels,” Malone said. “They became the aggressor and turned the tide in this game with how aggressive they were playing. Late in the game, they put Rui on Nikola and they were just [using] Anthony Davis [like a free safety] letting him man the paint and make it look really crowded. Our execution can be better. But we made enough big plays down the stretch on both ends of the floor to win the game.”  3. Fast road start foiled  The Lakers stole victories in their first road game of the previous two playoff series, averaging 122.5 points in those outings before dropping the other four games averaging 99.5 points. Denver prevented Los Angeles from snatching Game 1 in large part due to aggressive starts from Jokic and Murray, who shot 7-for-11 in the first half (17 points), as the Nuggets build an 18-point halftime lead.  Denver won its seventh straight at Ball Arena in the playoffs, the team’s longest home win streak to start a postseason.  “We have not lost a home game in the playoffs,” Malone said. “They haven’t lost a home game in the playoffs. We told our team that they went to Memphis, went to Golden State and won Game 1 [in] both of those series and wrestled home-court advantage from both of those teams. But for us, it’s maintaining the same course that we’re on, the same mindset and going out there and doing our jobs to the best of our ability.”  4. Denver hits most of main targets  Phoenix ran roughshod over Denver in transition for a couple games in the Western Conference semifinals, and Los Angeles features one of the league’s most devastating bigs in Davis, who leads a Lakers squad that practically lived on the free-throw line in the regular season (26.6 attempts per game). So, naturally, Malone emphasized holding down the Lakers in transition, keeping them off the line, and controlling the paint in the team’s prep work heading into the conference finals.  Denver delivered on a few its objectives to start this series. The Nuggets outscored Los Angeles 19-13 in transition (17 of those points came in the first half), and pounded the Lakers 47-30 on the glass, but finished with a plus-two edge in paint scoring (50-48) while failing to keep the visitors off the free-throw line. Los Angeles averaged 29 attempts from the free-throw line in the Western Conference semifinals and finished that series with a plus-66 advantage in free throws made. The Lakers ended Game 1 with a plus-four edge in free-throw attempts (26-22) and drained 88.5%.  5. Top O vs. Top D  Something’s got to give here, and in Game 1, Denver struck first in flexing the power of its electric offense against Los Angeles’ stingy defense. The Nuggets scored 118.7 points per 100 possessions through the first two rounds of the playoffs, which ranked No. 1 in the NBA going into the West Finals. The Lakers surrendered just 106.5 points per 100 possessions over that same span, good for the NBA’s best defensive efficiency in the playoffs, as they held Memphis and Golden State to 42.2% shooting over 12 contests.  Denver’s 132 points in Game 1 registered as the most it has scored this postseason, and the club’s 106 points through the first three frames set a franchise record for the most points through three quarters. The Nuggets top three scorers in Jokic, Murray and Caldwell-Pope combined for 86 points, while the Lakers’ high-scoring trio of James, Davis and Reaves came together for 89 points. In all, Denver featured six double-figures scorers, compared to four for Los Angeles.  Game 1 marked just the 12th time in Denver franchise history that two Nuggets scored 30 points or more in the same contest.  * * *","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy81LXRha2Vhd2F5cy1mcm9tLW51Z2dldHMtZ2FtZS0xLXZpY3Rvcnktb3Zlci1sYWtlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Banff"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:48:16","In the past month, developers of three major video games have announced special modes designed to help people with specific phobias play their games.  Why it matters: It’s an expansion of an industrywide push to make games more accessible, offering the audience options that wouldn’t be as feasible in other forms of entertainment.  Details: The new settings address fear of spiders or being underwater.  In April, Sony PlayStation hit Horizon Forbidden West was updated to include a thalassophobia mode for players with fears tied to deep water. Turning on that option keeps the protagonist from running out of air while swimming below the surface and adds pulsing and glowing effects to the game’s underwater environment.  Near the end of April, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, from Electronic Arts, launched with an “arachnophobia safe mode” that changes the look of one monstrous creature, hiding its stingers and altering other details to make it look less spider-like.  In early May, Warner Bros. Games’ Hogwarts Legacy (the year’s best-selling console game so far) also added an arachnophobia mode.  Be smart: Developers behind these modes consider them a necessary matter of accessibility, no different from letting players who are colorblind select an option to change how colors appear in the game.  Options around phobias first prominently appeared in 2020, when Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian Entertainment introduced an arachnophobia mode for Grounded, their survival game about shrunken teens trapped in a backyard.  What they’re saying: “We realized that our game features spiders very prominently, and they're very large,” Brian MacIntosh, a programmer at Obsidian, tells Axios. “That could definitely be an issue for some people, so it seemed like something we had to do something about.”  Developers at the studio had also taken note of 2019 indie game Satisfactory, which had a fear option that switched out its spiders for cats.  As they made Grounded, the studio worked with a Microsoft research team to understand how to alleviate phobic player’s fears. They created a “safe mode” slider that alters the game’s spiders gradually, first by removing arms and fangs, all the way to “what we call the danger dumpling,” MacIntosh says. “It's a couple of blobs with eyes on it.”  The goal “was not to just make the spiders not scary.” Rather, “the goal was to provide a mode where someone who's phobic, who has this sort of irrational, very heightened fear of spiders, to bring their fear level down to what someone who's not phobic might experience.”  Between the lines: The phobia options that made Grounded an outlier three years ago have become a trend as accessibility efforts gain more support from project to project.  EA’s Star Wars team at Respawn Entertainment started making their arachnophobia mode about a year ago, members of the team tell Axios, after a developer on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor became unable to work on a key level because of the spider-like design of one creature.  Less polished versions of the creature earlier in development hadn’t triggered the developer’s phobia.  It was too late to change the creature’s design, so, instead, an accessibility working group cooked up a solution: an optional, alternate look for the beast using a trick to obscure its stingers.  At PlayStation studio Guerilla Games, developers had heard from players who viewed the 2020 debut trailer for then-upcoming Horizon Forbidden West.  “Our community team received messages from fans who expressed that they were worried they would not be able to enjoy these sections because of severe fear of deep water,” Joshua van Gageldonk, the game’s project QA lead, tells Axios.  Implementing an alternate thalassophobia setting involved “a ton of different people from all kinds of disciplines on the development side,” to ensure the optional mode didn’t break the game. For example, the audio team had to ensure that the game never triggered choking sounds or drowning animations for its hero as she swam underwater.  State of play: Developers working on these modes say they’re comfortable letting players tweak the content to overcome a phobia.  “That’s something that people value across the team, across all disciplines, to be able to create that accessible game for players [who] otherwise wouldn't have been able to complete the story and experience the journey,” Respawn development director Jonas Lundqvist tells Axios.  “I think it’s incredible that games are opening up more and more to different people,” PlayStation’s van Gageldonk says. “We’re all different, and it’s great if we can customize games to just how we like them.”  What’s next: With each new phobia mode introduced into a game, more are likely to follow, according to Respawn technical designer Michel Wong, who worked on Jedi: Survivor’s arachnophobia mode.  “Having a greater body of work to draw from is beneficial for everyone.”  Among other things, Michel says, they serve as proof, for peers and for their bosses, “to sort of make the case for why it's important and how it would work.”  Sign up for the Axios Gaming newsletter here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE1L3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLXBob2JpYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Otherwise those are teams they only see once every four years, barring a Super Bowl bout.  It’s a thread we should keep chasing. Adding another regular season game shouldn’t mean a random matchup.

WASHINGTON -- — Joey Meneses drove in four runs as part of a four-hit day, CJ Abrams homered and the Washington Nationals defeated the New York Mets 10-3 on Monday to split a four-game series.  New York has lost nine of its last 13 and dropped 15 of 21 since its 14-7 start. The Mets are 0-5-2 in their last seven series and have not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from April 19-21. Big-spending New York fell to fourth in the NL East, 1 1/2 games ahead of last-place Washington.  “A lot of times you know what the problem is and you’re just trying to figure out ways to fix it,” Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. “That’s what makes this sport difficult. I don’t really know. There’s probably a number of things you can point at.”  Patrick Corbin (2-5) earned his first home victory since last Aug. 28, surrendering two runs and eight hits over six innings.  The rebuilding Nationals, who scored in each inning they batted except the second, improved to 17-17 since losing five of their first six games.  “Let’s forget about the first week of the season,"" Washington manager Dave Martinez said. ""We’ve been playing really well. I want them to take that into consideration. Not just playing one team, but understanding where we’re at and what we’re doing. It’s been fun. They’re playing with a lot of energy. They come to the ballpark ready. They’re engaged. They’re going out there and they’re doing the simple things right.”  Meneses doubled in Lane Thomas with one out in the first to put New York in another early hole. The Mets have been outscored 37-9 in the first inning this season.  Meneses added another RBI double in the third off New York starter David Peterson (1-6). Keibert Ruiz followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.  The Nationals scored two more runs in the fourth and another in the fifth against Peterson, who allowed six runs and nine hits in five innings. Peterson has yielded at least four runs in six consecutive starts, and his ERA ballooned to a season-high 8.08.  “He knows he's capable of pitching well up here and he feels good physically,” manager Buck Showalter said. “That's what's been really frustrating for everybody. Some of the breaking balls have been inconsistent. I thought he had a little better one today, but he just never could get any footing where they had to guard against something.”  Abrams hit a solo shot off Tommy Hunter in the sixth. It was the second day in a row Abrams went deep, and three of his four homers this season have come against the Mets.  Meneses added a run-scoring infield single later in the inning and an RBI double in the eighth. He is hitting .452 (19 of 42) with 20 RBI with runners in scoring position.  The Mets managed three hits in two different innings against Corbin, but pushed across just one run in both of them — Jeff McNeil's RBI single in the second and Tommy Pham's sacrifice fly in the sixth.  New York has not homered since Pete Alonso's second-inning homer Wednesday at Cincinnati, a span of 52 innings. The Mets had two doubles among their 11 hits Monday, while seven of Washington's 15 hits went for extra bases.  “We know what we’re doing right now is not producing wins, but we also know this team is very capable of that,” Nimmo said. “Look to what you’ve done in the past, look at things that have helped in the past and be open to new information on how we can get better. Then when you get up to the plate, it’s compete time. It’s time to grind it out.”  TRAINER'S ROOM  Mets: Showalter said RHP Carlos Carrasco (elbow inflammation) could return from the injured list Friday or Saturday if his between-starts work day goes well. Carrasco pitched four shutout innings Sunday in a rehabilitation start for Double-A Binghamton.  Nationals: Washington activated OF Corey Dickerson (left calf strain) from the injured list and optioned INF/OF Jake Alu to Triple-A Rochester. Dickerson had been on the IL since April 2.

DENVER -- — Rookie Brenton Doyle had first first multihomer game and Harold Castro had a tiebreaking, two-run double with two outs in the seventh inning that lifted Colorado over the Cincinnati Reds 9-8 Monday night for the Rockies’ 10th win in 14 games.  With the score 6-6, Ryan McMahon singled off Ben Lively (1-1) leading off the seventh. Luke Sims, who hadn't allowed a run in 11 appearances this season, relieved with one out and walked Randal Grichuk with two outs.  Castro doubled off the base of the right-field wall, giving him three hits and three RBI, and putting the Rockies ahead 8-6.  “He gets hits,"" Rockies manager Bud Black said. ""He’s a little bit of a slasher, a little bit of a low on-base compared to the batting average. There’s not a big gap between average and on-base, but the guy puts the bat on the ball. He’s a steady performer in a lot of ways. It was a good night for him.”  Wil Myers' sacrifice fly in the eighth cut the gap, and Doyle homered off Buck Farmer in the bottom half. Doyle, a 25-year-old who debuted on April 24, has four homers in 17 games. He went deep Sunday on his birthday in a 4-0 win over Philadelphia.  “With your mindset, there’s a huge shift,"" Doyle said. ""You gain so much momentum and confidence. You go up there looking at the damage and you know you can do damage because you’ve been swinging the bat well.”  Nick Senzel hit an RBI single in the ninth against Pierce Johnson, who with two on retired Henry Ramos on a game-ending flyout for his seventh save in seven chances.  Daniel Bard (1-0) pitched around a walk in the seventh, getting help when Doyle sprinted in from center to make a diving catch on Spencer Steer leading off. Steer had three hits.  Mike Moustakas also homered for Colorado. The Rockies are 9-4 in May, the second-best win percentage in the major leagues this month behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Cincinnati, which trailed 4-1 and 6-4, is 22-44 at Coors Field since 2002.  Reds starter Hunter Greene gave up six runs and nine hits in four innings with eight strikeouts. He had allowed four home runs in his first eight starts.  Greene averaged 98.2 mph with his fastball, down 0.6 mph from his season average, and reached 100 mph just once.  “I pitched really well tonight,"" Greene said. ""There were pitches that I doubled up on that I shouldn’t have. Those double-ups weren’t as good as the prior pitch.”  Colorado's Connor Seabold gave up six runs — four earned — eight hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Rockies: RHP Nick Mears (left oblique strain) was placed on the 15-day injured list. Colorado selected the contract of LHP Fernando Abad from Triple-A Albuquerque.  Reds: 1B Joey Votto (left biceps, left rotator cuff surgeries) was transferred to the 60-day injured list. … OF TJ Friedl (left oblique strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Friday. In 124 at-bats this season, Friedl is hitting .306. INF Matt McClain's contract was selected from Triple-A Louisville, where he was hitting .348 in 38 games.

"game","2022-07-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Mon 15 May 2023 21:51:00","The potential effects of video games on mental health has been a long-drawn-out debate. Some people argue that relaxing with a video game has positive impacts on an individual, while others fear that video games can be addictive and promote negative mood changes.  A new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Sociological Focus, has sort out to answer this heated debate.  How did the researchers find the answer?  The research team analyzed members of an online football simulation gaming site.  In the simulation, players play as a head coach of a football team. The players compete against one another to have the most successful team. The game also allows for communication between competing players.  The players were surveyed at the beginning and end of each game's season for a period of 10 months.  37 players responded before playing the game, 40 responded after playing the game and 30 responded both before and after.  (credit: INGIMAGE)  The surveys included questions on depressive symptoms and abilities to communicate personal issues. The players were also asked to list how many people in real life and online they spoke to about things impacting them.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Dr. Tyler Prochnow from the Department of Health Behavior at Texas A&M University’s School of Public Health said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support, and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  What did the research find?  The researchers found that the size and quality of a social network directly impacted depressive episodes. Online social networks enabled people to find support in coping with their problems.  Players without a strong real-life social network were also more likely to use the online network for support. Players in this situation were also more likely to spend a long time online.  Additionally, the researchers found that a sense of community, and the presence of depressive episodes, could alter the social structure of the group over time.  It is worth noting that the study was based on one type of non-violent video game, and thus the findings cannot be applied as a general rule.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtYW5kLXdlbGxuZXNzL21pbmQtYW5kLXNwaXJpdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzE0M9IBSmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vaGVhbHRoLWFuZC13ZWxsbmVzcy9taW5kLWFuZC1zcGlyaXQvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMxNDMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Mon 15 May 2023 10:01:38","Jayson Tatum gave Boston a long-overdue fast start and followed it up with a finish the NBA had never seen before.  After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. ""It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” said Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, who is in his first year as an NBA head coach after being promoted on the eve of training camp after Ime Udoka was suspended. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for Philadelphia. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year, and the fifth time in six seasons; they have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. ... I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,"" Brown said. ""He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  Banged-Up Brown  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  What's Up, Doc?  Rivers is 6-10 in seventh games. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL's Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: ""Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,"" Embiid said. ""We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  Tip-Ins  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNS9ib3N0b24tY2VsdGljcy1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnMtNzZlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

With the win, the Hogs secured their seventh SEC series victory of the season and improved to 30-4 at home this year.  Hollan struck out a career-high 10 batters, limiting the Gamecocks to just one run on five hits and one walk. The left-hander threw a season-high 113 pitches in his nine-inning complete game and recorded 19 consecutive outs until a two-out single in the top half of the ninth inning.  The performance marks the Razorbacks’ first complete game of at least nine innings against an SEC team since Dominic Taccolini’s 10-inning complete game shutout against Kentucky in 2016. Hollan is the second Arkansas pitcher to throw a complete game this season after Will McEntire twirled a nine-inning complete game against Louisiana Tech on April 11.  South Carolina’s lone run of the game came via a leadoff home run in the top of the third. Hollan was untouchable from that point forward, however, allowing the Arkansas offense to hit its groove and take control of the ballgame.  John Bolton’s one-out RBI double to right center in the bottom half of the third tied things at one apiece before Parker Rowland’s go-ahead two-run single to center in the fifth. Rowland’s clutch piece of hitting put the Hogs ahead, 3-1.  Arkansas tacked on two more runs with a two-out RBI single by Caleb Cali in the sixth followed by a two-out solo home run by Ben McLaughlin in the eighth, extending the lead to 5-1. Cali and Peyton Holt both finished with a team-leading three hits, and Rowland collected the Razorbacks’ lone multi-RBI performance of the game.  The Hogs’ four-run lead was more than enough for Hollan to protect as he finished off his complete game with a scoreless ninth inning, securing the Razorbacks’ series-clinching win and put the Hogs in the driver’s seat of the SEC.  Arkansas now owns a one-and-a-half-game lead over LSU in the SEC Western Division and a one-game lead over Florida in the overall SEC standings with three games left to play in the regular season.  Up next, the Hogs will travel to Nashville, Tenn., to close out the regular season at Vanderbilt. First pitch between the Razorbacks and Commodores is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, May 18, on SEC Network.

"game","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Sun 14 May 2023 23:46:00","Doc Rivers extended one of the more dubious streaks in coaching on Sunday. Despite entering each of the past four seasons with championship expectations, he has managed to lose in the second round four years in a row. His teams led three of the four series after five games, and his team had the higher seed in two of those collapses. Sunday was perhaps the worst of them all. Despite leading for most of the first half, the 76ers fell apart against the Boston Celtics, Rivers' former team, in a 33-10 third-quarter debacle. That gave Rivers his NBA record 10th Game 7 loss. No other head coach has more than five Game 7 losses.  As such, questions have immediately arisen surrounding Rivers' job security. While he initially signed a five-year deal to take over the 76ers in 2020, each playoff defeat has been more devastating than the last and the 76ers will now have to consider whether or not they want to give Rivers the chance to lead them for a fourth season. Rivers addressed the rumors at his post-game press conference Sunday, and while he wouldn't deny the inherent insecurity of his profession, he did suggest that he plans to be back next season. ""Yeah. I think I got two years left,"" Rivers said. ""No one is safe in our business and I get that.""  Rivers isn't the only notable 76er whose future is in question. James Harden can be a free agent after re-signing in Philadelphia on a one-year deal with a player option for a second. Rumors have linked him to his old team, the Houston Rockets, all season. He claimed that he has not thought about free agency yet, but that he thinks his current team still has room to grow. ""It's only Year 1 for us together,"" Harden said.  Looming over every decision Philadelphia makes this offseason is Joel Embiid's future. While the MVP winner is under contract for at least three more seasons, superstars are rarely satisfied with humiliating playoff defeats on a seemingly annual basis. All it will take to upend this franchise is one trade request. Embiid has given no indication yet that he plans to leave Philadelphia, but NBA history tells us that he won't be satisfied with second-round exits forever. Embiid did comment on Rivers' future in Philly after Game 7, saying the coach has done a ""fantastic job.""  That is going to inform whatever the 76ers do with Rivers, Harden and the rest of their team this offseason. The clock was already ticking. After what happened on Sunday, Philadelphia will have to make major moves to keep their best player happy. The logical place to start that process would be with a new coach.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25iYS9uZXdzL2RvYy1yaXZlcnMtY29tbWVudHMtb24tam9iLXNlY3VyaXR5LXdpdGgtNzZlcnMtYWZ0ZXItbGF0ZXN0LWdhbWUtNy1sb3NzLW5vdGVzLWhlLWhhcy10d28teWVhcnMtbGVmdC1pbi1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"game","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","Mon 15 May 2023 02:15:49","BOSTON — In the Sixers’ final loss of the 2021-22 season, James Harden scored zero second-half points. He was 0 for 2 from the field after intermission in the Sixers’ Round 2, Game 6 defeat to the Heat.  On Sunday afternoon at TD Garden, he scored three second-half points. The Celtics then immediately piled up 18 in a row as the Sixers crumbled on their way to another second-round playoff exit, losing Game 7 in a blowout.  Harden had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, seven assists, six rebounds and five turnovers. Across the Sixers’ four losses in the series, he made a mere 12 of 55 field goals (21.8 percent). While Harden was brilliant in Games 1 and 4 and very solid in Game 5, he and the Sixers were not nearly good enough with the season at stake.  Head coach Doc Rivers gave a generous spin on the 10-time All-Star’s outing.  “I thought James came to play,” Rivers said. “I really did. I thought he was trying to see the game. I thought he played downhill a lot. Where he passed the ball was the right decisions tonight, and we didn’t get anything out of it. I get it. James, (Joel Embiid), me ... I know we’ve got to point somewhere, right? But I thought James, in particular, he was trying to do the right things tonight. I really did.”  Harden, who will turn 34 years old in August, missed 24 games this season, including four in March with left Achilles soreness that he said had been bothering him “for some months.” When healthy, he regularly created excellent shots for everyone around him with inch-perfect hit-ahead feeds, smooth pick-and-roll passes, and well-timed kick-outs. After starting 12-12, the Sixers went an NBA-best 42-16 and were second in offensive rating. Harden led the league in assists for a second time with 10.7 per game.  For next season, he has a player option of $35.6 million.  “James has a decision to make this summer, and he’ll make it,” Rivers said. “I think he overall enjoyed being here. It’s tough for him. We asked him to play a little differently than he’s always been accustomed to. I think it made us a better team. And unfortunately, I thought for James at times, it wasn’t always best for him. But he still did it. You appreciate that as a coach.”  Speaking minutes later in the visiting locker room, Harden didn’t provide much to supplement his coach’s comments on that subject.  “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said of his player option.  What is he looking for next?  “I just want to have a chance to compete,” Harden said. “Compete.”  Harden also offered little when asked about Rivers, whom he’d called “one of the best coaches to ever coach the game of basketball” at his introductory Sixers press conference last February.  “Our relationship is OK,” he said.  Harden did agree with the notion that he and Embiid can further grow their partnership.  “Definitely,” he said. “I feel like we had a pretty solid team. Obviously, you always look to get better, whether it’s the personnel you have now or adding pieces. We’ll see how it goes.”  By next postseason, Embiid will be 30 years old.  “We’ve got an unfinished job,” the MVP big man said. “We haven’t won anything, and I think we’ve got a chance to win. Obviously, going to seven games and having a chance to close it out at home, which we didn’t do. I still believe we’ve got the chance to win. We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I know (Harden) has a player option or they can extend him, but that’s on those guys to figure it out. I’m going to stay out of it, but I still believe that me and him, we’ve got the chance to win.  “It’s going to take more than us. We’ve all got to look at ourselves. I’ve got to be better and I will be better. That’s what I’m focused on. All of us, we’ve got to come back and find ways to just keep improving and help the team. You can’t win alone. I can’t win alone. Me and James, we just can’t win alone. That’s why basketball, it’s played 5-on-5. We just need everybody to keep trying to find ways to get better, and we’ll be fine.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9zaXhlcnMvc2l4ZXJzLWphbWVzLWhhcmRlbi1zaXhlcnMtY2VsdGljcy1nYW1lLTctZG9jLXJpdmVycy1qYW1lcy1oYXJkZW4tY29udHJhY3QtbmJhLXBsYXlvZmZz0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhL3NpeGVycy9zaXhlcnMtamFtZXMtaGFyZGVuLXNpeGVycy1jZWx0aWNzLWdhbWUtNy1kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLWphbWVzLWhhcmRlbi1jb250cmFjdC1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Paul DeJong added a solo shot and Arenado drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who won for the sixth time in seven games since an eight-game losing streak. Their previous two wins came on ninth-inning rallies against closer Kenley Jansen at Fenway Park.  Lars Nootbaar had three hits and scored three times for St. Louis, and Paul Goldschmidt added two hits and an RBI. Miles Mikolas (2-1) pitched six innings of one-run ball, allowing four hits with two walks.  “We are a playoff team despite our bad start,” Mikolas said. “The talent is there. We're a very good baseball team.”  Rafael Devers had an RBI single for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games.  It was the first series sweep this season for St. Louis (16-25), which owns the NL’s worst record. Arenado homered over the Green Monster once in each game of the series.  The Cardinals finished a six-game road trip to Wrigley Field and Fenway Park at 5-1.  “It's a good road trip,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “To get back on track and the way we've done it, against two good teams, to be able to go out there with the style of play that has been really good. I know I've said it several times, but that clubhouse has trust in one another.”  Red Sox starter Corey Kluber (2-5) gave up four runs and seven hits — two homers — in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.  “I put us in a hole early,” he said. “I think it just boils down to poor fastball command.”  DeJong’s shot into the center-field seats broke a 1-all tie in the second. Knizner’s drive came in the fourth, also going out to center.  Boston’s Enmanuel Valdez had a two-run homer overturned by review in the seventh on a drive that replays showed hooked foul just short of Pesky's Pole.  Génesis Cabrera escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, getting Masataka Yoshida to fly out to end the inning.  “Played two good games and we lost in the ninth and today they kicked our butt,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.  DAD KNOWS  Standing on the field about two hours before the game, Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale asked how the Boston Celtics were doing in Game 7 of their NBA playoff series against Philadelphia. When informed All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had 25 points at halftime, the lefty said: “He’s my oldest son’s favorite athlete. He says it’s me, but I think that’s just to make me feel good. He has two of his jerseys and only one of mine.”  BACK INTO IT  Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras was stretching and squatting with a catcher’s mitt in the clubhouse before the game. After a break from catching, Contreras is slated to be back behind the plate Monday against Milwaukee. He was moved to DH on May 5.

Drury, the sixth seed in the tournament, ends the year with a 30-24 record. Quincy will go to the NCAA-II Tournament with an automatic berth at 44-9.  The Hawks started the game with three runs in the top of first and opened up the lead by posting six runs in the third inning.  Drury got on the board with two runs in the fifth, scoring on a Carson Shaver RBI double, then on a sacrifice fly from Tyler Bastunas.  Quincy, the top scoring offense in the GLVC that averaged more than nine runs per game, kept scoring and added two more in the sixth as well as a single run in the seventh and eighth to lead 13-2.  The Panthers put up four runs in the eighth, highlighted by Shaver’s bases-clearing double that drove in three, but the deficit was too much.  “If you want to beat Quincy, you have to out-pitch them and out-hit them and we weren’t able to do either of those things today,” said Drury head coach Scott Nasby. “We had a long night but a great night last night, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to carry that over to today.”  Jay Hammel (6-2) got the win for the Hawks while Drury starter Cade Waits (5-6) took the loss.  Shaver finished the game going 2 for 4 with two doubles and 4 RBI’s. Graydon Miller went 2 for 3 with two runs and a double.  Hawks DH Austin Simpson went 4 for 5 with 5 RBI’s and he hit his 17th home run of the year.  Drury entered the GLVC Tournament on a seven-game losing streak and was one out away from a loss in Thursday’s opening round as they trailed Maryville 3-1 when Brooks Sunny’s two-RBI single tied the game. The Panthers beat the Saints in 11 innings 6-3, then picked up a 12-4 win over William Jewell on Friday.  Drury had a late start to their game on Saturday as the first pitch was not until 9:40 pm, and in a game that lasted until 1:08 am on Sunday, the Panthers downed Indianapolis 11-4 avenging a loss earlier in the season to UIndy starter Brady Ware, who no-hit Drury while hitting for the cycle at the plate in the same game on April 7.  “I thought we brought some great energy into the tournament,” said Nasby. “We had some great performances offensively and on the mound and had a lot of positivity through the weekend.  “It was good to see some people step up like Graydon Miller, who hadn’t really played at all this year, but came through with some big hits when we needed them this weekend. Brooks Sunny continued to be a clutch player like he was all season, and it was good to see a senior, Carson Shaver, go out playing as well as he did today.”  Sunday’s championship marks the sixth time in program history the Panthers have reached the GLVC title game.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm96YXJrc3Nwb3J0c3pvbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTQvZHJ1cnktZmFsbHMtdG8tZmlmdGgtcmFua2VkLXF1aW5jeS1pbi1nbHZjLXRpdGxlLWdhbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

TORONTO -- — Danny Jansen hit a two-run single in the ninth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays rallied to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.  George Springer hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, who are 12-3 at home this season.  “This team’s resilient,” Jansen said. “We’re looking to win every game, and we believe that we can with the bats and the staff we have.”  With Toronto trailing 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero thought he tied the game to begin the ninth, pumping his fist as he watched his deep drive to right, but Guerrero was held to a single when the ball hit the wall.  The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two outs before Jansen singled to left field off Raisel Iglesias (1-1), driving in Guerrero and Matt Chapman.  “We had an opportunity to win the game and we couldn’t close the deal,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “It’s frustrating, but this game is frustrating.”  The Braves have lost four straight and five of eight.  “Tough one to swallow,” Atlanta’s Austin Riley said.  Nate Pearson (1-0) worked one inning for the win.  Ozzie Albies hit a two-run home run, and Ronald Acuña Jr. and Kevin Pillar each added solo blasts for Atlanta, which has lost nine straight against Toronto.  “Winning against a team like that three games in a row is really hard,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said.  The Braves made three errors and the Blue Jays had two defensive miscues, both by Gold Glove third baseman Chapman. Toronto pitchers also made a pair of wild pitches.  Snitker said he didn’t realize how windy it was on the field with the roof at Rogers Centre open until he came out to replace right-hander Collin McHugh in the second.  Pillar, who played with Toronto from 2013 until 2019, agreed that the conditions were “difficult” Sunday.  “You don’t feel a lot of the wind at ground level, it’s kind of up higher when those balls get up there,” Pillar said. “The ball was moving all over the place.”  Acuña homered on left-hander Yusei Kikuchi’s third pitch of the game, the 28th leadoff homer of his career, and Michael Harris II made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.  Toronto responded with three runs in the bottom of the second. Brandon Belt hit an RBI single and Guerrero’s base hit drove in a pair of runs.  Albies connected in the third, his 10th homer of the season.  Pillar made it 5-3 in the fourth when he homered against his former team, his fourth of the season, but Springer cut the Blue Jays’ deficit to one when he answered in the bottom half with a solo drive to left, his fifth.  McHugh made his first start of the season for Atlanta. He gave up three runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings.  Kikuchi allowed five runs, four earned, and nine hits in 4-plus innings.  WELCOME BACK  Pillar got a standing ovation before he batted in the second, his first at bat of the series and first appearance in Toronto since April 24, 2019, with San Francisco.  “It’s definitely really special to come back that many years later and to be remembered and to be appreciated,” Pillar said. “It was overwhelming.”  TABLE SETTER  Acuña reached base four times and scored twice. He leads the NL in hits (54), total bases (90), runs scored (36), stolen bases (17).  UP NEXT  Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (4-3, 3.32) starts Monday when Atlanta begins a three-game series at Texas. The Rangers have not named a starter.  Blue Jays: RHP Alek Manoah (1-3, 4.83) starts Monday when Toronto hosts the New York Yankees for a four-game series.

(WTVM) - Northside Christian Church hosted an adaptive needs sports game this weekend.  Mother’s Day was on the minds of many adaptive sports participants at this month’s adaptive sports game that was held on Saturday.  Volleyball was the game of choice for the month.  The church has been hosting sports games for kids, and older people with disabilities and challenges, to give them a chance to learn a sport and play among their peers.  Participants were also able to create a special gift of flowers for the mom in their life.  As the program wraps up for the Spring, volunteers say they need more people to come out and help with their upcoming summer camp.  “Just like we do here, we assign every child a buddy. The buddy just hangs out with them during the course of the event, so they can direct them, like we may be coming back for snack, or they may need help with a skill, and things like that so that’s really what we need volunteers for,” says Volunteer Buddy Coordinator Vikki Hutchinson.  The adaptive program’s summer camp starts June 7 and ends June 9, and volunteers are needed to help kids that are on a waitlist. If you want to participate, contact the church at (706) 324-5220.

The 3rd overall pick of the 2017 Draft broke a league record on Sunday for the most points in a Game 7 match.  “I thought he was hot as fish grease but nah I said he’s hot as whale grease. Because that dude was cooking,"" said a Cedric Maxwell, retired Celtic and radio broadcaster.  Philly's best hardly showed up, and former Celtics Head Coach Doc Rivers now has the most Game 7 losses of any coach in league history.  “[I] Was expecting a bounce back game from Harden after a brutal Game 5 and 6, but just did not get it,"" said a 76ers fan at the Garden.  The Celtics are up against the 76ers tomorrow (Sunday) at TD Garden for Game 7, and the city of Boston is behind them.  Philly didn't show up in part because of how Boston's fans did after Jaylen Brown called them out following Game 6.  ""Y'all love to call us out,"" said Brown. ""I'm calling you guys out this time. The energy in the garden has been okay at best all [of] playoffs.""  After Sunday's victory, Brown said this: ""Way to respond.

Jaylen was right to call everyone out.”  Brandy Cole chats with Latoyia Edwards ahead of Mother's Day, when her son, Jayson Tatum, and the Celtics will play in Game 7 against the 76ers.  Celtics fans answered the call, some even cancelling plans to see them play.

It was the best way to spend a five year anniversary,"" said Hopkin's boyfriend Sam Coveny.  Fans outside of TD Garden said Tatum's role in the Game 7 victory solidified his Celtics legacy.
