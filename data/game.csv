Chaotic Good Brewing Company in Kasson is putting a personal twist on the game during its monthly “D & D” nights.  David Sklenicka, a physics teacher in Austin is also a “Dragon Master.” A good friend of Chaotic Good owner Scott Stroh, he helps arrange these monthly game nights and writes a storyline based on the brewery.  For May, the theme is Orc-tober Fest. Characters will be invited to join a journey to a big Beer Festival and enter a competition. Along the way, there will be challenges to overcome.  “I get the ideas off of my considerate, but also my wife and daughter both play. I love bouncing ideas off of them. I like to keep it in the family,” said Sklenicka.  “I like the influence from other people but I don’t want to ruin any of the surprises my later players might have. I spend 15-20 hours typing it out.”  Credit: MGN  Outside of Chaotic Good, Sklenicka hosts gaming sessions at parties and events. If you’re interested, you can contact him here.

Jauhari struck a minute into the first additional period after Yotsakorn Burapha had netted in the dying seconds of normal time to take the game into extra time with Rahman and Putra adding the gloss on a dramatic victory.  Ramadhan Sananta's first-half double had looked set to earn Indonesia the gold medal, the 20-year-old opening the scoring in the 21st minute when he steered a long throw by Alfeandra Dewangga beyond Thai goalkeeper Soponwit Rakyart.  The 20-year-old doubled the lead in first half stoppage time in spectacular fashion, lobbing home from 25 yards with Soponwit stranded on the edge of his penalty area.  Thailand, looking to claim the title for a record-extending 17th time, halved the deficit when Anan Yodsangwal headed in a 65th minute corner and then dramatically pulled level deep into stoppage time through Yotsakorn.  However, Jauhari put Indonesia back in front when he deftly lifted the ball over Soponwit before a bench-clearing brawl on the touchline raised tensions further.  Soponwit and Indonesia's Komang Teguh were sent off for their involvement in the altercation while the Thais were reduced to nine men in the 101st minute when defender Jonathan Khemdee received a second yellow card.  Rahman hit his side's fourth two minutes into the second period of extra time and Putra put the result beyond all doubt in the final minute to earn Indonesia gold for the fourth time.

Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4  WORCESTER, M.A. — A pair of rehabbers on the mound and a trio of home runs gave the Worcester Red Sox (20-20) a 9-4 win over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (19-20) on Tuesday night at Polar Park.  Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4 IP, 5 H 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K on 49 pitches (35 strikes). The lone run allowed against him came in the third, a solo shot to Jake Cave. Whitlock reached 95-miles-per-hour on his sinker and recorded four swing-and-misses on his changeup.  Kutter Crawford followed, also on rehab, and delivered a strong outing in relief: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K over 41 pitches (26 strikes). Lehigh Valley’s run against the right-hander also came on a long ball, a solo home run by Jordan Qsar in the sixth. Crawford's four-seamer topped out at 95.6 miles-per-hour, as he mixed in all five of his pitches. He recorded eight swing-and-misses, including three with his changeup.  Offensively, the WooSox scored in five consecutive offensive innings to take a stranglehold on the game.  Bobby Dalbec opened the scoring in the second, smashing a 112 mile-per-hour, 471-foot home run to center for his fifth of the Triple-A season. Dalbec now has 11 extra-base-hits in 23 games with Worcester.  In a 1-1 game in the third, David Hamilton delivered his team-leading eighth homer, a solo blast to right. Including tonight, Hamilton has 19 RBI in 35 games.  In the fourth, Greg Allen doubled off the Worcester Wall in right, plating Jorge Alfaro. After a walk, Nick Sogard came up with two in scoring position and drove both runners home with a single to center, putting the WooSox up 5-1.  Ryan Fitzgerald drove home two in the fifth with a moonshot of his own, his seventh of the season. Six of Fitzgerald’s seven home runs have come in the month of May, and he has 16 total hits in 12 games.  Worcester made it 8-1 on a wild pitch in the sixth that allowed Sogard to score. Manager Chad Tracy was also ejected in the inning, arguing a foul tip call with Hamilton at the plate.  In the eighth, Hamilton made it his sixth multi-RBI game of the season with a run-scoring groundout.  Out of the bullpen, Cam Booser allowed a run in the eighth on an RBI double play, while A.J. Politi got the final four outs while allowing one run to seal the home team's win.  The WooSox continue the homestand on Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 p.m. against the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.

Jayson Tatum went 4 for 4 on 3-pointers when guarded by 76ers big man Joel Embiid. Barry Chin/Globe Staff      The shriveling Sixers weren’t the only thing the Celtics put to rest with their rousing 112-88 rout Sunday in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal.  They also buried an assortment of negative narratives and perceptions — some fair, some never fair at all — about themselves. And that’s another fulfilling victory in itself.  Any discussion of redemption must begin in one place: with Jayson Tatum’s career-defining, climb-on-my-back-boys tour de force.  You may know the stats by heart now: 51 points, the most in a Game 7 ever. (Even more impressive, Tatum scored 67 points since the start of the fourth quarter in Game 6.) A game-high 13 rebounds. A team-high 5 assists. Tatum knocked down 17 of 28 shots, including 6 of 10 threes, and that latter stat felt more like 9 of 10.  Advertisement:  Beyond the breathtaking numbers, Tatum played a remarkably poised and intelligent game. He did not commit a turnover in 41:40 of action. For parts of the series, he would become flummoxed when coming face to face with Joel Embiid in the lane, leading to altered and awkward shots.  Sunday, he put Embiid in the blender, blowing past him at will and going 4 for 4 from three when the big man was his primary defender, including a pair of threes within about a minute of each other early in the third that put the Celtics up, 65-55, and planted the seed that this might be a runaway. It was, largely because Tatum solved the Embiid mystery.  Tatum struggled mightily at points in this series, including shooting a combined 1 of 24 — that’s 4.2 percent — from the field in the first quarters of Games 4-6. He is long proven as a superb player, having made first-team NBA two years running, but his struggles (particularly in the Finals against the Warriors last season) tended to overshadow his big-moment success (46 points on Game 6 on the road against the defending champion Bucks in last year’s East semis).  It got so tiring hearing from fans that called him soft or said he was, to paraphrase, dispassionate. But it was tough to push back on that when he was essentially absent from the first quarter in multiple games in this series.  Advertisement:  Tatum is just 25, works relentlessly on his game, and there’s still room to grow (Paul Pierce didn’t become a champion until he was 30), but as the weight on his shoulders got heavier as this series went on, it began to feel like a referendum on his status among the NBA elite and his place in Celtics lore.  Let’s just say the referendum passed in a landslide. I saw Larry Bird’s entire career, and Pierce’s too, and I’m not sure I ever saw either of them dominate a game quite like this, and that’s even without considering how Tatum’s reputation was at stake.  There’s no perfect comparison for his performance, but it reminded me of various spectacular moments in Celtics lore. It was a little bit of the Bird-Dominique Wilkins shootout in Game 7 of the ‘88 Eastern Conference semifinals … and a little of Larry’s 60-point game against the Hawks in March 1985 … and a little of Pierce’s 41-point gem in Game 7 against the Cavaliers in 2008 … and, in a team sense, of the Celtics’ 36-6 run in the third quarter against Atlanta in the clinching Game 5 of the 1986 conference semis.  Whenever you’re reminding someone of the 1985-86 Celtics — the best single-season team I’ve ever seen — you’re doing something extraordinary.  Advertisement:  (There is a common thread through those aforementioned games, by the way. Doc Rivers was involved in all of them. Isn’t that wild?)  Funny, but no one has texted or messaged me today that Tatum is soft. Hopefully that nonsense is over for good.  As for other perceptions that were proven to be either misguided or no longer existent during this series, how about this one, the notion that Tatum and Jaylen Brown don’t bring out the best in each other. I thought Game 7 was the best they have ever played in tandem, with Brown setting the tone early, scoring 25 points in total, and tormenting first-ballot Hall of Fame quitter James Harden up and down the court.  The energy, as they say, shifted when Harden whacked Brown in his unmasked face with 8½ minutes left in the second quarter and the Sixers up, 35-27. The Celtics tore off an 8-0 run after that, playing with a relentless pace that you knew would eventually wear down the Sixers. (The Celtics were the far better- conditioned team.)  I thought it was telling in all the right ways at the end of Game 6 when no one was happier for Tatum after his breakout 16-point fourth quarter than Brown. Some stars would be annoyed that their teammate kept shooting through a miserable slump with the season on the line. But Brown, who would have had every right to want the ball down the stretch, greeted Tatum with a grin, an elaborate handshake, and a big hug afterward. There is no doubt. Those two are in this together.  Advertisement:  We’ll save the discussion of Joe Mazzulla’s standing after this series for another day, and just note one more change in perception for now.  It seemed at times during the season, and even in the first-round series against the Hawks, that both Al Horford and Marcus Smart had lost a step defensively. I don’t know if they were aching or pacing themselves or what, but it became clear in this series that both remain forces on the defensive end.  I’m not sure there’s another player in the league who enjoys beating a specific team the way Horford enjoys beating the Sixers, and the 36-year-old wore down and wore out Embiid. And Smart seemed to pester, agitate, and lock down every Sixer at one time or another; he was back in his Defensive Player of the Year form from a season ago.  If Horford, Smart, and Brown too continue to set the tone with their defensive intensity, and Tatum can keep playing like a Celtics legend in his own time, anything isn’t just possible with this team. It might just be probable."

It might have been a couple of sloppy plays in the field that led to several runs. The lack of hitting certainly didn’t help, and neither did a dose of plain bad luck.  In the end, it all added up to a 6-1 loss to Manchester Academy in Game 1 of the MAIS Class 3A baseball championship series that put the Trojans’ backs to the wall.  Email newsletter signup  Manchester pitcher Brodey Walker had 10 strikeouts in a complete-game victory, and Garner Burton was 2-for-3 with one RBI and one run scored.  “I thought we would be better, but they battled. If I thought they weren’t trying it’d be a different story. But (Walker’s) a legit lefty and lefties give people trouble,” Tallulah coach Stuart King said. “He’s got three good pitches. I don’t think he’s been touched up all year. We had a game plan for him. Having one and executing it is two different things.”  Game 2 of the best-of-three series is Thursday at 5 p.m. in Yazoo City. If Tallulah Academy (24-7) can win, it’ll force a deciding Game 3 back in Tallulah on Saturday.  “We’ve got tomorrow to regroup and then we go there. We will not see the lefty. I feel like we’ll bounce back and make a game of it. I think we’ll get back here,” King said.  Tallulah never got out of the blocks offensively against Walker. The left-hander retired the first 10 batters he faced and only gave up one hit through the first six innings.  Walker also helped himself with his glove. After Wyatt Bedgood singled with one out in the fourth inning for Tallulah’s first hit, Dee Morgan followed with a hard grounder back up the middle. Walker stuck his glove down to snag it, and threw to second to start an inning-ending double play.  The double play helped Walker face the minimum number of batters through five innings. Another runner was caught stealing to end the fifth inning.  “They threw their ace at us and he was better than us tonight,” King said.  Tallulah wasn’t blessed with the same kind of luck. In the top of the fourth inning, Burton led off with a double and Ryan Johnson followed with a ground ball to shortstop, right into a defensive shift. Tallulah’s Landry Tweedle caught Burton off of second base, but the Manchester runner made it back to the bag on a close play.  Two batters later, Reed Roberts and Mills Paul hit back-to-back RBI singles to put the Mavericks ahead 5-0.  Manchester added a run on a passed ball in the fifth inning. Roberts also had an RBI single in the third, and Burton had one in the second.  “Baseball is a game of momentum. If you’ve got the momentum they’re 7 foot tall. If they don’t they’re about 3 foot tall. As a coach it’s my job to keep them level, but that’s not as easy as putting the game plan together,” King said.  Tallulah finally got on the board in the bottom of the seventh inning. Tweedle led off with a walk, went to second on an infield single by Bedgood and third on an error, then scored on a groundout by Morgan.  Hayes Hopkins kept the rally going with a single, but Walker struck out the last two batters to end the game before it blossomed into anything more.  “Our game, we’re not a big home run, gap hitting team. We have to get on base, steal bases, bunt. It’s just the way it is,” King said. “When you fall behind 6-0, even 3-0, in the later innings you have to change your game plan a little bit.”"

He finished it off by contributing to a slump-breaking victory.  After striking out twice and misplaying a line drive into a triple, Duran homered, singled in a run and stole a base to help Boston snap a four-game losing streak by beating the Seattle Mariners 9-4 on Tuesday night.  “It’s baseball. I punched out the first two at bats and I was like, ‘I’ve got to flush it,’” said Duran, who is batting .351 and already matched his career high of three home runs. “Just pick up my boys and just think about the guys. Like, it’s not all about me.”  Masataka Yoshida doubled, tripled, scored on a wild pitch and drove in three runs for Boston. Justin Turner and Triston Casas also homered for the Red Sox, who were swept by the last-place St. Louis Cardinals and lost the series opener to Seattle.  Nick Pivetta (3-3) allowed four runs on six hits and four walks, striking out six in 5 1/3 innings.  Taylor Trammell homered for Seattle, which had won three out of four and 10 of 14 since starting the season 11-16. Luis Castillo (2-2) allowed seven runs — five earned — on six hits and two walks while striking out six in five innings.  Yoshida tripled and Turner and Casas homered in Boston’s four-run first. But Seattle tied it in the fourth, thanks in part to Teoscar Hernandez’s sinking liner to center that Duran dove for and missed; the ball rolled past him toward the wall.  “He’s trying to make a baseball play. I’d rather have that than lack of effort,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “He’s in a great place. He’s going to make mistakes, but overall his game has been a plus everywhere.”  Trammell followed with a two-run homer to make it 4-4. Alex Verdugo doubled leading off the bottom of the fifth, and Yoshida’s one-bounce, ground-rule double in the right field corner broke the tie. The Japanese left fielder took third on a flyout and scored on Castillo’s wild pitch before Duran homered for a 7-4 lead.  Duran singled in another run in the seventh and improved to 7 for 7 on stolen bases.  “He’s a game-changer,” Turner said. “He’s got power. He’s got speed. He uses the whole field and plays great defense in the center. So it’s good to see him having success hitting the ball all over the place and running the bases like it is.”  Yoshida made it 9-4 in the eighth on a bases-loaded groundout.

Attendance in Oakland has been, say, problematic, for a significant period of time.  The reasons for the erosion of fan support are multi-faceted. Partially due to ownership disinterest, fan disinterest and the worst stadium in professional sports.  But whatever little interest remains has been even further reduced in recent weeks.  Team ownership essentially announced their intention to move the A’s to Las Vegas by agreeing to purchase land off the strip.  That agreement has somehow already changed, but the overall plan remains.  READ: OAKLAND A’S ALREADY CHANGING VEGAS STADIUM PLANS DESPITE PREVIOUS BINDING AGREEMENT  That announcement combined with the longstanding issues has brought fan support to an unbelievable low.  So low, in fact, the A’s announced an attendance figure of just 2,064 for Monday’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  And given video from inside the stadium, that figure may have been inflated.  Oof.  OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 06: A general view of play between the Oakland Athletics and the Texas Rangers at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum on August 06, 2020 in Oakland, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)  Oakland A’s Embarrassing MLB  That announced attendance, almost certainly an over-estimate, marked a new low for Oakland.  How low? The lowest announced crowd size for a home game since 1979. 44 years ago.  It also ranks as one of the least attended MLB games in the league’s recorded history. Just two other games have seen fewer fans, outside of the 2020 lockdown season.  One of those two games had a game time temperature of 34 degrees. It was not 34 in Oakland on Monday.  The attendance to see the A’s and Diamondbacks play was lower than the average of 97 different minor league franchises.  For a major league team.  Quite simply, this is an unacceptable embarrassment. And fans aren’t to blame.  The A’s organization has essentially told locals they no longer care. Investments in talent have been nonexistent. They’ve stopped pretending to want to stay in Oakland, while openly admitting to be focused on Las Vegas.  Oakland has by far the worst record in the league, on pace for historic ineptitude.  Why should anyone support them by spending money on tickets, concessions or transportation?  The fact that it’s gotten to this point is a disaster for MLB, especially considering the team has many, many more home games to play before leaving for the desert.  Given this is just May, we may see some new attendance lows set the rest of the season."

Trying to help starting pitcher Bailey Falter get past his first-inning woes, Phillies manager Rob Thomson decided against anything so basic as letting the big lefthander work on his problems himself. Thomson’s plan: Have relief pitcher Connor Brogdon pitch the first inning and bring Falter in after an inning or two.  It was not a good idea, as illustrated by the Phillies’ 6-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants Monday night in the opener of a 3-game series.  Thomson wound up desperately turning to Falter with 2 outs in the first inning. Brogdon, who “opened” one game in his 130 career appearances, gave up two singles and a walk to load the bases with 2 out. With lefthanded-hitting Brandon Crawford due up, Thomson brought in Falter.  Instead of facing the top of the order with no one on base, Falter was facing a veteran All-Star with the bases loaded. And what do you know? Falter struck Crawford out to end the threat. So no harm, no foul, right?  Wrong, Opener-Breath.  As Ricky Bottalico pointed out on the pregame show, whenever Falter comes in, that’s the first inning for him. The bottom of the second appeared to be the first inning – ever – for Falter and his teammates.  After Falter gave up a couple of singles, second baseman Bryson Stott forgot to keep his glove open until the ball is actually in it. This was on a potential double play-starting throw from shortstop Trea Turner. It was Stott’s first error of the season. But that was just the warmup act.  With the bases loaded, the Giants’ Wilmer Flores stroked a line drive to right field. Nick Castellano held his glove out but had the same procedural difficulty as Stott. The ball bounced off his closed glove. Castellanos was able to pick up the ball and throw out the runner who had stayed at first expecting Castellanos to catch the ball.  That came up huge when Falter gave up a 3-run home run to Michael Conforto on his next pitch. That was the first of four consecutive hits Falter surrendered. When the smoke cleared and the glass bits were all over and there was a big old hole in the wall. Falter had given up 6 runs on 6 hits. The Phillies’ early 2-0 lead was a distant memory.  “I don’t think he was executing that inning,” Thomson said.  But at least Falter’s first-inning ERA wasn’t a problem! Success!  In fairness, Thomson wasn’t wrong to identify Falter’s vulnerability. After that second-inning generosity, Falter did pitch the way Thomson envisioned when he decided to delay his entry into the game. Falter did not allow another run in 3 more innings of work. He gave up a triple to Thairo Estrada in the third and a double to Casey Schmitt in the fifth.  “Credit to him, he settled in and gave us a little bit of life,” Thomson said. “He didn’t give up another run. He kind of kept us right there.”  Thomson said no decision has been made on Falter’s next start.  The question is whether Falter would have been better off just working through his early-inning woes from the mound instead of the bullpen. As it turned out, he was singled out as the guy who needs a teammate to start his game, and then gave up 6 runs in his first full inning of work. Meanwhile, the Phillies fell behind 6-2 early and were never really able to get back into it. Which just goes to show you, as Bailey Falters, so falter the Phillies."

James Derflinger and Jack Sand each added an RBI in the fifth to give the Saints a 9-2 advantage.  Sand was on the mound in the top of the seventh for Crean Lutheran and struggled to find his rhythm in the seventh. After Sultans leadoff batter Chris Manley reached safely on an error, Sand hit three consecutive batters and was replaced by Garcia.  Garcia was able to collect a pair of important outs before Haney called on Alex Iida, the Saints’ ace and probable starter in the championship game, to get the final out."

For the Bears, finishing 9-8 would certainly be respectable after finishing with the worst record in the league in 2022. Overall, Chicago has a favorable schedule. Not that it’s worth much given the turnover in the league. Aside from some juggernauts, including the Chiefs and Chargers, there are plenty of winnable games on this schedule for the Bears. We’ll see how things shake out with a Chicago team with plenty to prove heading into 2023.  Brendan Sugrue: 8-9  Things may look bleak to start the year with the Bears going 1-4, but they’ll rally to climb back to .500 by the middle of the season. Their schedule is favorable on paper, minus a few matchups. For example, having to travel to Tampa Bay in September could mean dealing with scorching temperatures. But given they will have plenty of rest throughout the season, the Bears will make huge strides from their record a year ago and be in the playoff hunt all the way until the end. Whether it’s enough to actually make the postseason is another question.  Ryan Fedrau: 8-9  8-9 is a great place to start, given the chance that a few games can go their way and they’re in the playoffs. I believe the Bears are a year away from being a playoff team. This is their year where they mold everything and next season, they put everything together and become a contender. Still, a few games bounce their way and they can be a wildcard team in 2023. If that happens, I wouldn’t be surprised.  Nate Atkins: 8-9  Possibly optimistic, but if Justin Fields makes the next step as a passer, I could see the Bears winning eight games. The Bears split the divisional matchups and won the games they should. Maybe with a couple of lucky breaks, they could win ten games by upsetting Kansas City and Los Angeles or winning both matchups with a divisional opponent.  Jarrett Bailey: 9-8  I really like what Ryan Poles is building in Chicago. They recognized their needs going into the offseason and addressed them. The linebacker position is dull? The Bears added two of the best off-ball linebackers available in Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards. Right tackle a weak spot? Chicago drafts Darnell Wright. With the NFC North changing tides with the Packers transitioning out of Aaron Rodgers, and the Vikings saying goodbye to a lot of veterans, the Bears pounce and make a big leap in 2023 and earn the final wild-card spot."

Fittingly, it was two members of that group that led the way for the Golden Bears in the second game of the Region 1 Championship Series.  One day after passing the 500 mark for her career, Lizzie Kell racked up another 10 strikeouts to surpass the 300 mark for the season in tossing a complete game, four-hit shutout, and fellow 12th-grader Dez Carter had all three RBIs in a 3-0 win over Keyser to knot the series at 1-1.  “The seniors told the rest of the group (Tuesday) they have to play for each other, that’s valuable leadership from them and a lesson for (the underclassmen),” Golden Bears head coach Sherrie Garner said of the senior group that’s been to back-to-back state tournaments. “They know (from experience) everyone had to put their best foot forward (after the loss Monday) so we could perform as a team.  “Win to extend, that was the saying this morning. This senior group has been here before, they’ve been in these situations before and they’re the leaders of this group. We have to fall behind them whichever way we can.”  The teams will play a winner-take-all Game 3 today at Keyser with a trip to the state tournament on the line.  Aside from simply keeping the season alive, it also gave the Bears six seniors one more win at the Field of Dreams Complex as it was their final home game regardless of the result today.  After being held off the board until the seventh in Game 1, the Golden Bears (24-9) wasted no time in getting on the board in Game 2.  Sarah Brown started a two-out rally in the first with a single, then, after the first of three Keyser (23-6) errors, scored when Carter singled to make it 1-0.  That would have been enough for Kell.  The Golden Tornado perhaps had its best chance to score in the top of the fifth when, after a dropped pop up in foul territory with two outs kept the inning alive, Averi Everline hit a hard-liner with runners on the corners that seemed destined to score at least one run — but senior Liv Munoz made a jumping, acrobatic snag and held on after falling to the ground to preserve the 1-0 lead.  In the bottom half, again with two outs, Carter put another ball into the outfield grass, plating two runs to provide the final margin.  Keyser’s Charity Wolfe finished with a double and Susie Cosenza two singles.  “We just couldn’t get anything going offensively,” Keyser head coach Colton Jones said. “Our pitching and defense weren’t bad.

""It's the stickiest hand I've ever felt,'' said umpire crew chief James Hoye, telling a pool reporter that ""it was definitely not rosin,'' despite German's claims.  And the Yankees are in deeper trouble as a pitching staff, with German facing an automatic 10-game suspension.  ""That's Domingo's responsibility,'' manager Aaron Boone said of German's use of, well, whatever he's applying to his pitching hand during a start.  ""The reality is, we should all have a very good idea what the line is and apparently Domingo crossed it.''  David Wells' perfect game:25 years later, teammate David Cone tells us how it impacted 1998 season  And for the second straight night, the Yankees became steeped in a controversy against the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre.  After three perfect innings Tuesday, the right-handed German was ejected following a routine inspection of his pitching hand.  Yet, in another test of the Yankees' resolve, a wearying bullpen - and another clutch, go-ahead home run by Aaron Judge - sent them toward a 6-3 victory against the tough Toronto Blue Jays.  ""Just another gutsy effort by that group out there that keeps competing,'' said Boone.  Anatomy of another Yankees controversy  At least, the Yankees should have Luis Severino back in their rotation Sunday at Cincinnati.  Sidelined since spring training due to a lat strain, Severino made his second minor league rehab stint Tuesday, going 3.1 innings (58 pitches, two runs, six hits, one walk, three strikeouts) for Class AA Somerset.  That determination should be made Wednesday, when German - barring appeal - would begin his suspension.  ""I’ve got to apologize to my teammates,'' German said through an interpreter. ""I’m putting them in a tough position right now, and how much the bullpen is being used.''  It was Hoye's crew that warned German of excess use of rosin, April 15, in a game at Yankee Stadium against the Minnesota Twins.  At that time, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli felt that German should have been ejected since the umpires told him to clean off the excess rosin and he came back out with some sticky substance still on part of his hand.  German, through an interpreter, said it was because he works the rosin bag between innings, in the dugout.  Mindful of that, with Hoye's umpiring crew Tuesday, German only used the sandy rosin bag exclusively and he only used it on the mound, not in the dugout.  Domingo German disputes umpires' claims  First base ump DJ Reyburn checked German after the first inning, but not again until German came out to pitch the bottom of the fourth inning, with the Yankees leading 2-0.  ""(German's) hand was clearly shiny on the palm and his fingertips, and it was extremely sticky,'' said Hoye, who confirmed Reyburn's claim, as did the other two umpires.  ""We all had the same opinion: shiny, extremely sticky, and it's the worst hand we've ever felt during a game,'' said Hoye. ""So, we got together, we decided we were going to eject him at that point for foreign substance.''  Hoye insisted it was not rosin, which ""usually is kind of like a little tackiness. This was sticky, as in my fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.''  German says he ""didn't get a pure explanation at the moment'' of his ejection. He expressed confusion about not getting ""a clear direction from them to find out what’s appropriate and what’s too much'' with what he insisted was rosin and sweat and nothing else mixed in.  As to the substance TV cameras caught on his pants, German smiled and said: ""That was chewing tobacco.''  After the game, an unsmiling Boone said he had ""a good conversation,'' with German. ""I’ll just leave it at that.''  More Yankees headaches, controversies  Ian Hamilton replaced German, who is now likely headed to the injured list.  Given all the time he needed to warm up, Hamilton loaded the bases with two out and exited the game due to groin tightness. He's headed to New York for tests and he's likely ""going to be down a little bit,'' Boone said.  Before the game, MLB officials became involved with the Yankees and Blue Jays, regarding the positioning of Yankees base coaches Travis Chapman and Luis Rojas following Monday night's 7-4 Yankees win.  In the eighth inning of that game, TV cameras caught Aaron Judge's eyes darting toward the Yankees dugout right before several of reliever Jay Jackson's pitches, the last of which Judge crushed for his second homer of the game.  During the third inning of Tuesday night's game, umpires seemed to warn Rojas, the Yanks' third base coach, about straying beyond the coaching lines.  After some apparent heated moments between Rojas and the umpires, and a back-and-forth with Toronto's coaches in their dugout, Rojas resumed his place along the third base coaching lines.  The Yankees appeared to use the same complaint in the fourth inning to prevent Toronto third base coach Luis Rivera from straying beyond the lines.  By the fourth inning, both the first base coaches of the Yanks and Jays were standing at least 10 feet beyond the coaching line.  Hoye said MLB directed the crew to keep the coaches in their boxes.  ""(Rojas) was a couple steps off and so there seemed to be some disagreement about that,'' Hoye said. ""We made sure he was in,'' as they also did later with Rivera at the Yankees insistance.  “It’s just silliness. It’s ridiculous,’’ said Boone. “And I think everyone, I hope on both sides, realizes that.’’"

The Birds are now 12-2 in such games. The Angels 9-5 win was led by Shohei Ohtani, who gave up three home runs on the mound but hit a three-run homer at bat as part of a 4-for-5 game where he came up a double short of the cycle.  Adam Frazier and Anthony Santander hit two-run homers off Ohtani and Cedric Mullins added a solo shot. In two career starts against the Orioles, Ohtani has allowed nine runs in 12 innings and has given up six homers, including two each to Mullins and Santander. His five runs allowed last night tied his season high.  But the O’s starter, rookie right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, allowed nine hits and eight runs over 3 1/3 innings. That is the most runs allowed by a Baltimore starting pitcher this year. Coming into this series, O’s starters had a 1.74 ERA their previous eight games, allowing two earned runs or less seven times.  The Orioles bullpen allowed just a single run over 5 2/3 innings last night. The Baltimore bullpen has a 1.48 ERA (five ER/30.1 IP) over the last eight games.  Best bullpen ERAs in MLB in 2023  2.76 – Seattle  3.00 – Orioles  3.14 – Cleveland  3.18 – New York Yankees  3.21 – Houston  After allowing a career-high-tying three earned runs on Opening Day in Boston, Bryan Baker has allowed just one earned run over his last 19 appearances (19.1 IP). Among pitchers with at least 18 innings pitched since March 31, Baker's 0.47 ERA (one ER/19.1 IP) ranks second in MLB, behind only teammate Yennier Cano (0.00), and just ahead of fellow O's hurler Félix Bautista, whose 1.00 ERA (two ER/18.0 IP) in that span ranks fifth.  The Angels won for just the third time in nine games last night, improving to 22-20. They are 12-11 on the road and 4-7 versus American League East teams.  The Orioles (26-15) are now 4.5 games behind Tampa Bay for first in the AL East. Toronto is in third place, 6.5 back, with New York 7.5 out and Boston nine games back of the Rays.  Right-hander Dean Kremer (4-1, 4.97 ERA), who has thrown 11 straight scoreless innings, takes the mound for Baltimore tonight. On Wednesday versus Tampa Bay he pitched six scoreless on four hits, all singles, throwing 95 pitches. He walked two and fanned four, earning the win as the Orioles beat the Rays 2-1 to win that series.  In the start before that at Atlanta, Kremer allowed one run in the first inning, but then threw five scoreless to conclude his outing. So he’s put up 11 straight scoreless versus the Rays and Braves, who rank one and two in the majors in team OPS at .856 and .804, respectively.  Kremer, who has three quality starts, has a 1.464 WHIP this season, allowing 10.4 hits per nine with a 1.5 homer rate, 2.8 walk rate and 6.9 K rate.  Lefty batters have fared much better against him this season than right-handers. Lefties are batting .350 with an OPS of .927 versus Kremer while right-handers hit .238/.697. The Orioles are 5-3 in his outings this year.  Right-hander Chase Silseth (0-0, 3.24 ERA) will make his fifth appearance and first start of the year for the Angels. He has thrown just 8 1/3 innings in the majors this season, allowing five hits and six runs (three earned). He began this season ranked by Baseball America as the Angels’ No. 3 prospect.  The 22-year-old right-hander was drafted by Los Angeles in round 11 of 2021 and got an overslot $485,000 bonus. He then became the first player from the 2021 draft to make the majors.  He has made four Triple-A starts this year for Salt Lake City, going 2-0 with an 0.90 ERA. He was the Pacific Coast League Player of the Week for the period from April 3-9.  He has made one career start against the Orioles, going 0-1 with an ERA of 9.00. On July 7, 2022 he gave up six hits and four runs over four innings in a start at Camden Yards.  He throws his fastball 52 percent at an average velocity of 95.8 mph, and it’s a heater that can touch the high 90s. He uses his cutter 23 percent, slider 14 percent and split-finger pitch 11 percent."

Take, for example, John Carbone of Norwood.  Most days, Carbone's basement is filled with the sounds of daughters Bella and Gabby playing Lego surrounded by green decor. But on Celtics game day, it transforms.  Friends and neighbors fill the room, their names on plaques at the ""bar."" During game breaks, Carbone hosts trivia, and the winning answer gets a piece of priceless Celtics history.  ""I look at everything from like a historical perspective,"" Carbone told WBZ-TV.  He has bricks from the old Boston Garden, pieces of the floor, Larry Bird signed memorabilia, and more. Plus, it all sits next to his kids' tee ball hats – because he wants to show them that they, too, can sit next to the greats.  For Carbone, the passion began at a young age, when his father offered to volunteer at autograph signings for the athletes.  The Carbones would be paid in autographs for their time. The catch? John's dad didn't even love sports; he just saw his son's passion and created the pathway to a lifetime of love for the game.  Carbone later worked at the Garden Pro Shop, and now manages a Celtics collector's Facebook page with thousands of members. He's the go-to person when people need to determine if something they're buying is legitimate.  Carbone is preparing to host friends and newcomers for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Wednesday. His prediction?  ""Knowing the Celtics and seeing them, I think they can beat the Heat handedly. But I can see them having like a 40-point lead and then maybe losing by one in one game. So I'm going to say Celtics in six,"" he said."

The only active head coach who has won more games than him is Gregg Popovich. But at this point, when NBA fans think of Rivers, one of the first things that usually comes to mind is his not-so-storied history of blowing series leads.  Toward the end of their blowout Game 7 loss to the Boston Celtics (a series in which they once held a 3-2 series advantage), The Athletic’s Mike Prada tweeted out this eye-opening statistic:  Assuming Philly doesn't rally, Doc Rivers-coached teams will fall to 16-33 when they have three wins in a seven-game series. — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Rivers is 16-33 in playoff games where his team already has three wins. That’s a win percentage of roughly 32.7%, which is right around the same win percentage the lowly Charlotte Hornets mustered up during the regular season (32.9%).  Now, high-stakes playoff games are much more difficult to win than banal regular season matchups, so comparing Rivers to the Hornets isn’t 100 percent fair. But when you compare his record to that of other coaches in those situations, the disparity in his performance compared to theirs becomes far more pronounced.  Here is a look at some other win-loss records of coaches with three wins in a playoff series (all the data provided by Prada):  Now, it isn’t completely fair to compare Rivers to the likes of Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, and Erik Spoelstra. Those guys are some of the best to ever do it. Of course, they will have incredible win-loss records in these sorts of games.  However, what is very telling is that even George Karl – a coach with a similar reputation to Rivers in regards to his affinity for blowing series leads – has a 50% win percentage in these situations.  To put some even more context on the matter, here are some of the highlights (or rather lowlights) of that 16-33 record:  Doc Rivers teams have also now blown three 3-1 leads, four other 3-2 leads, one other 2-0 lead, and have lost Game 7 at home four times (five if you count the bubble).    He's now 6-10 in Game 7s. https://t.co/ha0spYfvUa — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Arguably the craziest of all those blown leads is the fact that he’s conceded three 3-1 leads. In the history of the NBA Playoffs, a team has come back from a 3-1 series deficit only 13 times. That means that about 23.1% of all 3-1 collapses in NBA history have happened under Rivers’ watch.  Now, this isn’t to say Rivers is a bad coach or anything or that his legacy is set in stone. He’s got an NBA title to his name, and he’s still only 61 years old, with another two years left on his contract.  All told, Rivers is still a good coach (you need to be to get a chance to blow that many series leads!), and he’ll hopefully get another shot to nip his lead-blowing demons in the bud. But in the meantime, brother, that is a tough record to have."

The game was in development at Industrial Toys, a studio founded by Bungie veteran Alex Seropian and acquired by EA in 2018. Seropian told MobileGamer.biz that at the start of development on Battlefield Mobile, things were looking ""super good"" due to the shooter genre growing on mobile, the strength of the Battlefield franchise, and the caliber of the team.  However, the tepid reception to Battlefield 2042's launch in 2021 combined with Apple's changes to its ""identifier for advertisers"" (IDFA) system, and other factors, contributed to EA making the call to close up shop.  The community reaction to Battlefield 2042, which was not good, led to a ""bunch of introspection"" about the future of the Battlefield series, Seropian said. As for the IDFA changes, in essence, it made user acquisition ""a lot more expensive,"" Seropian explained.  ""So organics eroded away with 2042's release, and paid distribution got an order of magnitude more expensive because of the IDFA rules,"" he said.  EA also canceled Apex Legends Mobile, another title that many believed could be a big success and help expand the brand beyond console/PC in a way that Call of Duty Mobile did. Seropian said people can ""fill in the blanks"" and make some educated guesses as to why EA pulled back from Apex Legends Mobile, too.  ""I don't know if EA has talked about why they canceled it, whether it was economics or whatever, but without me saying, you could fill in the blanks, I guess,"" he said.  Battlefield Mobile's soft launch in a number of territories apparently performed well, but Seropian's team needed more time and money to get the game ready for a global rollout. Battlefield Mobile was also not planned to be a ""connected"" experience with other versions of Battlefield in a way that skins for a game like Fornite, for example, also move with players across devices. Battlefield Mobile was going to be a ""bespoke experience for mobile,"" with the gameplay tailored to a mobile experience.  The challenges of Battlefield 2042, Apple's IDFA rule changes, the team needing more time and money, and the bespoke nature of Battlefield Mobile all contributed to EA eventually calling it quits, Seropian said.  EA isn't abandoning the Battlefield series, though. Battlefield 2042 is in a much better state these days and the game continues to get new updates. Looking further out, EA has outlined a strategy for a Battlefield connected universe that includes multiple titles from multiple teams. And it's not just about multiplayer, either, as Halo veteran Marcus Lehto's team at Ridgeline Games is making a Battlefield single-player campaign."

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.

The loss dropped the Pirates out of the tournament just a game short of qualifying for this week’s state tournament in Mesquite.  The game against Boulder City came immediately after the Pirates had fought their way through a huge win against Clark High School to advance to the semi-final. The Pirates began that game from behind as Clark had stepped out to a 2-1 lead in the first inning.  But the Pirates took the lead with three runs in a critical third inning. Tyelar Anderson brought one of those home with a ground out. Kyndall Longman hit a single that scored another run in the frame.  The Pirates kept the lead from there, scoring two more runs in the top of the final inning. The final score was 6-3.  The win advanced the Pirate girls to the big game which immediately followed against the Eagles. Though they were tired in this second game of the day, after a week of rigorous competition, the Moapa team gave their all. The Pirates ended up outhitting the Boulder City team 6-5. But they struggled to put runs on the board.  The fatigue showed specifically on defense where the Pirates gave up 16 runs in the game.  Moapa pulled ahead early in the game scoring 4 runs in the top of the first inning. Boulder City answered with 3 runs of their own in the bottom of the frame.  The Moapa team managed another run to start the second inning. But the Eagles answered with five runs in the bottom of the inning and six more in the third to take a commanding lead that they would not give up. This seemed to take the wind from the Pirate sails. The team didn’t score again and the game was called on the mercy rule in the fifth inning.  The Pirates had begun the tournament with a 3-2 loss to Clark on Monday afternoon in Las Vegas. They spent the rest of the week marching their way through the consolation bracket.  Moapa blanked Canyon Springs on Tuesday for a 15-0 victory. Then they battled with Pahrump Valley on Wednesday for a close 14-13 win. That brought them to the long Thursday double-game schedule with Clark and Boulder City.  The Pirate team ended as 3rd in the Southern Region, just short of the state championship running.  MVHS Head Coach John Stastny said that the season had been full of learning life lessons for both girls and coaches.  “During the tournament we realized that all of the little things really matter and m,ake the difference against good teams in intense situation,” Stastny said. “It takes a group of individuals, willing to work on those small things in their own positions, who come together and give 100 percent to their team in order to experience success.”  Stastny added that he loved working with the girls of this year’s team. “I loved our mix of 4 seniors, 5 juniors, a sophomore and a freshman,” he said. “I hope that the girls form a bond and enjoy working with each other, even if they aren’t best friends off of the softball diamond.”"

Instead, it’s a game, with each side trying to outthink and outmaneuver the other. Bad actors can choose when and how to exploit vulnerabilities, but defenders need to know all possible inroads and be prepared for a range of outcomes. Threat intelligence (TI) can give agencies a meaningful advantage by providing situational awareness in context.  Still, gathering knowledge is only part of how the game is played. Staying ahead of adversaries essentially comes down to three elements: visibility, capabilities, and governance, and all are tied to the impact of TI on your security posture.  Awareness delivers a decision advantage  TI is about predicting the future, not explaining the past. Its job is to give you greater awareness, helping you anticipate an adversary’s next move. By correlating internal data, open-source information and third-party inputs, TI helps you spot obscure connections and patterns. This is crucial to identifying threats early enough to do something about them; TI is vital for rationalizing strategies, placing bets, and dynamically rethinking countermeasures.  A smarter defense looks at all the angles  Some attackers are after a specific prize, but in some cases, you might actually be a target of chance, not a target of choice. This means intruders aren’t looking for something specific, and if blocked in one direction, they may simply try another.  That’s why generating intelligent responses to threats takes diversity of thought and perspectives. Angles are not just technical; they are informed by people with different functional, operational, and even life experience backgrounds. Responses today are less about suppressing a single alert and more about stringing alerts together to look through the eyes of the adversary, informing a broader community defense model.  Augmenting the human touch  AI-based automation can play a critical role across the three stages of TI: collection, analysis, and dissemination. AI empowers human decision makers to keep pace with, if not get ahead of, attackers.  AI can also lift long-standing burdens that many agencies face. First, there’s the issue of alert fatigue; if each alarm represents a top priority, how can analysts, who are already spread too thin, choose which fire to fight first? Next, the siloed or bespoke systems found throughout government require too many separate queries, which adds a complexity and time barrier to cyber defense. AI can enable higher confidence, faster, and better coordinated processes, so you can quickly identify the threat and mount an appropriate response.  Governance is everyone’s business  Zero Trust embodies the rules and principles that govern security across the agency. A Zero Trust approach also supports every player on the defensive team, making everyone across the agency essential to security.  Under Zero Trust principles, TI informs a common operational picture of your threat landscape, and surfaces threats that would most likely impact your agency’s operations. This enables you to focus on the bad actors and threat vectors most likely to impact your agency’s operations.  The best strategies are intelligence-led  We’ve all worked tirelessly dealing with threats, and while as an industry, we’re getting better, the challenge is getting harder faster than we are getting better. We need to start thinking differently: we need to find ways to get more defenders in the game, we need Zero Trust to protect people and data across government (and keep bad actors from looking like good ones), we need AI to grow the effectiveness of our cyber strategies, and we need threat intelligence to inform and drive our priorities. Going forward, this is how the game of cyber security will be played.  Read more about integrating security intelligence tools to defend against modern threats.

It's a two-player board game that plays out on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns putting pieces on the grid. The objective is to get a line of four pieces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, across the board.  This sounds like Connect 4, but rather than using pieces of different colours - I'm red and you're blue - Quarto's pieces are little towers that have a mix of four different characteristics. Pieces can be tall or sort, square or round, can be solid or hollow, and can be dark or light. Every piece is some of these things, so one will be dark, short, hollow, and round. Another will be solid, short, dark and square. The objective is to ensure that every piece in the line of four pieces you make shares at least one characteristic. You don't have to place all the pieces in the line, but you do have to complete it, at which point you shout ""Quarto!""  One final rule. Your opponent chooses the piece you play each turn, and you choose the piece they play.  To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings  Quarto is extremely good. God, it's quick, too. Our set arrived last night and my daughter went from bemusement as I tried to explain the rules to absolutely flattening me in the space of ten minutes. I love the simplicity of it, but also the fiendishness. That 4x4 grid? Not a lot of real estate there, so you're elbow to elbow from an early point in the game. I also love the ritual of politely handing your enemy the absolute most useless piece you can find, smiling at them sweetly, and wishing them well.  Deep down - maybe not so deep down, actually - I think Quarto's about zugzwang, a word I might be badly misusing, but which is so much fun to type I'm going to take the risk. From my understanding zugzwang comes from games like chess, the idea being that it's a state in which you have to make a move, but any move you make will damage you significantly, and you know this.  That's Quarto. There gets a point where you're going to have to hand your opponent a piece that will win them the game, or a point at which you've maneuvered your opponent into a position where they have to hand you a winning piece. So it's all about tempo. It's also all about your options disappearing. After about four turns each the board will often be in a state where nobody wants to play a light piece or a square piece anymore, say, as both are contributing to lines that are almost complete. You're trying to screw over your opponent, but in this weird world of total information.  I've been after a game like this for some time, a game which is simple, quick, and sort of self-contained, by which I mean it draws you and the person you're playing with so deeply into a shared world that you might as well both be sitting in the drum of a washing machine as you play. The rest of the world disappears. Strangers have no clue what you're doing. And then the game turns against you and your enemy shouts, ""Quarto!"""

Now, as the Amerks return to Rochester in Round 3, they’re leading the series by two games. While the situations are in stark opposition, the focus is still the exact same.  Just win one game.  That’s been the message from the coaching staff — and from the leadership group in the locker room — for the last five games. As the Amerks faced elimination in three-straight games, the mindset stayed the same: just win one game. And the Amerks did.  They won one game.  And then they won one game, again.  And then they won one game to advance to the North Division finals.  Tomorrow, in front of the home crowd, the Amerks will try to win one game. And they’ll try to eliminate the Marlies from the Calder Cup Playoffs as they do so. It won’t be an easy task against the top-seeded Toronto team, even with a 2-0 series lead.  “Our guys know how hard it is to end someone’s season,” Amerks head coach Seth Appert said after practice on Tuesday. “We have a tremendous amount of respect for Toronto, but our focus is just preparing to just win a game.”  The preparation for the game comes in having good habits at practice, it comes in productive video sessions, and it comes with rest, too. “What can we do today, on a Tuesday, to get ready, to put ourselves mentally and physically in the best position to win one game,” Appert said.  There have been adjustments since the two games in Toronto, aimed at finding ways to exploit Toronto’s weak spots and take away their strengths. There have also been adjustments made to the Amerks’ game, and a focus on tweaking the penalty kill.  Before assessing the PK, though, Appert made sure to give credit to Toronto, who had the second-best power play in the league throughout the regular season. “At the end of the day, it’s really important you stay out of the box,” he explained. “You can kill off two or three, but if you’re giving them four, five, or six, usually a good power play like Toronto is going to get you.”  Rochester is also seeing a good power play during the playoffs so far. The Amerks’ unit ranks second in the league, converting on 34.6% of power plays in seven games. Rookie Jiri Kulich has scored four of his five postseason goals on the power play.  Jiri Kulich has scored a goal in every playoff game he’s played in…    The rookie is HOT 🔥 pic.twitter.com/anldTns8GR — x-Rochester Americans (@AmerksHockey) May 13, 2023  In fact, he has a goal in every playoff game he’s suited up for. Kulich’s 5-game goal streak matches the longest in an AHL postseason since Peter Holland for Toronto in 2014.  “We’re all extremely impressed with Jiri,” Appert said. “I think that it’s just a biproduct of the work he’s been putting in, especially in the second half of the season.""  ""His habits, the maturity to his game, competing for the puck, those things started to take off at a high level and his offensive numbers went with it.”  Kulich led the Rochester squad with 24 goals, and 17 of those came in the second-half of the season. His nine power play goals were also best on the team. “A player of his caliber, when you have the puck, good things can happen,” Appert said.  The Amerks are hoping for a few good things tomorrow night, but one thing is certain: the crowd is going to be electric. Wednesday night’s game is very quickly approaching a sellout, with over 9,500 tickets out.  The team is excited to play in front of the rowdy home crowd and to use the home ice to their advantage. “I thought in the Syracuse series, we did a great job of bringing the fans into the fight,” Appert said. Big hits, fights, and early goals: “Those are things that really get a crowd going. Let’s make sure we do those things early and often.”  And just win one game.  Only a handful of tickets remain for Game 3 at Blue Cross Arena on Wednesday night. The first 5,000 fans will receive a red Round 3 rally towel, and fans can enjoy Pregame Happy Hour, presented by the Genesee Brewery: get $2 beers until puck drop at the Genesee Brewhouse inside Blue Cross Arena.  Fans can also get the playoff party started early at the Genesee Brewhouse: Sabres Live will be broadcasting live from 12-1pm and then Marty & Duffer will be hanging out until 2pm! They'll have Amerks x Genny t-shirts to give away... and maybe a pair of tickets, too."

Or in the words of its developers Irreverent Labs, entered ""indefinite hibernation"". The game would have starred 'mechabots': Robotic chickens that were being sold as NFTs to verify each chicken's uniqueness. It was intended as a so-called ""play-to-earn"" game where players would level the chickens and theoretically sell them on at a higher price. I'm not making this up.  This hype video shows (opens in new tab) the production values weren't too bad, though as soon as the fighting starts it's pretty clear this wouldn't have been a good game. But then the game's cancellation is probably the least bizarre thing about this whole story. The studio behind the game has one of the most irritating websites I've ever used (opens in new tab) and has pivoted away from NFTs onto a new area of focus: AI. That may seem like swapping one grift for another, but it's even more astonishing in the light of the fact it raised $40 million in private funding to make MechaFightClub (opens in new tab), disclosed in an SEC filing.  At least some of the cash still remains. The one silver lining for fans of MechaFightClub (presuming there are any) is that Irrereverent Labs announced the cancellation alongside a buyback program called, and again I'm not making this up, Sol 4 Cocks.  It’s time for Sol 4 Cocks: we’re repurchasing your Mechabots and putting MFC into indefinite hibernation. This was a tough decision. For more details, visit our official announcement here: https://t.co/TPfb1VP2C7 pic.twitter.com/6YnO4g50T4May 11, 2023 See more  Sol refers to the popular cryptocurrency Solana, which is currently trading at around $21 per unit. So the buyback offer values each robot chicken at $378. Look, I just work here.  Irreverent Labs' official statement on what's happened reads as equal parts misleading and delusional (opens in new tab). It also says absolutely everything about this corner of the industry that the first two pages (of four) are dedicated to the risk of scams around Sol 4 Cocks, before going on to moan about those pesky regulators and how they made the NFT cockfighting dream impossible.  ""The theme, culture, art, story and underpinning goals of MFC remain with us, but we can’t continue to develop it as a blockchain game,"" says Irreverent Labs. ""Unfortunately, the regulatory and operations environment around blockchain within the USA has drastically changed in the last two years.  ""We are an American company, and a lack of clarity is making it difficult for blockchain companies to operate here. In the current regulatory confusion, we simply couldn’t create an in-game economy without concern about the regulatory ramifications. We have no way to know how long this will continue, or when it will get better. We simply can’t ask you to wait any longer.""  It's not that the bottom is falling out of the crypto market or people have completely lost whatever confidence there ever was in NFTs, then. It's the government! It does make you wonder where that $40 million came from, and how much more money is sloshing around in lunatic projects like this: Probably more than one would like to imagine.

It's so inviting that even non-gamers should try it.  The new Ultrahand tool is leading to some unexpectedly weird player behavior.  Nintendo  Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (TotK) might not technically be the best game ever made—how would you even measure that anyway, between this and Tetris? But it is already becoming a cultural phenomenon.  The new Zelda (for Switch) came out last Friday, and many of us have been unable to stop playing it ever since. It's the latest in a long line of Zelda games, and a direct sequel to 2017's 'Breath of the Wild', sharing the same game map, control system, and overall art style. Breath of the Wild was already regarded as (another one of) Nintendo's masterpieces, and yet the consensus is that Tears of the Kingdome improves on the original in almost every way.  ""I personally think even this early on, it is by far the best Legend Of Zelda game by a long shot. Is it the best game ever made, however? Honestly, I can’t really say yet,"" Mark Cruz, proprietor of the retro-gaming YouTube channel The Retro Mark Cruz, told Lifewire via email.  Do Literally Anything in 'Tears of the Kingdom'  I grew up playing video games that you loaded into a computer from a tape, and I always dreamed of a game where you could wander the world and interact with pretty much anything. In Zelda, that's exactly what you can do. In fact, you could pretty much make up your own game within a game, building a house, keeping a horse, and foraging for dinner every day. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.  Everything in Tears of the Kingdom has been upgraded. The basic contours of the world are the same, but the world itself has grown and changed. New characters join existing ones, and of course, there are new missions to complete. The world has also expanded up into a shoal of Sky Islands and down into underground cave systems. The visuals are better, the character dialog improved, and the world feels more populated and real.  But the biggest change, and the one that takes this game over the edge, compared to any other game, and will turn Zelda from a game into a meme machine, is the Ultrahand.  TotK Ultrahand and Korok Torture  The Ultrahand is an update to BotW's Magnesis, a special power that lets you use a magnetic beam to lift and toss around metallic objects of any size. The Ultrahand extends this ability to pretty much everything around you. Use the beam to lift, turn, and otherwise manipulate fallen tree trunks, apples, swords, boats, and more. And here's the neat part. You can use the Ultrahand to glue things together.  Nintendo  The Ultrahand is essential to completing some puzzles, and you can use it to do practical things like sticking wheels to an old wooden board and attaching a fan to make a car or repairing broken machinery.  But the possibilities are endless. I built a wooden screen on wheels that I rolled past a huge creature sleeping on a bridge, so it wouldn't see me behind it. And other players have gotten a little darker with their creations. One created a giant phallus from a tree trunk and a pair of rocks and used it to beat a creature to death. Another popular pastime, apparently, is torturing Koroks.  Koroks are cute little woodland creatures, and in Tears of the Kingdom, one diversion has you reuniting separated Koroks. Usually, this involves the Ultrahand, which can grab Koroks because they are wearing backpacks. And players are torturing them, crucifying them, tying them up and dragging them behind horses, cooking them on automatic (player-built) rotisseries, and attaching them to rockets.  It's grim stuff, but it shows the creativity possible inside the game. You could literally build a hut by a lake, go fishing, and start obsessively counting things, like in Henry David Thoreau's Walden. In some ways, it's like a basic version of Minecraft, set inside an existing game world. Although given that one person has recreated 'Breath of the Wild' in Minecraft, it seems that Minecraft will still have the edge.  Nintendo  ""My daughter is mostly about taming all kinds of horses. She also finds out glitches to lead her horse into deep water and stuff,"" said Zelda player and parent Dr. K in a forum thread participated in by Lifewire.  Even if you're not into building things for the sake of building them, this single new dynamic totally changes how you inhabit the world in Tears of the Kingdom. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some shelves to put up."

Universal has released the first teaser for the Blumhouse horror film, giving viewers their first look at how the popular survival horror video game’s terrifying animatronics will be brought to life.  “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is based on the video game franchise created by Scott Cawthon, which released its first entry in 2014 and quickly rocketed to massive popularity. Throughout the different games, players are tasked with surviving the onslaught of hostile animatronic characters inside the haunted Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza restaurant, using security cameras, lights and doors to survey the area.  The new teaser reveals how those game mechanics have been incorporated into the adaptation, with film starring Josh Hutcherson as a hapless security guard.  Cawthon first announced the film adaptation in 2015 to much excitement from fans. But from there, it was a rocky road. Warner Bros. acquired the rights, but, after two years of silence, Cawthon announced that the project was “back to square one.” After losing a series of directors, Jason Blum announced he would be adapting the project through his Blumhouse production company in 2017.  Earlier this year, Universal announced that “Five Nights at Freddy’s” would debut on the streaming service Peacock on the same day of its theatrical release, replicating the day-and-date release strategy by other high-profile Blumhouse productions such as “Halloween Kills” and “Halloween Ends”  Directed by Emma Tammi, “Five Nights at Freddy’s” also stars Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, Kat Conner Sterling, Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard, as well as animatronic designs and technology by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.

That’s how it goes from game to game and season to season.  Whether they like it or not, that’s also been especially true for the Petoskey baseball team this season.  Splits have been a common occurrence for the Northmen throughout the year and it’s been reflected honestly in their 2023 record.  When they welcomed in Alpena for a Big North Conference doubleheader Tuesday at Turcott Field, another split came their way.  The Northmen dropped a 2-1 opener, then leaned on the pitching of senior Max Ferrin to collect a 3-0 victory in game two.  The split moved Petoskey to 11-11 overall and 4-4 within the Big North, with one matchup vs. TC West left on the schedule.  While they've collected 11 losses on the season, the margin for error has been razor thin for Petoskey. They've dropped eight of those 11 games by a single run, including three of their last four and three of their four BNC defeats have come by a lone run.  In the opener Tuesday, both sides found opportunities on the base paths, though runs were tougher to come by.  Grant Slater went seven innings with seven hits and no walks allowed, while striking out six batters.  Both teams plated a run in the sixth, before Alpena then put one on unanswered in the seventh.  Slater also singled twice and Peyton Harmon also added a single for the Northmen. Tyler Goeldel also had an RBI.  In game two, Petoskey spread runs across the first, third and sixth innings and that was plenty for what Ferrin was dealing to the dish.  The senior went all seven innings with one hit and no walks allowed, while also striking out six.  Ferrin allowed a first inning double to the Wildcats, then didn’t allow an Alpena base runner over the next six innings, as the Wildcats went three up, three down the rest of the way.  It dropped Ferrin’s season ERA to 2.10, with 41 strikeouts across 33 and a third.  Petoskey’s run production came behind just four hits, with Ferrin, Harmon, Haden Janes and Kam Horn all singling on.  The Northmen hit a busy stretch ahead to try to pull away from the .500 mark, as they head to Rudyard on Wednesday, May 17, then down to Bay City Western on Saturday, May 20.  They’ll also wrap up BNC play with a visit from Traverse City West on Monday, May 22."

(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)  Todd Bowles admits he only looks at three things on Bucs schedule by Josh Hill  While listing each NFL team’s one must-watch game this upcoming season, The Athletic missed the mark on its pick for the Buccaneers.  Now that the NFL schedule has finally been released, we can fill the upcoming dead period on the football calendar with rampant speculation about how games four months out will go.  That’s not a knock, either. Despite what Todd Bowles says, part of what makes the schedule so much fun to look at is the blank slate of promise and hope it represents. Who looked at the Cincinnati Bengals 2022 schedule and had them in the Super Bowl? Did anyone outside of Philly look at the Eagles schedule and predict an 8-0 start?  Hitting a bit closer to home, so many folks had the Bucs as a 12-win team this time last year, only to watch the team finish under .500 and limp into the playoffs.  Breaking down the schedule is fun because there’s no way to actually be right. Is there a more Extremely Online thing than that?  While it’s impossible to be right about predicting a team’s schedule this time of year, it is possible to be wrong — or at least misguided — about how it’s interpreted.  The Athletic lists one must-watch game for Buccaneers in 2023  A recent piece in The Athletic picked one must-watch game for each team in the NFL, selecting the Week 3 game against the Eagles for Tampa Bay. While the game is one of the Buccaneers two primetime matchups this year — assuming they don’t get flexed later in the season — it’s not the one must-watch game on the schedule.  Dan Pompeii argues the intrigue revolves around what it will tell us about kind of team Tampa Bay will be this season.  Pompeii writes:  The Bucs’ first prime-time game in 2023 will tell us everything we need to know. After opening up at Minnesota and hosting Chicago, they play the defending NFC champions on a Monday night. If the Bucs can give the Eagles a game, it will be an indication that the obituaries were premature.  He’s not entirely wrong, but the Buccaneers will not be making or breaking their season three weeks in.  There’s a chance the Bucs get their doors blown off by a vastly superior team, which would tell us in the moment that they’re not contenders. Writing off a team in September is foolish, even a team with seemingly as little to look forward to as Tampa Bay.  How many times have teams encountered early season turbulence only to later turn it around. Last year Tom Brady navigated a season full of turbulence before crashing out in the playoffs, and we’ve seen teams find ways to turn it around after slow starts.  It’s fair to question whether the Bucs have the right pieces to pull that off, but to suggest a what could be an 0-3 start means the season is over is simply wrong. If that’s the case, why even play the remaining 14 games on the schedule and skip right to picking No. 1 overall in April?  Week 3 will border on a must-watch if the Buccaneers come into the game with one or more wins, but it’s certainly not the hinge on which the season will swing."

Each generation many of the most popular games are multiplayer games. The problem with multiplayer games is when people lose interest, the cost of maintaining servers outweighs the money coming in. When this happens, the servers are promptly shut down, and in cases where the game requires an online connection and/or is strictly multiplayer, it becomes unplayable. And because of this, it ends up being removed from sale. This is the fate of many multiplayer games, including 2012's free-to-play first-person mech shooter Hawken That said, Hawken is coming back tomorrow as Hawken Reborn.  The news comes the way of 505 Games, the developer and publisher of the original game and the developer and publisher of this comeback. The game is set to debut in early access form via Steam Early Access and PC on May 17. When it will fully release, there's no word. There is also no word of it coming to console. What there is word of is that like its predecessor it will be free-to-play.  ""Welcome to the world of Illal, a planet once thought to be humanity's future utopia, turned into a grim dystopia driven by corporate corruption and greed,"" reads an official blurb about the game. ""Illicit terraforming poisoned the atmosphere and a terrible accident gave birth to the 'Giga,' a nanite plague that ravaged half the planet. Become a mercenary pilot, pitting your mech against the dangers of Illal, gaining fame, fortune, and resources to reach the truth behind its bodyguard of lies.""  Right now there's no word of what type of Steam Deck compatibility there will be when the game releases tomorrow in early access. It will presumably be playable on the handheld machines but it remains to be seen whether work has gone into making sure it's verified in time for release.  As always, feel free to leave a comment or two letting us know what you think. Are you interested in checking out Hawken out on PC five years after the game's servers went dark in 2018 or have you moved on from the free-to-play mech shooter in favor of other, newer multiplayer experiences?"

That meant, of course, that they likely were going to struggle to score.  That indeed was what happened on Tuesday night as the Cardinals were held to just two runs, one coming on another Nolan Arenado home run, and saw their four-game winning streak come to an end with the loss to the Brewers at Busch Stadium.  The loss extended a longer streak for Montgomery as he fell to 0-6 in his last seven starts, all of which the Cardinals have lost. Montgomery has not won since his second start of the season, on April 8 at Milwaukee.  In five of those losses, including Tuesday night, Montgomery did not allow more than three runs. The Cardinals have scored a combined 10 runs while Montgomery was in the game in his last seven starts.  Here is how Tuesday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Arenado homered for the fifth consecutive game, one off the longest streak of his career, which he did for the Rockies in 2015 … The Cardinnals other run scored in the fourth on a two-out double by Tommy Edman and a single by Brendan Donovan … The Cardinals left at least one runner on base in every inning except the first inning, including two in both the eighth and ninth innings. They left 12 runners on base for the game and were just 1-of-9 with runners in scoring position … Nolan Gorman’s streaks of an extra-base hit and an RBI both ended at five games.  On the mound: Montgomey gave up a run on a pair of doubles in the first inning, then allowed solo homers in the fifth and sixth. He struck out seven and was able to get out of a bases-loaded jam in the fifth. He had allowed only two home runs against 96 batters faced at Busch this season prior to Tuesday night … Jordan Hicks, Andre Pallante and Drew VerHagen combined to allow just one hit over the final 3 1/3 innings.  Key stat: Despite falling back to nine games under .500 at 17-26, the Cardinals have a plus-six run differential for the year. They are just 2-9 in games decided by one run.  Worth noting: The alignment of Donovan in left, Lars Nootbaar in center and Edman in right was the 16th different combination of outfielders to start for the Cardinals in their first 43 games. They have not used any alignment in more than six games … Gorman made his first start against a lefthander but that lasted only one at-bat before Wade Miley had to come out of the game because of a lat strain. Gorman hit into a fielder’s choice in that at-bat and did get another at-bat against a lefthander later in the game and struck out, leaving him 0-of-9 this season against lefthanders … Dylan Carlson (sprained ankle) is still considered day to day. He was able to take swings righthanded in the batting cage on Tuesday and manager Oli Marmol said “we’re going to give it another day and see where he’s at. There was definite progress today.” … Further research after Monday night’s game found that the last time the Cardinals had three players each drive in at least four runs in the same game was on Aug. 9, 1932.  Looking ahead: It was announced after the game that Matthew Liberatore will be recalled from Memphis to start against Corbin Burnes in the final game of the series on Wednesday night.  Adam Wainwright and the rest of the starters will move back a day in a temporary six-man rotation  Follow Rob Rains on Twitter @RobRains  Share this: Twitter  Facebook  Skype  Email    Like this: Like Loading..."

Please wager responsibly.  The two combatants in the NBA Eastern Confernce final have arrived at this destination in entirely different manners. The Boston Celtics displayed their resiliency, rebounding from a 3-2 series deficit to take out the Philadelphia 76ers in a seven-game second-round series.  For the Miami Heat, they’ve maintained control throughout their first two series. The Heat have never trailed in beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games and taking out the New York Knicks in six games.  All of that serves to make Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final perhaps a little bit bigger than an opening game might seem during a seven-game set. The Heat have opened both playoff rounds with road victories. What happens to Miami if Boston were to whip the Heat in Game 1?  Oddsmakers are expecting exactly that to happen. It’s the Celtics who are set as eight-point home favorites in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference final on Wednesday at TD Garden (TNT, 8:30 pm ET).  Heat vs. Celtics betting trends  Miami is 2-0 both straight up and against the spread in Game 1 of playoff series this spring, winning both on the road. The Heat covered as 10-point road underdogs in Game 1 of their opening-round series at Milwaukee, beating the Bucks outright 130-117.  Boston is 1-1 both SU and ATS when playing Game 1 of a playoff series this year. The Celtics opened the postseason by winning outright at home over Atlanta as 10-point home favorites over the Hawks in successive games. However, since that time, Boston has been favored by 8+ points three times. The Celtics are 0-3 both SU and ATS in all three of those games. They dropped Game 1 of the second round at home to Philadelphia by a 119-115 count as the 10.5-point home chalk.  FanDuel Sportsbook MA $150 BONUS BETS! CLAIM OFFER 21+ and present in MA.

Miami is 7-2 both SU and ATS over the past nine games. Boston is 11-5 SU in the last 16 games and 12-5 ATS over the last 17 games. Head-to-head this season, there’s little to choose between the two teams. Both clubs are 2-2 SU and ATS overall and 1-1 SU and ATS at home. Boston is 2-1 SU and ATS as a betting favorite over Miami. The Heat are 1-0 SU and ATS as the betting pick over the Celtics.  The total for Game 1 is set at 201.5 points. The total has gone over in eight of the last 11 games for both the Heat and the Celtics. Eight of the last 10 Miami vs. Boston games at TD Garden have also gone over. In four meetings this season, Miami and Boston are 2-2 on the total. Both games in Boston went over, while each game at Miami went under.  Miami stealing Boston’s thunder?  At the outset of the playoffs, with the Bruins setting NHL regular-season marks for wins and points and the Celtics challenging for top spot in the NBA standings, there was talk of Boston sweeping the NHL and NBA titles. Caesars Sportsbook even put forth a prop bet on a Boston title double. No city has ever won both championships in the same season.  However, the Bruins blew a 3-1 series lead and were bounced in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Florida Panthers, who also call South Beach home. Now, with the Panthers in NHL final four, it is Miami which is poised to do this unique double.  DraftKings Massachusetts $150 Bonus Bets! CLAIM OFFER 21+. Physically present in MA.

To do their part, the Heat will have to overcome both history and the odds. As a No. 8 seed, Miami is seeking to emulate the 1999 New York Knicks, the only eight seed ever to reach the NBA Finals. The Knicks were quashed in five games by the San Antonio Spurs.  Boston is set as overwhelming -525 favorites to win the Eastern Conference title. Miami is a +400 long shot to beat the Celtics, and the +1400 fourth betting choice to win the NBA Finals. Boston is the +105 chalk to lift the Larry O’Brien Trophy.  Heat can’t match Celtics depth  As impressive as Miami’s run has been, the worrisome part is that it’s been mostly done on the broad shoulders of Jimmy Butler. Last season, when the Heat pushed the Celtics to seven games, Butler scored 41 and 47 points in two of Miami’s three victories.  With Tyler Herro (hand) out, can anyone consistently provide a second scoring option for Miami against Boston’s stifling defense? That’s the issue the Heat are facing.  Meanwhile, Boston can count on double dipping in elite scoring talent with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Tatum poured in 51 points in Game 7 against the 76ers. Brown is averaging 24.6 points per game in the playoffs.  Pick: Boston Celtics -8 (-110).  Heat vs. Celtics same-game parlay  After surviving the stern test provided by Philadelphia, there’s a sense that Boston is more ready for the next test than Miami, which had it easy against the relatively defenseless Knicks. A blowout Celtics win in Game 1 doesn’t seem to be an unreasonable outcome, so we’ll set out assembling a same-game parlay by going with Boston -8 in the point spread at odds of -110.  Let’s couple that with a Tatum prop. No, he’s not going to score 51 again, but will he go over his points prop for Game 1 of 28.5? He’s only done so twice in his last six games, but is averaging 30.8 ppg against the Heat this season.

April showers bring May flowers?  The flowers are blooming and the bats are ringing for Luis Robert Jr. in May.  And in the past four games, Robert Jr. has rounded the bases and walked to the dugout to be donned with the notorious White Sox gangster jacket and top hat. We all know what that means.  4 HRs in 4-straight games for Luis ð£    He won't stop mashing! pic.twitter.com/FwGC53SW4V — White Sox Talk (@NBCSWhiteSox) May 17, 2023  Before the May flowers grew colorfully and festooned a string of Robert's at-bats, there were April showers. A lot of them, too. In fact, in 99 at-bats in April, Robert Jr. recorded 20 hits for a .202 batting average. He struck out 28 times and walked just four times in 105 plate appearances.  He went through one of the worst hitting slumps of his career. Mixed in with that, he was benched during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays for jogging to first base on a groundball he could've beat. He wasn't in the lineup the subsequent game either.  But all of that changed in May. What's the secret to his recent success?  He's somewhat adapted to the new hitting coaching staff's method of incorporating technology, specifically the iPitch machine, into the practice routine. But Robert is instinctually hesitant to delve into the numbers too far.  ""There is too much information that I don’t like to look at,"" Robert Jr. told James Fegan of The Athletic. ""To me, the simpler the better. Once you are at home plate, you can’t be thinking of all that stuff. You have to be thinking of the pitcher, what pitch and the speed of the pitch that he has, nothing more than that.""  Whatever he's doing, it's working. In the 14 games the Sox have played so far in May, Robert Jr. is hitting .408 from the plate with 20 hits, seven home runs, 15 RBIs and 17 runs scored. He has just as many walks as he had in the previous 26 games and just 10 strikeouts in 46 at-bats.  Let's not forget. Robert is arguably the best defensive center fielder in the game right now. He holds defensive runs saved (DFRS) value of 7, well above the rest of the competition. At this rate, he could be in the mix for a Gold Glove in the outfield, which would be the second of his career.  But right now, the rest of the White Sox are riding off Robert Jr.'s energy, taking it in as they watch from the dugout. If Robert Jr. homers on Wednesday, he will tie A.J. Pierzynski's franchise record for the longest streak with a home run.  ""It's incredible,"" Gavin Sheets told the media after Tuesday's win over the Cleveland Guardians. ""I've been hitting behind him most the games and what he's been doing, he's been locked in. It's been a lot of fun to watch. It doesn't surprise me one bit with the talent he's got but whenever a guy like him gets hot it's a lot of fun to watch.""  Click here to follow the White Sox Talk Podcast."

Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert’s solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland’s Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Manager Terry Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBIs, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan’s double, which ended Lynn’s night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated another run.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, manager Pedro Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Indians: RHP Aaron Civale (oblique strain) is expected to throw 50 pitches in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday. ... Francona said RHP Triston McKenzie, (teres major strain) is expected to be assigned “somewhere” to pitch on Saturday.  White Sox: Returned LHP Garrett Crochet (Tommy John surgery) from his rehab assignment from Charlotte and optioned RHP Nick Padilla. The 6-foot-6 Crochet, who hasn’t pitched in the majors since Oct. 1, 2021, was expected to be available from the bullpen. ...

Yesterday, Amazon Games announced that it's taking another stab at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, a little more than two years after its previous effort with Chinese tech giant Tencent was canceled. Now, the same team behind Amazon's New World is developing a new Lord of the Rings MMO in partnership with Embracer Group, which owns the IP rights to the franchise. The project is in early development, so details are light, but we did learn a bit about what to expect from its story and setting in an interview with GamesIndustry.  Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann said there's already plenty of internal debate about how to approach adapting the iconic story of The Lord of the Rings to a modern MMO format.  ""We have some die-hard Lord of the Rings fans, and already [they're saying], 'We can't do that' or Middle-earth [Enterprises] is not going to allow it, and we're not going to be able to alter the story, and introduce new characters, or rewrite the books,"" Hartmann said.  ""But for me, it's still very important that it's first a game, and then a reflection of the books second. So while I need to stay true, I always, and I'm reminding the team already, 'I get it, but it's not about every person going and pointing out if that detail is 100% perfect.' Let's say the way [Tolkien] describes the world, maybe the landscape looks a little bit different because either we can't get it going or the art people feel it might look a little bit different than what people assume it is in the book.""  Of course, The Lord of the Rings Online is going on its 17th year and still receiving substantial updates, including last year's Before the Shadow expansion. Hartmann said he has ""a lot of respect"" for the developers at Standing Stone Games but clarified that, chiefly due to technological advancements, Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO will be ""worlds apart.""  In the meantime, here are the best MMORPGs you can play today."

For the third time this season,  Corpus Christi, TX – The Tulsa Drillers pitching staff has been lighting up the Texas League this season, but that was not the case on Tuesday night as the Corpus Christi Hooks offense accomplished something that has happened just two other times this season. For the third time this season, the Drillers gave up at least seven runs in a 7-3 game one loss at Whataburger Field.  Tuesday marked the first game for the Drillers in Corpus Christi since the 2019 season and was the opener of a six-game set with the Hooks.  BOX SCORE  All of the Drillers offense came in the first inning as Jose Ramos gave Tulsa an early lead with a three-run homer.  Tulsa starting pitcher River Ryan also had a great start to his night as he kept the Hooks hitless through the first three innings but ran into trouble in the fourth. Following two walks, Quincy Hamilton tied the game with his three-run homer. A single from Chad Stevens gave Corpus Christi two more runs and a 5-3 lead.  In the fifth inning, the Hooks plated two more on Kenedy Corona’s two-RBI double to take a 7-3 lead.  The game remained scoreless over the next three innings as Jake Pilarski and Lael Lockhart combined to record the final ten outs, and Tulsa's offense earned just three hits after the first inning.  HIGHLIGHTS AND HAPPENINGS:  *All five of Tulsa's hits were recorded by just three batters, as Eddy Leonard and Ramos recorded two hits, and Jorbit Vivas earned one.  *Hooks pitcher Colton Gordon earned a four-inning save as he pitched the final four innings following five innings from starter Rhett Kouba.  *Houston Astros infielder José Altuve made a rehab appearance in the game. He finished 0-5 with one strikeout. Altuve is expected to make two more rehab starts for the Hooks.  *Before the game, the Drillers announced a series of roster moves. Outfielders Jonny DeLuca and Andy Pages were transferred to Oklahoma City, Yusniel Diaz was reinstated from the Injured List and Bryson Brigman was reinstated from the Development List. Pitcher Kevin Gowdy was also added from Extended Spring Training while pitcher Jack Little was placed on the Injured List.

Peacock will present an NFL Wild Card Playoff game in primetime on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2024, starting at 8 p.m. ET under a deal announced by NBCU and the NFL. The Peacock-exclusive Wild Card game will immediately follow a late afternoon NFL Wild Card Playoff game on NBC and Peacock (4:30 p.m. ET on Jan. 13).  With the two Saturday NFL Wild Card games and a Sunday primetime NFL Wild Card game (on NBC and Peacock), NBCU will be the first media company to present three NFL playoff games in a single weekend. In addition, Peacock will carry its first-ever exclusive NFL regular season game on Dec. 23, featuring the Bills at Chargers.  Peacock’s exclusive NFL Wild Card game and regular-season game will be broadcast on NBC stations in the two competing teams’ local markets, per the NFL’s usual requirement. Both games also will be available on mobile devices to subscribers of NFL+.  “We are thrilled to partner with the NFL on this industry milestone, bringing to Peacock the first ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game,” NBC Sports chairman Pete Bevacqua said in a statement. “With America’s No. 1 primetime show for a record 12 consecutive years, the terrific regular season ‘SNF’ schedule revealed last week, and today’s announcement, we can’t wait for the 2023 season to kick off.”  NFL Media chief operating officer Hans Schroeder commented, “We are excited to work with a great partner in Peacock to present the first-ever exclusively live streamed NFL playoff game this upcoming season. Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League, and bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  For the 2023 NFL season, Peacock will once again stream all NBC “Sunday Night Football” games, including the playoffs, and the “Football Night in America” studio show. The exclusive Peacock “Sunday Night Football Final” will return with expanded postgame coverage following “SNF” each week.  NBCU claims Peacock offers the most live sports of any direct-to-consumer streaming service in the U.S. That includes “Sunday Night Football,” Olympic Games, Premier League soccer, Notre Dame football, NASCAR, the NTT IndyCar Series and Big Ten football (beginning in September 2023). Peacock also offers daily sports programming on the NBC Sports channel."

Regular ol' Xbox Game Pass subscribers, those subscribed to the standard tier, do not have a new game to play as of today as the game has been made available via EA Play, which is only available with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. For an extra $5 a month, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get EA Play access, an Xbox Live Gold subscription, and a variety of special perks. As a result of this, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now play FIFA 23. How long, remains to be seen, but the ultra popular 2022 release is now in the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate library, which means subscribers can now also buy it outright for 20 percent cheaper as is customary with every Xbox Game Pass game.  At this point, if you don't know the deal about FIFA then you're not interested in it, which means you're not going to be interested in this additon. One of the longest-running series in gaming, and one of the best-selling, FIFA 23 debuted on September 30, 2022, but has only now been added to EA Play. That said, the installment, in particular, is notable because it marks the end of the 29-year partnership between EA and FIFA. Going forward, EA's soccer games will be called EA Sports FC rather than FIFA.

Will FIFA 23 ever be added to standard Xbox Game Pass? No, probably not.

(2:00)  PARIS -- Hours before finding out his likely destination in the NBA, Victor Wembanyama drew a star-studded crowd in his last regular-season game in France and delivered another game-winning performance in the fourth quarter.  Soccer star Kylian Mbappé and popular French actor Omar Sy were both on hand to watch Wembanyama put up 22 points as his Boulogne-Levallois side won 93-85 in a local derby against Paris Basketball. The French phenom -- and much of the basketball world -- then turned their attention to the NBA draft lottery in Chicago later Tuesday, when he watched the San Antonio Spurs win the No. 1 pick.  Wembanyama, 19, showed a glimpse of why as he scored 14 of his game-high 22 points in the fourth quarter, with the crowd of about 4,000 chanting ""Wemby, Wemby"" as he turned it on late after a slow start.  ""He seemed elsewhere early on, probably at the lottery,"" Metropolitans 92 coach Vincent Collet said. ""But he responded so well. ... He's 19 and his life is going to totally change. Can you understand that? Tonight is a massive moment in his career. It's totally understandable that things were going on in his head.""  Wembanyama treated the crowd to a late one-handed dunk, then tapped his own head repeatedly in appreciation.  One fan responded by bowing with his hands held out when another two-handed dunk with just six seconds left made the teenager the game's top scorer.  Wemby clenched his fist and let out a yell at the final buzzer and then hugged his teammates as the crowd rose to gave the French league's leading scorer a standing ovation at the Palais des Sports Marcel Cerdan.  The 7-foot-5 Wembanyama then did a lap of honor high-fiving fans -- or low-fiving, really, given his height -- and signing autographs.  Wembanyama still has the French league's playoffs to focus on -- starting this weekend -- before he can fully turn his eye to the NBA. But the French crowds are taking every chance to see him while they can, knowing that a similar talent is unlikely to come along soon.  ""I believe he's going to be a Hall of Famer,"" said Paris Basketball coach Will Weaver, a former assistant with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. ""I coached Kevin Durant, Jarrett Allen. I've been around a lot of good, big men that have a lot of unique skills. I just see his professionalism and competitiveness.""  Mbappé, France's World Cup star, is a huge basketball fan and arrived just in time -- about 30 seconds before the start of the game -- to watch another prolific scorer in action.  Though it wasn't a vintage performance from Wemby early.  He got into foul trouble and looked a little tense at times, perhaps because of the occasion. He pointed to his forearm and said ""Mais non!"" (""Not at all!"") when a refereeing decision was not given his way. He bowed his head, then shook it when missing a 3-pointer late in the first quarter.  During one break early in the second quarter, a camera crew on the opposite side rushed to interview Mbappé, who sat on the same row as Wembanyama's parents and close to Sy. Mbappé was still posing for photos seconds before the start of the third quarter and threatening to steal the spotlight.  But then, Wemby, showed again who the main attraction was, taking over the fourth quarter.  Collet, who also coaches France, said he will stay up late to watch the lottery with Wembanyama.  ""Tonight he will know his destination,"" he said. ""I think the team that has the first choice isn't going to get it wrong."""

North discussed several schedule-related topics during a recent interview on ""The Adam Schefter Podcast,"" including this year's inaugural Black Friday game when the Jets will host the Miami Dolphins on Amazon.  North told reporters last week that the Cincinnati Bengals lobbied to host the Black Friday game as an annual fixture. During his interview with Schefter, he mentioned the Jets as another team interested in being an annual host of the holiday game, similar to the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys traditionally hosting nationally televised games on Thanksgiving.  ""I hope I'm not speaking out of turn when I mentioned to people that the Bengals volunteered,"" said North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning. ""There were others that kind of raised their hands for Black Friday as well.""  The league announced last week that this year's Black Friday game would be hosted by the Jets, who will be featured in five additional prime-time games in 2023 with Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback.  ""The Jets, once they found out they were the host team, then started to think about, 'Hey, is this something we could make a permanent fixture as part of the NFL schedule?'"" North said. ""Maybe they didn't raise their hands in February, but now that they have been selected as the Black Friday host, I think they might be interested in it, too.""  Amazon, which will distribute the game on Prime Video, reached out to the league about having one of the NFL's New York teams involved in the inaugural Black Friday game. Amazon suggested that its positioning as a giant retailer and having a game in the top retail market in the country could be a ""fun way"" to introduce the concept. North said last week that the NFL also looked at a potential matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants before settling on Dolphins-Jets.  North told Schefter that the NFL also considered Black Friday rivalry matchups featuring the Bengals hosting either the Pittsburgh Steelers or Baltimore Ravens. He emphasized that he doesn't have the final word on whether the league will implement a permanent host for the Black Friday game, saying that decision will fall on ownership and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.  ""I don't think we were looking for this season to commit to a permanent home for Black Friday,"" North said. ""Let's play one first and let's see what we learn and let's see what makes sense and let's see if it works for our fans, I don't think we were looking on day one to deploy this with a permanent home.  ""But it's certainly something we should talk about. Let's see what happens this year, let's see what the fan reaction is to that day, and I'm sure we'll go back to ownership, we'll go back to membership and we'll talk about would we be interested in it. Is that a good idea for the NFL? I'm sure there's pros and cons to both.""  The Jets acquired Rodgers in a blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers last month, two weeks before the NFL released its full 2023 schedule. North said the protracted Rodgers trade talks did not have much impact on the league's scheduling plan for the Jets, who he referred to as a ""good football team"" with ""exciting skill position players.""  ""I think you would still see a lot of Jets games on national television,"" North said. ""That was a good football team. ... Those games had to be used in national TV windows somewhere."""

The shift to $70 games for the “next-gen” consoles has been slow but steady, and another major publisher could soon be making the jump. Sega said in its latest earnings report that it’s currently reviewing its games to see where price increases make sense, moving in the direction of 2K Games, Square Enix, and other big companies that have already adopted $70 as the new standard price point for blockbuster video games.  “In the global marketplace, AAA game titles for console have been sold at $59.99 for many years, but titles sold at $69.99 have appeared in the last year,” Sega said in a newly translated transcript of the company’s April 28 earnings call (via VGC). “We would like to review the prices of titles that we believe are commensurate with price increases, while also keeping an eye on market conditions.”  Read more  Sega’s most recent blockbuster, a remake of the Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin!, was cross-gen and priced at $60. So was last year’s ambitious Sonic Frontiers, which came to every platform including the Nintendo Switch. It now sounds like the next Yakuza and Sonic games could be the first to tick up to $70. Like a Dragon 8 (as the Yakuza series is known in Japan) is slated to arrive sometime in 2024.  Read More: Sonic Maker Sega Is The Video Game Industry’s Next Union Battleground  After over a decade of prices for high-end games stagnating at $60, Take-Two was the first to race to make NBA 2K21 $70 when it came to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Other companies like Activision, Sony, Square Enix, and Ubisoft followed suit. Redfall was Microsoft’s first $70 game, while The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was Nintendo’s, though the Mario maker says some of its games will remain at $60 for now.  Interestingly, the price changes have mostly only been on consoles. With the exception of Forspoken, PC versions of recent blockbusters like the Dead Space remake and The Callisto Protocol remained $10 cheaper than their counterparts on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.

With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with  Beloit, WI - Entering Tuesday evening in Beloit, the South Bend Cubs continued their 12-game road trip held exclusively in the state of Wisconsin. With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with both Peoria and Cedar Rapids. With a 9-4 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday, the Cubs are in striking range in the West Division and started their most important series of the first half in a big way.  South Bend sent starter Connor Noland to the mound on Tuesday night, and Noland continued his strong work in his first pro season. Pitching his third career game already against Beloit, Noland worked a 1-2-3 1st inning, and set the Cubs up for success at the plate.  Kevin Alcántara was hit by a pitch on the first offering of the game by Holt Jones, and then stole second base. He was left in scoring position, but the Cubs didn’t miss out on their opportunities from then on.  In the 2nd, still facing Jones, who came into Tuesday with an ERA over 11.00, he was also facing the Cubs for a third time this year. His first start in the home opener at Four Winds Field went well with 4.2 shutout innings. That same series, he pitched in the finale and surrendered seven runs in 3.2 innings.  Tuesday in Beloit looked like the latter, as Jones ran into trouble first in the 2nd. South Bend received a double by Bryce Ball, Ethan Hearn walked, Scott McKeon got hit by a pitch, and Christian Franklin singled. Alcántara brought home his first two RBI of the night on a solid single, and that was followed by another RBI-hit from Ezequiel Pagan.  Jones continued on the mound into the 3rd, and that’s when the big blow was dealt. James Triantos was the third man that Jones hit on the night to start the frame, Yohendrick Pinango walked, and Fabian Pertuz took Jones deep on a three-run homer to give the Cubs a 6-1 lead. It was the third round tripper of the season for Pertuz.  The inning continued with RBI hits from Hearn and McKeon. In a short matter of time, it was an 8-1 Cubs lead.  That was all the pitching staff would need as Noland finished off his start with four innings pitched, no walks, and five strikeouts. It ended up being the third straight start that Noland did not walk a batter.  Out of the bullpen, Jarod Wright earned the win with three strong innings and only one run allowed. Beloit mounted a comeback effort late against Adam Laskey, singling in four consecutive at-bats. But Laskey got a double-play ball and a strikeout to end the threat. He locked down the final three outs and South Bend picked up the win.  With the victory, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels beating the Peoria Chiefs, the Cubs and Kernels will enter Wednesday both just 1.5 games back of Beloit for 1st place. It will be an afternoon matinee on Wednesday at ABC Supply Stadium, as the two clubs play again at 12:05 PM ET.  Chicago Cubs 2022 first-round pick Cade Horton will start his second game in the Midwest League for South Bend."

Week 18 is the last game of the regular season. What's most exciting is what comes next – the start of the playoffs.  PJ's Pick: Week 2 vs. Seahawks  The Lions are looking to avenge four 2022 losses this year, but to me, the home opener against the Seahawks is by far the most important. As I'm sure many remember, Detroit lost a 48-45 shootout at Ford Field in Week 4 of last season, a game that eventually led to Seattle earning a playoff berth with the same 9-7 record as the Lions.  Even outside of last year's results, it's hard to find two teams more alike in circumstance than the Lions and Seahawks - both are young teams with improved rosters that they believe are ready to compete in the NFC. It may only be Week 2, but beating maybe your closest peer early on should go a long way when it comes time to look at the postseason."

CHICAGO -- — Luis Robert Jr. homered for the fourth straight game, Gavin Sheets and Jake Burger went deep off Shane Bieber in Chicago’s six-run fifth inning, and the White Sox beat the Cleveland Guardians 8-3 on Tuesday night.  Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert's solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  In 14 games in May, Robert is hitting .408 (20 for 49) with seven homers and 15 RBI.  “He got a good pitch up in the zone and he's not missing those right now,” Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. “And they're going a long way. He's shrinking this ballpark, he's shrinking any ballpark right now.”  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  “You've got a matchup like Lance and Bieber going at it and both guys were throwing the ball really well,” Sheets said. “So to have that inning was huge for us.”  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  “It was a weird, weird game,” Cleveland manager Tony Francona said. ""The first four innings he scattered hits, but kept them off the scoreboard, kind of typical Bieber style. Bobbed and weaved a little bit, but made pitches.  “Then we got two quick outs (in the fifth) ... and it was like the roof caved in.""  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland's Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBI, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan's double, which ended Lynn's night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated the second unearned run charged to Lynn.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Indians: Francona said he'd know more on Wednesday about the extent of Naylor's injury, sustained when he dived after a ball. ... RHP Aaron Civale (oblique strain) is expected to throw 50 pitches in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday. ... Francona said RHP Triston McKenzie, (teres major strain) is expected to be assigned “somewhere” to pitch on Saturday.  White Sox: Returned LHP Garrett Crochet (Tommy John surgery) from his rehab assignment from Charlotte and optioned RHP Nick Padilla. The 6-foot-6 Crochet, who hasn’t pitched in the majors since Oct. 1, 2021, was expected to be available from the bullpen. ...

In the first game of the night, No. 1 Colorado Academy took down No. 4 Cherry Creek, and in the second, No. 6 Regis Jesuit upset No. 2 Valor Christian to advance to its first-ever state championship game.Defending state champion Colorado Academy will play Regis Jesuit in the state championship game at University of Denver's Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium Friday night at 7:30 p.m.  ENGLEWOOD - One of the Colorado prep sports’ greatest streaks continued Tuesday evening, when the Colorado Academy girls lacrosse team earned its now accustomed spot in the Class 5A state championship game.    It is absolutely nothing new for the Mustangs, who won an incredible 30th consecutive postseason contest dating back to the 2014 season and now have a chance to win a state championship for an eighth consecutive time after a 17-7 win over fourth-seeded Cherry Creek in a game twice delayed by lightning at Englewood High School.  “Pressure is such a privilege and I’m so grateful to carry the CA name because it means so much in the lacrosse community,” said junior midfield Charlotte Corkins, who was one of eight different players to score goals as Colorado Academy improved to 18-0.  “The best thing CA has is that everybody buys into our culture and our team,” she added. “I think it’s just great that we have this tradition and that people have such pride to play for the team.”  That culture and tradition helped the beat go on despite the arrival of a new coach, as Sonorah Hunter took over for former coach Laura Sandblom prior to the season.  Hunter put her own stamp on how the program is run, but she credited the mentality and coachable nature of the returning players as how the Mustangs have again reached the cusp of another title.  “I think it is really easy to get caught up with where the team has been in the past, but since the beginning of the season, we really have focused on the details and how we play together as a group,” Hunter said. “We have a lot of amazing, talented individuals on this team and to be able to shape that and watch them buy into that and get so much better since the beginning of the season has been great to see.”  To get back to the state championship game, Colorado Academy had to go through a Cherry Creek team it beat by a 16-2 count back on April 6.  As expected with both teams having a full regular season and playoff games under their belts, it was a different result, at least for the first 20 minutes.  The Bruins (14-4) — who were seeking their first trip to a state championship game since 2019 — were undaunted in the early going, as they took a lead at 2-1 and after trailing for a bit, forged a 5-5 tie with 8:47 left in the opening half.  Colorado Academy got three key goals in the final 3 minutes, 52 seconds, of the half — including back-to-back scores by Corkins — to take a three-goal edge into halftime. It was particularly meaningful to contribute in a key moment for Corkins, who was on the sidelines watching last season with a torn ACL.  “This is a real, cool full circle moment for me; a year ago I was on crutches and I can remember standing over there on the sideline,” said Corkins, who finished with four goals in the first half. “It feels really good to come back and make an impact for my team.”  The game broke for the first lightning delay with 17:24 remaining in the second half and by that time, Colorado Academy had added goals by juniors Zoe Martin, Skylar May, Alex May and Estella Gellar to up the advantage to 12-5. Another goal on the other side of the break by senior Anna Colpack made it a streak of eight straight scores for the Mustangs before Cherry Creek stopped the run with a goal by senior Becca Zerr just before the second delay.  The remaining time elapsed quickly as the Mustangs reached the 10-goal barrier to invoke the running clock and then could prepare for yet another trip to the state championship game.  The distribution of offense in the semifinal showed how dangerous Colorado Academy can be, as Martin — who came into the game with a staggering 73 goals — had to score just twice, while several others shouldered the scoring load.  “We have so many great goal scorers, so anybody can have their best game on any given day,” said Corkins, one of five players with 29 or more goals coming into the game. “I think that’s what makes us so good, there are so many offensive threats.”  By knocking out Cherry Creek, Colorado Academy has a chance to creep even closer to the Bruins’ lead in the all-time state championship category since the sport debuted in Colorado in 2000.  Cherry Creek has won 10 state championships (the last came in 2013), while the Mustangs now have a chance to win their ninth.  Colorado Academy will be playing a team in the final that has never won a title before and Hunter expects to get their best effort.  “All of these girls are going through so much this week with finals and everything,” Hunter said. “We beat them during the regular season, so we know we can win, but we know they are going to be super hungry. They are definitely going to be coming for us.”  (6) Regis Jesuit 11, (2) Valor Christian 7  ENGLEWOOD - In sharp contrast to its next opponent, the Regis Jesuit girls lacrosse team doesn’t know what it is like to play for a state championship.The Raiders will know that feeling for the first time on Friday when they take the field at the University of Denver to go against Colorado Academy, which will be after its eighth consecutive Class 5A state championship. Regis Jesuit, meanwhile, will have a chance to win its first thanks to an 11-7 semifinal victory over Valor Christian late Tuesday night at Englewood High School.Coach Crysti Foote’s sixth-seeded Regis Jesuit team continued its trend of fast starts and avoided the second half struggles it had in a few games this year to finally get over the hurdles of the semifinals, which had stopped it in both 2019 and 2021. In the process, the Raiders avenged a loss by the identical 11-7 score early in the season to the second-seeded Eagles, who were in search of their third straight trip to the state championship game.“Our goal this season was to get to the state championship, but I didn’t know we hadn’t been there before,” said Foote, who is in her second season as head coach. “It was just something we were working towards. I’m super proud of this team.”Senior Ava Rogala and sophomore Maddy Jokerst scored four goals apiece for Regis Jesuit (12-4), which also got two scores from junior Phoebe Rogala and another from senior Carly Kennedy as it set up a championship contest against top-seeded Colorado Academy, a 17-7 winner over No. 4 Cherry Creek in the previous semifinal.In a game delayed by a couple of hours because of two lightning delays in the previous game, the Raiders came out strong and built a lead of four goals at 5-1.Valor Christian answered with three straight goals to get within one when senior Kaley Kakac converted a free shot opportunity.Regis Jesuit got the momentum back with Ava Rogala’s third goal of the opening half followed by Phoebe Rogala’s first tally, which came with just nine seconds left on the clock.“As a team with a history of not coming out the strongest in the second half, we left that first half with passion, with energy and with hope,” Phoebe Rogala said.The Raiders never really wavered in the second half, although consecutive goals by speedy Valor Christian junior Eliza Osburn tightened the game up in the opening five minutes of the half.Phoebe and Ava Rogala again had consecutive goals to restore a four-goal edge and from there, freshman goalie Rayn Parker made a few key saves and the Regis Jesuit defense played aggressive and physical as it limited the chances for Valor Christian in the remainder of the half.A point-blank stop by Parker on Kakac inside the final four minutes essentially sealed the victory.Regis Jesuit will get another chance to play Colorado Academy, which it lost to 12-8 in the regular season finale May 6.The Raiders believe the Mustangs are “beatable” and look forward to the challenge of playing a team that will be heavily favored.“CA is an amazing team, but we’ve played a lot of great teams this year to prepare for this moment,” Foote said. “I think we’re going to go watch video, prepare and be ready to go again.”"

Unsurprisingly, it’s also nurtured tons of video games over the decades.  40K models are typically gorgeous, and its tabletop qualities are enticing for anyone willing to learn the ropes, but its universe gradually became attractive on its own as well. In the distant future, a dogmatic human civilization is under siege from all sides, fighting off armies of hostile aliens and terrifying supernatural forces. It’s grand and gritty in equal measure, and despite the many franchises it’s influenced over the years, there’s nothing quite like it.  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Many Warhammer fans are familiar with 40K’s large body of novels, but it was video games that truly started to advance on soon-to-be Warhammer diehards. The medium’s unparalleled interactive possibilities have allowed the IP to flourish in both traditional and unexpected ways. With Warhammer 40K: Boltgun (opens in new tab)'s imminent release, we thought now would be a good time to look back at the best Warhammer 40K games from across the years.  If you’re looking for other specific gaming picks, you might want to check out our list of the best space exploration games or maybe the all-spooky best space horror games list. And, if you want to get into Warhammer 40K but don’t know how to cut down costs, we’ve got you covered with some recommendations on how to save money on Warhammer 40K too. For the Emperor!  10. Warhammer 40K: Darktide  (Image credit: Fatshark)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Fatshark  Warhammer 40K really lends itself to first-person shooters filled with bullets and blood, and we’re surprised Games Workshop hasn’t explored that genre more often, but we’re getting there. Darktide launched only a few months ago, and it’s already caused a strong impression despite an overall lack of polish that’s being fixed as we speak.  The key here is that Fatshark’s natural talent for punchy and brutal combat is all there, brought over from the two Warhammer: Vermintide games they made before. Darktide follows the watertight four-player co-op FPS formula that was popularized by Valve’s Left 4 Dead back in the day, so you know what you’re getting into. Just make sure your PC is up to par or wait for the (delayed) current-gen Xbox release.  9. Space Hulk: Tactics  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One  PC, PS4, Xbox One Developer: Cyanide Studio  2018 brought us a pretty solid adaptation of the tabletop miniatures board game Space Hulk. This is a two-player versus game that distills Warhammer 40K into a cheaper, quicker, and tighter experience set in derelict spaceships and other pieces of space junk floating adrift and run over by Tyranids.  The game features two single-player campaigns, competitive multiplayer, and a skirmish mode. Moreover, it packs an impressive map builder that allows players to cook up and share their own maps. Just be aware that this one is very punishing.  8. Warhammer 40K: Battlesector  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S  PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S Developer: Black Lab Games  Battlesector is another recent 40K game release that flew under the radar. However, both veteran gamers and fans have praised its take on turn-based tactics on a larger scale than usual, which results in a slower-paced and more meditative approach too.  The mission design can often be monotonous, but the moment-to-moment gameplay and the systems gluing everything together work well enough to achieve one of the best digital representations of the miniature wargame around. We’d love to see a bigger and better sequel of this one.  7. Warhammer 40K: Gladius – Relics of War  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, Linux  PC, Linux Developer: Proxy Studios  Gladius – Relics of War mixes Warhammer 40K and 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) systems. On paper this sounds like a match made in heaven and it largely succeeds at doing Sid Meier’s Civilization but 40K. If that sounds attractive, give it a fair shake.  While its older 4X brothers are far more addicting, Gladius’ more fast-paced nature and strong commitment to the 40K universe (diplomacy ain’t an option) make it an oddly relaxing – and unsurprisingly darker – take on a well-trodden formula.  6. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Tindalos Interactive  If you like spaceships (which is likely if you’re an avid reader of our site) and real-time tactics in your games, then Battlefield Gothic: Armada 2 is a safe bet. It adapts the 40K miniature wargame of the same name, and it does so with style.  This one features three narrative campaigns and 12 playable factions, with the option of doing co-op multiplayer as well. Even if you’re not well-versed in the Warhammer 40K universe, anyone into space strategy games should check this one out.  5. Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus  (Image credit: Kasedo Games)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch  PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch Developer: Bulwark Studios  Mechanicus is yet another turn-based video game that follows a very specific faction of the human Imperium. This time around it’s all about the Adeptus Mechanicus, a group of cybernetically enhanced warrior priests. That sounds rad, and we promise that the game is rad too.  It’s also one of the few turn-based 40K titles that stick more closely to the obvious XCOM inspiration, so it might be an easier recommendation for players who are looking for that specific take on tactical battles. On top of the solid gameplay, the flexible customization and notable worldbuilding are highlights.  4. Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters  (Image credit: Frontier Foundry)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Complex Games  Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters was released in 2022, but it’s already become a favorite among fans thanks to its strong focus on the Grey Knights, a chapter of Space Marines composed of psychics whose purpose is the combat and eradication of the daemonic forces of Chaos.  Daemonhunters is a single-player, turn-based strategy game that does way more than just replicating XCOM with Space Marines; it’s largely unforgiving and deceptively deep. The audiovisual presentation is also top notch, making the (at times) seemingly impossible battles a blast to watch play out.  3. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War II  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux  PC, macOS, Linux Developers: Relic Entertainment  Dawn of War diehards never fully embraced Dawn of War II, but it’s still one of the franchise’s finest gaming efforts and deserves its own spot in the list. It can’t be denied that it cemented itself as a sequel that can stand on its own thanks to a heavier focus on RPG elements.  Dawn of War II received two major expansion packs plus a fair amount of DLC that rounded out the experience, eventually nullifying complaints about the removal of the base-building element and the repetition found in some missions of the campaign. If you’ve exhausted the first Dawn of War’s options, give its first sequel a chance. We don’t talk about the third one though.  2. Warhammer 40K: Space Marine  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360  PC, PS3, Xbox 360 Developer: Relic Entertainment  With Space Marine 2 (opens in new tab) slated to release later this year, there’s never been a better time to play (or replay) the 2011 original, especially after the free anniversary upgrade (opens in new tab) it got on PC in 2021.  Even before the announcement of a sequel, Space Marine has always had many fans. This was with good reason as it perfectly represents the brutality of the Space Marines up close and personal through a third-person view and visceral melee and ranged combat. Some of the Imperium’s biggest enemies are featured heavily in this one, and the plot is easy to follow, so it’s a nice entry point for newcomers too.  1. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC  PC Developers: Relic Entertainment  40K fans and real-time strategy veterans alike agree that the original Dawn of War is one of the best PC games ever, period. Relic Entertainment once cracked the code and delivered an all-timer which is both accessible and unique. It perfectly adapts many of the miniature game and its universe’s nuances into a modern classic that nailed both the base-building aspect and the relentless combat across desolate scenarios.  Furthermore, Dawn of War packed spectacular story campaigns, a solid roster of units for all factions, and the option to customize the armies’ colors plus basic aesthetics. And, since it was a massive commercial hit, it received three chunky expansion packs which we 100% recommend. More specifically, the second expansions, Dark Crusade, which still to this day feels like a high point for the RTS genre."

This is not enough to stop people from getting grumpy after losses like last night’s. I get it. The Grayson Rodriguez outing was a real downer, and added to that, it feels like quite a waste to have scored five runs off of Shohei Ohtani and still lost the game by a grand slam. I hope they can halt the losing before dropping a third straight game.  As is true of every game, the starting pitcher will have a lot to do with the chances of the Orioles winning. That’s Dean Kremer tonight. His last two games have been pretty good, with just one run allowed combined across 12 innings pitched against the Braves and Rays. Those are two great offenses so far this season. Kremer has had some rocky outings this year but we can hope, not unreasonably, that the last couple are a sign he’s heading in a more positive direction.  For another game in a row, the Orioles have made a move to summon fresh bullpen reinforcements. After Rodriguez didn’t go deep into the game last night and a number of relievers needed to be used, they wanted some long relief insurance. That’s turned out to be Cole Irvin, erstwhile starting rotation member, who’s done better with his control after a demotion to Norfolk. I hope he’s not needed, like they didn’t end up needing Drew Rom over the weekend, but it’s good they brought him in case.  Orioles lineup  Cedric Mullins - CF Adley Rutschman - C Anthony Santander - 1B Austin Hays - LF Gunnar Henderson - 3B Adam Frazier - 2B Terrin Vavra - RF Jorge Mateo - SS Ryan O’Hearn - DH  A lot of days I’ve looked at the Orioles lineup this season, I’ve thought to myself, “Is this really the best they can do?” They’ve won a number of those games, so it’s been working out. Still, here’s that reaction again. Vavra in right field, really? If this is going to happen - and this is now the second straight game it has - it is a lot tougher to defend, say, Colton Cowser remaining in Norfolk with his 1.044 OPS.  Also, O’Hearn had a nice spring training but that’s not carrying over into the regular season in the slightest, so, you know. It would be nice to do something different there. Ryan Mountcastle getting a game off is part of why the lineup looks like this, of course.  Angels lineup  Mickey Moniak - RF Mike Trout - CF Shohei Ohtani - DH Taylor Ward - LF Matt Thaiss - C Brandon Drury - 1B Gio Urshela - 3B Luis Rengifo - 2B Zach Neto - SS  The Angels starting pitcher is Chase Silseth, who has pitched in four games this year but yet to make a start. Though Trout and Ohtani are fearsome presences in this lineup, it feels like the Orioles lineup ought to be better than these guys. They weren’t last night, so, you know, hopefully they can change that today."

The start of the game was delayed 44 minutes due to lightning in the area.  Jackson Mayo (St. Johns) went 3-for-4 with a home run in the loss for South Florida.  Stetson broke the scoring seal and took a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the third inning. The Hatters added two to their lead with a handful of seeing-eye singles in the top of the fourth for a 3-0 advantage.  The Hatters plated four more runs in the top of the fifth inning to pad their lead to 7-0 and made it a 9-0 affair with two more in the sixth frame.  After being limited to just two hits through the first five innings, USF finally put together a rally to scratch the plate in the bottom of the sixth. Drew Brutcher (Lakeland) walked with one out, and two batters later with two outs, Rafael Betancourt (Deltona) extended the inning with a base hit. John Montes (Toa Alto, Puerto Rico) then drove in Brutcher with an RBI-single.  Travis Sankovich (Uniontown, Pa.) added a run-scoring double by the Bulls in the bottom of the seventh inning.  The Hatters hit back-to-back solo homers in the top of the ninth inning before the Bulls tacked on three runs in the bottom half of the frame.  Mayo tagged a solo home run, Bobby Boser (Wesley Chapel) drilled an RBI-triple to the gap in right-center field, just missing his 16th homer of the year, and Brutcher added a sac fly to chase home Boser and account for the final score.  Notable  Boser extended his hitting streak (11) and on-base streak (15) on Tuesday night.  Ethan Brown (Winter Garden), who has made only one appearance since suffering a shoulder injury on April 14th, face three batters in the sixth inning and recorded one strikeout.

The game distributor appears to be mulling the idea of a free 90-minute trial, beginning with this popular new remake.  Just below the thumbnail carousel and the “Add to Wishlist” button sits a narrow box titled “Try Dead Space - Free Trial.” From there, it’s clear this is an experimental feature for Steam: The box says you can “Play this title for up to 1 hours” but also that you have “1 hour 30 minutes remaining.” Clicking the “Play Now” button kicks off a full-game download, but once your 90 minutes are up, you must either purchase the game or get out.  Many Steam games offer demos—the Steam Store has an entire section for them. But demos typically contain in-game restrictions rather than time restrictions. You might only get to complete a couple of objectives or explore a small section of the game’s world before being invited to purchase the game. Although this is still a brilliant way to ensure you want a title before committing (an invaluable opportunity, given game prices nowadays), it doesn’t always offer a full picture of what a playthrough experience will look like.  Credit: Adrianna Nine  Steam has toyed with several free trial formulas, offering entire weekends where users could play games like Crusader Kings III for free. Models like this only work for games you’d conceivably play over and over, though; story-driven games like Dead Space aren’t a great fit, as players could complete a full playthrough within that free weekend. From Steam’s perspective, 90 minutes is enough to offer curious users an enticing taste without giving away the whole story.  As of writing, it appears that Dead Space is the only game offering a timed free trial; other major titles lack the box entirely. It could be that Steam is testing the feature before conducting a wider rollout, or Dead Space publisher Electronic Arts just wants people to get into this title. (EA also announced that Dead Space would be 20% off through May 29.)"

Most video games of the time were unapologetic about pushing 3D graphics forward, even if it wasn’t a fully realized concept yet. Meanwhile, as a society, we were worried sick about what Y2K might do to our computers while so obsessed with the upcoming millennium that roughly half of all media produced in 1999 had a ‘2000’ at the end of the title. They even gave the guy that made The X-Files some other show based entirely on how fucked up it was that the millennium was approaching. With the notable exception of one child screaming about the Nintendo 64 he’d received as a Christmas gift, we were too focused on the future to enjoy the present.  The irony here is that many of the things society was obsessing over later became a blip on the radar. Y2K was a bust, and as of this writing, none of the three dozen prominent streaming services currently feature Chris Carter’s Millenium (67 episodes across three seasons). Yet we all know GoldenEye, Mario 64, and Knife Edge: Nose Gunner!  Okay, maybe not Knife Edge: Nose Gunner.  The Nintendo 64 is many things to many people, probably more so than other consoles. To some, it was the gateway to a new, fully realized world of possibilities, in-depth adventures, and precision controls. To others, it’s overrated nostalgia, home to lifeless worlds the player often struggled to navigate thanks to that wonky controller and frequent camera issues. As always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. With 296 games released in North America, its library is somewhat scarce compared to other similarly beloved consoles. Yet despite this, a half dozen titles routinely mentioned among the finest in gaming are found in its catalog. Rightfully, these and a handful of others have been discussed throughout the years as variations of “The Best 25 Nintendo 64 Games of All Time” lists permeate the internet.  We here at Hard Drive have never seen a party we didn’t want to invite ourselves to, but we also wanted to shine a light on the games that haven’t been endlessly ranked and re-ranked over the subsequent 25 years. We wanted to pay homage to both the stone-cold classics of the era (meaning the wrestling games with Steve Austin on the cover) and the outliers, the dubious games given as well-intentioned gifts by aunts and stepparents. These ghastly licensed titles and inexplicable originals often shaped our collective gaming experiences as much as anything else. And even if we say some pretty mean things, we just really love video games, man. It beats talking about anything else.  So here you go; all 296 North American Nintendo 64 games ranked and reviewed, as well as way too many references to our fathers, video stores, and 9/11. We hope you enjoy reading it — it’s the biggest thing we’ve ever done (not that it will impress our dads).  — Mark Roebuck  List by: Chris Colman, Patrick Crooks, John Danek, Chandler Dean, Kyle Duggan, Seth Finkelstein, Luca Fisher, Ryan Fleishman, Jeremy Kaplowitz, Michael Katz, James Knapp, Naomi Krause, Walker MacDonald, Ashley Oh, Kevin Podas, Gabe Porter, William Quant, Mark Roebuck, Matt Saincome, Joe Tilleli, Brad Waters, Thomas Wilde, and a guy who is stuck in a hole.  Art by Matt Harding  # 296. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker    December 13, 2000  Kemco  Ubisoft  $65.99 on Amazon  A devastatingly bad brawler that’s as devoid of redeeming qualities as Bruce Wayne is parents. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker suffers from lightning quick animations that make it seem like Terry Batman is moving faster than the camera can keep up with, which is frustrating but also kind of hilarious. Batman’s move set mostly consists of kicking and punching, and several strikes can be strung together to form “combos” in the way that eating a bowl of barbecue sauce at 6:30 PM could loosely be considered “eating supper.” The game consists of five levels, and the score consists of five notes. The cinematics in between levels literally go by too fast to keep up with, which is probably a good thing, as I’m assuming this game’s story is as insulting as every other aspect of it. One of my favorite examples is that level two, Wayne Enterprises Building, is the exact same as level one, The Gotham Air & Space Museum, except the hallways have potted plants in them now. On the bright side, it’s all over in about an hour. It’s fucked up that this is the only Batman game they made for the Nintendo 64, because it really sucks. — Mark Roebuck  #295. Carmageddon 64  July 26, 2000  Stainless Games/Software Creations  Titus Interactive  $124.99 on Amazon  Somewhere, someone is going through an actual car crash, doomed to have to go through physical therapy for the next two years as a result of their injuries to have some semblance of their full range of motion back, on top of an unholy amount of medical debt. And that person would still be having more fun than me playing this abomination of a racing game. I was hoping that this game’s infamy was some kind of hyperbole; that perhaps people were harsher on it in its time and that modern days may have actually vindicated it like some of these other old games we played. But no. This one is just as dreadful as everyone says it is.  Besides creeping to the framerate of a slideshow on basically every turn, nothing works the way it’s supposed to and it all just feels like ass. The worst part is there’s no point to any of it! The game presents itself as some kind of apocalyptic race where you must ‘race or die’ as the opening narration spells out, but your only objective is to complete the race. No other racer is competing against you and yet you’re prompted to kill all other drivers you see. Also, there’s zombies everywhere as some sort of alternate win condition that is impossible to complete. And if I don’t want to destroy or maim anything in your apocalyptic demolition derby race, then what’s the point of it all? — William Quant  #294. Superman: The New Superman Adventures  May 31, 1999  Titus Interactive  $25.49 on Amazon  Look, you don’t need me to tell you this game sucks. We all know it sucks. It’s not even the developer’s fault that it sucks (the licensing team at WB hated the devs and tried to make them turn this into a SimCity clone). The controls suck. The gameplay sucks. The graphics suck. You don’t really do Superman things, you just do minigames all day with extremely strict time limits. Did you know you get to fight Darkseid in this game? He’s in a hallway. They’re all in hallways in this game! You know what? That’s enough. I’m going to spend the rest of this review begging someone, anyone, to make a Superman game. I don’t want to hear anything about how he’s too powerful and no one can hurt him. Figure it out! Have him fight Titano, the giant robot ape. Hey, and while we’re at it, let’s make another Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. You can make car boxing gloves in that. Man, what a fun game that was. — Seth Finkelstein  #293: B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S.    May 19, 1998  Midway  B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. is a travesty. This fighting game is set in Neo Amerika, where escalating tech overlords have caused the nation to break down in the Techno-Industrial Civil War (great naming convention, really nailed it). Every character is a variant of unholy cyborg abomination named something like KillFucker because of how much they like Killing and Fucking. Honestly, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. would be a The Room­, ­so-bad-it’s-good type game if the name of the flagship character on the cover wasn’t a racial slur used as a play on words (he has an actual zipper on his head, so funny). This checks out since the game as a whole feels targeted towards your dipshit cousin that still says the f-slur.  In terms of actual gameplay, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. characters control like a Walmart mobility scooter. The game is comically unbalanced, mainly due to a shield mechanic that makes characters invulnerable by removing all the textures on their already-ugly polygons. The game also blatantly cheats by reading your inputs so the computer enemies can easily beat all your attacks, which is why you can find multiple videos of content creators hopelessly trying to beat the BS final boss of Arcade Mode. The next time you want to complain about modern fighting games, pop in B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. and thank god you’re getting another Street Fighter sequel instead of this roadkill. — Ryan Fleishman  #292. Monster Truck Madness 64  August 31, 1996  Terminal Reality  Microsoft  $37.99 on Amazon  Monster Truck Madness 64, Rockstar’s third release, long before they created Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, opens with a caffeine-addled announcer screaming “ARE YOU READY?!” followed by a dick-crushing industrial metal track, so it’s clearly among the best games ever conceived. But alas, no amount of personality and testosterone can compensate for messy gameplay.  MTM 64 is both slippery and heavy, like trying to deadlift a sea lion. Or, in this case, like trying to push a monster truck with tires made of butter across a track made of soap. One must imagine their opponents laughing as their truck keels over into the mud on its side, a metaphor for life’s inevitable cruelty.  There is also a distinct lack of car-crushing — a crushing disappointment in its own right. Battering fences and tombstones is fun, but it doesn’t compare to the raw, primal thrill of man-hicular vehicle-slaughter that monster trucks bring to mind. And unlike the game’s trucks and corny announcer, the environments are almost entirely devoid of personality and largely identical to one another. Even the stage called DEATH TRAP was pretty nonlethal. I was expecting both DEATH and a host of booby TRAPs, or perhaps wild bears for flavor, but found neither.  Like Sisyphus making sweet love to the boulder that binds him in eternal punishment, I mindlessly chased an ever-returning ball (or puck) in the identical Soccer and Hockey minigames. Through all of it, the emcee’s commentary helped me to stay strong — he was there for me in each of these miserable game modes, even as I slipped all over the place and ate the dirt. My fondest memory of this game will be the exact moment I hurtled into an enemy vehicle in Summit Rumble, prompting the emcee, my only friend in this wasteland, to shout “Hell hath no fury like a monster truck scorned!” — Luca Fisher  #291. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie    November 8, 2000  Avalanche Software  THQ  $21.24 on Amazon  Rugrats in Paris is a beautiful kids movie that made me confront the grief of what it’s like to have lost a parent and learn how to welcome new familial love into your life. The video game adaptation of the film explores different thesis surrounding how I wish everyone around me was dead. It opens with selecting your favorite baby and then lets you explore its theme park overworld in a manner not unlike pushing a stroller without wheels. They seriously gave these babies tank controls. They cannot turn. The babies can only move forward, leaning slightly toward one direction or the other, and require stopping to turn and walk backwards at a crawl. If the dev’s goal was for me to re-experience learning to walk for the first time, well then I guess they succeeded.  The gameplay is structured as a series of carnival minigames so you can win enough tickets to buy the helmet that controls Reptar—then fight his arch-nemesis, RoboSnail. I never got to RoboSnail. These minigames range from a clunky ‘hit the targets with a baseball’ game where the hitboxes are incomprehensible to an almost-serviceable minigolf course that would maybe work if you didn’t have to run your baby from your previous stroke to the next with the same overworld tank controls that make me feel glad the vibrant orange and greens of Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, have been painted over beige and its presence erased from the earth. — Joe Tilleli  #290. Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.    December 9, 1999  Acclaim Studios London  Acclaim  $26.99 on Amazon  When I began Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M., I was greeted with a cheesy B-movie style plot of alien invaders. I thought it would be good for a few laughs. Unfortunately, the game ended up laughing at me. I couldn’t move for the first few minutes of gameplay, only to learn that you move with the C-buttons, which is just as confusing and difficult as you’d imagine. Also, you cannot see anything in this game. You just keep barreling headfirst into darkness, hoping that the horrible bug enemies that you are unable to aim at for more than a second aren’t about to kill you. The worst part, however, is when you finish a level, only to be told you didn’t do one of the obtuse missions, leading to an instant game over and you needing to redo everything. And I still am completely lost as to what the fuck an Armorine is. — Gabe Porter  #289. NBA In The Zone ‘98    February 16, 1998  Konami  $22.49 on Amazon  This is one of those games where the graphics aren’t so much ‘weird but forgivable demonstration of growing pains in three dimensional graphics’ as they are ‘vaguely humanoid creatures made up of uneven shoulders and blurry textures who’s every movement and action invoke unease and terror.’ Nothing about this game looks, sounds, or feels good. Factor that in with weird features like the ability to trade players in the pre-game setup menu (I think these guys are dressed for the game already, fellas) and omissions like the ability to call plays, you have the worst basketball game on the Nintendo 64. Anyone that’s played Fox Sports College Hoops ‘99 knows I’m talking mad shit right now. — M. Roebuck  #288: South Park Rally    January 5, 2000  Tantalus Interactive  Acclaim Entertainment  $99.99 on Amazon  I wanted to go to bat for this game. I consistently saw it toward the top of every ‘Worst N64 Games’ list—and that puzzled me. I thought, “Shouldn’t even a middling kart racer be worth playing if it means I get to enjoy some irreverent South Park vibes in the process? Shouldn’t the fun of PLAYABLE CHEF alone be enough to get this thing to a 6/10!?”  And sure enough, when I started navigating the menu—with fart noises accompanying my every click—I had reason to hope. Between a full 3D rendition of the iconic theme song (complete with obligatory Kenny death) and a surprisingly wide array of playable characters, I dared to ask myself: for Acclaim Entertainment’s South Park games, could the third time have been the charm?  Then I started playing it. And I came to realize that in other racing games, we often fail to appreciate how wonderful it is to know where you are supposed to be going and how you are supposed to get there. Instead of simply circling around a set path, South Park Rally is one of very few racing games to embrace FromSoftware-style open world hostility; you’re free to go wherever you want, but you’re fucked if you don’t take one highly specific route. Other things we’ve taken for granted? Controls that work, sound that’s audible, AI that’s beatable, and most of all: a game that’s playable. South Park Rally succeeds only as an exercise in cynicism. Acclaim took this beloved franchise, chopped it up, fed it to us, and licked up our tears. Jesus Christ, dude. — Chandler Dean  #287. Deadly Arts    September 29, 1998  Konami  $64.99 on Amazon  Deadly Arts may be the most authentic fighting game ever created, given how its shit show mechanics force it to so closely match the pace of most fights that occur in real life.  I started working on this review by inviting over my unemployed friend Tad, and we drank fourteen Michelob Ultras each to prepare. As the first round of martial combat began, we were amped and ready to have at it. We smack-talked and boasted about how badly we were going to beat one another. At one point we just straight up started spitting at each other. Then, some time later, the first awkward punch finally landed thanks to the absolutely appalling frame rate in the game. It was at this time that Tad threw down his controller and quit, no longer wanting to be a part of this painful and pointless exercise. I’d rather go watch the fights outside of Shady McGrady’s at 2 AM on a Sunday. — James Knapp  #286. ECW Hardcore Revolution    February 17, 2000  Acclaim  $40 on Amazon  Since some Hard Drive readers might not be wrestling fans, let me spin you a yarn. In the same year this game came out, ECW – which stood for Extreme Championship Wrestling and was famed for their no holds barred, car crash style of wrestling – put on a Pay-Pew-View show called Living Dangerously that was also sponsored by Acclaim and this very game. At this event, a wrestler named New Jack, famous for being an absolute legitimate psychopath, dragged another wrestler to the top of a scaffolding to perform an unplanned stunt that resulted in them both crashing 20 feet unprotected onto a concrete arena floor. They both survived, but not without injuries and for New Jack, not without losing a fuckton of vision in one eye. Watching this horrific accident unfold was still a more enjoyable experience than playing ECW Hardcore Revolution. — W. Quant"

Specifically, the mass of people queueing for Comiket, the longstanding comic and pop culture convention in Tokyo. As its director Yugo Nakamura explains over a video call from the city, he was intrigued by the “orderly manner” in which these people were milling about. “We have our soul and mind,” he says, “but it was almost like they were moving without thinking.” The challenge the designer set himself and his colleagues at the award-winning Japanese studio tha ltd. was to simulate this gently surging crowd, the ebb and flow of the collective.  Yugo Nakamura  The resulting puzzle game does something unusual for the genre. Yes, it stretches your grey matter in ways that will make you feel like an idiot and then a genius, but its hundreds, sometimes thousands of people moving in unison are capable of stirring up surprising emotions: delight, awe, even fear. The setup is simple: direct an endlessly spawning mass of people towards the light in a series of self-contained levels. The execution is anything but: a luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader, scampering about brutalist architecture suspended high in the clouds. You are given the ability to manipulate the group in different ways with commands such as turn, jump, and branch, which siphons the roving mob into two. When it goes right, Humanity is the stuff of dreams; one wrong instruction, however, and the game turns into a Freudian nightmare, its mass of figures tumbling into an infinite abyss.  This strange, compulsive game is the product of a collaboration between tha and Enhance, the video game studio founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, celebrated designer of 2001’s Rez (another game inspired by heaving bodies) and 2019’s Tetris Effect. Mizuguchi, who simply goes by “Miz” to most people who know him, first saw Humanity in 2017 while sitting on a judging panel at a Unity showcase in Tokyo, back when it was still just a tech demo. It grabbed of his attention and then wouldn’t let it go, inspiring a series of searching questions. “Where is this going? What is this trying to get to?” he recalls asking himself, over a video call from his Tokyo office. Six years on, the game elements of Humanity have been fleshed out, but its confusing emotional impact hasn’t changed. “Even today, when I see what we’ve come up with, it’s quite shocking visually,” he says.  A luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Six years is a long time to spend making any kind of video game, let alone a puzzle game (for comparison, that’s how long the new open-world behemoth Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom took to produce). Nakamura admits sculpting the crystalline idea into a meaningful interactive experience was a fraught process. There was a loss in direction, a stutter in development: “To be quite honest … I didn’t even want to show up to work,” Nakamura says. Then Enhance stepped in to offer direction – how to make Humanity “interesting, fun, and entertaining to play”.  Tetsuya Mizuguchi  Mizuguchi is modest about his studio’s input, casually describing it as “helping out with level design”. Like some of the very best puzzle games in recent memory, Humanity gradually ratchets up its complexity. You navigate levels filled with inky blocks that can be pushed around, fans that suspend your minions in mid-air and then, later in the game, grey-skinned figures dressed in black called “the others”. A boldly metaphorical narrative unfolds alongside this symbolic gameplay. During one set of levels collectively titled Fate, there’s no way to alter the path of your followers once they’ve started moving, forcing you to think 10, 15, sometimes even 20 moves ahead. During these puzzles, humankind’s course is preordained.  That said, Humanity is more often than not a game of improvisation and creativity, not least for players who choose to take advantage of the game’s in-built level creator. As producer Mark Macdonald explains, this also contributed to the protracted development, a feature requiring not only the development of easy-to-use tools but an entire network within which fan-made levels could be hosted, shared, and rated. “It’s kind of like creating Netflix and Twitter at the same time,” says Macdonald. During the game’s demo period in March, inventive players made levels based on the recent hit Vampire Survivors, stealth classic Metal Gear Solid, and even baseball, ideas the development team would never have conceived – in other words, “exactly what you’re hoping to see”, he says.  Creating levels is as much of a puzzle as those found in the actual game. Both tickle parts of the brain that enjoy tinkering and experimentation – seeing computer software come alive thanks to human input. As such, Nakamura sees Humanity as an extension of the web design work that made his name in the late 1990s – then cutting-edge sites like MONO*craft, which took advantage of the era’s nascent Flash software. He speaks of the user coming into “touch” with a site, a “reaction”, and this generating an “aha moment”. Of course, websites tend to occupy their users’ attention for only a few minutes; video games have to sustain a player’s attention for many hours. This proved to be one of the biggest challenges for Nakamura. “I would feel that maybe [we had] enough to satisfy the user,” he says. “But I didn’t know what the upper limit was.”  Ebb and flow of the collective … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Nakamura has used the medium’s length to produce a game that is both playful and profound, evoking two works that could scarcely be more different. On the one hand, Lemmings, the seminal 1991 puzzle game that sees you leading strange tiny humanoid figures through underground environments; on the other, Godfrey Reggio’s 1982 masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi, a cinematic tone poem that casts a panoramic, God-like gaze over humanity and its increasingly fractious relationship with Earth. Reggio’s film eludes a single straightforward interpretation, and Humanity will likely inspire similar existential musings.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Free weekly newsletter Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He recalls watching US coverage of the accompanying public unrest and demonstrations while working in Japan, “unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my lifetime”, he says. “Then I’m seeing these giant crowds of people [in the game] flowing, interacting, sometimes competing and fighting, and it’s surreal.”  Nakamura, meanwhile, speaks philosophically of social media and the ways in which it has distorted our perspective before zeroing in on a single question: “Why do things happen when suddenly we’re part of a crowd, part of a larger society, or part of a larger community?” In the surreal, visual story he has crafted – one that only a video game could tell – a dog leads a pack of humans who have “lost their sense of direction, and maybe even hope”."

Pomona, N.Y. – (May 16, 2023) – The Fordham Rams and Manhattan Jaspers have exchanged pleasantries on the baseball diamond for over 150 years, dating back to 1870, and have never played a game beyond 12 innings. That is until Tuesday, as the team played 13 innings with Manhattan getting the walk-off 13-12 win at Clover Stadium in Pomona, N.Y.got things rolling for Fordham in the second inning, as he connected on a solo home run to right field, his first of the season, for a 1-0 lead.The Rams made it 5-0 in the third inning, rallying for four runs.andled off with back-to-back walks with Bucciero scoring on a single to center by.

However, Fordham could not hold the lead, as the Jaspers loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning and scored a run on a fielder's choice.Then in the 12inning, Mexico put Fordham back on top with an RBI-single to score Selinger from second, making it a 12-11 count.

In a developer livestream, game director Aaron Keller said that the team is canceling the game’s PvE-based hero missions in favor of continuing on with seasonal, story-focused events.  When Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2, the developers teased that the game would have two PvE campaign modes adjacent to its traditional competitive modes.  In the presentation announcing Overwatch 2 during Blizzcon 2019, former game director Jeff Kaplan spoke of hero missions and story missions that encompassed the game’s PvE elements and drove the game’s narrative. Story missions would be like the story-focused events the original Overwatch already had. Players would group up and fight against AI-controlled enemies instead of teams of other players. These kinds of missions would either cover Overwatch 2’s overall story the way Uprising, Retribution, and Storm Rising dug into events in original Overwatch or be fantastical side stories outside Overwatch canon like the Halloween event Junkenstein’s Revenge. These story missions would also be seasonal, rotating out every few months.  Hero missions, however, were presented as this always-available, always-replayable mode that featured talent trees that would grant different buffs to heroes, giving this part of the game more RPG-like qualities.  But as Overwatch 2 suffered from delays and development issues, Blizzard announced that hero mode (known then as simply PvE mode) would not launch with the game and come at a later date. In today’s developer livestream, it seems that the hero mode version of Overwatch 2 PvE is being shuttered due to development constraints and shifted priorities.  “With everything we’ve learned about what it takes to operate this game,” said executive producer Jared Neuss. “It’s clear that we can’t deliver on that original vision for PvE that was shown in 2019.”  After Overwatch 2 was announced, the game entered a kind of “dead zone” where no new content was being released save skins and rehashed holiday events. Even though a new game was forthcoming, players started disengaging from original Overwatch. Ahead of the game’s release in 2022, Keller put out a video promising a steady cadence of releases and new content so players would never again have to wait years between new heroes or events.  In an interview with GameSpot, Neuss and Keller went into detail about the reasons for hero modes’ cancellation, talking about how it would’ve taken pulling developers off the live game in order to create hero mission PvE as it was originally conceived and how that wouldn’t square with the team’s commitment to keeping the game fresh and exciting.  In reality, what we were looking at was running two separate games at the same time with a set of heroes as the piece that is shared between two of them. And as we started to get further and further into it — obviously our players could realize that we were pulling focus away from the live game — but it just didn’t look like there was a definitive end date in sight where we would finally be able to put that stamp on [it], or that end date was years away and it no longer felt like we could be doing that to our players, or we could be doing that to the live game that we were running. And that’s when we took the moment to shift strategy and put everything into the live game.  Losing hero missions is a big bummer, but Overwatch 2 PvE isn’t totally gone. Story missions have been traditional events within both games, and the developers shared that Overwatch 2’s first big story event is coming in season 6.  Blizzard Entertainment"

OPCraft was built by crypto devotees who disdain the format of the most popular crypto games, which generally take conventional game designs and add a cryptocurrency element on top, often centered on making money exchanged as digital currency or NFTs.  The creators of OPCraft are trying to establish a new genre of games shaped more fundamentally by blockchains. Their rules and core mechanisms are encoded into smart contracts—software applications that encode an agreement—linked to the Ethereum blockchain. The game, which debuted in October for a two-week test period, is meant to demonstrate a vision its developers call an autonomous world—a digital space owned and controlled not by a single, centralized entity but by a decentralized network of people interacting with a blockchain.  OPCraft is not the first on-chain game, and dozens more are in the works, setting out to build gaming worlds their creators describe as “sovereign” or “eternal.” At a time when the games industry is more lucrative and corporate than ever, these projects are trying to show that it’s possible to rethink some long-established patterns—like the fact that a game’s code typically lives on a privately owned server and can be changed or removed on a whim by its owners.  The challenge now for these crypto idealists is to build games that demonstrate and prove out those ideals. If they can do that, they might change the conventional wisdom about what blockchains can do, too, by showing that they’re useful for more than just cryptocurrency and NFTs.

On-Chain Game Theory  Justin Glibert, cofounder of the blockchain research nonprofit 0xPARC, is quick to acknowledge that the idea of online games offering a new canvas for self-expression might not sound very new. But he argues that the freedom offered by conventional games is partly an illusion.  Players of the 20-year-old space-themed game Eve Online, like devotees of other online multiplayer games, invest huge amounts of time and energy into their play, creating and running sophisticated organizations and maintaining genuine relationships. Players feel like they’re free to shape their own destiny inside the game. But Glibert says that freedom can in fact be yanked away at any moment by CCP Games, Eve’s owner.  “They believe that CCP is not running the game world,” when in fact it retains total control, says Glibert, who runs a division of 0xPARC called Lattice that builds on-chain games. He says that games built on blockchains can be designed to prevent any one entity from controlling a world’s fate, while also offering new freedom for users to customize and expand on a game’s design."

In doing so, Jokic ties Magic Johnson (1982) and Draymond Green (2019) for the second-most triple-doubles in a single postseason. The Nuggets’ center now ranks as the only player in NBA history to tally multiple 30-point, 20-rebound triple-doubles (Hall of Famers such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar accomplished that only once).  Jokic did it through relentless aggression from the onset, pouring in 19 points with 16 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks during a first half in which Denver stacked an 18-point lead. The big man now ranks as just the second NBA player to produce 15-plus points and 15-plus rebounds in the first half of a playoff game (Tim Duncan scored 22 points with 16 rebounds against the Lakers in the 2002 West semis).  “It’s a playoff, we need to be aggressive,” Jokic said. “We need to win the game, especially in front of our home crowd because [the Lakers] won two Game 1s [on the road]. Being aggressive, it’s normal right now.”  It also proved crucial toward building a little cushion for a fourth-quarter drought during which Jokic didn’t make a single field goal, as the Lakers closed to 124-121 on an Austin Reaves 3-pointer with 3:23 left to play. Los Angeles’ lone lead of the night (2-0) came on a LeBron James drive to the bucket to start the game, but the Lakers climbed uphill the rest of the way, closing strong with 72 points over the third and fourth quarters.  Here are five quick takeaways from Tuesday’s Game 2:  1. Battle of the bigs  Jokic receives the nod here for his Game 1 performance in arguably the most compelling, and likely decisive, matchup of this entire series. Anthony Davis scored a game-high 40 points (his third career 40-point postseason showing), but the Nuggets’ big man asserted most of the force early in gobbling up 12 rebounds to the visiting team’s total of four in the opening frame, as Denver stormed to a 16-point lead on the strength of a combined 16 points from the two-time Kia MVP and Aaron Gordon. Denver outscored the visiting Lakers 18-12 in the paint in the first quarter, connecting on 50% (9-for-18) from that area, as Jokic set an early tone of physicality that the visitors wouldn’t match until late in the contest.  Keep in mind, the Nuggets entered Game 1 having taken 53% of their shots up to that point from the paint, which ranked as the highest rate for any team in the playoffs, and they connected on 57.2%. It’s also worth noting Los Angeles marched into the conference finals limiting teams to 50.9% shooting from the paint (second lowest in the NBA), and that mark fell to 47.9% with Davis on the court.  Apparently, Jokic wasn’t aware or didn’t care about the latter in the first half because the 28-year-old made it a point to aggressively attack his Lakers counterpart. Jokic smashed the gas on multiple powerful drives resulting in two dunks in the first half, even surprising Davis on a couple by taking him off the bounce.  “On his first post-up, they double-teamed,” Malone said. “They were sending an extra body at him early on. We had a great example we showed at halftime where they double-teamed him, [Kentavious Caldwell-Pope] cut to the basket and got a layup. Then, they started guarding him 1-on-1. When he felt there was 1-on-1 coverage, [he was] facing up, getting to the basket, and using that understated athleticism to finish in traffic. That was great to see.”  The diversity of Jokic’s attack in the first half left Davis guessing in trying to anticipate the Denver center’s next move, and that likely played a role in the 28-year old running up a near triple-double over the first two quarters.  That’s a win for the home team.  “I don’t think you can shut any one aspect of his game down and expect to be OK,” said Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “You just have to come in and have a great initial defender on him and the other four guys being ready to pitch in and just do their job, and again, being early to your spots, because if you have to play catch-up they’ll kill you every time.”  Despite Denver’s fast start, Malone pointed out the team’s lapses in the second half. The Nuggets outscored the visitors 30-24 in the paint in the first half and 16-8 in second-chance points over that span, while outrebounding the Lakers 36-13. The second half told a different story with the Lakers authoring leads in rebounding (17-11), points in the paint (24-20) and second-chance points (5-2).  “We were kind of imposing our will on the glass [in the first half], but that’s got to be for four quarters,” Malone said. “It just can’t be for a half.”  2. Key 2nd-half adjustment  Los Angeles threw multiple looks at Jokic throughout the first half with little success as the Nuggets center carved up the Lakers over the first two quarters, before finishing the night with 34 points on 12-for-17 shooting with 21 rebounds, 14 assists and two blocks. But Ham tossed out an adjustment late in Game 1 that Jokic and the Nuggets should count on seeing again throughout this series.  After Jokic poured in 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting with five assists in the third quarter, Ham deployed Rui Hachimura as a primary defender on the Nuggets center, while letting Davis roam the paint freely to help on Jokic drives.  “Something that we just went to, a little adjustment,” Davis said. “We did end up liking it.”  In a fourth quarter in which Los Angeles pulled to within three points, the Lakers limited Jokic to 0-for-2 from the field as Jamal Murray closed out the game. Murray scored eight points in the fourth quarter, finishing with 31 (on 12-for-20 shooting).  “They definitely had us on our heels,” Malone said. “They became the aggressor and turned the tide in this game with how aggressive they were playing. Late in the game, they put Rui on Nikola and they were just [using] Anthony Davis [like a free safety] letting him man the paint and make it look really crowded. Our execution can be better. But we made enough big plays down the stretch on both ends of the floor to win the game.”  3. Fast road start foiled  The Lakers stole victories in their first road game of the previous two playoff series, averaging 122.5 points in those outings before dropping the other four games averaging 99.5 points. Denver prevented Los Angeles from snatching Game 1 in large part due to aggressive starts from Jokic and Murray, who shot 7-for-11 in the first half (17 points), as the Nuggets build an 18-point halftime lead.  Denver won its seventh straight at Ball Arena in the playoffs, the team’s longest home win streak to start a postseason.  “We have not lost a home game in the playoffs,” Malone said. “They haven’t lost a home game in the playoffs. We told our team that they went to Memphis, went to Golden State and won Game 1 [in] both of those series and wrestled home-court advantage from both of those teams. But for us, it’s maintaining the same course that we’re on, the same mindset and going out there and doing our jobs to the best of our ability.”  4. Denver hits most of main targets  Phoenix ran roughshod over Denver in transition for a couple games in the Western Conference semifinals, and Los Angeles features one of the league’s most devastating bigs in Davis, who leads a Lakers squad that practically lived on the free-throw line in the regular season (26.6 attempts per game). So, naturally, Malone emphasized holding down the Lakers in transition, keeping them off the line, and controlling the paint in the team’s prep work heading into the conference finals.  Denver delivered on a few its objectives to start this series. The Nuggets outscored Los Angeles 19-13 in transition (17 of those points came in the first half), and pounded the Lakers 47-30 on the glass, but finished with a plus-two edge in paint scoring (50-48) while failing to keep the visitors off the free-throw line. Los Angeles averaged 29 attempts from the free-throw line in the Western Conference semifinals and finished that series with a plus-66 advantage in free throws made. The Lakers ended Game 1 with a plus-four edge in free-throw attempts (26-22) and drained 88.5%.  5. Top O vs. Top D  Something’s got to give here, and in Game 1, Denver struck first in flexing the power of its electric offense against Los Angeles’ stingy defense. The Nuggets scored 118.7 points per 100 possessions through the first two rounds of the playoffs, which ranked No. 1 in the NBA going into the West Finals. The Lakers surrendered just 106.5 points per 100 possessions over that same span, good for the NBA’s best defensive efficiency in the playoffs, as they held Memphis and Golden State to 42.2% shooting over 12 contests.  Denver’s 132 points in Game 1 registered as the most it has scored this postseason, and the club’s 106 points through the first three frames set a franchise record for the most points through three quarters. The Nuggets top three scorers in Jokic, Murray and Caldwell-Pope combined for 86 points, while the Lakers’ high-scoring trio of James, Davis and Reaves came together for 89 points. In all, Denver featured six double-figures scorers, compared to four for Los Angeles.  Game 1 marked just the 12th time in Denver franchise history that two Nuggets scored 30 points or more in the same contest.  * * *"

Why it matters: It’s an expansion of an industrywide push to make games more accessible, offering the audience options that wouldn’t be as feasible in other forms of entertainment.  Details: The new settings address fear of spiders or being underwater.  In April, Sony PlayStation hit Horizon Forbidden West was updated to include a thalassophobia mode for players with fears tied to deep water. Turning on that option keeps the protagonist from running out of air while swimming below the surface and adds pulsing and glowing effects to the game’s underwater environment.  Near the end of April, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, from Electronic Arts, launched with an “arachnophobia safe mode” that changes the look of one monstrous creature, hiding its stingers and altering other details to make it look less spider-like.  In early May, Warner Bros. Games’ Hogwarts Legacy (the year’s best-selling console game so far) also added an arachnophobia mode.  Be smart: Developers behind these modes consider them a necessary matter of accessibility, no different from letting players who are colorblind select an option to change how colors appear in the game.  Options around phobias first prominently appeared in 2020, when Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian Entertainment introduced an arachnophobia mode for Grounded, their survival game about shrunken teens trapped in a backyard.  What they’re saying: “We realized that our game features spiders very prominently, and they're very large,” Brian MacIntosh, a programmer at Obsidian, tells Axios. “That could definitely be an issue for some people, so it seemed like something we had to do something about.”  Developers at the studio had also taken note of 2019 indie game Satisfactory, which had a fear option that switched out its spiders for cats.  As they made Grounded, the studio worked with a Microsoft research team to understand how to alleviate phobic player’s fears. They created a “safe mode” slider that alters the game’s spiders gradually, first by removing arms and fangs, all the way to “what we call the danger dumpling,” MacIntosh says. “It's a couple of blobs with eyes on it.”  The goal “was not to just make the spiders not scary.” Rather, “the goal was to provide a mode where someone who's phobic, who has this sort of irrational, very heightened fear of spiders, to bring their fear level down to what someone who's not phobic might experience.”  Between the lines: The phobia options that made Grounded an outlier three years ago have become a trend as accessibility efforts gain more support from project to project.  EA’s Star Wars team at Respawn Entertainment started making their arachnophobia mode about a year ago, members of the team tell Axios, after a developer on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor became unable to work on a key level because of the spider-like design of one creature.  Less polished versions of the creature earlier in development hadn’t triggered the developer’s phobia.  It was too late to change the creature’s design, so, instead, an accessibility working group cooked up a solution: an optional, alternate look for the beast using a trick to obscure its stingers.  At PlayStation studio Guerilla Games, developers had heard from players who viewed the 2020 debut trailer for then-upcoming Horizon Forbidden West.  “Our community team received messages from fans who expressed that they were worried they would not be able to enjoy these sections because of severe fear of deep water,” Joshua van Gageldonk, the game’s project QA lead, tells Axios.  Implementing an alternate thalassophobia setting involved “a ton of different people from all kinds of disciplines on the development side,” to ensure the optional mode didn’t break the game. For example, the audio team had to ensure that the game never triggered choking sounds or drowning animations for its hero as she swam underwater.  State of play: Developers working on these modes say they’re comfortable letting players tweak the content to overcome a phobia.  “That’s something that people value across the team, across all disciplines, to be able to create that accessible game for players [who] otherwise wouldn't have been able to complete the story and experience the journey,” Respawn development director Jonas Lundqvist tells Axios.  “I think it’s incredible that games are opening up more and more to different people,” PlayStation’s van Gageldonk says. “We’re all different, and it’s great if we can customize games to just how we like them.”  What’s next: With each new phobia mode introduced into a game, more are likely to follow, according to Respawn technical designer Michel Wong, who worked on Jedi: Survivor’s arachnophobia mode.  “Having a greater body of work to draw from is beneficial for everyone.”  Among other things, Michel says, they serve as proof, for peers and for their bosses, “to sort of make the case for why it's important and how it would work.”  Sign up for the Axios Gaming newsletter here."

Roleplaying a god is rarely something I feel while playing puzzle games, but Humanity provides it in new and surprising ways. The unique style of puzzle solving uses directional signs and commands to guide droves of miniature people to an endpoint. The puzzles start simple, but Humanity builds on this core system throughout its 100-plus stages in exciting and challenging ways, pushing me to my limit while telling a heartfelt story about human nature.  Humanity is an immediately striking game. Its visual style is minimalistic, focusing squarely on the 3D puzzle area. But soft and beautiful backgrounds spotlight my actions as I guide colorful hordes of humans across various challenges. I begin with one simple command: a direction.

WASHINGTON -- — Joey Meneses drove in four runs as part of a four-hit day, CJ Abrams homered and the Washington Nationals defeated the New York Mets 10-3 on Monday to split a four-game series.  New York has lost nine of its last 13 and dropped 15 of 21 since its 14-7 start. The Mets are 0-5-2 in their last seven series and have not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from April 19-21. Big-spending New York fell to fourth in the NL East, 1 1/2 games ahead of last-place Washington.  “A lot of times you know what the problem is and you’re just trying to figure out ways to fix it,” Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. “That’s what makes this sport difficult. I don’t really know. There’s probably a number of things you can point at.”  Patrick Corbin (2-5) earned his first home victory since last Aug. 28, surrendering two runs and eight hits over six innings.  The rebuilding Nationals, who scored in each inning they batted except the second, improved to 17-17 since losing five of their first six games.  “Let’s forget about the first week of the season,"" Washington manager Dave Martinez said. ""We’ve been playing really well. I want them to take that into consideration. Not just playing one team, but understanding where we’re at and what we’re doing. It’s been fun. They’re playing with a lot of energy. They come to the ballpark ready. They’re engaged. They’re going out there and they’re doing the simple things right.”  Meneses doubled in Lane Thomas with one out in the first to put New York in another early hole. The Mets have been outscored 37-9 in the first inning this season.  Meneses added another RBI double in the third off New York starter David Peterson (1-6). Keibert Ruiz followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.  The Nationals scored two more runs in the fourth and another in the fifth against Peterson, who allowed six runs and nine hits in five innings. Peterson has yielded at least four runs in six consecutive starts, and his ERA ballooned to a season-high 8.08.  “He knows he's capable of pitching well up here and he feels good physically,” manager Buck Showalter said. “That's what's been really frustrating for everybody. Some of the breaking balls have been inconsistent. I thought he had a little better one today, but he just never could get any footing where they had to guard against something.”  Abrams hit a solo shot off Tommy Hunter in the sixth. It was the second day in a row Abrams went deep, and three of his four homers this season have come against the Mets.  Meneses added a run-scoring infield single later in the inning and an RBI double in the eighth. He is hitting .452 (19 of 42) with 20 RBI with runners in scoring position.  The Mets managed three hits in two different innings against Corbin, but pushed across just one run in both of them — Jeff McNeil's RBI single in the second and Tommy Pham's sacrifice fly in the sixth.  New York has not homered since Pete Alonso's second-inning homer Wednesday at Cincinnati, a span of 52 innings. The Mets had two doubles among their 11 hits Monday, while seven of Washington's 15 hits went for extra bases.  “We know what we’re doing right now is not producing wins, but we also know this team is very capable of that,” Nimmo said. “Look to what you’ve done in the past, look at things that have helped in the past and be open to new information on how we can get better. Then when you get up to the plate, it’s compete time. It’s time to grind it out.”  TRAINER'S ROOM  Mets: Showalter said RHP Carlos Carrasco (elbow inflammation) could return from the injured list Friday or Saturday if his between-starts work day goes well. Carrasco pitched four shutout innings Sunday in a rehabilitation start for Double-A Binghamton.  Nationals: Washington activated OF Corey Dickerson (left calf strain) from the injured list and optioned INF/OF Jake Alu to Triple-A Rochester. Dickerson had been on the IL since April 2.  UP NEXT  Mets: RHP Justin Verlander (1-1, 2.25 ERA) makes his first home start at Citi Field on Tuesday as New York begins a three-game series against majors-best Tampa Bay.

""He’s a little bit of a slasher, a little bit of a low on-base compared to the batting average. There’s not a big gap between average and on-base, but the guy puts the bat on the ball. He’s a steady performer in a lot of ways. It was a good night for him.”  Wil Myers' sacrifice fly in the eighth cut the gap, and Doyle homered off Buck Farmer in the bottom half. Doyle, a 25-year-old who debuted on April 24, has four homers in 17 games. He went deep Sunday on his birthday in a 4-0 win over Philadelphia.  “With your mindset, there’s a huge shift,"" Doyle said. ""You gain so much momentum and confidence. You go up there looking at the damage and you know you can do damage because you’ve been swinging the bat well.”  Nick Senzel hit an RBI single in the ninth against Pierce Johnson, who with two on retired Henry Ramos on a game-ending flyout for his seventh save in seven chances.  Daniel Bard (1-0) pitched around a walk in the seventh, getting help when Doyle sprinted in from center to make a diving catch on Spencer Steer leading off. Steer had three hits.  Mike Moustakas also homered for Colorado. The Rockies are 9-4 in May, the second-best win percentage in the major leagues this month behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Cincinnati, which trailed 4-1 and 6-4, is 22-44 at Coors Field since 2002.  Reds starter Hunter Greene gave up six runs and nine hits in four innings with eight strikeouts. He had allowed four home runs in his first eight starts.  Greene averaged 98.2 mph with his fastball, down 0.6 mph from his season average, and reached 100 mph just once.  “I pitched really well tonight,"" Greene said. ""There were pitches that I doubled up on that I shouldn’t have. Those double-ups weren’t as good as the prior pitch.”  Colorado's Connor Seabold gave up six runs — four earned — eight hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Rockies: RHP Nick Mears (left oblique strain) was placed on the 15-day injured list. Colorado selected the contract of LHP Fernando Abad from Triple-A Albuquerque.  Reds: 1B Joey Votto (left biceps, left rotator cuff surgeries) was transferred to the 60-day injured list. … OF TJ Friedl (left oblique strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Friday. In 124 at-bats this season, Friedl is hitting .306. INF Matt McClain's contract was selected from Triple-A Louisville, where he was hitting .348 in 38 games.  UP NEXT  Rockies RHP Chase Anderson, claimed off waivers from Tampa Bay on Friday, is to start Tuesday night in his Rockies debut. He pitched five scoreless innings for the Rays in two relief appearances this year. LHP Brandon Williamson, a 25-year-old left-hander, will make his big league debut for the Reds after going 2-4 with a 6.62 at Triple-A Louisville.  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports"

Some people argue that relaxing with a video game has positive impacts on an individual, while others fear that video games can be addictive and promote negative mood changes.  A new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Sociological Focus, has sort out to answer this heated debate.  How did the researchers find the answer?  The research team analyzed members of an online football simulation gaming site.  In the simulation, players play as a head coach of a football team. The players compete against one another to have the most successful team. The game also allows for communication between competing players.  The players were surveyed at the beginning and end of each game's season for a period of 10 months.  37 players responded before playing the game, 40 responded after playing the game and 30 responded both before and after.  (credit: INGIMAGE)  The surveys included questions on depressive symptoms and abilities to communicate personal issues. The players were also asked to list how many people in real life and online they spoke to about things impacting them.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Dr. Tyler Prochnow from the Department of Health Behavior at Texas A&M University’s School of Public Health said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support, and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  What did the research find?  The researchers found that the size and quality of a social network directly impacted depressive episodes. Online social networks enabled people to find support in coping with their problems.  Players without a strong real-life social network were also more likely to use the online network for support. Players in this situation were also more likely to spend a long time online.  Additionally, the researchers found that a sense of community, and the presence of depressive episodes, could alter the social structure of the group over time.  It is worth noting that the study was based on one type of non-violent video game, and thus the findings cannot be applied as a general rule."

After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. ""It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” said Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, who is in his first year as an NBA head coach after being promoted on the eve of training camp after Ime Udoka was suspended. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for Philadelphia. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year, and the fifth time in six seasons; they have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. ... I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,"" Brown said. ""He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  Banged-Up Brown  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  What's Up, Doc?  Rivers is 6-10 in seventh games. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL's Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: ""Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,"" Embiid said. ""We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  Tip-Ins  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era."

With the win, the Hogs secured their seventh SEC series victory of the season and improved to 30-4 at home this year.  Hollan struck out a career-high 10 batters, limiting the Gamecocks to just one run on five hits and one walk. The left-hander threw a season-high 113 pitches in his nine-inning complete game and recorded 19 consecutive outs until a two-out single in the top half of the ninth inning.  The performance marks the Razorbacks’ first complete game of at least nine innings against an SEC team since Dominic Taccolini’s 10-inning complete game shutout against Kentucky in 2016. Hollan is the second Arkansas pitcher to throw a complete game this season after Will McEntire twirled a nine-inning complete game against Louisiana Tech on April 11.  South Carolina’s lone run of the game came via a leadoff home run in the top of the third. Hollan was untouchable from that point forward, however, allowing the Arkansas offense to hit its groove and take control of the ballgame.  John Bolton’s one-out RBI double to right center in the bottom half of the third tied things at one apiece before Parker Rowland’s go-ahead two-run single to center in the fifth. Rowland’s clutch piece of hitting put the Hogs ahead, 3-1.  Arkansas tacked on two more runs with a two-out RBI single by Caleb Cali in the sixth followed by a two-out solo home run by Ben McLaughlin in the eighth, extending the lead to 5-1. Cali and Peyton Holt both finished with a team-leading three hits, and Rowland collected the Razorbacks’ lone multi-RBI performance of the game.  The Hogs’ four-run lead was more than enough for Hollan to protect as he finished off his complete game with a scoreless ninth inning, securing the Razorbacks’ series-clinching win and put the Hogs in the driver’s seat of the SEC.  Arkansas now owns a one-and-a-half-game lead over LSU in the SEC Western Division and a one-game lead over Florida in the overall SEC standings with three games left to play in the regular season.  Up next, the Hogs will travel to Nashville, Tenn., to close out the regular season at Vanderbilt.

Despite entering each of the past four seasons with championship expectations, he has managed to lose in the second round four years in a row. His teams led three of the four series after five games, and his team had the higher seed in two of those collapses. Sunday was perhaps the worst of them all. Despite leading for most of the first half, the 76ers fell apart against the Boston Celtics, Rivers' former team, in a 33-10 third-quarter debacle. That gave Rivers his NBA record 10th Game 7 loss. No other head coach has more than five Game 7 losses.  As such, questions have immediately arisen surrounding Rivers' job security. While he initially signed a five-year deal to take over the 76ers in 2020, each playoff defeat has been more devastating than the last and the 76ers will now have to consider whether or not they want to give Rivers the chance to lead them for a fourth season. Rivers addressed the rumors at his post-game press conference Sunday, and while he wouldn't deny the inherent insecurity of his profession, he did suggest that he plans to be back next season. ""Yeah. I think I got two years left,"" Rivers said. ""No one is safe in our business and I get that.""  Rivers isn't the only notable 76er whose future is in question. James Harden can be a free agent after re-signing in Philadelphia on a one-year deal with a player option for a second. Rumors have linked him to his old team, the Houston Rockets, all season. He claimed that he has not thought about free agency yet, but that he thinks his current team still has room to grow. ""It's only Year 1 for us together,"" Harden said.  Looming over every decision Philadelphia makes this offseason is Joel Embiid's future. While the MVP winner is under contract for at least three more seasons, superstars are rarely satisfied with humiliating playoff defeats on a seemingly annual basis. All it will take to upend this franchise is one trade request. Embiid has given no indication yet that he plans to leave Philadelphia, but NBA history tells us that he won't be satisfied with second-round exits forever. Embiid did comment on Rivers' future in Philly after Game 7, saying the coach has done a ""fantastic job.""  That is going to inform whatever the 76ers do with Rivers, Harden and the rest of their team this offseason. The clock was already ticking. After what happened on Sunday, Philadelphia will have to make major moves to keep their best player happy. The logical place to start that process would be with a new coach."

He was 0 for 2 from the field after intermission in the Sixers’ Round 2, Game 6 defeat to the Heat.  On Sunday afternoon at TD Garden, he scored three second-half points. The Celtics then immediately piled up 18 in a row as the Sixers crumbled on their way to another second-round playoff exit, losing Game 7 in a blowout.  Harden had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, seven assists, six rebounds and five turnovers. Across the Sixers’ four losses in the series, he made a mere 12 of 55 field goals (21.8 percent). While Harden was brilliant in Games 1 and 4 and very solid in Game 5, he and the Sixers were not nearly good enough with the season at stake.  Head coach Doc Rivers gave a generous spin on the 10-time All-Star’s outing.  “I thought James came to play,” Rivers said. “I really did. I thought he was trying to see the game. I thought he played downhill a lot. Where he passed the ball was the right decisions tonight, and we didn’t get anything out of it. I get it. James, (Joel Embiid), me ... I know we’ve got to point somewhere, right? But I thought James, in particular, he was trying to do the right things tonight. I really did.”  Harden, who will turn 34 years old in August, missed 24 games this season, including four in March with left Achilles soreness that he said had been bothering him “for some months.” When healthy, he regularly created excellent shots for everyone around him with inch-perfect hit-ahead feeds, smooth pick-and-roll passes, and well-timed kick-outs. After starting 12-12, the Sixers went an NBA-best 42-16 and were second in offensive rating. Harden led the league in assists for a second time with 10.7 per game.  For next season, he has a player option of $35.6 million.  “James has a decision to make this summer, and he’ll make it,” Rivers said. “I think he overall enjoyed being here. It’s tough for him. We asked him to play a little differently than he’s always been accustomed to. I think it made us a better team. And unfortunately, I thought for James at times, it wasn’t always best for him. But he still did it. You appreciate that as a coach.”  Speaking minutes later in the visiting locker room, Harden didn’t provide much to supplement his coach’s comments on that subject.  “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said of his player option.  What is he looking for next?  “I just want to have a chance to compete,” Harden said. “Compete.”  Harden also offered little when asked about Rivers, whom he’d called “one of the best coaches to ever coach the game of basketball” at his introductory Sixers press conference last February.  “Our relationship is OK,” he said.  Harden did agree with the notion that he and Embiid can further grow their partnership.  “Definitely,” he said. “I feel like we had a pretty solid team. Obviously, you always look to get better, whether it’s the personnel you have now or adding pieces. We’ll see how it goes.”  By next postseason, Embiid will be 30 years old.  “We’ve got an unfinished job,” the MVP big man said. “We haven’t won anything, and I think we’ve got a chance to win. Obviously, going to seven games and having a chance to close it out at home, which we didn’t do. I still believe we’ve got the chance to win. We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I know (Harden) has a player option or they can extend him, but that’s on those guys to figure it out. I’m going to stay out of it, but I still believe that me and him, we’ve got the chance to win.  “It’s going to take more than us. We’ve all got to look at ourselves. I’ve got to be better and I will be better. That’s what I’m focused on. All of us, we’ve got to come back and find ways to just keep improving and help the team. You can’t win alone. I can’t win alone. Me and James, we just can’t win alone. That’s why basketball, it’s played 5-on-5. We just need everybody to keep trying to find ways to get better, and we’ll be fine.”"

Paul DeJong added a solo shot and Arenado drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who won for the sixth time in seven games since an eight-game losing streak. Their previous two wins came on ninth-inning rallies against closer Kenley Jansen at Fenway Park.  Lars Nootbaar had three hits and scored three times for St. Louis, and Paul Goldschmidt added two hits and an RBI. Miles Mikolas (2-1) pitched six innings of one-run ball, allowing four hits with two walks.  “We are a playoff team despite our bad start,” Mikolas said. “The talent is there. We're a very good baseball team.”  Rafael Devers had an RBI single for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games.  It was the first series sweep this season for St. Louis (16-25), which owns the NL’s worst record. Arenado homered over the Green Monster once in each game of the series.  The Cardinals finished a six-game road trip to Wrigley Field and Fenway Park at 5-1.  “It's a good road trip,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “To get back on track and the way we've done it, against two good teams, to be able to go out there with the style of play that has been really good. I know I've said it several times, but that clubhouse has trust in one another.”  Red Sox starter Corey Kluber (2-5) gave up four runs and seven hits — two homers — in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.  “I put us in a hole early,” he said. “I think it just boils down to poor fastball command.”  DeJong’s shot into the center-field seats broke a 1-all tie in the second. Knizner’s drive came in the fourth, also going out to center.  Boston’s Enmanuel Valdez had a two-run homer overturned by review in the seventh on a drive that replays showed hooked foul just short of Pesky's Pole.  Génesis Cabrera escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, getting Masataka Yoshida to fly out to end the inning.  “Played two good games and we lost in the ninth and today they kicked our butt,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.  DAD KNOWS  Standing on the field about two hours before the game, Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale asked how the Boston Celtics were doing in Game 7 of their NBA playoff series against Philadelphia. When informed All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had 25 points at halftime, the lefty said: “He’s my oldest son’s favorite athlete. He says it’s me, but I think that’s just to make me feel good. He has two of his jerseys and only one of mine.”  BACK INTO IT  Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras was stretching and squatting with a catcher’s mitt in the clubhouse before the game. After a break from catching, Contreras is slated to be back behind the plate Monday against Milwaukee. He was moved to DH on May 5.

After the Sixers were eliminated in Game 7 of the 2021 NBA Playoffs as a No. 1 seed to the No. 5 Atlanta Hawks, a game in which Simmons infamously passed up a wide-open dunk, he eventually requested a trade in the offseason. He did not play to start the 2022 regular season, citing not being ready mentally, then was traded to Brooklyn in a deal that landed Philadelphia James Harden at the deadline.  But the post-Simmons era has not yielded fruit for Harden, Joel Embiid and Co. either, as they've been bounced in the second round for consecutive seasons.  Simmons played 42 games for the Nets this season and averaged 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 26.3 minutes per game."

Drury, the sixth seed in the tournament, ends the year with a 30-24 record. Quincy will go to the NCAA-II Tournament with an automatic berth at 44-9.  The Hawks started the game with three runs in the top of first and opened up the lead by posting six runs in the third inning.  Drury got on the board with two runs in the fifth, scoring on a Carson Shaver RBI double, then on a sacrifice fly from Tyler Bastunas.  Quincy, the top scoring offense in the GLVC that averaged more than nine runs per game, kept scoring and added two more in the sixth as well as a single run in the seventh and eighth to lead 13-2.  The Panthers put up four runs in the eighth, highlighted by Shaver’s bases-clearing double that drove in three, but the deficit was too much.  “If you want to beat Quincy, you have to out-pitch them and out-hit them and we weren’t able to do either of those things today,” said Drury head coach Scott Nasby. “We had a long night but a great night last night, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to carry that over to today.”  Jay Hammel (6-2) got the win for the Hawks while Drury starter Cade Waits (5-6) took the loss.  Shaver finished the game going 2 for 4 with two doubles and 4 RBI’s. Graydon Miller went 2 for 3 with two runs and a double.  Hawks DH Austin Simpson went 4 for 5 with 5 RBI’s and he hit his 17th home run of the year.  Drury entered the GLVC Tournament on a seven-game losing streak and was one out away from a loss in Thursday’s opening round as they trailed Maryville 3-1 when Brooks Sunny’s two-RBI single tied the game. The Panthers beat the Saints in 11 innings 6-3, then picked up a 12-4 win over William Jewell on Friday.  Drury had a late start to their game on Saturday as the first pitch was not until 9:40 pm, and in a game that lasted until 1:08 am on Sunday, the Panthers downed Indianapolis 11-4 avenging a loss earlier in the season to UIndy starter Brady Ware, who no-hit Drury while hitting for the cycle at the plate in the same game on April 7.  “I thought we brought some great energy into the tournament,” said Nasby. “We had some great performances offensively and on the mound and had a lot of positivity through the weekend.  “It was good to see some people step up like Graydon Miller, who hadn’t really played at all this year, but came through with some big hits when we needed them this weekend. Brooks Sunny continued to be a clutch player like he was all season, and it was good to see a senior, Carson Shaver, go out playing as well as he did today.”  Sunday’s championship marks the sixth time in program history the Panthers have reached the GLVC title game."

TORONTO -- — Danny Jansen hit a two-run single in the ninth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays rallied to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.  George Springer hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, who are 12-3 at home this season.  “This team’s resilient,” Jansen said. “We’re looking to win every game, and we believe that we can with the bats and the staff we have.”  With Toronto trailing 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero thought he tied the game to begin the ninth, pumping his fist as he watched his deep drive to right, but Guerrero was held to a single when the ball hit the wall.  The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two outs before Jansen singled to left field off Raisel Iglesias (1-1), driving in Guerrero and Matt Chapman.  “We had an opportunity to win the game and we couldn’t close the deal,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “It’s frustrating, but this game is frustrating.”  The Braves have lost four straight and five of eight.  “Tough one to swallow,” Atlanta’s Austin Riley said.  Nate Pearson (1-0) worked one inning for the win.  Ozzie Albies hit a two-run home run, and Ronald Acuña Jr. and Kevin Pillar each added solo blasts for Atlanta, which has lost nine straight against Toronto.  “Winning against a team like that three games in a row is really hard,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said.  The Braves made three errors and the Blue Jays had two defensive miscues, both by Gold Glove third baseman Chapman. Toronto pitchers also made a pair of wild pitches.  Snitker said he didn’t realize how windy it was on the field with the roof at Rogers Centre open until he came out to replace right-hander Collin McHugh in the second.  Pillar, who played with Toronto from 2013 until 2019, agreed that the conditions were “difficult” Sunday.  “You don’t feel a lot of the wind at ground level, it’s kind of up higher when those balls get up there,” Pillar said. “The ball was moving all over the place.”  Acuña homered on left-hander Yusei Kikuchi’s third pitch of the game, the 28th leadoff homer of his career, and Michael Harris II made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.  Toronto responded with three runs in the bottom of the second. Brandon Belt hit an RBI single and Guerrero’s base hit drove in a pair of runs.  Albies connected in the third, his 10th homer of the season.  Pillar made it 5-3 in the fourth when he homered against his former team, his fourth of the season, but Springer cut the Blue Jays’ deficit to one when he answered in the bottom half with a solo drive to left, his fifth.  McHugh made his first start of the season for Atlanta. He gave up three runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings.  Kikuchi allowed five runs, four earned, and nine hits in 4-plus innings.  WELCOME BACK  Pillar got a standing ovation before he batted in the second, his first at bat of the series and first appearance in Toronto since April 24, 2019, with San Francisco.  “It’s definitely really special to come back that many years later and to be remembered and to be appreciated,” Pillar said. “It was overwhelming.”  TABLE SETTER  Acuña reached base four times and scored twice. He leads the NL in hits (54), total bases (90), runs scored (36), stolen bases (17).  UP NEXT  Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (4-3, 3.32) starts Monday when Atlanta begins a three-game series at Texas.

""We’re going to bring it home all the way this year.”  “It was an electric environment,"" said Patriots player Julian Edelman. ""There’s a Boston vs. Philly thing that we’ve had the last decade.""  The Celtics won with 24 points ahead of the 76ers by the end of the game, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals to go against the Miami Heat.

The 3rd overall pick of the 2017 Draft broke a league record on Sunday for the most points in a Game 7 match.  “I thought he was hot as fish grease but nah I said he’s hot as whale grease. Because that dude was cooking,"" said a Cedric Maxwell, retired Celtic and radio broadcaster.  Philly's best hardly showed up, and former Celtics Head Coach Doc Rivers now has the most Game 7 losses of any coach in league history.  “[I] Was expecting a bounce back game from Harden after a brutal Game 5 and 6, but just did not get it,"" said a 76ers fan at the Garden.  The Celtics are up against the 76ers tomorrow (Sunday) at TD Garden for Game 7, and the city of Boston is behind them.  Philly didn't show up in part because of how Boston's fans did after Jaylen Brown called them out following Game 6.  ""Y'all love to call us out,"" said Brown. ""I'm calling you guys out this time. The energy in the garden has been okay at best all [of] playoffs.""  After Sunday's victory, Brown said this: ""Way to respond. The energy in the building was through the roof, it was amazing.""  “Jaylen was right!"" said actor Donnie Wahlberg. ""Watch our interview from a week ago. I said the same thing. It hasn’t quite been the energy level! Tonight they answered the call. Jaylen was right to call everyone out.”  Brandy Cole chats with Latoyia Edwards ahead of Mother's Day, when her son, Jayson Tatum, and the Celtics will play in Game 7 against the 76ers.  Celtics fans answered the call, some even cancelling plans to see them play.  ""We had an anniversary dinner planned for this week, but we decided the money was better spent on Game 7 tickets, said Brittany Hopkins.  “Wow. It was the best way to spend a five year anniversary,"" said Hopkin's boyfriend Sam Coveny.  Fans outside of TD Garden said Tatum's role in the Game 7 victory solidified his Celtics legacy.  ""He’s stamped,"" said Celtics fan Benjamin Tranfaglia. ""He’s solidified. He needs to bring that ring home. But after that performance and a few others? He’s stamped."""
