game,2023-05-15,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T18:37:00,"Ever since the bitter ending of the 2016 Wild Card game, Toronto has hardly been a welcoming place for the Orioles. Heading into the 2023, the Orioles were 17-28 in Rogers Centre since Buck Showalter made the ill-fated decision to pitch Ubaldo Jimenez instead of Zach Britton in that winner-take-all playoff match up. However, the first 45 games of this season have been a referendum on all those who expected the Orioles to backslide toward mediocrity. In a similar manner, Friday night’s win over the Blue Jays in Toronto can be seen as a turning of the tide when it comes to the O’s success north of the border.  What seemingly never changes is just how locked in Ryan Mountcastle is when he steps up to the plate against the Blue Jays. After going 1-3 with the decisive three-run HR on Friday, the O’s first baseman raised his career average against the Toronto to .323, to go along with a 1.030 OPS, 15 HRs and 36 RBIs. After hitting .313 with a 5 HRs and 17 RBIs in Rogers Centre last season, RMC seems intent to continue to victimizing Blue Jays pitching in 2023.  Today, Mountcastle and the rest of the Orioles lineup are tasked with doing damage against one of the AL’s best pitchers from last season in Alek Manoah. After finishing third in AL Cy Young voting last year, Manoah’s start to the 2023 campaign has been less than spectacular. After putting up mixed results in the first month of the season—two quality starts balance out by two truly poor start—Manoah’s disappointed throughout May. In three starts this month, the big right-hander is 0-3 with a 6.59 ERA and .321 batting average against. These struggles from Manoah are a welcome sign to the Orioles hitters that struggled against the All-Star pitcher last year. In five starts against Baltimore last year, Manoah limited Orioles hitters to a .180 average on his way to 2.54 ERA against the Birds from Baltimore.  The Orioles counter with their own flaming-throwing righty in rookie Grayson Rodriguez. The O’s prized rookie starter has been equally up and down throughout his first eight big league starts. We’ve seen some excellent efforts—back-to-back starts of five shutout innings against Detroit, only allowing two runs in 5.2 innings against league best Tampa Bay—to go along with some less-than-stellar outings. Last Monday against the Angels was Rodriguez’ worst start of the season, allowing eight runs over 3.1 innings against Shohei Ohtani and the Angels. The good news: Rodriguez has been better overall on the road this season. His ERA away from Camden Yards is over 1.5 runs lower and he’s put up strikeout rate of over 12 per nine innings on the road.

Each game seems to have one mistake you can circle as the reason for the loss. They say you lose as a team, and it is never about one play. Everything still seems to go back to the start of this losing streak when the Nats held a 2-run lead in the 9th inning and blew the save via a Marlins’ walk-off home run.  In manager Dave Martinez‘s postgame presser last night, he did not look to be his normal self, and the pressure might be getting to him.

We’re now we’re in mid-May and EA Sports has still not unveiled Madden NFL 24. We have no idea about the Madden 24 cover athlete, a release date or platforms, or any new gameplay features. For football fans eager for a first look at this year’s game, when can we expect EA to lift the curtain?  When will EA reveal Madden 24?  Looking at the calendar, the next major gaming event is Summer Game Fest. The annual summer gaming celebration, which has effectively replaced E3, is scheduled to take place from June 8 through June 10.  In previous years, EA would host its own showcase separate from E3 or Summer Game Fest; however, plans changed last year when the publisher chose not to hold the event and instead reveal each of its games when it was right for them.  EA has not announced any plans for EA Play Live 2023, which suggests they could once again be opting not to hold a showcase. They could instead be taking the same approach of showing a game when there’s something significant to show.  With the Madden NFL 24 Closed Beta taking place in June, EA could be waiting to reveal this year’s game next month. Perhaps at Summer Game Fest? If you recall, Madden 23 was revealed on June 2, while Madden 22 was unveiled on June 17.  EA’s struggles with the Madden franchise have been well-documented these past few years. After Madden 23’s disappointment — especially the major franchise save bug — there’s a lot riding on Madden 24. If EA were to put out another lackluster football game, it could spell the end of the franchise as far as fans are concerned.  Maybe that’s why EA has waited so long to reveal the game.

Corbin (3-5) allowed two runs and six hits in six innings against the Tigers, the only big league team he had never faced. He struck out three, reaching 1,500 in his career when he fanned Jonathan Scoop in the sixth.  “Always cool to hit those milestones,"" Corbin said. ""I guess it means you've been around awhile. I think it's even sweeter to come away with a win today.""  Following up on a win over the New York Mets, Corbin won consecutive starts for the first time since beating Cincinnati on Aug. 28 and the Mets on Sept. 3. He settled in after allowing a first inning two-run homer.  “I thought everything was solid,” Corbin said. “I thought I located well. A lot of quick at-bats. A few less pitches there, which is good. ... You give up the homer, but it's still early so you just forget about it, move forward and try to put up as many zeros as you can.”  Follow every game: Latest MLB Scores and Schedules  Carl Edwards Jr., Hunter Harvey and Kyle Finnegan finished with hitless relief. Finnegan converted his ninth save in 11 chances, ending a game that took 2 hours, 3 minutes.  Jeimer Candelario homered and hit a run-scoring double for Washington, which fell behind when Spencer Torkelson homered in the first. The Tigers managed four more singles against Corbin, but couldn't string together hits.  “He just started keeping the ball on the ground,” Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. “I think almost half his outs were on the ground.""  Alex Faedo (0-2) gave up three runs and five hits in five innings. Detroit had won three of four.  After Candelario's fourth-inning homer, Thomas' single past diving shortstop Javier Báez gave the Nationals a 3-2 lead in the fifth.  “It jammed me a little bit but luckily it found a hole,” Thomas said.

USM had hit two grand slams in a game before, with Matt Baltz and David Vilardi each going deep with the bases loaded in 1999 against Nicholls State University in Hattiesburg.  But Lynch became Saturday the first Golden Eagles to hit two grand slams in the same game.  Lynch’s first home run cleared the fence in right field and cleared the bases in the bottom of the first inning off Louisiana starter David Christie, tying the game, 4-4.  Reece Ewing, Christopher Sargent and Rodrigo Montenegro scored for the Golden Eagles.  Trailing 8-5 heading into the bottom of the fifth inning, Lynch homered with the bases loaded off Louisiana reliver Brendan Moody, giving USM a short-lived 9-8 lead against the Ragin’ Cajuns.

Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled the latest round of additions to Game Pass that would be rolling out in the days ahead. Some of these forthcoming arrivals include Massive Chalice, Railway Empire 2, and Chicory: A Colorful Tale, to name a few. And while this lineup is pretty solid overall, it won't come without the cost of a handful of losses.

game,2019-02-18,Not Discerned,"{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T18:56:00,"So, the NB A is considering changing the All-Star game format yet again. According to a report by Shams Charania and Mike Vorkunov of The Athletic, this has been a topic discussed recently among the Board of Governors (team owners) and general managers. The A ssociation wants to increase the competitiveness of the All-Star game and apparently feels like this is one of the solutions.  Maybe they’ve forgotten, but the format of the game was changed in 2018 due in part to a lack of competitiveness in the game. And that’s not anything new for the NBA’s All-Star game. It’s been a glorified 24 H our F itness pickup game for the past decade, no matter the format. Teams barely play defense in the regular season, so it shouldn’t be shocking that no one is going all out in the All-Star game. Players have little incentive to lay it all on the line like those back in the day. That’s just how players view it.  Advertisement  Thirty years ago, when role players weren’t bringing in eight-figure salaries, guys wanted every extra penny they could come across. So, the added bonus that came with playing on the winning team of an All-Star game was huge even for stars of the game back then. Now, most players who play in the All-Star game already have $100+ million contracts that are guaranteed, so playing hard in an exhibition with the potential of getting injured is out of the question. We’re lucky they play hard in the closing minutes when the game is on the line. But expecting every player to go full throttle in a game that means nothing to them is purely naïve.  Keep the draft aspect, even if the game reverts to East vs. West  If the NBA does go back to East vs. West, they should keep the drafting aspect of the game. Fans have enjoyed that for the past few years, and it adds a little spice to the event. Whether it’s players getting “snubbed” or guys trash-talking each other, as we saw with James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo in the early years of the current format. That drama adds to the spectacle because those one-on-one encounters are usually the most competition we get surrounding the game.  Advertisement  There could still be team captains if the league wanted to keep that wrinkle. Each team captain could only pick from the pool of players in their respective conferences. That would be the simplest way to reform this process and still make it fun for fans while also being able to create content for television, which is what all this is about. It always comes back to advertising, TV partnerships, and dollar, dollar bills y’all. That’s the name of the game.  As far as getting players to take this game seriously like they would any other, well, that’s a pipedream. The NBA can make all the changes they want, and it still won’t matter. That ship sailed long ago, and it ain’t returning. Going back to East against West would be a nice bit of nostalgia, but that’s about it. We’ll continue to hear the same complaints from fans and media that we’ve heard for years. Aside from money, players have little incentive to play hard for 48 minutes in an All-Star game. When you’ve got players who can make $5-10 million per year and never sniff an All-Star selection, good luck getting high-paid stars to play that game like it means anything of consequence.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZGVhZHNwaW4uY29tL25iYS1hbGwtc3Rhci1nYW1lLWVhc3Qtd2VzdC1jaGFuZ2VzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLTE4NTA0NTg0OTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-07-12,Not Discerned,"{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}",2023-05-20T11:00:52,"Over the past few years, I’ve found myself mourning the PlayStation brand I grew up with. When I was a kid, PlayStation was an eccentric platform home to the kind of oddball creative swings you now only ever see indie publishers take a chance on. In the PS5 era, though, Sony has doubled down on a cinematic action-adventure formula that feels less safe (though likely way more profitable) by comparison. It’s an understandable pivot, but it leaves me hungry for more diverse experiences on my PS5.  Thankfully, that desire has been satiated with Humanity, a game that’s already nabbing several impressive accolades from me. It’s the best reason to subscribe to PS Plus, the best game currently available on PlayStation VR2, and perhaps the best PS5 console-exclusive period (it’s also available on PC via Steam). The unique puzzler has all the markings of those left-field PlayStation classics I love … except for the fact it wasn’t developed or published by Sony at all.  Recommended Videos  Whether you enjoy complex puzzle games or just want a good excuse to use your PSVR2, Humanity is one of 2023’s few “can’t miss” games. What starts as a straightforward game about directing rows of marching people quickly turns into an insightful, challenging, and at times dark meditation on humanity’s ability to evolve and organize.  A true PlayStation game  In Humanity, players control a shiba inu tasked with herding rows of wandering humans through puzzle chambers. Each trial is set in a small room and largely revolves around an endless stream of humans flowing out of a door. In most levels, the goal is to direct that aimless traffic by placing commands down on tiles that the humans will follow when they pass by them. These include telling them when to turn or jump, as well as granting them the power to split into different directions, float, and more. Generally, they need to be directed towards some sort of goal, though that formula gets twisted in increasingly clever ways later on.  That premise creates some striking visual imagery. It’s a bit of a marvel to see thousands of tiny humans wandering around on screen — and it’s even more impressive once they’re following the intricate pathways I lay out for them. One level had me splitting rows of humans down a Q*bert-esque grid so they could reach three different goals. Another has me sending them crisscrossing over a bridge by floating over fans, creating multiple archways of human bodies. There’s something oddly satisfying about that; It’s like watching ants march around in their incredibly disciplined fashion.  While it can be played outside of VR, the experience gets even better in a headset. My playthrough has almost exclusively been in PSVR2, where I get a bird’s eye view of each level. That lets me get a better look at each level and game plan much easier, while enhancing that ant hill perspective even more. It’s an immersive experience and by far the most compelling reason to pick up Sony’s new headset yet.  A lot of excellent puzzle games come to mind as I play through its engrossing trials. Its diorama-like levels remind me of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, while the visual of a stream of bodies wandering around helplessly makes it feel like a modern version of Lemmings. The closest comparison, though, is something even more obscure: Echochrome. The 2008 Sony title (which is available in PS Plus’ retro catalog) has players controlling the path of an autonomous mannequin. Humanity very much feels like a spiritual successor to that title, right down to a powerful level creator that’ll give it lots of longevity beyond its 80 main puzzles.  As I played through it, I had to double-check to make sure it hadn’t been developed internally at PlayStation Studios. It’s a tonal dead-ringer for the platform’s older exclusives, holding that same atmospheric weirdness that makes games like Fantavision or I.Q.: Intelligent Qube so endearing. Perhaps that’s why Sony has included it as a freebie for PS Plus members, one of the best moves it has made with its subscription service platform so far. It’s perfectly positioned for the current PlayStation ecosystem.  The dark side of humanity  I knew that Humanity’s challenging puzzles would get my brain moving, but I didn’t expect it to hit me as hard as it did on a thematic level too. Though it may look like a simple puzzle game about routing objects to a destination (like Freshly Frosted, but with humans instead of donuts), there’s a surprisingly rich meditation about human evolution here — and a dark one at that.  That’s because of a big gameplay change midway through its seven themed chapters. Each set of levels introduces a new tool or idea that helps the at first aimless humans better deal with obstacles. At around the midway point, it tosses in computer-controlled humans who are in competition with your little guys. That playful dynamic quickly balloons into a full-on war, as the rival faction starts attacking with laser guns and swords. That’s where things radically change.  Around chapter four, Humanity gives players a set of new commands: ones that arm humans with weapons. While the gameplay hook remains the same, levels morph into real-time tactics battles where players need to find the right way to push back against waves of ongoing enemies and wipe them out en route to safety. The cute navigation puzzles soon become dark, with tooltips explaining useful battle formations instead of helpful puzzle hints. I watch as my dumb little herd of humans turns into an organized militia, cutting down thousands of faceless people with cold efficiency.  It’s a brilliant twist that speaks to the quietly subversive nature of Humanity. It isn’t just giving players stylish routing puzzles for the sake of brain-teasing fun. Rather, it’s using that format to visualize the way that civilizations form from chaos — in both astonishing and terrifying ways. It’s a more effective commentary on war than any Call of Duty game I’ve played.  Humanity is certainly a bit of a niche title. Some of its convoluted puzzle solutions are sure to cause frustration, even though the game includes handy video solutions for each one. Though I’d still recommend it to anyone who usually doesn’t click with the genre. This is one of those special, one-of-a-kind games that puts more thought into how game mechanics can naturally communicate some ideas better than any other medium. It’s a totally oddball experience and one that I’m hoping we see Sony nurture more in its current big-budget ecosystem.  Humanity is out now on PS4, PS5, and PC. It’s compatible with VR headsets, including PlayStation VR2.

game,2023-05-24,21:00:00,"{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T21:33:51,"With the absence of E3, Sony is kicking off the first major event of the gaming season with their PlayStation Showcase, scheduled for May 24th at 1 pm PST / 9 pm BST / 6 am AEST (next day).  What makes it intriguing is that this showcase serves as a precursor to the Summer Game Fest 2023 event, commencing on June 8th. Of particular interest is the wording used by Sony when they announced the event, stating that they will discuss upcoming PS5 titles. This suggests that the showcased games might leverage the advancements of the PlayStation 5, including the SSD technology and 60 FPS performance.  While we cannot predict the future, here are a few notable games that we anticipate will be revealed. Are you excited to see if any of your most anticipated games will make an appearance?  Ghost of Tsushima – In-game Screenshot  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2  The first game on our list is the highly anticipated Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, featuring the iconic web-slinging hero in the vibrant setting of New York City. Developed by Insomniac, who previously delivered an exceptional experience with Spider-Man for PlayStation 4 in 2018, this game was nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards. It marked Insomniac’s successful foray into creating a Marvel superhero game, captivating gamers with the immersive thrill of becoming Spider-Man.  Receiving glowing reviews from critics and achieving resounding success, Spider-Man set the stage for the release of its spin-off title, Miles Morales, in 2020. Though a shorter game in comparison to its predecessor, Spider-Man: Miles Morales was equally fantastic, leaving fans wondering if a Spider-Man 2 was on the horizon.  At the PlayStation Showcase in 2021, Insomniac delighted fans by unveiling both a thrilling trailer for Spider-Man 2 and an exciting new project, Marvel’s Wolverine. Sony officially announced that the release window for Spider-Man 2 is set for 2023, as confirmed on the PlayStation Blog. Insomniac later specified a more precise release in Fall 2023 through a tweet in December 2022.  Since then, information about the game has been scarce, leaving fans eagerly awaiting a gameplay reveal and an official release date. As the anticipated release approaches, it’s highly likely that Insomniac will soon break their silence, providing fans with the exciting details they’ve been eagerly anticipating.  Spider-Man 2 Reveal Trailer  The Return of Metal Gear Solid  As a passionate fan, I’ve long held hope for the revival of some beloved franchises from Konami’s extensive catalogue, such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. Over the years, rumours have circulated about Konami’s potential plans, and my optimism grew when MGS producer Noriaki Okamura hinted at a series of announcements, including the return of a “long-awaited” franchise, in an interview with Famitsu.  Although Okamura’s statement leaves room for speculation, it carries weight considering his involvement in one of Konami’s most successful franchises, with the last instalment being The Phantom Pain in 2015. Based on this, I strongly believe that a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 could be in the works for the PlayStation platform. Konami might be seeking to regain momentum following disappointing releases like Metal Gear Survive and eFootball, and revisiting the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid 3, a favourite among many fans, would undoubtedly be met with great enthusiasm.  While it’s true that the series was primarily shaped by the renowned game director Hideo Kojima, it’s important to note that Konami retains the rights to the license and engine. Thus, they have the capability to create a remake even after parting ways with Kojima in 2015, following the release of MGS: The Phantom Pain and the cancellation of Silent Hill, represented by the PT demo.  Only time will reveal Konami’s intentions and whether they will embark on revitalising the Metal Gear Solid franchise. As a lifelong fan, I am eagerly keeping my fingers crossed for an exciting announcement and the potential resurrection of this beloved series.  Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain – In-game Screenshot  7 Good  Bloodborne Remaster at the PlayStation Showcase  We’re eagerly anticipating the possibility of another remastered edition of a PlayStation classic from 2015, developed by an acclaimed Game of the Year winner. Bloodborne, crafted by FromSoftware, garnered universal praise from both critics and players alike. Despite ultimately losing the Game of the Year award to The Witcher 3, Bloodborne left a lasting impact on the gaming community. Following the release of Dark Souls 2, where FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki took a backseat, he sought to regain his creative stride and found it in the Victorian-era, Souls-style gameplay of Bloodborne. Miyazaki himself has expressed that Bloodborne is his favourite title among the Souls-like games.  Since its initial launch in 2015, Bloodborne has been locked at a 30 FPS frame rate, designed to maximise the capabilities of the PlayStation 4 technology at the time. However, I strongly believe that the game would greatly benefit from a graphics overhaul and the ability to run smoothly at 60 FPS.  With its self-contained narrative reaching its conclusion, the likelihood of a sequel seems uncertain, making a remastered version a more feasible desire. Not only would a remaster enhance the visual experience, but it would also serve as a delightful treat for fans of FromSoftware, bridging the gap until the release of Elden Ring‘s highly anticipated first DLC, Shadows of the Erdtree.  I am confident that I speak on behalf of countless Souls fans when I say that a Bloodborne remaster would be a truly fantastic surprise, reigniting our love for this remarkable game and satisfying our craving for more unforgettable experiences from FromSoftware.  Bloodborne – Key Art  What Games Can You Expect At The PlayStation Showcase?  As the reveal season dawns upon us, Sony has chosen May 24th as the date to provide a glimpse into the future of PlayStation 5. While my personal hopes lie with certain titles, there is always room for surprises that may surpass our expectations. Could we witness the unveiling of a Ghost of Tsushima sequel, a final trailer for Final Fantasy 16, or even gameplay footage for Death Stranding 2? The possibilities are endless, and our desires and aspirations run deep.  I have a strong intuition that regardless of the specific reveals, fans will emerge from the showcase with a sense of hope and satisfaction, knowing that the future of PS5 holds promising games. Yet, all we can do for now is exercise patience and eagerly anticipate what awaits us not only during the showcase but also throughout the Summer Game Fest in June.  Irrespective of the outcome, I will be present with my popcorn and overflowing excitement, eager to witness the unveiling of new worlds to explore or the rejuvenation of beloved classics in a fresh light.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVjcmF0ZXIuY29tL3BsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXdoYXQtdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXMtd2lsbC13ZS1zZWUv0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ2FtZWNyYXRlci5jb20vcGxheXN0YXRpb24tc2hvd2Nhc2Utd2hhdC12aWRlby1nYW1lcy13aWxsLXdlLXNlZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-07-28,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T15:00:00,"Small personal accomplishment: I bowled a 530 series Friday night. That’s the highest series I’ve had since my fusion in September. I bowled a 543 the week before the surgery and so I guess I feel like I’m almost all of the way back. After taking off the fall and bowling one league in the spring, I’m back to two for the summer. Baby steps and progress!  And this came at a time when I don’t really need a paragraph of filler. While I was getting into a pretty good rhythm Friday night, so were the Cubs. And they did it on both sides of the ball. I’m not going to be obtuse about it. This was a strong game with a lot of good things, things that can be built on and lead this team forward.  At the same time, I’m not ready to throw a parade. I felt this way a few weeks ago when they Cubs came home after a disastrously bad road trip to Miami and Washington with a solid win. Over the first 44 games of the season, the Cubs are like a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde team. They can look so good at times and so bad at others.  The story is well known by now. The starting pitching has been fantastic. Teams that have starting pitching as good as what the Cubs have featured to date are generally playoff teams. There have been a couple of clunkers over the last week or so. but by and large the most dependable part of this Cubs team has been their starting pitching.  After that, it gets more and more dicey. The offense has been statistically one of the best in baseball. Interestingly much of that was put up before Christopher Morel joined the team. He has been hands down the best player on the team since he joined it 10 days ago. Of course, some of that is offset by the torrid April of Patrick Wisdom. Wisdom has fallen off in May and not long after, Morel arrived.  But the offense has been maddeningly inconsistent. The old habits of striking out all too often and struggling with runners on base have reared their head increasingly. Amusingly, when you sort out the numbers, the Cubs are 12th in total team strikeouts, not all that much higher than league average. Even though it feels like they’ve grounded into a million double plays, they’ve actually been below average at that.  It has certainly been frustrating to watch the offense be so good one night and come up empty the next. Still, they have legitimately been one of the top 10 offenses in baseball. Even with the inconsistency, you can live with the work being done by the lineup.  The real frustrating things for this team are the performance in high leverage situations. When you search splits on Baseball Reference, you can find a statistic called Clutch and another called cClutch. I’ve not studied the methodology to have any impression on the effectiveness of the stat. But I don’t imagine anyone here is going to fall over in shock that the Cubs stand last in both (and I have little doubt that the two measures more or less measure the same thing with a little different methodology). Actually, my impression is that the Cubs are an extreme outlier for the statistic. For what it’s worth, in that eye it is even more impressive that the Cubs remain one of the highest scoring teams.  Of course, we know exactly why that is. The Cubs have scored in bunches and they’ve had a lot of high scoring games. This is already their eighth double-digit scoring game. They have an eight and five sixes in addition. So the combination of relaxing at the plate and perhaps seeing a lot of “B” team relievers has led to some stratified results (though this team has not been shutout yet).  On the other side of the ball, the Cubs relievers. For what it’s worth, those Clutch and cClutch numbers show up again. Once again, the Cubs find themselves near the bottom. They are 29th in both, ahead of only the Cardinals. The Cubs are 22nd in reliever ERA. They are 29th in saves (though in fairness, 30th in opportunities). Their bullpen has 13 losses, most in baseball.  Interestingly, the overall WHIP is 12th at 1.26 and the opponent batting average is 14th at .234. So the overall reliever numbers aren’t horrible. Certainly Mark Leiter Jr. has helped to prop these numbers. But, using MLB.com and their definition of late/close, in those situations the Cubs drop to 1.56 and .291. The WHIP is 22nd and the opponent batting average is 29th.  Put another way, the Cubs check in with the highest team OPS when the team is ahead and the second lowest team batting average. This team is fantastic when ahead. So you’ll pardon me if I don’t fall head over heels for this team when they jump out to a lead and keep it. Granted, that Wednesday game was a gut punch. But that’s more the exception than the rule. This team usually just keeps pouring on.  This team needs to learn how to battle through the competitive games. They can’t run with the big boys until they do. Let’s look at three positives from this one.  Nico Hoerner checks in to the top spot. He had three hits and drove in four runs. In case you haven’t picked up on the oddity yet, Nico moves into the team lead in RBI (tied with Patrick Wisdom), despite spending 10 days on the injured list. Two of his four hits were doubles. Welcome back. We certainly missed you. Marcus Stroman hadn’t won since April 7. Glad to see that put to rest. Six innings, three hits, two walks, one run. He struck out four. There were games in that stretch that he probably should have won. This time he got it done. He picked up his eighth quality start to move into the major league lead. Julian Merryweather faced six batters and retired all six. He struck out two. So he had that garish first appearance against the Brewers. Since then? 16 games, 17 innings, 13 hits, four walks, five runs, 18 strikeouts. Of course, the Cubs are 5-11 in those 16 games. he has been one of those “B” team relievers. He gets some work here in a lopsided win and he does excellent with it. Today I’m going four deep. Why? Because I’m gonna just keep banging the Christopher Morel drum. He homered for the sixth time in nine games. That moves him into a tie for third on the team. He will catch Cody Bellinger for the second spot before Cody returns. With the homer, Morel has had a hit and scored a run in every game. He has 12 RBI and 12 runs in nine games. That would be a pace for 216 RBI and runs over 162 games. Clearly, it can’t last, but this is an amazing run. HIs BA dropped to .359, his OBP rose to .390 and SLG up to .872. That’s a wRC+ of 234.

Jameson will make his seventh start of the year seeking his first Cubs win. He has a 6.66 ERA over 24⅓ innings. He almost made it five innings in his last start, coming one out short. He did allow four runs. They were all earned because there is no error charged on a ball misplayed in left field that would have avoided all of the damage.  On the other side, veteran right hander Aaron Nola (3-3, 4.53, 55⅔ IP) will start. Nola is coming off of a loss in Colorado last Sunday. He pitched seven innings in that one, but allowed four runs. Nola hasn’t been totally dominant since 2018. But, he did have a 3.25 ERA last year in 205 innings for a Phillies team that reached the World Series. In the early going his strikeouts per nine innings pitched is a little over three lower than where it sits. Paired with that, he’s allowing a little more homers than he has. Long story short, in the early going Nola hasn’t been quite as impactful as we historically expect. Still, at 29, there is no reason to believe he’s washed up. Let’s hope he doesn’t find himself until after the Cubs leave town.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVkY3ViYmllYmx1ZS5jb20vMjAyMy81LzIwLzIzNzMwODc2LzIwMjMtY3Vicy1oZXJvZXMtYW5kLWdvYXRzLWdhbWUtNDTSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGVlZGN1YmJpZWJsdWUuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMjAvMjM3MzA4NzYvMjAyMy1jdWJzLWhlcm9lcy1hbmQtZ29hdHMtZ2FtZS00NA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-01,Not Discerned,"{""NorthKansasCity"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T09:00:00,"This story was first published in KCUR's Adventure! newsletter. You can sign up to receive stories like this in your inbox every Tuesday.  Dungeons & Dragons, the world’s most iconic tabletop role-playing game (RPG), has evolved from a niche fantasy game to a major cultural phenomenon, spawning books, documentaries, animated and live action television shows, references in popular culture, and recently a major motion picture.  It’s also led to a sub-genre of episodic live play, with audiences tuning in to watch players act and improvise, dare and create magic around a table bursting with figurines, dice, notebooks, and maps.  The world of D&D — and other popular tabletop RPGs — is an ever-expanding collection of lore, events, communities, and organizations.  Around Kansas City, there are clubs and guilds and groups for both the gamer enthusiast or role-playing curious.  Here’s an introduction to the wide world of D&D and the RPG community in the region.  Roll for initiative  Alperen Yazgi / Unsplash Dice are one of the essential elements of role-playing games, involving chance and improvisation.  First of all, you don’t need to know anything about D&D before getting involved. Not really. The game is complex, yes, but it grows as you grow. Whether age 12 or 20 or 92, there are plenty of regular beginner-friendly sessions to introduce you to the concept.  KCUR’s community engagement producer Zach Perez plays Dungeons & Dragons and has served as a Dungeon Master since college, making him the resident expert for D&D queries.  “In my experience, most people’s entry point for D&D is being friends with someone who already plays the game,” says Perez.  Wizards of the Coast, which produces Dungeons & Dragons, sells starter sets with pre-packaged stories and characters, to help groups learn together. If you don’t have friends in the know, consider checking out local groups, like the Kansas City Dungeons and Dragons Facebook group.  A handful of local businesses host beginner game nights. ReRoll Tavern, in North Kansas City, has D&D 5E for Beginners (that’s 5th Edition) on Monday nights in May and open campaigns to join every Saturday.  Game Cafe, in Independence, hosts Dungeons & Dragons night on Wednesdays, and Redux Society in the Crossroads has “Beginner D&D” on Thursday evenings.  Cardboard Corner Cafe, in Overland Park, has a Learn to Play D&D 5e session on May 29 and Peculiar Games and Hobbies in Peculiar, Missouri, hosts one on May 22.  Building character  Libby Hanssen / KCUR 89.3 ReRoll Tavern in North Kansas City offers beginning Dungeons & Dragons sessions, open play, and Paint n Take workshops to make customized miniature figures.  In RPGs, gamers create and play as characters who navigate fantasy worlds — tiefling warlocks and dragonborn paladins and half-elf rangers and, sure, humans too.  Creating a character is one of the first stages of the game, and the first opportunity for a new player to be imaginative and learn some of the features of the world. Some people create a new character with each campaign, some evolve their character game after game.  Perez recommends creating characters that are nothing like the real you.  “One of my favorite characters I’ve ever played was a 325-year-old dwarven woman named Olda who was raising a Lizardman as her son,” Perez says. “The reason she was one of my favorites is because of all the moments I had in thinking about how a different person would examine a situation.”  And while characters can exist purely in imagination (or rather, as documented on your character sheet), they can also be represented by miniature figurines, accoutrements on the gaming table, or even full costumes.  Many players enjoy painting their own mini figures. ReRoll Tavern hosts Paint n Take Workshops on Friday nights and TableTop Game & Hobby has monthly mini painting 101 and 102 classes.  Others personalize with customized dice. Check out the selection at LevelOne Game Shop in the River Market, the Geekery in Shawnee, Kansas, or learn more about dice making at Druid Dice in the Crossroads.  The adventure begins  Redux Society Many local organizations host beginning role-playing game sessions and welcome new players.  Building community is as much a part of the experience as playing the game.  Phil Kilgore, owner of TableTop Game & Hobby, credits Dungeons & Dragons for changing his life and has built his business to be a destination for area gamers. Perez spoke with Kilgore about the store’s evolution for KCUR’s series The Regulars.  Bringing together gamers from around the region, TableTop hosts RPG (Really Pleasant Gaming) Weekend June 9-11, filled with inspiration, community and adventure.  For teenagers looking for an opportunity to learn, the Kansas City Public Library hosts regular D&D sessions on Tuesdays at the Lucille H. Bluford Branch. (And they have snacks!) You can also learn more about the game by watching “Adventure Never Ends: A Tabletop Saga,” accessed through the library’s Kanopy account.  Mid-Continent Public Library hosts Teen Role-Playing Games at various times and locations as well as Teen Games: Dungeons & Dragons 101.  Another community group is The Role-Players Guild of Kansas City, a non-profit dedicated to “enhancing gaming in Kansas City and the surrounding areas since 1990.” The organization hosts monthly game days on first Saturdays at different area businesses, which includes ongoing D&D campaigns that welcome new players.  Becoming game master  ReRoll Tavern Building community is as much a part of the experience as playing the game. A large group gathers at ReRoll Tavern to play Dungeons & Dragons.  Though everyone’s actions determine the outcome of the adventure, the Dungeon Master (or Game Master) is the chief storyteller. They create the world, plot the challenges, determine success and failure, and play all the other characters in the story.  To make the leap from player to DM may seem daunting, but it is “often as easy as volunteering to be one, even if you don’t know much about it,” says Perez. “It can definitely be a lot, but I think it’s important to not put pressure on yourself to be incredible immediately. The best way to become a DM is to try doing it.”  There is a “How to be a Dungeon Master” course at KingCade Arcade in Overland Park on May 28. This class is Course 2, about improvising and world-building. (If you missed Course 1, call ahead and they’ll have the Course 1 material ready for you.)  TableTop has a variety of Game Master Boot Camp classes, covering everything an aspiring game master needs to know.  D&D is by no means the only tabletop RPG out there, with many designed for different ages and interests. No Thank You, Evil! is a fun introduction for families (and kids make great game masters).  Try out different tabletop role-player games on Mission: Board Games’ TTRPG nights at the North Kansas City location on Tuesday evenings or the Mission, Kansas location on Thursdays. TableTop has open play for the popular Pathfinder/Starfinder games on Tuesdays.  Events like KantCon, in July, and the Midwest GameFest, in December, are also great opportunities to try out new games and meet fellow gamers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtjdXIub3JnL2FydHMtbGlmZS8yMDIzLTA1LTIwL2thbnNhcy1jaXR5LWR1bmdlb25zLWRyYWdvbnMtdGFibGV0b3AtcnBnLWNhbXBhaWduLWdhbWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-10-12,19:00:00,Not Discerned,2023-05-21T02:23:00,"Dead by Daylight looked to capture the spirit of classic horror franchises like Halloween and Friday the 13th, and now Level 99 Games is attempting to capture that same spirit with Dead by Daylight: The Board Game. Just like in the original video game, the board game version is a mostly cooperative affair that has players looking to start generators around various locations to power the exit gates, allowing you to escape. I say mostly because one player will play as the killer, attempting to sacrifice the Survivors and ultimately win the game. The game succeeds in building the necessary tension on each Survivor's turn, as the Killer can quickly get on a roll if you're not paying attention, and yet the Survivors have a bevy of handy abilities that can help keep them one step ahead. Dead by Daylight: The Board Game embraces its theme and brings players into the game with ease, and those who jump into this survival scenario will not regret it in the least.  Level 99 and designer D. Brad Dalton Jr. did a fantastic job fitting the various components and overall aesthetic to the theme, and credit especially goes to graphic designer Davy Wagnarok and sculptor Sergei Popovichev. The miniatures of the Survivors are all good, but it's really the Killer miniatures that stand out, and the creepy artwork on their Identity Boards helps bring them to life. Even the board, Movement Cards, and Prop Tiles contribute to the dour motif. That said, the Generator Progress Tokens feel too large for the smaller Generator Tile, and in the area of nitpicks, this might be one of the most oversized First Player Markers I've ever had to use, and I just never understand oversized First Player Markers.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Once you pick your location (through a double-sided board) you and the other players roll a Skill Check Die and place your Survivors, and the Killer player does the same. Then you all strategize and figure out where you want to go through Movement Cards, and since you can only move once per turn (without taking a Bonus Action), you need to really consider your move and what it allows you to do while also factoring in where you think the Killer might move to. That's because you won't be able to see the Killer's Movement Cards (without a special Perk allowing you to do so) and the Killer gets to take two actions instead of just one each round. This push and pull is the central mechanic that helps build the tension and cultivates the gameplay's risk vs reward nature, but it's the variability that really makes this all shine.  (Photo: ComicBook)  The game may only have two locations to play in, but there's so much replayability built into the game that even after several plays you'll still find new elements to spice things up. This is partly due to the Survivors, who all have three different Perks at their disposal. These base Perks are for the most part incredibly useful and shake up your play style, but if those don't appeal to you, there's an entire Perk deck that you can choose from to find Perks more up your alley. You might not use them every round (even if they cost 0 to use), but they are essential to keep you away from the killer and on the road to success. The same goes for the Killer, who has his own unique Power and three Perks to choose from, and it's just as important for the Killer player to keep these in mind when taking your turns.  The number of options at your disposal is impressive. You can heal your teammates as an ordinary interact action, but some Perks allow you to heal in other ways. You can also block the Killer's path with Pallets and hide in Lockers when a Killer enters your area. The Killer can then interact with that occupied Locker, either destroying it or wounding you after a skill check. Crows can be used to give Bonus Turns to Survivors, but Killers can take them out and net Bloodpoint Tokens. While you're trying to get Generators started 3 times, Killers can reset that progress, and then Killers have their own innate powers that can lay traps, charge foreword with Chainsaws, cause Madness, and more.  (Photo: ComicBook)  The back and forth of it all as you try to outsmart the Killer while the Killer tries to anticipate your moves is incredibly fun and addictive, and the more comfortable you become with the Perks and Killers abilities the better that experience becomes. Level 99 has also done an exceptional job of balancing and counteracting abilities and play styles, so while it will be challenging to survive, you do always feel like you have a valid shot to make it happen. Likewise, the Killer is outnumbered, but you still feel empowered and able to achieve the end goal.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Between the 7 survivors, 6 Killers, two locations, and Perk Decks, the amount of content in the box is impressive, and I had a truly fantastic time on both sides of the encounter. I personally enjoyed playing on the Survivor side more but still had fun on the opposite side too. I would have loved one additional location in a dream scenario, but the two in the core box are more than enough to hold you over for some time thanks to the other factors and abilities in play. Dead by Daylight: The Board Game is a breeze to learn and gets you into the frantic action quickly, and once you're in I doubt you'll want to stop playing anytime soon.

Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images  In a must-win game on Saturday night, the Lakers couldn't afford to have any weak links.  And that is exactly what D'Angelo Russell was in Los Angeles' 119-108 loss to the Denver Nuggets on their home floor at Crypto.com Arena to fall into a dreaded 3-0 series hole against the No. 1 seed in the West.  It was the Lakers' first loss at home in the playoffs.  Russell, who was the team's big acquisition ahead of the trade deadline back in February, had just three points on 1-of-8 shooting from the field and 1-of-6 from three-point range. He also had three turnovers in the loss.  Coach Darvin Ham had to take him out in place of Rui Hachimura as Russell played just 20 minutes to Hachimura's 34.  It may be a switch that Ham needs to make permanently if the Lakers' are going to have any prayer of overcoming the 3-0 deficit, which has never been done before.  Despite Russell's horrific night, Los Angeles was still able to keep it close for most of the night, even holding a lead early in the fourth quarter. But it just wasn't enough despite Anthony Davis' 28 points and 18 rebounds and LeBron James' 23 points and 12 assists.  Lakers' nation directed a lot of its anger towards Russell following the loss.  Russell's performance immediately led to Lakers' fans calling for the team to acquire Mavericks' star guard Kyrie Irving this offseason.  It's something the fanbase has been groveling for all year long. And now on the brink of elimination, the calls are louder than ever.  As for the Nuggets, their star duo of Nikola Jokic´ and Jamal Murray showed up big once again. Murray was especially good, scoring 30 of his game-high 37 points in the first half to go along with seven rebounds, six assists and two steals.  From 2-10 to the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers had a great run this postseason. But without a miraculous performance the rest of the series, their season looks toast.  If they are going to get back into this series it'll start with defending home court in Game 4, which is set to take place Monday night at 8:30 p.m. ET.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDc2NzQ5LWxha2Vycy1mYW5zLXR1cm4tb24tZGFuZ2Vsby1ydXNzZWxsLWFzLWxlYnJvbi1sYWwtbG9zZS1nYW1lLTMtdnMtam9raWMtbnVnZ2V0c9IBiwFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwNzY3NDktbGFrZXJzLWZhbnMtdHVybi1vbi1kYW5nZWxvLXJ1c3NlbGwtYXMtbGVicm9uLWxhbC1sb3NlLWdhbWUtMy12cy1qb2tpYy1udWdnZXRzLmFtcC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Trojans had a great year, and a memorable playoff run. But they’d saved the worst for last and couldn’t do much more than endure the pain and heartbreak as they grinded through the final few innings of their season.  Brodey Walker piled up 13 strikeouts on the mound, and went 4-for-5 with four RBIs at the plate to lead Manchester Academy to a 13-1 rout of Tallulah Academy on Saturday to win the MAIS Class 3A baseball championship.  Email newsletter signup  “I think we just weren’t all there. We weren’t ready to play — at all,” Tallulah first baseman Hayes Hopkins said. “Our batting wasn’t there, our fielding wasn’t there. We had a lot of errors. That’s about all you can blame it on. Our coaches got us ready. It just happens.”  The crushing loss in Game 3 of the Class 3A finals marked a brutal finish to an otherwise great season for Tallulah Academy. It finished with a 25-8 record, won two Game 3s in the playoffs and forced a third by winning on the road against Manchester on Thursday. This trip to the state finals was its second in three years.  “25-and-8 for the season? That’s a pretty good year. You can’t just dwell on this,” Tallulah coach Stuart King said.  The Trojans shouldn’t, and not just because they might lose sight of all they did accomplish. If they dwell on it too long they might have nightmares.  Manchester (35-6) scored its first run just five pitches into the game. Leadoff batter Mills Paul reached on an error, then scored when Walker ripped a double to the gap in left center field.  The Mavericks loaded the bases, but Tallulah got out of the jam when Brayson Morson caught a fly ball and fired a strike to home plate to throw out courtesy runner Grant Nixon as he was trying to tag up and score.  Manchester left two runners on base in the second and third innings, then started to pull away in the fourth. A passed ball and a throwing error allowed two runs to score and led to a third to make it 4-0. Another error in the fifth inning, along with RBI singles by Paul and Walker, helped push it to 9-1.  Manchester then got four consecutive singles in the sixth inning to make it 13-1 and cruised through the last two innings.  “Defensively, when they hit it you need to give them three outs and get in the dugout. It all multiplies,” King said.  Tallulah committed five errors in the game, and had a handful of other baserunning and mental mistakes that kept Manchester rolling. It was one of their worst outings of the year, at the worst possible time, made even worse by being on their home field and on the biggest stage.  “It’s hard to watch, but you’ve just got to play through it,” Hopkins said.  Despite all of that, King pointed out that the Trojans were one of the last two teams playing in Class 3A and tried to put a philosophical spin on things.  “You can’t win one if you don’t get here. We forced it to the third game and that’s all you can ask of them, and then once you get here you flip a coin,” King said. “We knew that with their lefty we needed to keep it close where maybe one clutch hit can make a difference. When we closed it, we had a chance. But they rolled the ball well. That’s the way baseball is.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvdGFsbHVsYWgtYWNhZGVteXMtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXF1ZXN0LWZhbGxzLXNob3J0LXdpdGgtZ2FtZS0zLWxvc3MtdG8tbWFuY2hlc3Rlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)  NEW YORK (AP) — Saturday’s game between the Cleveland Guardians and New York Mets was postponed because of rain.  It will be made up as part of a split-admission doubleheader Sunday at Citi Field, with the opener beginning at 1:40 p.m. and the nightcap at 7:10 p.m.  With steady rain falling Saturday morning in New York and a wet forecast all day, the game was called off more than five hours before the scheduled first pitch.  Max Scherzer (3-2, 4.88 ERA) had been slated to start for the Mets against rookie Tanner Bibee (1-1, 3.22). Both were pushed back to the first game Sunday, with Justin Verlander (1-2, 4.76) facing Cleveland ace Shane Bieber (3-2, 3.20) in the series finale Sunday night as originally planned — a marquee matchup of Cy Young Award winners.  The last time Scherzer and Verlander both started as teammates in a doubleheader was with Detroit on Sept. 29, 2010. When they take the mound Sunday for the Mets, it will mark the longest stretch in big league history between a particular pair of pitchers starting for same team on the same day, according to Major League Baseball.  New York won the series opener 10-9 in dramatic fashion Friday night, rallying from a 5-0 deficit to tie it 7-all on Pete Alonso’s grand slam in the seventh inning. After falling behind 9-7 in the 10th, the Mets scored three times in the bottom half against All-Star closer Emmanuel Clase, winning on Francisco Lindor’s two-out RBI single against his original team.  Lindor was facing Cleveland for the first time since getting traded to the Mets in January 2021.  It was New York’s third consecutive one-run victory since a 6-16 slide. Cleveland has dropped three of four, giving up a total of 25 runs in those three defeats.  Bad weather has wreaked havoc with the Mets’ schedule over the past three-plus weeks. Saturday’s postponement was the team’s fifth this season — four since April 29. The doubleheader Sunday will be New York’s third this month, after splitting with Atlanta on May 1 and getting swept in Detroit on May 3.  It was the Guardians’ third postponement this season. Cleveland was swept in both its doubleheaders, April 18 in Detroit and April 22 at home against Miami.  ___  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21ldHMtZ3VhcmRpYW5zLXBvc3Rwb25lZC1yYWluLWRvdWJsZWhlYWRlci02MGQ5OWY1NGFkMDgwNDAxNGQ2NWU0ZGU3ODA3Y2QwYtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-07-15,15:00:00,"{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}",2023-05-20T23:00:00,"Earlier in the year, a standalone multiplayer game inspired by Harry Potter’s fictional broom-based sport Quidditch was announced, although there was confusion over the scope of the project. With no specific platforms attached – just a vague promise of PC and consoles – many felt that it could be a cheap cash-in designed to make bank off the wizarding world.  But with a closed beta currently taking place, it was only a matter of time before some gameplay leaked – and footage has started to surface online. While we’re not going to reproduce the videos here for obvious reasons – or even link to them due to the strict NDA in place – we’re quite buoyed by what we’ve seen.  Looking at the gameplay that’s circulating, you’re able to customise your own character, selecting their appearance, broom trails, goal celebrations, and much more. The gameplay itself does strike us as quite complicated – Quidditch isn’t exactly straightforward at the best of times – but visually it looks clean, and it seems like developer Unbroken Studios has tried to remain as faithful as possible.  We reckon it’s pretty clear Warner Bros is hoping for a Rocket League-style hit here, and given the sheer scale of the customisation seemingly available, we wouldn’t be surprised if this ended up being free-to-play. Obviously it’s been a long time since the last full-scale Quidditch game – PS2, to be precise – so we have high hopes this can follow-up on Hogwarts Legacy’s success and be another hit.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1c2hzcXVhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9nYW1lcGxheS1vZi1oYXJyeS1wb3R0ZXItcXVpZGRpdGNoLWdhbWUtbGVha3MtYW5kLWl0LWxvb2tzLXByb21pc2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2009-11-12,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-21T03:41:19,"We're digging into the PC Gamer archives to publish pieces from years gone by. This article was originally published in PC Gamer issue 206, November 2009.  Combining designer Peter Molyneux's twin obsessions of the time—collecting mana and deformable landscapes—Magic Carpet is almost like a simplified, first-person 3D version of Populous without the pesky man-management. And with a great deal more fireballs.  Reinstall Reinstall invites you to join us in revisiting PC gaming days gone by. This time, Ed Ricketts calls 1994's Magic Carpet ""bloody hard"".  Each world/level/set of islands of the 50 featured has a set level of mana, the idea being to collect enough to ""restore"" that world (for tedious plot reasons). This is why you happen to be floating about on your Axminster dispatching monsters with spells. At first you have only two, a pathetic fireball and a Possession spell. Do-in a monster with fireballs and it breaks up into a jumble of golden mana balls that bounce around the landscape. That's where the Possession spell comes in: shooting the golden balls turns them silver and claims them for your own.  Other magicians also flit about on carpets, have the same spells as you, and aren't averse to nicking some of your mana. So you need to protect it, and you do this by collecting another spell that builds castles out of the earth itself. Your PortaCastle comes with its own hot air balloons, which search out your claimed mana globules and take them back, safe from harm. The more mana you collect, the stronger your castle can be, and thus better protected from the other magicians who try to attack it.  MC isn't about the flying. Controlling your carpet is a simple matter of left, right, forward and back, with mouse tilt for up and down, and since you can never crash (or land, for that matter), it takes only a few minutes to get comfortable with it. Spell collection, too, isn't hard—they just lie about on the ground.  No, MC is about the strategy, and the action. The basic concept is beautifully simple, but as the game progresses, you need to use the increasingly sophisticated spells to full advantage. A well-placed volcano pinged at an enemy castle sprouts into a satisfying fire-spewing monster that nets you a great deal of mana, while Invisibility, Rebound and Mana steal could be termed utility spells.  The minute your back's turned, a rival wizard nabs all your waiting mana. The arse.  I've heard that sound on adverts, films, music tracks and TV shows, and it always reminds me of Magic Carpet.  Do you protect your castle or your balloons? Do you whizz round the native villages trying to convert them to your side, or take on an enemy wizard directly and attempt to eliminate him? Do you deal with those sodding Kraken, which pull you inexorably towards them with a kind of tractor beam, or just avoid the bloody things?  It's a game of violent chess, and by modern standards, a bloody hard one. With the introduction of the aforementioned Krakens at level 7, what has previously been a bit of breeze suddenly turns serious. The combination of monster types, spells and surprisingly irksome enemy AI guarantees a hefty amount of swearing on the road to level 50.  Two things about MC will remain burned in my brain forever—or at least raise a Pavlovian response every time I hear them, as they're both sound effects. The first is the whooshing noise your carpet makes when you use the accelerate spell. It must have been a stock library effect, because I've heard it on adverts, films, music tracks, TV shows and just about everywhere since, and it always—ALWAYS—reminds me of Magic Carpet.  Magic Carpet's golden balls.  The worm that flies  The second is the noise that both the crawling worm things and the flying worm things (dragons, if we're being accurate) make when they attack you. It's a two-note howl of rage, or rather a mixture of outrage and anger, which is almost impossible to describe but which becomes the bane of your life throughout the game: EEEEEEH-UUUUUUH, EEEEEEHUUUUHHH. The second you hear this, you know one of these creatures has decided to zero-in on you—usually when you're desperately fighting an enemy wizard and really don't need any extra distractions right now, thanks.  In fact sound plays a vital part in the game's atmospherics. Most of the time a vaguely Far Eastern motif is warbling in the background, with the sound effects changing to suit the location. Drift towards a village, and a hubbub of foreign-sounding voices rises to meet you. Go out over the ocean and all you can hear is the sighing and lapping of the waves. But these are subtle effects: they aren't simply short samples that have been obviously looped, but an ambient mass of noise which drifts in and out of your consciousness.  (Image credit: EA)  Partly because of this, Magic Carpet is a schizophrenic game. Sometimes, while you're soaring through the ether admiring the scenery with the hypnotic music gently washing over you, it's almost a thing of beauty. (Yeah, I'm man enough to say it.)  Deformed: terrain, that is (Image credit: EA) Magic Carpet was doing real-time deformable landscapes back in 1994, albeit in a very simple form. Spells such as Volcano and Crater create gigantic spewing mountains or deep crevices, both of which are great for cocking up enemy castles. In addition, one nifty if ultimately rather pointless feature enables you to load a picture and use it as the height-field for your own landscape.  But as soon as you encounter a beast of some sort, the whole mood changes. The music starts pounding, your missiles fly by the dozen accompanied by terrifying whooshes and explosions, and the air is filled with fire, golden globes of mana and general chaos. At these times it's like being in Vietnam... well, like watching a film about being in Vietnam, at least.  MC's graphics were truly revolutionary in their day: deformable landscapes in ""real"" 3D, water reflections and translucency, incredible speed. What stands out most these days is the use of 2D sprites rather than true 3D models, and the cripplingly short view distance, but at least you can finally run it at a fair clip (at the time, it needed an incredibly pricey Pentium to run its fancy ""high resolution"" mode properly).  Carpet, unlike its contemporary Doom, was something of a one-off. There still hasn't been anything to compare to it. Here indeed is a game far more worthy of a remake than yet another tedious retro arcade title: a manic blend of pure action, subtle strategy and the sort of bonkers mentality for which Bullfrog used to be justly famous. EEEEEEH-UUUUUH.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3BldGVyLW1vbHluZXV4cy1tYWdpYy1jYXJwZXQtd2FzLWEtZ2FtZS1vZi12aW9sZW50LWNoZXNzLWFuZC1hLXRydWUtb25lLW9mZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-06-02,Not Discerned,"{""Atlanta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T15:15:00,"Eugenio Suarez crushes one 432 feet to dead center field for a 2-run shot to pad the Mariners' lead.  ATLANTA -- — After seeing the Atlanta Braves attack his fastball in the first inning, Logan Gilbert needed to change his strategy to keep Seattle in the game.  Gilbert's splitter saved the day.  Gilbert recovered from a rocky first inning to retire 15 consecutive hitters, Eugenio Suárez hit a two-run homer, and the Mariners beat the Braves 7-3 on Saturday night.  Gilbert (2-2) gave up three consecutive hits, including Matt Olson's two-run homer, to open the game. Gilbert gave credit to catcher Tom Murphy for helping him adjust his pitches ""just based off the swings. They hit the fastball hard early. ... Murf did a good job recognizing that and setting up a new game plan from there.”  Gilbert also issued his only walk in the first inning but didn't give up another hit until Austin Riley singled to right field with two outs in the sixth.  Gilbert allowed two runs on four hits with nine strikeouts in six innings.  “They were really aggressive in the first inning,” said Seattle manager Scott Servais, who said Gilbert made “an awesome adjustment after that.”  J.P. Crawford had two hits, including a run-scoring single in Seattle’s three-run fourth.  Olson's homer to center field drove in Ronald Acuña Jr., who led off the game with a single up the middle.  “Not really the start you're looking for,” Gilbert said.  Placing more emphasis on his splitter, which at first looks like a fastball to hitters, Gilbert regrouped with a dominant stretch of five scoreless innings. The Mariners' offense chipped away at Atlanta's collection of relievers who followed opener Jesse Chavez in the bullpen game. Taylor Trammell drove in a run with a single off Michael Tonkin (3-2) in the fourth.  Teoscar Hernández's single drove in Jarred Kelenic in the fifth for a 5-2 lead. Suárez, who drove in three runs on two hits, added his fifth homer off Kirby Yates in the seventh to stretch the lead to five runs.  “It was awesome,” said Gilbert of the Mariners' nine-hit attack. “It helps me out a ton after a rough first inning.”  Olson leads the Braves with 13 homers, including blasts in each of the first two games of the series with Seattle.  Tonkin, Atlanta's second pitcher, allowed five runs, only two earned, on six hits and two walks in two innings. The Braves committed three errors, including two by Acuña, one fielding and one throwing.  Jesse Chavez was effective as Atlanta's opener, allowing one hit in 2 1/3 scoreless innings.  DEPLETED ROTATION  The Braves fell to 0-3 in bullpen games.  Atlanta is attempting to compensate for a depleted rotation during the team's stretch of 13 consecutive games before its next off day on June 1. If the bullpen is stressed during that stretch, the Braves may have to make other roster moves to overcome the losses of LHP Max Fried (strained left forearm) and RHP Kyle Wright (right shoulder inflammation) to the injured list.  “It's going to be determined by the starts with the other guys,” said manager Brian Snitker.  Help could be coming soon from 20-year-old right-hander AJ Smith-Shawver, who allowed two runs on four hits in five innings in his debut with Triple-A Gwinnett on Friday. Smith-Shawver was a 2021 draft pick who signed with the Braves while turning down an opportunity to play quarterback for the Texas Tech football team.  “The kid's got a really good arm,” Snitker said. “His stuff is real.”  LOOKING TO END DROUGHT  After splitting the first two games of the series, the Braves on Sunday will be looking for their first series win against the Mariners since 2011, when Atlanta swept three games in Seattle. The Mariners won two of three at home against the Braves last season.  Before this series, the Mariners had not played in Atlanta since 2017’s debut of the Braves' new stadium, now named Truist Park.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Fried is lifting weights two weeks after being placed on the injured list. There is no indication the update impacts initial projections that Fried is expected to miss about two months. “He's going to be in great shape when he comes back,"" Snitker said.  UP NEXT  Braves LHP Jared Shuster (0-2, 7.24 ERA) will look for his first win in Sunday's final game of the series against Mariners RHP George Kirby (5-2, 2.45).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbWxiL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTQ3MTcwNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Shohei Ohtani hit his 11th home run of the season for the Angels, a night before he takes a 5-1 record to the mound for the rubber game. Minnesota will be trying to win its second road series in eight tries this season.  Kyle Farmer, Kyle Garlick and Willi Castro drove in runs in a three-run first. Farmer went 3 for 5 and is batting .395 (15 for 38) since becoming Minnesota's starting third baseman on May 10.  “Kyle Farmer's a heck of a baseball player,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said. “I like relying on him, and he handles a lot of what comes with this job very, very well. And he's here to play. He's here to do whatever we're asking him to do, and right now what we're asking him to do is basically play every day, and right now it's at third base.”  Gallo boosted the lead to 4-1 with a leadoff homer in the sixth, his 11th home run this season.  Larnach tripled into the right-field corner in the seventh against Andrew Wantz, scoring Farmer from first, then came home when second baseman Brandon Drury took the throw from right fielder Hunter Renfroe and heaved the ball past third for an error.  “Tacking on some runs later on in the game, I mean, that's vital,” Baldelli said. “It changes the game mightily when you're able to put another couple of runs on the board. And the way we did it, that was fun.”  Louie Varland (2-0) gave up two runs and six hits in five innings. He liked being able to pitch with a three-run lead from the start, allowing him to be more aggressive against the Angels’ star tandem of Ohtani and Mike Trout.  “Having the lead, it makes every everything, like, a lot easier, smoother,” Varland said. “It’s not like you have to be perfect.”  Jared Walsh of the Angels went 0 for 4 with a fourth-inning RBI groundout in his season debut. Walsh had been on the injured list because of headaches and insomnia.  Patrick Sandoval (3-3) allowed three runs, five hits and four walks in 4 2/3 innings. He needed 55 pitches to get through the first two innings, lucky to escape further trouble after loading the bases in the second.  “He just had a rough start,"" Angels manager Phil Nevil said. ""It was a lot of pitches in the first two innings, and to get us through the point where he did was gutsy.”  The Angels have not won consecutive home games this month.  GOOD RESPONSE  It had been a frustrating road trip for the Twins, with blown leads carrying over from losing two of three against the Dodgers into a 5-4 loss Friday. With that in mind, Baldelli was pleased to see his team shake it off immediately.  “It was a great way to start a ball game after having some opportunities where we weren't able to capitalize this week, we did capitalize against their guy in the first inning,” he said.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Twins: Byron Buxton, who had a a run and two walks as the designated hitter, came out of the game in the sixth inning because of tightness in his right knee. He will not start Sunday. … 2B Jorge Polanco (strained hamstring) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Thursday, INF Edouard Julien was recalled from Triple-A St. Paul.  Angels: OF Brett Phillips was designated for assignment.  UP NEXT  Twins: RHP Pablo López (2-2) will look to bounce back after allowing a season-high three homers in 4 2/3 innings against the Dodgers.

(WISH) — Surveillance footage captured someone breaking into Valkyrie’s Vault in Brownsburg around 4:00 am Friday, making off with 1,600 “Magic the Gathering” cards.  “I was hoping that the door was ajar or something like that, I never expected to find things in disarray on the ground, and then to learn that some really important items had been taken from us,” said Jessi Kahlo, co-owner of Valkyrie’s Vault .  “Magic the Gathering” was created in 1993 and has become a popular card game.  Each card has a value energy point attached to it. A player can win by drawing a stronger card against his or her’s opponent.  “For me, it’s less about the card game and more about being able to meet people and talk to people face to face, and how you get to interact with them,” said Austin Oliveira, who started playing Magic a few months ago.  The cards are rare and worth thousands of dollars.  “I know somebody who sold a card to a game shop and got almost a thousand dollars out of it. Some of these cards, because they are so rare and there are so little of them printed, they’re just very valuable,” said Oliveira.  Kahlo believes the people who stole these cards know how valuable they are, and may have even cased out her store before the break in. The crime strikes a blow at the trust built among those in the gaming community.  “Because we built this collection off our personal collection and three years of business, the loss hurts,” said Kahlo.  Kahlo said she called around to other gaming shops in the Midwest so they can be on the lookout for these thieves because they may try to sell the stolen cards.

The Toronto Blue Jays and New York Yankees played a chaotic four-game series earlier this week that included, among other things, controversy over Aaron Judge glancing at the first base coach during an at-bat, Domingo Germán getting busted with a foreign substance, and coaches jawing at each other.  On Saturday, Alek Manoah got into it with Baltimore Orioles infielder Adam Frazier, yelling at him and using some choice words to tell him to go back to the dugout following a sixth inning strikeout. Blue Jays manager John Schneider came out to speak to Manoah after the exchange with Frazier, presumably to help him get his focus back on the game.  There was one small problem though: Schneider did not realize it was the second mound visit of the inning. Pitching coach Pete Walker visited Manoah earlier in the frame. By rule, you must change pitchers following the second mound visit in an inning, so Manoah had to come out of the game. He'd thrown 85 pitches in 5 2/3 innings of two-run ball.  ""I f----d up."" Schneider told MLB.com about the mound visit after the game. ""But I think, regardless of my f--- up, it was the right time to get him out.""  The score was tied 2-2 when Manoah was forced to exit. The Blue Jays went on to take a 5-2 lead, though the O's tied it on Ryan O'Hearn's eighth inning three-run homer against Jordan Romano. Baltimore won the game in 10 innings (BAL 6, TOR 5 in 10 innings). Toronto has lost five of their last six games, all to AL East rivals.  Those five losses in the last six games -- all at home at Rogers Centre -- have dropped the Blue Jays into last place. They are 25-21 on the season, which certainly isn't bad, though the AL East is incredibly competitive. In that division, an 88-win pace equals last place.  The Blue Jays wrap up their homestand and their series with the Orioles on Sunday. Things don't get any easy after that though.

Unfortunately Findlay had to cancel out because they did not have enough receivers and Glennville made the trip to Massillon, but did not have their helmets so they could not participate. So the event turned out to be just two teams, Pickerington North against Massillon Washington.

The homer came off a left-handed pitcher, the second time Gorman has done that in the last three days after getting only a few opportunities to hit against lefthanders in the first six weeks of the season.  Gorman’s 13 home runs is tied for third in the National League; his 39 RBIs rank second and his 1,031 OPS also is the second highest in the league. He is hitting .302, which ranks eighth.  One more stat – Gorman turned 23 just 10 days ago.  In the first calendar year in the majors, Gorman hit 27 homers, drove in 74 runs and posted a .251 average in 131 games.  Here is how Saturday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: The Cardinals built an early 3-0 lead on an RBI single by Willson Contreras in the first and a run-scoring double from Alec Burleson and a sacrifice fly from Lars Nootbaar in the second … The Cardinals only had two hits between the third and seventh innings, singles by Nolan Arenado and Gorman that extended both of their hitting streaks to 11 games … In the eighth, Tommy Edman led off with a double and after Nootbaar struck out, Paul Goldschmidt was intentionally walked to bring up Gorman, who had made his first start of the season against a lefthander on Thursday night. Gorman hit a 1-1 pitch into the seats in right, his ninth multiple-run homer of the season.  On the mound: Miles Mikolas did not allow a hit until Freddie Freeman doubled with one out in the fourth. He pitched around two hits in the fifth, but then gave up singles to Mookie Betts and Freeman to begin the sixth before serving up the homer to Martinez, his former college teammate at Nova Southeastern (Fla.) University. Mikolas then retired six more hitters in order, completing the seventh … Ryan Helsley worked around a hit batter in the eighth, but gave up a double, single and another double in the ninth that produced one run … Giovanny Gallegos relieved and got the final three outs, with a sacrifice fly scoring the second run of the inning, before stranding the would-be tying run on second by throwing a called strike three past Betts to end the game.  Key stat: Of Gorman’s 13 homers this season, six have come in either the eighth or ninth inning, the most in the major leagues. Seven of his homers have come with the game tied.  Worth noting: Mikolas became only the second starter this season for the Cardinals to retire the first six batters he faced in order. The only other game when that happened was on April 8, by Jordan Montgomery, at Milwaukee … The home run by Martinez was the 26th allowed by the Cardinals with two strikes this season, tied for the second most in the majors. It was the fourth off Mikolas with two strikes, out of the team-leading eight homers he has given up … Dakota Hudson was activated off the injured list at Memphis and will get the start on Sunday, his first appearance since April 19.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIvc3RsLWNhcmRpbmFscy9zYXR1cmRheXMtZ2FtZS1yZXBvcnQtY2FyZGluYWxzLTYtZG9kZ2Vycy01LXJvYi1yYWlucy82My05ZmRkN2NkYS05MGMyLTRkNzgtODFlYy1kNzdlZmEzYTM2YmTSAZcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3Nkay5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL21sYi9zdGwtY2FyZGluYWxzL3NhdHVyZGF5cy1nYW1lLXJlcG9ydC1jYXJkaW5hbHMtNi1kb2RnZXJzLTUtcm9iLXJhaW5zLzYzLTlmZGQ3Y2RhLTkwYzItNGQ3OC04MWVjLWQ3N2VmYTNhMzZiZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2019-01-01,Not Discerned,"{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}",2023-05-21T05:50:24,"Jerusalem is a city of many qualities. It boasts a rich history, a colorful mix of cultures and a never-ending flow of tourists.  One thing Jerusalem is not, however, is a gaming powerhouse. It is not even a gaming cellar. In fact, while many tech companies made Jerusalem their home in recent years, anyone interested in dabbling in the video games industry in Israel would have no choice but to move to Tel Aviv.  The founders of Jerusalem’s first major video games community – developers Amir Blum and Simon Gross – say their desire to change this status quo is what prompted them to establish MakeGamesJLM in 2019.  Developing a gaming ecosystem  “We were developing games in Jerusalem, and we knew some other people were as well, but there were no social events, meetups, courses, lectures or anything like that,” says Blum.  “People were always going to Tel Aviv for those things. So, we started MakeGamesJLM to show people that it was possible to do it in Jerusalem, and we wanted them to join us on that journey.”  Collage of Unity 2D (Arabic-language course). Photo by MakeGamesJLM  The community is part of the worker cooperative Double Jump (“a professional expansion of MakeGamesJLM”) supported and partially funded by Jerusalem’s Tech Community: Made in JLM, the Jerusalem Development Authority, the American Center Jerusalem and Startup Nation Central. The rest of the funding comes from Double Jump’s business ventures.  “MakeGamesJLM is a place for all of the different disciplines of game making,” says Gross. “We have programmers, 3D and 2D artists, sound designers, all sorts of people with their own area of expertise.”  The community holds weekly four-hour meetups. “Basically, it’s a support group,” says Blum.  “It’s a format we borrowed from similar communities around the world. The idea is that you come with your project and we all work in the same space, where we are able to share ideas, learn from each other and help each other.”  Representing all of Jerusalem  MakeGamesJLM also works to integrate Jerusalem’s under-represented groups, such as Arabs and ultra-Orthodox (“haredi”) Jewish women, by offering various training courses.  “Project Ignite” graduation at MakeGamesJLM. Photo by Jenya Malai  “The beauty of the games industry is that it’s not just technology, it’s also art. So it’s a ground where different backgrounds — professional and socia l– mix and create together. It was our vision from the beginning,” says Blum.  “We also worked alongside a leader of the Arab community in East Jerusalem, Amin Abu-Zahra, to create courses in Arabic for developers.”  Gross, meanwhile, developed and taught a course for ultra-Orthodox women. “Beyond the base level of meetups, the courses serve the purpose of getting people into this industry. In my course, the haredi women were learning how to do 3D art for games. At the end of the course, they were making their own game themes; it was really impressive.”  While the courses were fully subsidized at the beginning for anyone who wanted to take them, MakeGamesJLM recently added a small fee to make sure the people who sign up are “serious and aren’t going to quit” after one lesson.  “The courses are meant for people who are interested [in creating games], but don’t have the skillset yet. Integrating marginalized groups is a very important aspect of it all,” Blum adds.  Blum and Gross say they have noticed quite a few game studios popping up across Jerusalem. They say this is partly due to connections made at MakeGamesJLM community events.  But they add it’s impossible to measure the success of their enterprise in a quantifiable way. “We’re creating the right environment, but it’s not a college,” says Gross.  Gaming ideology  The difficulty in making game development popular in Jerusalem also stems from the characteristics of the games industry in Israel in general.  “The Israeli games industry is mostly focused around large, mobile game companies, like Playtika and ironSource,” says Blum. “Many of the games they produce are social gambling games, with casino-based mechanics. Mobile and free to play. These are the kind of companies that have succeeded in the games industry in Israel.”  Simon Gross and Amir Blum, founders of MakeGamesJLM. Photo by Dylan Brahms  MakeGamesJLM is more focused on the creative side of game development rather than the monetary aspect.  “If we’re creating something different in the Israeli games industry that doesn’t exist in Tel Aviv, we want it to be the kind of experience that would get to you in non-predatory ways. The focus here [in Jerusalem] is on the arts side of game development,” Blum tells ISRAEL21c.  “Games are an artform,” adds Gross. “We have our ideology, but money isn’t something to sneer at. So if you want to take our course to make mobile games — everybody’s welcome.”  ‘Scramballed’  Among Double Jump’s business ventures is the Unboxed gaming studio, a creative partnership between Blum and Gross founded in 2018.  There, the two are creating “indie” games such as “Scramballed,” developed for the Nintendo console and is described as a “chicken tennis deathmatch” video game.  Cover for Scramballed game. Photo by Unboxed  They say that despite their ideology, they do want Scramballed to sell well. “Unless you’re independently wealthy, in order to make games as an art, you need those games to be a monetary success,” says Blum.  “It’s our first commercial game. We’ve been trying to tell our community that it’s possible to do, and now that we’ve done it, hopefully it’ll serve as inspiration to others.”  For more information, click here.

game,2023-05-03,Not Discerned,"{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-21T02:24:10,"MIAMI – If you’ve seen one Miami Heat game this postseason, you’ve seen them all. Invariably, whether it’s a play-by-play announcer or an analyst on a TV broadcast or someone seated nearby in the stands, you have heard the term “Heat culture” again and again and again. More or less in sync with that team’s 10-3 record this spring.  What is Heat culture? That’s not always easy to define. Generally, it has to do with attributes such as toughness, resiliency, a willingness to sacrifice for the group and unyielding effort. It is long on plow horses as opposed to show ponies.  Taking charges, challenging referees to call every bit of physical contact and chiding the occasional Heat player who tips the scales a couple pounds too heavy are other markers of an ingrained Miami way.  No one is more impressed by Heat culture, mind you, than the Heat, its media and its fans. And it does seem to come and go – setting tongues to wagging in the Orlando bubble in 2020 when Miami reached the NBA Finals, receding rather significantly seven months later when the Heat got swept out of the first round by Milwaukee, beaten by an average margin of 20.5 points.  For now, though, two games into the Eastern Conference finals – with Game 3 against Boston on Sunday at the Kaseya Center (8:30 ET, TNT) – Heat culture is rampant. It is Jimmy Butler hitting big shots and making pivotal plays late in both games, with not just a swagger but a sneer. It is coach Erik Spoelstra stomping his feet, walking to the free-throw lane to call timeouts and working the officials on pretty much every call and non-call.  It is an inordinate number of undrafted contributors – four of nine in Spoelstra’s current rotation – making a huge difference: Max Strus, Gabe Vincent, Caleb Martin and Duncan Robinson have scored 45% (105-for-234) of Miami’s points so far. It’s the fact, too, that the Heat’s stars didn’t arrive as such; Butler was the last player picked in the first round in 2011, while Bam Adebayo and injured Tyler Herro went 14th and 13th in their respective drafts.  Oh, one more thing about Heat culture: It typically gets noticed relative to whichever opponent Miami is playing, who by definition do not have Heat culture. In this case that means Boston, which has dug itself a two-game deficit by squandering double-digit leads both times while going frosty cold offensively at the least opportune times.  Which leads to the inevitable question: What is Celtics culture? And for that matter, where is it?  This isn’t about banners and retired numbers in the rafters, about legends such as Russell, Bird, Cousy, McHale, the Joneses, Pierce and Garnett. This is right-here, right-now urgent, a reliable style of playing, even a way of life that can translate into Boston prevailing in the closest thing to a must-win challenge this side of an elimination game.  The Celtics culture exhibited thus far has been as unsavory as something scraped from a discarded petri dish. Game to game, there has been almost nothing on which they or their fans can hang their proverbial hats. No defensive intensity to dial up night in and night out, no go-to scoring option who can grind his way to essential points the way Butler’s been doing for the Heat.  “They work for everything and they’re grinders,” Celtics role player Grant Williams said, “and we have to match that energy. We have to come out with that same competitive nature, that same physicality, that same toughness. And then on top of that take care of our job on the other end, because they don’t come down and have empty possessions. And that’s part of why closing the game against them is so difficult, is they come down and find a way to get a bucket.”  By the way, let’s not be blaming Williams for provoking Butler into his devastating finish in Game 2. Sure, Williams talked trash with the Heat wing and engaged in a literal cabeza-a-cabeza showdown. But what followed – Butler outscoring Boston 7-4 over the next 3:49, leading a turnaround from being down 96-89 to going up 102-100 – was nothing we haven’t seen.  No need to indulge in revisionist history about Butler and his performances/antics with three previous teams (Chicago, Minnesota, Miami). In the world of what-have-you-done-for-us-lately, “Playoff Jimmy” has been quite real.  “I love that gnarly version of Jimmy,” Spoelstra said late Friday, “but you get that regardless. I just think people are paying a lot more attention to him now that we’ve won some games in the postseason the last few years.”  More Celtics culture these days: In just two crushing quarters – the third in Game 1, the fourth in Game 2 – Boston has been outscored 82-47. In the other six, they had a 174-152 advantage. That might appeal to coach Joe Mazzulla, who mentioned “quarters won” as if this were the old Continental Basketball Association, but it will push his team to a quick ouster unless it can avoid such sinkhole periods.  Jayson Tatum ostensibly is Boston’s star, with Jaylen Brown a notch below. The former finished fourth in Kia MVP voting this season and earned All-NBA 1st Team status, while the latter landed on the second team. But Tatum, who saved his team last round with a flurry in the fourth in Game 6 and 51 to dump Philadelphia in Game 7, has no field goals in the final quarters here. Brown is 4-for-12 in the fourth so far.  As a group, the Celtics looked stymied by Miami’s zone defense and overmatched against its tenacity in generating second and third chances. If this is a direct result of Heat culture, then this seems a by-product of Celtics culture of late.  Mazzulla conceded the “discipline and mindset” battle to the Heat Friday, a staggering mental surrender for a home team already down in a series. Anything short of a full reversal in Game 3, doing on Miami’s court what was just done twice on theirs, might as well be a white flag.  “This team has a real decision to make,” Williams said. “The decision is going to be whether we are going to come back and really set the tone for the rest of this year and make a statement, or are we going to come out and lay down?”  Rest of this year? Boston had better focus on the rest of this week and go from there.  * * *  Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,"{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T21:50:00,"The Aces look like the defending champs as they cruise to an opening game victory over the Storm. (2:22)  SEATTLE -- Without head coach Becky Hammon, serving the first game of a two-game suspension, the defending WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces set a league record for margin of victory in a season opener with their 105-64 win Saturday over the Seattle Storm.  ""I think more so than anything, it's just a testament to how hard they continue to play,"" said acting coach Tyler Marsh. ""There's never a feeling of satisfaction. We want to play to the best of our ability at all times until the clock hits zero. That's the standard we've tried to set on the court.""  The 41-point margin was the largest ever in a WNBA team's opening game, per ESPN Stats & Information research, and also the largest defeat ever suffered by the Storm. That outcome made Marsh feel a lot better heading into his postgame chat with Hammon.  ""I'm sure that this call will be a lot more pleasant than had things gone a different way tonight,"" he joked. ""I think what you saw today was a team and a staff that wanted to get a win very badly for their head coach. We know who Becky is to us and who she's been for us. So the best thing we can do is come out and get this win for her.""  On Tuesday, the WNBA announced a two-game suspension for Hammon for violating team and league policies for respect in the workplace in her comments to former Aces forward Dearica Hamby -- subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Sparks -- in connection with Hamby's recent pregnancy.  Las Vegas decided to split those two games among its coaching staff. Assistant Natalie Nakase, a Southern California native, will coach Thursday when the Aces visit the Los Angeles Sparks. Marsh drew the assignment for opening day in Seattle. After learning he would coach, Marsh made plans for his father, Donnie (an assistant at the University of Detroit Mercy), wife and son to travel for the game.  ""My dad, he's been a college coach my whole life, and for him to be out here just to see me coach and for my wife and my son to be here, that's the sentimental part for me,"" Marsh said. ""Outside of that, it's just an extreme level of gratefulness to the organization and to Coach [Hammon] for having that trust in me to do the job.""  Hammon was able to help the Las Vegas staff craft a game plan in practice leading up to Saturday, but come gameday, the team was in Marsh's hands. He made sure not to deviate from how he operates as an assistant.  ""I tried to approach it the same way,"" Marsh said. ""It was key for me personally to come in and just be myself -- not trying to be Becky, because there's only one Becky Hammon. I think that was the message she was trying to communicate to me as well: just be yourself and let them go out and play. That's what I tried to do today.""  For players, however, there was something special about the opportunity to spotlight a member of their coaching staff who typically operates behind the scenes. Although the win is officially credited to Hammon in the WNBA record books, the Aces celebrated by dousing Marsh with water in a postgame locker room celebration.  ""When you have someone like Tyler, I don't think anyone sees the work that he does for us, and it is so incredibly awesome to see him get this win,"" two-time MVP A'ja Wilson said. ""He was incredible through and through, always kept us level-headed. We have amazing assistants and the way that Tyler helped guide us to the win -- he was prepared, he had just prepared -- it was truly special. It was honestly a great day for us to start playing and get a win, but especially with Tyler as our head honcho today.""  Marsh hadn't yet spoken to Hammon before meeting the media, but Wilson had, calling her head coach via FaceTime shortly after leaving the court.  ""She knew we were in good hands, obviously, with Ty, but I just wanted to make sure we were on the right track,"" Wilson said. ""She said she only yelled twice, so that's pretty big for us, because I'm pretty sure in real life she would have been yelling more than twice.""  Even for a coach as demanding as Hammon, there wouldn't have been much to lament in a dominating performance by Las Vegas, which added to the championship core in free agency by signing two-time MVP Candace Parker to join the starting lineup and veteran starter Alysha Clark to come off the bench.  In contrast to a slow start in the season opener from the other co-favorite to win the 2023 title, the New York Liberty, the Aces already appeared to be in midseason form. Taking advantage of an inexperienced Storm team that lost former MVP Breanna Stewart to New York in free agency and saw legendary point guard Sue Bird retire since facing Las Vegas in last year's competitive semifinals series, the Aces built a double-digit lead midway through the second quarter and never looked back.  Led by 23 points apiece from Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young, all five Las Vegas starters scored in double figures. So too did Clark off the bench. Meanwhile, just one Seattle player (holdover All-Star Jewell Loyd, who had 22) scored more than eight points.  As impressive as the new-look Aces appeared, Wilson indicated there's still work to be done integrating the team's new players.  ""It's not easy,"" she said. ""We've got newcomers that have to get used to the system. We ourselves as the core are still trying to get to know and jell with everyone. I think it's just going to come with time. I'm glad it looks easy, but it's actually definitely hard. We're going to communicate and make sure that we're just all on the same page and have that same goal.""  That goal remains repeating as champions, something that hasn't been done in the WNBA since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002. Despite Hammon's absence, on Saturday Las Vegas took its first step toward that eventual outcome in dominating fashion.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL3duYmEvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY5NDQ3My9hY2VzLWJlZ2luLXduYmEtdGl0bGUtZGVmZW5zZS00MS1wb2ludC13aW4tc3Rvcm3SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS93bmJhL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2OTQ0NzMvYWNlcy1iZWdpbi13bmJhLXRpdGxlLWRlZmVuc2UtNDEtcG9pbnQtd2luLXN0b3JtP3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Miami Heat have jumped out to a surprising 2-0 series lead thanks to a huge performance from Jimmy Butler.  Oddsmakers are expecting a pushback from Jayson Tatum and company, as they’ve set Boston as small road favorites over Miami in Game 3. Tip off for this ECF matchup is 8:30 PM ET at Kaseya Center.

Boston vs Miami Betting Analysis  The Miami Heat continue to silence the critics who have doubted them since the opening night of the NBA postseason. Despite being the No. 8 seed, the Heat have taken a 2-0 series lead over the No. 2 Celtics in the Eastern Conference Final.  The Heat are an example of a team literally defying the odds. According to ESPN analytics, Miami only had a 3% chance of reaching the NBA Finals prior to the ECF. Miami will hope to keep exceeding expectations, as they still only have a 35% chance to defeat Boston per those same analytics.  The Celtics have been favored in both games against Miami, including 8.5-point favorites in Game 1 and 10-point favorites in Game 2. Miami has offered tremendous underdog value, winning outright on the moneyline at +305 and +350.  Boston hasn’t been covering the spread consistently going back to the last round. The Celtics are just 2-4 ATS in their past six games, while the Heats are on an impressive 9-2 ATS run in their past 11 contests.  When it comes to the game total, bettors who cheer for high-scoring games haven’t been disappointed. The “over” has hit in both Eastern Conference Final games so far, and has also cashed in 10 of Boston’s last 13 contests overall.  Celtics vs Heat Betting Pick  Oddsmakers and analytics alike indicate that this series is far from over. The last time Boston was down 2-0 in these playoffs (Round 2 vs Philadelphia), they responded with a 95-86 road win to force a Game 7.  The good news for Boston is they’ve been a better team on the road than at home this postseason, posting a solid 4-2 record away from TD Garden. Furthermore, Jayston Tatum arrived in Game 2 with a 34-point performance that should inspire confidence going forward.  There are a few things that likely need to happen for Boston to win Game 3. Firstly, Jaylen Brown needs to bounce back after shooting 7/23 (30.4%) in Game 2. The Celtics also can’t turn the ball over 15 times and get out-rebounded 45-35 like they did last outing.  We’re betting on Boston to respond with their backs against the wall. Yes, they’ve had a hard time defending Jimmy Butler, but they had a 12-point lead heading into the fourth quarter Friday and blew it.  The Celtics are due for some positive regression after shooting well below their three-point average in the two Eastern Final games so far. It also helps that the Heat surrender the second-most threes (13.3) per game at home. Lastly, the Celtics haven’t lost three straight games since the start of March.

Celtics vs Heat Player Props & Same-Game Parlay  When it comes to our Celtics vs Heat same-game parlay for Game 3, we’re banking on a bounce-back performance from Jaylen Brown, plus pure desperation from Boston facing a potential 3-0 series deficit.  There have been two instances this postseason when Brown failed to record double-digit points, and he responded each time by putting up at least 25 points the following game. FanDuel is only listing Brown’s player prop number at 23.5, which offers value considering he went for 28 playing in Miami during the regular season.  We also like targeting the game total in this same-game parlay, as both teams rank top-three in offensive rating this postseason. The Celtics and Heat have averaged 227.5 points through the first two matchups, and the over is also 10-2 in the Celtics’ last 12 road games.  A change of scenery could provide the spark Boston needs in this series. In addition to the team’s solid road record this season, they are 4-1 ATS in their last five visits to Miami.  If you parlay the Celtics -3.5 spread, with the over on Jaylen Brown’s point total and the game total over, you can get juicy +467 odds at FanDuel. A simple $10 wager on this SGP would payout $56.70 if successful.  Pick: Same-Game Parlay (+467)  DraftKings $150 Bonus Bets!

game,2023-05-05,19:00:00,"{""Fayetteville"", ""Arkansas"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-21T03:59:58,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – The University of Notre Dame softball team’s 2023 campaign came to an end at Bogle Park Saturday night. After eliminating Harvard earlier in the evening, the Fighting Irish dropped the day’s finale 5-0 to the host Arkansas Razorbacks. Notre Dame ends the season 30-19-1 overall, having qualified for their 24th consecutive NCAA Regional, and 27th in program history.  Freshman Micaela Kastor manned the circle for the Irish. Kastor worked a complete game, her third of the season as she allowed six hits, five earned runs and struck out four of an Arkansas lineup that finished second in the Southeastern Conference in batting average.  Lexi Orozco led the offense, going 2-for-3 with two singles. Joley Mitchell added another single as the Irish offense couldn’t get on track against first team All-SEC selection Chenise Delce.  How It Happened  Arkansas played the untraditional role of the visiting team at Bogle Park, and wasted no time getting on the board. A lead-off single followed by a fielder’s choice and two hit batters loaded the bases with two outs. A walk brought in the first run of the game.  The Razorbacks kept the pressure on in the second, this time using the bats. A single up the middle and another single back to center field brought in another run to double up the lead at 2-0 after an inning and a half.  The teams exchanged zeroes for the next four innings before Arkansas added insurance in the seventh. A called ball on a check swing put a runner on with a walk. A ground ball back up the middle led to a fielder’s choice as the runner from first was off on the pitch and beat the throw to second before the relay was too slow at first to put two on. Rylin Hedgecock left the yard for the 21st time on the season as the three-run homer put Arkansas up 5-0.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdW5kLmNvbS9pcmlzaC1mYWxsLXRvLW5vLTEzLWFya2Fuc2FzLWluLWVsaW1pbmF0aW9uLWdhbWUtb2YtbmNhYS1mYXlldHRldmlsbGUtcmVnaW9uYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-07-12,Not Discerned,"{""Bellevue"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T15:12:33,"After more than 2,000 hours in Dota 2, I’ve finally been sent to gamer jail for the first time. It’s worse than I ever imagined, which makes it an extremely effective deterrent in a competitive game where teamwork is essential. But now that I’ve been punished, I see that there’s a better way to administer multiplayer justice.  I had been proud of my perfect player conduct score since Valve introduced the rating system in 2019. (By the way, that’s a score of 10,000, and it comes with a reassuring green smiley face when you’re doing well.) The score is a loose measure of whether you’re an upstanding member of the player community. If you’re reported a lot by your teammates or abandon games before they’re finished, your score goes down. I think those are the right metrics to track, even though people routinely abuse the reporting feature for petty reasons.  So here’s why I’m in the Dota 2 cone of shame: I’ve “abandoned” several games over the past couple of weeks due to having a life. For various reasons, I’ve had more urgent phone calls to attend to than usual and other things that have demanded my attention in a way I can’t ignore. To be clear: I think it sucks when people leave team games prematurely and, in Dota, that includes going AFK for just a few minutes at a time. Even if you return to your keyboard and resume play, the jig is up: you’ll be officially assessed with game abandonment. I’m not proud of abandoning my teammates, even if we still ended up winning several of those games when I returned.  I’ve now been placed into what’s called the “low priority matchmaking pool,” which is a very lonely place. It’s difficult to find a match; in my experience, it can take up to 20 minutes to find enough players to queue up with. And the really punishing measure is that you’re required to earn several victories to escape this matchmaking pool; losing a game doesn’t get you any closer to freedom. Because each match can last anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour, it could take many hours to get out of purgatory. As of the time of writing this, I’ve got one victory left, after trying to get out of this for about five hours.  Some players are punished more than others for reasons outside of their control  The way this system is set up means that some players will be punished more than others for reasons outside of their control, whether it’s because of their own skill level, their ability to complete a match with life happening in the background, or because they’re required to complete matches with people who are more likely to be horrible trolls.  I am a huge supporter of moderation in social games, and I’ve put heat on Valve in the past for making people pay to avoid toxic members of the community. I’m usually on the side of more moderation in games. But my recent experience has made me realize that a lot of team games are not built to recognize a particular segment of their audience: people who love the game but just can’t commit to its demands. This group spans all ages: kids who are being called down to dinner; parents who have to suddenly attend to their children; and anybody else who is faced with an urgent need in real life that is more important than playing a video game.  Let me reiterate something: I deserve to be in Dota 2’s punishment pool because I did abandon those games and left my teammates hanging. And that’s true even if there were legitimate reasons for me to step away from the keyboard. But that makes me think multiplayer games that require moderation should create space for people who want to intentionally lower the stakes.  I thought Dota 2’s “turbo” mode, which is an unranked mode played at a faster pace (kind of like listening to a podcast at 2x speed), was that solution. But I’ve found that people take it just as seriously as other modes. Players in turbo still often get angry at teammates for not demonstrating expert skill. And the system seems to punish people for leaving turbo games the same as in other more serious modes of play. While I’ve played in turbo mode exclusively for some time because it accommodates my lifestyle better, it hasn’t really lowered the stakes of the game.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMzcyODU3MC9tdWx0aXBsYXllci1nYW1lLXRlYW0tc3Rha2VzLWNvbXBldGl0aXZlLW1vZGVyYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Florida continued its winning ways away from Sunrise as Matthew Tkachuk again scored in overtime — less than 2 minutes in, this time — to beat the host Hurricanes 2-1 to take a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals.  The Panthers have now won eight straight road games — second all-time in NHL playoff history — as they come home to Sunrise with a commanding lead for the second consecutive series.  They are also 6-0 in overtime games with five of those wins coming on the road including both games in Raleigh.  Florida got a second-period goal from Sasha Barkov as Sergei Bobrovsky made 37 saves in his seventh consecutive road win.  Bobrovsky has now given up two goals or fewer in seven straight games and, dating to Game 1, has stopped 80 of his past 81 shots.  After being outshot 36-22 through regulation, the Panthers caught a break when Jesperi Kotkaniemi got called for tripping 1:39 into OT.  Moments later, Barkov got the puck in the corner and, as two Carolina defenders stumbled to the ice, fed it to Sam Bennett.  Bennett, Sam Reinhart and Tkachuk played a little tic-tac-toe with Tkachuk going top shelf to win it — and now the Panthers are two wins away from the Stanley Cup Final with five games left in this series.  Carolina came out flying taking a 1-0 lead on a Jalen Chatfield redirection 1:43 into the game on the Hurricanes’ first shot of the game.  Florida appeared to tie the score a minute later on a Gus Forsling shot through traffic, but it was first of two goals to be called back for offside via video review in the period.  At 15:56, Jack Drury’s goal was taken off the board due to a successful Florida challenge.  That goal would have made it 2-0 as Florida was being outshot 21-4 at the time.  Carolina, which got 6 of its 20 first-period shots on a Florida power play, threw everything it had at Bobrovsky and the Panthers yet only held a 1-0 lead going into the second.  The Panthers were much, much better at the end of the first and that carried into the second.  Not long after coming out of the penalty box for holding, Barkov took a feed from Josh Mahura and scored as sweet a goal as one will get to see in the postseason.  Barkov was somehow all alone in front of the net and showed the patience to get goalie Antti Raanta to commit as he pulled off a fake between the skates move and calmly backhanded the puck above his downed countryman.  Wayne Gretzky, working the game in the TNT studios in Atlanta, said it was one of the best playoff goals he had ever seen.  High praise indeed.  “He does that all the time in practice, we’ve just been trying to get him to do it in a game,” coach Paul Maurice said on the TNT broadcast. “He has a heck of a shot, is an incredible player and at speed, there are very few guys who can do what he does.”  The Panthers and Hurricanes ended up tied in shots on goal in the second 8-8 which was a big improvement over the first.  Raanta, meanwhile, was not exactly a surprise starter for the Hurricanes as Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour had said he was thinking about making a switch in goal during his media availability on Friday.  During the first period, Brind’Amour said the move was made simply because of how much work Frederik Andersen carried on Thursday night and Friday morning in Game 1 and went with his most rested goalie.  Bobrovsky did not look tired, at all, as he carried the Panthers throughout.  In the third, Bobrovsky got a little help on what could have been the game-winner for the Hurricanes.  With Radko Gudas in the box with 6:25 left, the Panthers killed the penalty — thanks in great part to Marc Staal blocking a big shot in front of the net.  Tkachuk also made a great block as Brent Burns tried to feed to a wide-open Jordan Martinook before the penalty kill.  Florida’s best chance at taking the lead in regulation came with 7:07 left when Colin White walked in on Raanta and could not get the shot off.

game,2019-05-12,Not Discerned,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T17:35:00,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Rested or not, the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes will play Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Final at PNC Arena on Saturday.  The Panthers and Hurricanes have been trying to recoup their energy after playing four overtimes in Florida's 3-2 win in Game 1 of the best-of-7 series, which ended at 1:54 a.m. on Friday.  ""Playing 2 1/2 games in one night certainly doesn't help anyone, but we had a good day to recover,"" Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said. ""Being on the road, being kind of together all day yesterday, you're all kind of recovering together, going through the same things together. So all that helps, and this morning just feels like a normal game day.""  Neither team skated Friday. Florida held an optional morning skate Saturday. Only the Carolina extra players skated Saturday morning.  Even the younger players appreciated the time off.  ""I've got the youth advantage on my side, so I can play that card a little bit,"" said 21-year-old Hurricanes forward Seth Jarvis. ""But it's nice to feel not like I did yesterday.""  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  The Panthers are looking to win the first two games on the road in their second straight series after taking a 2-0 lead in the second round against the Toronto Maple Leafs and winning in five games.  Teams that take a 2-0 lead are 345-55 (.863) winning a best-of-7 series all-time, including 3-1 (.750) in 2023.  Here are 3 keys to Game 2:  1. Hurricanes goalie decision  Coach Rod Brind'Amour wouldn't reveal Carolina's starting goalie after saying Friday the Hurricanes were considering whether to rest Frederik Andersen and start Antti Raanta because of concern about possible ""wear and tear"" on Andersen from playing nearly seven full periods in Game 1.  ""I'll just leave it as suspenseful for the lineup tonight,"" Brind'Amour said Saturday. ""Everybody's available, though.""  Florida coach Paul Maurice said Sergei Bobrovsky will start for the 11th consecutive game.  Andersen has started seven straight games, his longest string of the season, and is 5-1 with a 1.65 goals-against average and .936 save percentage. Raanta, who last played on April 25, started Carolina's first five playoff games is 3-2 with a 2.59 GAA and .906 save percentage.  He is also 8-1 with 1.78 GAA, .933 save percentage and one shutout in 13 home playoff games (11 starts) in his NHL career.  2. Start strong  The Panthers and Hurricanes each like to play with speed and be aggressive on the forecheck, but finding the legs to do that from the drop of the puck will be a challenge because of any lingering fatigue from Game 1. Getting through that early could give either team an advantage.  Carolina took until the third period of Game 1, when it outshot Florida 14-2, to establish the sustained offensive-zone pressure that is usually its trademark, so wants to get to that game more quickly in Game 2.  ""It's a great team we're playing,"" Brind'Amour said. ""They got to their game. We would like to, obviously, do a little better job earlier. You want to start on time, but at the end of the day, when you look at that game as a whole, in the game we gave up 20 shots (in regulation).""  3. Time to kill  The Panthers were the better team 5-on-5 in Game 1, scoring each of their three goals at even strength and eventually winning because of it. But the Hurricanes were a Jarvis shot off the crossbar in the first overtime away from scoring a third power-play goal and winning with their special teams play.  Carolina was 2-for-6 on the man advantage in Game 1 and killed off all three Florida power plays while yielding a total of two shots on goal. The Hurricanes are a League-best 30-for-33 (90.9 percent) on the penalty kill in the playoffs. The Panthers are 29-for-44 (65.9 percent) on the penalty kill.  This could be a difference maker in a game at some point between two otherwise evenly matched teams.  ""We're asking our penalty kill to give us the moments we need,"" Maurice said. ""Get the kill in overtime. We don't care if we gave up two (power-play goals in regulation). Just get the kill in overtime. The power play is going to be a challenge because that penalty kill is a beast. It's not just good. They're not hot. They've been good for five years.""

game,2023-05-06,Not Discerned,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-21T00:14:00,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Carolina Hurricanes started goalie Antti Raanta in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday after Frederik Andersen played four overtimes in Game 1 against the Florida Panthers.  Raanta stopped 24 of 26 shots, but the Panthers won 2-1 to take a 2-0 series lead.  Raanta, 34, last appeared in the Hurricanes' Game 5 loss against the New York Islanders in the first round on April 25. Andersen took over the crease, won Game 6 and had started every game since then, winning five of seven games.  Andersen and Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky both played 139 minutes and 47 seconds in Game 1, the sixth-longest game in Stanley Cup playoff history. Panthers coach Paul Maurice didn't hesitate in naming Bobrovsky his starter for Game 2, but Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour indicated after Game 1 that a load-management decision for his goaltenders was under consideration.  ""You have to. The guy played the whole game,"" he said of Andersen.  One consideration in switching to Raanta was his dominance on home ice. On the regular season, Raanta won 11 of 12 home games with three shutouts and a .916 save percentage. In his 11 previous playoff home games, Raanta was 8-1 with a .943 save percentage and a 1.53 goals-against average with one shutout.

game,2023-05-05,Not Discerned,"{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-21T04:16:03,"LeBron James sends a hopeful message to his teammates following the Lakers' Game 3 loss against the Nuggets.  LOS ANGELES -- — Nikola Jokic was far from his usual dominant self while mired in foul trouble, and Jamal Murray cooled off after his scorching first half. The Denver Nuggets' big early lead disappeared entirely in the fourth quarter of Game 3, and the Lakers' home crowd was in a frenzy.  The Nuggets weathered every setback and calmly, methodically took control with a poise worthy of champions.  With one more victory, they'll finally get the chance to play for their first rings.  Murray scored 37 points, Jokic added 24 points and eight assists and the Nuggets rolled to a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals with a 119-108 victory over Los Angeles on Saturday night.  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope scored 12 of his 17 points in the second half against his former team for the top-seeded Nuggets, who have never been this close to the NBA Finals in 47 years in the league. Denver is making its fifth straight playoff appearance, and the ultimate stage is now just one win away.  “I learn a lot about this team every time we play,” Caldwell-Pope said. “We have that dog mentality where no matter if we’re up, down, we’re going to continue to fight and play our game, and do it at a high level. We’re going to continue to do that for the rest of these games.”  Denver blew a 14-point lead in Game 3, but made a decisive 13-0 run in the fourth quarter to snap the Lakers' nine-game home winning streak since March 26, including seven straight victories since the regular season ended. The Nuggets excelled down the stretch with Murray and Jokic repeatedly running a two-man pick-and-roll game suggested by “Coach Jokic,” according to coach Michael Malone.  “This group is capable of doing great things, and they believe,” Malone said. “Belief is a very powerful thing.”  No team has rallied from a 3-0 playoff series deficit in NBA history. Game 4 is Monday night in Los Angeles.  “I can’t speak for the guys right now because I don’t know what’s going through all their minds, but I still (believe),” said LeBron James, who had 23 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds. “So it’s time to go right back home and start to refuel and start the treatment process and recovery process and get ready for Monday. My mindset is always locked in.”  Anthony Davis had 28 points and 18 rebounds for the seventh-seeded Lakers, who hadn't lost three straight games since early February. Los Angeles' prolonged, desperate surge ever since the trade deadline has finally run out of steam against the powerhouse Nuggets, who have won five consecutive playoff games.  “They've been at the top of the food chain for a reason, and have a plethora of guys that can hurt you, as was on full display tonight,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “But you know, circumstances are what they are. Difficult, but not impossible.”  James hit three 3-pointers after starting the series 0 for 13 from distance, and Austin Reaves added 23 points and seven rebounds. But Rui Hachimura was the only other Lakers scorer to crack double figures with 13 points, and they couldn't counter the Nuggets' balanced effort down the stretch.  “Our backs have been against the wall (for) probably about the last two months, maybe more than that since the trade deadline,"" Reaves said. “Swinging, throwing punches to fight to get to this opportunity. ... We can either come out Monday and go home, or we can fight for another day. And with the group of guys that we’ve got, I know what that answer will be.”  Jokic's streak of four consecutive triple-doubles ended in a fairly quiet game for the two-time MVP, who got his fourth foul in the third quarter. But Murray scored 17 points in a dynamic first quarter following his 23-point fourth quarter two nights ago, and he had 30 points by halftime of Game 3.  Bruce Brown scored 15 points and hit a key 3-pointer down the stretch for the Nuggets before Jokic all but iced it on a 3-pointer with 3:17 to play.  The Lakers’ passionate fans turned out in force for the 17-time champion franchise’s first conference finals games at home since 2010. Los Angeles tried desperately to get back in the series, with James playing 43 minutes after spraining his left ankle in Game 2 on top of his already sore right foot.  But the Nuggets’ flight to the coast didn’t cool off Murray in the slightest: The Canadian guard poured in 17 points in the first quarter and had 26 midway through the second. Reaves racked up 15 points, three assists and three rebounds in the second quarter alone to keep LA in it.  Hachimura’s 3-pointer early in the fourth gave the Lakers their first lead since the opening minutes, but the Nuggets took charge again in a rally highlighted by Brown’s 3-pointer with 7:02 to play, after which he taunted the Lakers’ bench with Los Angeles’ own “Freeze” 3-point celebration.  D’Angelo Russell had another rough game for the Lakers, scoring three points on 1-of-8 shooting in 20 minutes. The Lakers’ biggest addition in their trade deadline transformation has just 21 points in the series.  TIP-INS  Nuggets: Aaron Gordon had seven points in 32 minutes. ... Michael Porter Jr. had 14 points and 10 rebounds, capped by a 3-pointer in the final 90 seconds.  Lakers: Backup C Mo Bamba missed his ninth consecutive game with a sore left ankle. The team is hopeful Bamba can play at some point in this series. ...

game,2023-02-11,Not Discerned,"{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T19:19:00,"After dropping another close game in Denver, the Lakers (0-2) return home to face the Nuggets (2-0) in Game 3 of their Western Conference Finals playoff series. The game tips at 5:30 p.m. PT on ABC and 710 ESPN radio.  Below are three things to know ahead of the matchup:  HOLDING SERVE  After losing both games in Denver, the Lakers find themselves in an unfamiliar situation these playoffs -- trailing in a series for the first time and winless after the first two games. As the #1 seed and one of the best home teams during the regular season, the Nuggets did what they were supposed to do by holding serve.  Now it is up to the Lakers to do the same. The good news is they, too, have been one of the best home teams of late, particularly after the trade deadline and through the first two rounds of the playoffs.  Since February 11th, the Lakers posted a 10-4 record at home to close out the regular season, outscoring teams by an average of 5.9 points a night. And in the postseason, the Lakers have been even better. In their six home playoff games, the Lakers are undefeated and have outscored opponents by an average of 18.3 points per game, the best mark for home teams in the postseason.  Denver, of course, offers the Lakers their biggest challenge yet in maintaining this sort of dominance at home. But the Lakers should feel confident about returning home and being able to play their best basketball.  History, too, is slightly on the Lakers' side here. Since 1984 in series with a 2-2-1-1-1 format, the higher seeded team has won both their home games 223 times. Of those series, 126 times the team trailing in the series has won Game 3 (56.5% of the time). The Lakers being able to add to that tally is critical in them being able to hold serve themselves and keep extending this series.  D'ANGELO RUSSELL'S RHYTHM  A key reason the Lakers have had such success at home is that D'Angelo Russell has played his best basketball when in the confines of Crypto.com Arena. Here are D-Lo's road/home splits this postseason:  Road: 8 games, 30.8 minutes, 12.1 points, 3.3 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 40.4% FG, 24.3% 3-point FG  Home: 6 games, 31.9 minutes, 18.2 points, 2.7 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 47.6% FG, 39.5% 3-point FG  In the first two games vs. Denver, Russell is averaging nine points a game on 36.8% shooting and has connected on one of his eight attempts from behind the arc. Getting him in position to find his rhythm is necessary not just for his own level of play, but because of how instrumental he can be for the Lakers overall success. A return home offers him a great opportunity to find that rhythm.  Denver, to their credit, have put Russell in the bull's-eye of their game plan, understanding his importance to the Lakers offense. They have hounded him defensively, and both head coach Michael Malone and reserve guard Bruce Brown commented that challenging Russell to defend at a high level on the other end of the floor is a Nuggets' priority.  Russell has shown these playoffs that he's able to meet these moments with strong games that help propel the Lakers to wins. A strong performance in Game 3 would go a long way in boosting his team in this series.  MORE ADJUSTMENTS COMING?  The Lakers have already made a few tweaks and changes to their lineups and defensive coverages this series. And while they do not yet have a win to show for these adjustments, they had some success in slowing down a potent Nuggets' offense in Game 2 and posting good shot quality for their own offense.  Considering the margin of these games has been just 11 total points, the Lakers are in a situation where they know what they have been doing can have some success and put them in position to win, while also seeking more solutions to get over the hump and claim some momentum of their own. As Coach Ham has noted in previous series, finding the right balance between scheme and execution is imperative in a playoff setting.  For the Lakers, the early returns on some of their lineups show that groupings involving Dennis Schröder and Rui Hachimura playing next to LeBron James and/or Anthony Davis have been pretty successful. The five-man lineup of those four players along with Austin Reaves has played 15 minutes together and have a net rating of +44.1 in those minutes. That group has shown to have strong execution on both sides of the ball, with a nice balance between size, athleticism, speed, strength, and skill.  Additionally, alternating defensive assignments on Nikola Jokic with Rui Hachimura and LeBron, and by putting Anthony Davis in more help situations has been a boost to the Lakers overall defense, while also challenging Jokic's ability to finish in the paint as efficiently. Continuing to build in this success while having answers to potential Denver counters will be important.  On the Nuggets' side, they have leaned into playing a shortened rotation in which six players are playing the majority of the minutes. This has put a heavy burden on Jokic and Jamal Murray to carry their offense, a call they have been able to answer so far. And being up 2-0, they have had little reason to deviate from this plan.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbGFrZXJzL25ld3MvdGhyZWUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctZ2FtZS0zLWxha2Vycy12cy1udWdnZXRzLTUtMjAtMjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,"{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-21T05:45:28,"LOS ANGELES — If history is our guide and remains unrelenting and inflexible, then it’s not a matter of if the Nuggets will be moving onto the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, it’s a matter of when.  The final shove of the Lakers off the 2022-23 ledge could arrive courtesy of a sweep Monday (8:30 ET, ESPN), or if the basketball gods have a heart — and the Lakers have a pulse — then it might take another game or two. In any event, it’s a 3-0 series lead for the Nuggets after their 119-108 victory Saturday and you don’t need yet another reminder that nobody has blown an advantage that big.  What was especially comforting for the Nuggets is how they captured Game 3 with, by his standards, a mild effort from Nikola Jokic. He was mainly silent through three quarters, dogged by fouls and decent L.A. defense, yet Denver managed to win anyway, rare for a team so dependent on the multiple skills of their two-time Kia NBA MVP center.  There was plenty from Jamal Murray (30 of his 37 points in the first half) and enough from a variety of others to break away from the Lakers and breeze down the stretch. Eddie Murphy beat the rush by leaving his courtside seat with four minutes left, and the crowd at Crypto.com Arena took a hint, following him out the door moments later.  And just like that, a Laker team that spent much of the regular season shoveling out of a mess of their making, find themselves covered in it all over again. Remember when Lakers coach Darvin Ham said “we’ll be OK, trust me” after Game 1? Well, they’re not.  The Nuggets are the No. 1 seed in the West for a reason, as they constantly love to point that out in case anyone forgot.  Here are five takeaways from Denver’s Game 3 victory, its commanding lead in the best-of-seven, and the plunging plight of the Lakers:  1. Finally, the help carries Joker  This was, by far, the most impressive Everyone Else has been in a game this season for the Nuggets. Keep in mind that Jokic is the center of the Nuggets’ universe and when he’s either on the bench or in a rare funk, bad things happen to the Nuggets. The Nuggets were the most efficient team in the league with him on the floor and were among the worst when he wasn’t.  But for one night — and it couldn’t come on a more important night, given the stakes — Denver not only survived without much from Jokic, who missed a triple-double for the first time in five games, but thrived. It started when Jamal Murray couldn’t miss a first-half shot, and then others chimed in. Bruce Brown, Michael Porter Jr., Jeff Green, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope all hit timely shots or made defensive plays that prevented the Lakers from taking advantage of the situation.  Jokic had nine points, six assists and four rebounds through three quarters and dealt with foul trouble; he got his fourth with seven minutes left in the third and sat. And yet, L.A. could only manage a 1-point lead before the Nuggets snatched momentum back for good with a 13-0 run in the fourth.  “It’s not about one guy,” said Murray. “We have a deep team and everyone’s ready to contribute.”  Now, for the bigger question: Was this just an exception by the Nuggets on an exceptional night? That depends on whether Jokic has another lapse. And that might not happen again in this series or, if the Nuggets advance as expected, at all in the NBA Finals. This was probably his one stinker for the postseason. He’s been that good, he is that good. And the Lakers missed an opportunity.  2. Jamal Murray a menace  It’s all but assured that Jokic will capture the Magic Johnson Award for most outstanding player in the West playoffs. But Murray, if nothing else, is leaving quite the impression as someone who must be considered among the top performers in this postseason as well. His level of play over the last two games is the main reason the Nuggets are up 3-0. And the Lakers simply have no answer for him.  Well, they finally cracked the Murray Code in the second half, but only after he torched them for 30 points in the first. In that first half, Murray dropped buckets of all varieties, a continuation of his 37-point Game 2. He’s now averaging 31 in this series on 52% shooting, 45% from deep.  LeBron James sent postgame flowers to the visiting locker room, saying this: “Once he gets going, it’s hard to turn him off, a guy that has that type of rhythm. Jamal’s one of those guys who can run off 20 in a quarter or 30 in a half. He can score at all three levels in the game, in the paint, free-throw line or 3-point line. You tip your hat. He’s a hell of a player.”  Murray, who was blistering in the bubble a few years ago, is a prideful player who feels slighted by the perception, at least in his mind, that he’s not in the class of the elite guards — Devin Booker, Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, etc. Murray did miss considerable time while rehabbing a knee injury that cost him an entire season, and he was load-managed initially this season, and therefore missed out on all the award-earning accolades (All-NBA, All-Star, etc.). More than anything, he’s a victim of circumstance, and his injury, and the fact that Jokic handles much of the point guard chores.  There is a consolation, though. Murray is still playing and those other guards aren’t.  3. Anthony Davis, gassed  It was Davis’ turn to falter in the fourth quarter when he had nothing left at the finish. After playing inspired basketball through three quarters when he punished the Nuggets in the paint and especially on the glass, Davis was on empty. He had one basket and two rebounds in the quarter, and this followed LeBron James’ fourth-quarter disappearance that proved costly in Game 2.  Of course, it’s all about perspective. Davis was downright beastly, finishing with 28 points and 18 rebounds; is it reasonable to believe he could stretch that through 41 intense minutes? And where was the help?  It enhanced the notion that LeBron and AD are wearing down right before our eyes, right when the Lakers can least afford them to do so. Both are playing heavy minutes, as they have all postseason, and there’s a game every other night. That’s not ideal for a player with AD’s injury history and a 38-year-old star with creaky ankles.  There’s no rest for the weary, with the next game up in 48 hours. After enduring a tough season, spending plenty of energy rallying to make the Play-In Tournament, then dealing with the physicality of the Grizzlies in the first round and Steph Curry in the second round, the postseason is catching up to the Lakers’ two stars.  Oh, and maybe the Nuggets are simply the better team.  4. Another low for D-Lo  There was much jubilation in the Laker Nation when Russell Westbrook was essentially dumped for D’Angelo Russell in February, and that optimism was affirmed when Russell prospered in the final few months of the season, then amped up in the first two rounds.  But right now? He’s mainly unplayable in this series, a swift fall by a point guard whose shot isn’t dropping and whose lack of defense is being exploited by Jamal Murray. Russell is shooting under 30% from the floor in this series, just 19% from deep, and saw only 20 minutes Saturday.  As if his timing was bad enough, Russell will be an unrestricted free agent this summer and there’s no assurances he’ll be extended by the Lakers. It’s not a stretch to see a scenario where Chris Paul joins the Lakers next season if he and the Suns don’t see a future together. That’s the situation facing Russell. Not only is he playing for his playoff life right now, his Laker life is also at stake.  5. Storied franchise vs. storybook franchise  There couldn’t be a bigger contrast than the Nuggets and Lakers. One owns 17 championships, the other hasn’t even made the Finals in its 47 years in the league. One is a marquee team filled with Hall of Famers and all-time greats in a history that stretches back to 1947, the other feels constantly slighted by the basketball public and TV networks.  The Nuggets are the Goliath in this matchup. Any notion of this being a close Western Conference finals is all but over, and the best two players so far belong to the Nuggets.  It would be an obvious breakthrough by Denver to win one more game in this series. And if they capture a title next month, it would be a crowning achievement by the Kroenke family, which also owns the Colorado Avalanche and L.A. Rams — both of whom won NHL and NFL championships in the last three years.  “You need 16 wins to win a championship and we have five more to go,” said Murray. “We just gotta stay locked in.”  * * *  Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,"{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T05:31:16,"Hunter Renfroe drops in a hit to bring home the Angels' go-ahead run in the seventh.  ANAHEIM, Calif. -- — Mickey Moniak ended up coming through in center field for the Los Angeles Angels as Mike Trout had the night off.  Moniak had three hits and made a game-saving catch at the wall in the seventh inning as Los Angeles rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday after Angels starter Reid Detmers took a no-hitter into the sixth inning.  Moniak was playing in center after Trout was out of the lineup for only the fourth time this season. The three-time AL MVP got an off day after the team flew cross country Thursday after completing a four-game series in Baltimore.  The all-around game continues what has been a strong start for Moniak since he was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake one week ago. In six games, he is 9 for 19 with two home runs and three RBI.  “He’s done everything we’ve asked. He's got an opportunity and he’s wrapped his hands around it and run with it,” manager Phil Nevin said.  In the top of the seventh, Moniak made a well-timed jump at the wall to rob Michael A. Taylor of what would have been a solo home run that would have given the Twins a two-run advantage.  In the bottom of the inning, Moniak's triple to the right-field corner drove in Zach Neto and tied the score at 4-all.  “I like to pride myself on both sides of the ball. Just that catch there was a lot of work and refining stuff,” said Moniak, who was acquired from the Phillies at the trade deadline last year. “Just being able to see the fruits of my labor, I guess you could say is, is fun.”  Hunter Renfroe also had three hits for the Angels, including the RBI base hit in the seventh inning that drove in Taylor Ward for the go-ahead run.  Detmers tied a career high with 12 strikeouts and allowed only three Twins to reach base via walks before Byron Buxton lined a base hit to left with two outs in the sixth to end the left-hander's bid for a second no-hitter. Carlos Correa's walk and Buxton's single started a three-run rally that allowed Minnesota to tie the score.  ""I felt like I had all four pitches going. I was tunneling really well,"" said Detmers, who allowed three runs and two hits. “I mean things kind of got out of hand in the sixth a little bit, but other than that it was really good.”  Willi Castro homered in the seventh inning for the Twins to give them a short-lived 4-3 lead.  Zack Weiss (1-0) got the win and Carlos Estevez picked up his 11th save.  Griffin Jax (2-6) was charged with the loss.  Minnesota has dropped three of four games on its road trip, and has squandered late leads.  “We didn’t just sit there and and mope and go, we’re just not going to score today. We went out there, scored some runs, and had the lead on a day where we don’t have a hit through most of the game,” manager Rocco Baldelli said. ""We’ve done this a few times where we were in the driver’s seat, and then late in the game, we weren’t in the driver’s seat.”  The Angels opened the scoring in the third when Taylor Ward's sacrifice fly brought home Zach Neto. Los Angeles added two runs in the fourth. Brandon Drury had an RBI double then scored on catcher Ryan Jeffers' throwing error when Luis Rengifo stole second base.  After Buxton's base hit in the sixth, Kyle Farmer followed with an RBI single to left to end Detmers' night. The Twins then tied it on Alex Kirilloff's two-run double down the right-field line off Jimmy Herget.

game,2023-07-01,Not Discerned,"{""Lancaster"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T21:10:00,"Stefan Bogen's delightful board game Camel Up always makes for a good time. Though it's in a smaller box, Bogen and Pretzel Games have recreated those central elements in Camel Up The Card Game. Players will still put their bets in and attempt to manipulate the race to turn those bets into big payouts, all while trying to move up the track as you stack under and over other Camels. The entertaining push and pull of the core gameplay loop don't suffer from the game's compact nature. While some of the personality flourishes are missing compared to the original, Camel Up The Card Game should charm just about anyone that decides to jump on in.  Instead of the original game's bigger board, Camel Up The Card Game lives up to its name and goes for cards only in the setup. You lay out a track's length of cards, with each one having two spaces on it and an alternate sandstorm side with only one space. The original's trademark stackable Camel game pieces are back, and the only other elements that may occupy the track are the Shortcut and Fennec markers. These can either send you back a space or move you forward one extra space, and all the other cards on the table are Betting Cards.  (Photo: ComicBook)  Between the Fennec and Shortcut Markers and the Betting Cards, there's a welcome amount of strategy to unearth, and that's without factoring in the Crazy Camel, which we'll get to shortly. Regarding the former, your goal in the game is to have the most coins by the end of the game, and you earn coins by placing bets throughout. On each of your turns, you can take a Betting Card and these reward (or cost you) coins depending on where the Camel places in the race. There are Betting Winner Cards, Betting Midfield Cards, Final Betting Overall Winner Cards, and Final Betting Overall Loser Cards. While the Midfield, Final Winner, and Final Loser cards are limited to one of each color, there are several Betting Winner Cards, allowing multiple people to bet on the same Camel with slightly different coin results.  So for instance, each turn you can take one of the Final Betting and Midfield Cards, which will be cashed out at the end of the round. You can also take Final Betting Overall Winner and Loser cards, though these aren't turned in until the end of the game, so you want to be careful on who you bet on, as those cards also cost you if that Camel color doesn't win or lose.  The betting is one aspect of the game, but the real fun lies in attempting to move your Camel up the track and sabotaging the others so your chosen Camel can win. For those not familiar with the original, the game comes with several Camel pieces that can be stacked on top of one another, and this can lead to massive swings in who leads the group from one turn to the next.  (Photo: ComicBook)  For example, let's say the Blue Camel wants to move, and they have a card that allows them to move 2. If they are on top of the stack or by themselves on a space, they can just move as normal. If thought the Blue Camel is underneath a Green Camel and above a Red Camel, the Blue Camel will move the Green Camel with it 2 spaces. It's also important to note that the person higher in the stack counts as the furthest in the face, so while three Camels might all occupy the same space, their stack order is what dictates whether they are 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. This allows for chaotic shakeups throughout the race, as with the turn of a few cards and some key moves from players you can quickly find yourself backing the losing Camel instead of the winning one.  Players can directly manipulate the race in several ways. You can reveal the top card of the racing deck and move the Camel the number of spaces it dictates, though you will also have a finite amount of cards in your hand to play per round. The twist is that other players can use those cards too simply by paying a coin to you, and then they can also place a shortcut to move a Camel forward or a Fennec to move a Camel backwards.  (Photo: ComicBook)  That's all without even considering the Crazy Camel, which is facing the opposite way on the track and continues to move backwards. My first game the Crazy Camel really didn't affect much, but that changed in the next game, as the Crazy Camel ended up taking two heavily bet-on winners back to fourth and fifth place in just two turns. This ever-changing formation is like a constantly moving puzzle, and you're betting on through instincts and belief in your ability to maneuver constantly throughout.  Most of the game's flaws are in the presentation. The biggest issue is in how the cards are differentiated from each other and represented in the manual. The changes between a Betting Winner, a Midfield, a Final Winner, and a Final Loser card aren't all that drastic, and due to the manual's smaller size, the image of the setup is pretty small, making these differences even more difficult to sort out. Some more drastic visual differences would've been welcome, but nothing that seriously hinders the game once you get used to them.  Camel Up The Card Game offers an experience that will be a hit at just about any game night, and the painless learning curve coupled with the surprisingly tactical yet chaos-inducing gameplay makes multiple replays a joy. It's not the deepest experience, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one and worth a spin.

Many publishers have adopted this $70 price point as standard, including the likes of Sony, Activision Blizzard, and Gearbox, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Earlier this week, Sega also suggested it could adopt a similar approach for its future releases, and stated it was ""keeping an eye on market conditions"".  As for those who have already increased prices to this higher point, Zelnick claimed he hasn't seen any real resistance from players so far.  Watch on YouTube Newscast: After Redfall's launch woes, where next for Xbox?  Zelnick's comments come from Take-Two's latest earnings call (thanks VGC), in which he stated consumers were now generally limiting overall spending by ""going either to the stuff they really, really care about, blockbusters, or to value"".  As for Take-Two itself, Zenick seemed confident in its slate, with ""a bunch of blockbusters"" and a ""wonderful catalogue"".  The publisher has also suggested Grand Theft Auto 6 could be launching as soon as next year. In the company's yearly earning's report, which was published earlier this week, Take-Two predicted it will generate a staggering $8bn in net bookings for its 2025 fiscal year (beginning April 2024), as it launches ""several groundbreaking titles"". One of these is surely GTA6...  Mortal Kombat 1 will retail for $69.99 across platforms.  Outside of Take-Two, Mortal Kombat 1 was officially revealed yesterday by publisher Warner Bros Games in a rather graphic and juicy-sounding trailer. Along with this debut, we also found out the various platforms NetherRealm's upcoming fighter will be releasing on - PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch and PC (via Steam and Epic Games Store).  As you can see, there are no plans for a PS4 or Xbox One version of the game - Mortal Kombat 1 is a 'next-gen' only release. Well, except for the Switch, which, despite my very fond affection, is somewhat comparatively dated hardware.  But even though Mortal Kombat 1 will be releasing on Nintendo's hybrid console, and likely not have the same graphical polish as those versions on PS5 or Xbox X/S, it will still cost the same as its beefier counterparts - that's $69.99, for the game's standard edition.  This will be the second game to release on the Nintendo Switch with that higher price tag, the first of which was the recently released Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (although it is worth noting that in the UK the game retailed for £60).  Tears of the Kingdom has won itself plenty of fans in the week since its release, and I have not seen any quarrel from those across the pond about having to shell out an extra $10 for the pleasure of returning to Hyrule.  Will this also be the case for Mortal Kombat 1?

Compared to ESPN’s conference final Game 2 last year, Celtics-Heat, ratings increased 31% (from 3.1) and viewership 27% (from 6.05M).  Denver’s win, which peaked with 9.45 million from 11-11:15 PM ET, delivered the fifth-largest audience of the postseason. It was the 11th game of the playoffs to average at least seven million viewers, the most in any postseason prior to the NBA Finals since 2018 (13).  The Lakers have played in eight of the 11 most-watched games this postseason, tied with the Warriors as the most of any team. All six second round games between Golden State and the Lakers placed in the top 11.  Most-watched games of 2023 NBA Playoffs (through May 18)  As should be no surprise, viewership soared over the last time the Lakers and Nuggets met in the conference finals, three years ago in the “bubble.” Game 2 of that series, which aired on a Sunday night in September opposite the NFL, averaged 3.28 million viewers on TNT.  Game 2 was television’s most-watched program of the night and dominated in the key young adult demographics of 18-49 (2.6), 18-34 (2.25) and 25-54 (2.9). Compared to Mavericks-Warriors last year, ratings in those demographics increased 24%, 36% and 19% respectively.  All six games of Lakers-Warriors and the first two of Nuggets-Lakers have been the most-watched primetime program of their respective nights. While it is common for NBA games to dominate the rest of TV in the young adult demographics, it is comparably rare for the league to win the night in viewership during the television season.

While that buoys the data to analyze, I'm keeping it simple and going back to a pair of reads that came through for me to start the series.  Sebastian Aho over 2.5 SOG (-120 DK)  So, Sebastian Aho was a sweaty win in Game 1, as it took some overtime for him to deliver on his shots. While that may trouble some, I'm fine to go right back to him, and it isn't because he finished the first game with six SOG on 18 attempts, most of those came in OT.  The reason I backed Aho in Game 1 was his shot volume, and how his attempts and lack of hits in Round 2 had me seeing a guy that seemed due.  Aho has had 5+ shot attempts in six straight at home now and all four games against Florida this season. Over the past two seasons, when the Carolina center finds that level of volume, he's gone over 2.5 shots at a 74% rate.  I'm banking on some tired defenses tonight that open up shooting lanes for both sides, so I'm going right back to the ship on Aho.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL25obC9hcnRpY2xlcy90d29fc29nX3Byb3BzX2Zvcl9nYW1lXzJfb2ZfZmxvcmlkYV9jYXJvbGluYS9zMV8xMzEzMl8zODgzMzAxNdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcmRiYXJrZXIuY29tL25obC9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbXAvdHdvX3NvZ19wcm9wc19mb3JfZ2FtZV8yX29mX2Zsb3JpZGFfY2Fyb2xpbmEvczFfMTMxMzJfMzg4MzMwMTU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2002-09-27,Not Discerned,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T17:45:16,"RALEIGH, NC - SEPTEMBER 27: Center Keith Primeau #25 of the Philadelphia Flyers stands on the ice during the pre-season NHL game against the Carolina Hurricanes at the RBC Center on September 27, 2002 in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Flyers won 5-1. (Photo by Dave Sandford/Getty Images/NHLI)  Last night the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers put on a great show. The game started at a little after 8pm and ended just before 2 am. Florida’s Matthew Tkachuk sent everyone home with under 13 seconds left to play in the fourth overtime period of the game. Had he missed that shot, it would have sent the game into a fifth overtime; something that has happened just five times before. And it got me to thinking about the time the Flyers did this.  It was 2000. I was a junior in college in Utica, NY. My roommate, Ken, was a huge Penguins fan. And this came right on the heels of the Flyers whomping on the Buffalo Sabres in five games; a team that my friend Joe from across the hall was a huge fan of.  This was the Pittsburgh team of Jaromir Jagr, Matthew Barnaby, Darius Kasparaitis, and Martin Straka. They were a solid team from top down. They could score, hit, and defend. And much like the Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin led squad, they were a perpetual thorn in the side of the Flyers and their fans.  And what a better place to showcase thorniness than in the playoffs. And Pittsburgh had done just that. Despite winning the Atlantic Division that year, the Flyers struggled in the first two games of the series against Pittsburgh. Goals by Jagr and Straka supported a 28 save performance by Ron Tugnutt as the Pens downed Philly 2-0 in the series opener. In game two, Simon Gagne got Philly on the board, but only after Pittsburgh started off with three. The Pens won Game 2 by a score of 4-1. Down 2-0 in the series, all seemed hopeless.  In the forgotten game three of the series, the Flyers finally won a game. Andy Delmore opened the scoring in the first period followed by Keith Jones. Pittsburgh tied the game at two goals each in the second period. John LeClair put the Flyers up in the third only to see Jagr tie it up again. In the overtime period that followed, Delmore scored again at 11 minutes in to secure the win.  Then we come to the epic game four. Alex Kovalev scored for Pittsburgh in the first period. As the game went on, it was a tightly controlled game with neither team letting the other get a chance to score. LeClair tied the game up at 4:47 in the third on a power play goal. And that’s where things remained.  And in our dorm room, Ken and I watched. Each of yelling, cheering, screaming “Dammit!”, complaining about perceived missed calls and dirty plays. Going “OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!” at every ping off the post or miraculous save. Probably, just like every hockey fan in Pennsylvania was doing that night.  Now, the date of this hockey game was Thursday, May 4. My college, Utica College, graduates students on Mother’s Day; I guess they felt it was a nice gift for mom. That was 10 days later. So, May 4 was right at the start of exam week. My roommate Ken was a senior. And while we were big hockey fans, we were also conscientious students first who happened to have exams at 8:30 the next morning.  We stayed up watching the first two overtime periods before calling it a night. It was wayyyyyyy after midnight at this point. And again, we both had early morning exams.  The next morning, we turned on Sports Center and saw the news: Keith Primeau had saved the day.  It is still one of the greatest moments in Flyers history that wasn’t a Stanley Cup victory. Primeau would forever remain a Flyers hero because of it. My buddy Matt, who lived across the hall with Joe, stayed up to watch the whole thing. He said the game ended sometime after 2 am. I wish I could’ve stayed up. And I know some of you will think that I was a huge nerd for not doing it…and you are right. I’m not going to argue that.  Losing a game in a multiple overtime matchup like that can turn a series around. Pittsburgh never recovered from that lose and dropped the next two games to Philly. This set up an unfortunate seven game series with New Jersey that still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe Carolina can recover from this loss. Maybe Florida is the magic team this year. We’ll just have to see.  But 23 years ago, Primeau and the Flyers were on top of the world and forever gave us a memorable moment that we can always go back to when the current iteration of the Flyers fail us.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYnJvYWRzdHJlZXRidXp6LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L3JlbWVtYmVyaW5nLWZseWVycy1wZW5ndWlucy1tYXJhdGhvbi1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The program aims to enhance the player experience and provide additional value. Read more about this game-changing move in the gaming industry.  Epic Games, the renowned gaming company behind titles like Fortnite, has recently unveiled its latest initiative to further strengthen its position in the gaming industry. The introduction of Epic Rewards, a new rewards program for the Epic Game Store, aims to provide players with added benefits and incentives for their loyalty.  Starting today, all Epic Games account holders will be automatically enrolled in the Epic Rewards program. This means that whenever players make eligible purchases, such as games, apps, add-ons, or virtual currency, they will receive 5% back in rewards. These rewards will be added to their account balance approximately two weeks after the purchase.  One of the key advantages of Epic Rewards is its flexibility. Players have the option to apply their rewards at the checkout to receive discounts on future eligible purchases, or they can choose to save them for later use. The program also allows the combination of Epic Rewards with other discounts and coupons, enabling players to maximize their savings.  However, it’s important to note that Epic Rewards do have an expiration date. The rewards will expire 25 months after their acquisition date, encouraging players to make use of them within a reasonable timeframe.  The introduction of Epic Rewards is another step in Epic Games’ ongoing efforts to improve the Epic Game Store and provide a compelling alternative to platforms like Steam. The company has gradually enhanced the storefront by offering a more favorable revenue split for creators, weekly free games, and securing notable timed-exclusives. These strategic moves have contributed to the store’s growth, with monthly active users reaching a peak of 68 million in 2022.  Last year, the Epic Game Store saw significant business, with players spending $820 million on Epic’s own games and $355 million on third-party applications. While Epic’s own game sales experienced a slight decline compared to the previous year, third-party application sales saw an impressive 18% increase year-over-year.  With the introduction of Epic Rewards, Epic Games aims to strengthen its relationship with players and reward their support. By offering tangible benefits and combining them with the existing features of the Epic Game Store, the company aims to create a compelling ecosystem that caters to the needs of both developers and players alike.  As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it is initiatives like Epic Rewards that demonstrate the company’s commitment to innovation and player satisfaction. By providing a more rewarding experience, Epic Games is poised to make a lasting impact in the digital distribution landscape.  As the gaming industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies like Epic Games are constantly exploring new ways to attract and retain players. The introduction of the Epic Rewards program for the Epic Game Store is a strategic move that aims to provide players with added value and incentivize them to choose the platform for their gaming needs.  By offering a 5% reward on eligible purchases, Epic Games is not only giving players a direct benefit but also encouraging them to continue making purchases on the Epic Game Store. This not only helps to boost the platform’s revenue but also strengthens its position as a viable alternative to other digital distribution platforms like Steam.  The flexibility of the Epic Rewards program is another key aspect that sets it apart. Players have the freedom to choose when and how they want to use their rewards. Whether they decide to apply the rewards immediately for discounts on future purchases or save them for later, the program allows for a personalized experience tailored to individual preferences.  Moreover, the ability to combine Epic Rewards with other discounts and coupons further enhances the value proposition for players. This means that players can stack multiple savings opportunities to maximize their purchasing power. It’s a win-win situation, as players get more value for their money while the Epic Game Store benefits from increased customer loyalty and engagement.  The success of the Epic Game Store in recent years is evident from its growing user base and increasing sales figures. The platform’s commitment to providing a fair revenue split for developers, offering weekly free games, and securing exclusive titles has contributed to its popularity. With the introduction of Epic Rewards, Epic Games is reinforcing its dedication to player satisfaction and further differentiating itself from competitors.  In a rapidly evolving industry, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. Epic Games understands this and continues to innovate to meet the changing needs of players. The launch of the Epic Rewards program demonstrates the company’s proactive approach to improving the gaming experience and fostering long-term relationships with its player community.  As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other platforms and publishers respond to initiatives like Epic Rewards. It’s clear that players are increasingly looking for value beyond just the games themselves. Programs like this not only benefit players but also contribute to the overall growth and competitiveness of the gaming industry.  The introduction of Epic Rewards is a significant development for the Epic Game Store and the gaming industry as a whole. By providing players with a rewarding experience and additional incentives, Epic Games is taking a step forward in building a loyal player base and solidifying its position as a key player in the digital distribution landscape. As players continue to seek value and unique experiences, programs like Epic Rewards will undoubtedly shape the future of the gaming industry.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYXBwdHJpZ2dlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9lcGljLXJld2FyZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Orioles went 2-1 versus Tampa Bay, 2-1 against Pittsburgh and 2-2 versus the Angels during the homestand. They are now 9-7 in May and 10-3-1 in 14 series for the year.

The Orioles are 12-2 in 2023 in series-opening games, going 7-0 in road series openers.  Serving as the designated hitter on Thursday, Adley Rutschman launched his seventh homer of the season with a 424-foot blast in the seventh inning to give the O’s a 5-4 lead. It marked his second career go-ahead home run in the seventh inning or later, joining a solo walk-off homer on April 13 vs. Oakland.

Nirvana, however, is grunge and definitely not emo. Maybe ""Pistol Pete Wentz"" would be a better nickname.  The series goes to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Saturday (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC).

Most games tend to stick around in Game Pass for around 12-24 months, and to give you an idea of what to focus on before Microsoft makes an official announcement, we've looked through our data to bring you a list of games that might leave the service next month.The majority of games in Game Pass tend to remain in the service for about 12 months before they leave. The games listed below all joined the service 12 months ago, so they could be next to leave.So many great games joined Game Pass in June 2022, including three Ubisoft games that might be on the chopping block due to the launch of Ubisoft's own subscription service, Ubisoft+. It should be noted that the Xbox One version ofonly came to Game Pass in December last year, so it could be sticking around in the service for longer. The same can be said for the, where the PC versions of the three Shadowrun games joined PC Game Pass earlier this month. While the Shadowrun games and Naraka: Bladepoint are unlikely to leave, we've included them anyway to be on the safe side.It doesn't happen all the time, but some games do leave Game Pass after 18 months in the service. Here are all the games that are still in Game Pass that joined back in December 2021.There are several quick completions here that you may want to get done and out of the way now: Townscaper can be completed in under 30 minutes, Paw Patrol: Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay in four hours, and The Gunk in under eight hours. For those looking for a challenge, Stardew Valley, ANVIL: Vault Breaker, and Generation Zero all have pretty lengthy completion estimates and some achievements with hefty TA ratios. Rubber Bandits has one partly discontinued/unobtainable achievement , so you may want to avoid the party game if that sort of thing bothers you.Nearly all games that joined Game Pass two years ago have now left the service, but there is one that is still hanging on.From what we can tell, out of all the games that came to Game Pass in June 2021, just Yakuza: Like a Dragon remains. If you want the completion for Yakuza: LAD on your tag, you'll need to set aside between 80 and 100 hours. Technically, retro-inspired FPS Produes also joined PC Game Pass back in June 2021, but that was in Game Preview and hadn't fully released.Next, we have games that are still in Game Pass after a full three years. While most games that joined Game Pass in June 2020 have left, a couple remain.No Man's Sky has a pretty tough achievement list, thanks to permadeath and survival modes, but if you're thinking of going for the completion, unlocking all 27 of its achievements will take between 50 and 60 hours. PC Game Pass title Battletech could also leave next month, but it doesn't feature any achievements.After a huge 48 months in Game Pass, a surprising number of games are still hanging on. These five games joined Game Pass back in June 2019.Now, Batman: Arkham Knight was announced as leaving Game Pass back in September 2020, but for some reason, it was never removed from the service, so it was either a mistake, or its contract was renewed. We don't know how long it was renewed for, but it's possible that it could leave on its four-year anniversary in the service next month. All the games listed above have pretty chunky TA ratios and completion estimates. Batman's base list is estimated to take between 40 and 50 hours, Astroneer's between 60 and 80 hours, Hollow Knight's between 60 and 80 hours, Moonligter's between 25 and 40 hours, and Bridge Constructor Portal's between 15 and 20 hours.Finally, we come onto the Game Pass faithful. These games have been in Xbox Game Pass since its full launch back in 2017 — a full six years!Both games here have lengthy completion estimates, so you'll want to get cracking on these sooner rather than later. To complete Payday 2: Crimewave Edition's base achievement list, you'll need between 150 and 200 hours. For Terraria, estimates suggest a completion will take between 80 and 100 hours.As for games leaving at the end of May, Microsoft has confirmed that five games are leaving Game Pass .

game,2014-05-24,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T05:29:09,"Ten years on from the viral game's release, we take a look back at why it captured our attention  Every once in a while, a game comes along that gets so many people onboard for the ride, the very notion of what defines a video game is challenged.  People who would never have considered themselves gamers flock to it, it makes headline news, and becomes a cultural touchstone that will forever encapsulate a certain period of time, a certain world mood. But long before there was Wordle, there was Flappy Bird.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Yes, it's a name that probably hasn't crossed your synapses in the decade since the game's unceremonious wiping from history. But hearing it has likely taken you straight back to early 2014, tapping away at your phone's screen before another infuriating collision with a Super Mario pipe. Gold.  But though the game gained its popularity in early 2014, it actually first made an appearance 10 years ago on 24 May 2013. So what better time to revisit an unsuspecting mobile game that captured the world's attention?  Tap, tap, tap again  (Image: .Gears)  Developed by Vietnamese programmer Dong Nguyen and released for iOS and Android devices, Flappy Bird's concept was simple yet challenging; navigate a small, pixelated bird through a series of obstacles consisting of green pipes that resembled those from the Super Mario Bros. games.  The controls were straightforward, requiring players to tap the screen to make the bird flap its wings and gain height, and the objective was to pass through the gaps between the pipes without colliding with them. Each successful passage awarded the player a point, and the goal was to achieve the highest score possible.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Flappy Bird spread rapidly through word-of-mouth recommendations, with players introducing the game to their friends and family, challenging them to beat their scores or boasting about their achievements. Players only needed to tap the screen to control the bird's flight, making it accessible to a wide audience, including casual gamers.  But while the game was simple to grasp, it was incredibly difficult to master. The timing required to navigate the bird through the narrow gaps between the pipes was precise, resulting in frequent collisions and frustration, but that led players to share their high scores, screenshots and frustrations on social media.  This created a ripple effect, as people were curious to try the game for themselves and see if they could achieve similar or better results, and the addictive nature of the game kept new players engaged as they continuously tried to beat their high scores or compete with friends.  (Image: .Gears)  Flappy Bird achieved unprecedented levels of mainstream success during its peak popularity, climbing the ranks on app stores and reaching the top of the charts in several countries, surpassing many well-established and heavily marketed games. It became one of the most downloaded and played games worldwide; at its height, it was downloaded millions of times a day.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The game's explosive popularity caught the attention of various media outlets worldwide, and it became a topic of conversation, generating memes, parodies and discussions across social media as Flappy Bird and its creator, Dong Nguyen, were featured in numerous news articles, interviews and television segments.  The downfall  Despite the immense success and attention, Nguyen found the overwhelming response to be too much to handle, and he expressed concerns about the addictive nature of the game and the impact it was having on players.  Flappy Bird's popularity on social media platforms fostered a sense of competition among players, and the game's quick turnaround time - when the bird collided with a pipe, the game immediately restarted - reinforced the ""one more try"" mentality and contributed to the addictive nature of the game.  Some players spent excessive amounts of time playing, often neglecting other responsibilities and activities in their lives. The game's difficulty and frequent failures could also lead to frustration, stress and even anger, which began to draw criticism and scrutiny as the game's popularity soared.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Some critics questioned the simplicity of the gameplay and the visual resemblance to Super Mario Bros., leading to discussions about potential copyright infringement and the ethics of the game design. The difficulty level of Flappy Bird, which frustrated many players, became a topic of debate, with some arguing that it was unfairly challenging and caused unnecessary stress.  This didn't sit well with Nguyen, and in February 2014, he unexpectedly removed the game from app stores, stating that he could no longer handle the fame and attention it brought him.  Splashy Fish, Flappy Wings and Clumsy Plane  Flappy Bird's popularity persisted, and after the addictive game was removed from app stores, some players even experienced withdrawal symptoms and a longing to play the game again.  There were even reports of devices with the game still installed being listed on online marketplaces, such as eBay, for prices ranging from a few hundred to several thousand pounds, with sellers attempting to capitalise on the game's scarcity and continued demand.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The sudden absence of the game created a void for those who had become heavily invested and addicted to its gameplay, and inevitably, imitators and clones began flooding app stores. But while a multitude of Flappy Bird clones emerged attempting to replicate its success, they were often met with mixed reviews and failed to achieve the same level of widespread popularity.  Flappy Bird had a significant impact on the mobile gaming industry, showcasing the potential for simple, addictive gameplay to capture a massive audience and achieve viral success, and inspiring developers to create similar games with challenging mechanics while also sparking conversations about the addictive nature of games.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsd29ybGQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvZ2FtaW5nL2ZsYXBweS1iaXJkLWlwaG9uZS1nYW1lLXdoeS1yZW1vdmVkLWZyb20tYXBwLXN0b3JlLTQxNTAzODTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-20,09:00:00,"{""Lewistown"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T05:18:17,"LEWISTOWN — Tim Beck and Kyle Kahley are roofers by day and semi-professional football players for the Mifflin County Tomahawks come Saturday.  The Lewistown men, best friends on and off the football field, wouldn’t have it any other way.  “I think every single one of us have been playing football since we were 6 or 7 years old up through Pop Warner, Pee Wee and Midget football,” said the 28-year-old Beck, who is completing his 10th season with the Tomahawks in the Great Eastern Football Association.  “We do it because we love it,” he added. “We treat it like our NFL whether we get paid or not. It’s something that we don’t want to give up until our bodies can’t handle it anymore.”  At 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds, Beck is one of the smaller players in the league. Making his home playing slot receiver, don’t think he’s afraid to get hit going over the middle.  “I don’t know how many years I have left in me,” he quipped. “I can’t imagine my life without football. It’s more than just a game to a lot of us.”  For many, it’s a refuge where their real-world problems don’t exist – at least for three hours on Saturdays. On the other hand, when they need a shoulder to lean on, they have 25 to 30 teammates to rely on.  “All these guys come from all different walks of life,” Beck added. “We’re each unique, but on Saturdays we come together as a team. I don’t think of us as a team, we’re a true family. I look at any one of the players as my brothers. I would do anything for them on and off the field.”  Beck credits long-time Tomahawks head coach Brian Rodgers as the cog that holds everything together.  “Coach does an excellent job keeping this family-oriented,” Beck said. “I couldn’t imagine having the whole team over to my house like he does his house.  “I can appreciate him more and more,” he added. “He goes above and beyond for each one of us. I am so appreciative of what he does for me in my life and for this team.”  Coaches and players have shared in the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat – back-to-back appearances in the Keystone Bowl are tainted by losses to the Lancaster County Cyclones on both occasions.  Beck played high school football at Indian Valley High School as a freshman and sophomore then finished up his final two scholastic seasons at Mifflin County. He was supposed to play for his old high school coach, the late Steve Hayes, at Division III Juniata College. Things didn’t work out.  Playing in the semi-pro GEFA has given him a second chance. “I have to hit that hole if I want to make that yardage, and I have to absorb the hit,” he explained. “The league has made me a better football player.”  Critics question its authenticity since there are only eight players on each side, no goal posts so kickers aren’t needed and the length of the field is 50 yards – half the size of an NFL field. To keep insurance and operating costs down, players aren’t paid, which makes them amateurs and cheaper to insure.  “People think this league is a joke,” Beck said. “We don’t get paid. I was recruited by a few schools. Thankfully, I had this football to keep my passion going.”  Practice not perfect  Because of conflicting work schedules, players only practice once a week during the season – on game day. Coaches and players meet at Lewistown’s Rec Park around 9 a.m. on Saturdays for 1 ½- to 2-hour practice. “We watch film and game plan then head down to the (Kish Park) field for warmups.  “It’s not just 1 to 4 p.m. on game day, guys are waking up at 7:30 for practice, film and the game then they’re done at 5 p.m.”  There’s little time during practices to teach new concepts or schemes. Coaches stress the basics and make adjustments, depending on what players are available that particular week and the scouting report for the opposition.  Kahley: Feeling aches and pains on Sunday  At age 27, Kahley has played in the league for six years and has enjoyed every minute of it. “It feels great to still be playing football,” said Kahley, who played one year at Indian Valley then three years at Mifflin County before playing at Division III Lycoming College.  “Just to be able to do that for something you’ve had a true passion for as a wee little kid,” he added “You can play the game that you fell in love with. There’s nothing more precious in life to still play right now.”  The physicality of the game has taken its toll on his body. During the 2019 season, Kahley suffered a back injury that sidelined him for nearly two years.  Getting hit nearly every time he carries the ball catches up to him. “Now, I’ve started to feel it every Sunday,” he explained.  Still, he relishes the opportunity that the Tomahawks have afforded him.  “It feels great to still play football,” Kahley said. Although he realizes the clock on his career is ticking as the league is undergoing a youth movement.  “There are so many younger guys coming in,” he explained. “Eight-man football is a lot different. With the smaller field and the athletes, we have now, there’s a better chance anyone can become a superstar in any game.”  Case in point: With Kahley resting one game after injuring his ankle, Jonathan Dodson filled in and rushed for a team-record 157 yards and four touchdowns against Snyder County. “It took one game,” Kahley said. “You never know when that moment is going to happen. It happened in a flash.”  The unwanted champion  Dodson, who lives in Huntingdon, should have been reveling in that championship feeling in 2022. The Moshannon Valley Vikings had just captured Keystone Bowl XVIII with a 26-18 victory over Dauphin County.  Dodson didn’t feel much like celebrating as he saw little playing time as a Viking. A few days later, Moshannon Valley released Dodson. He came to Mifflin County, believing he would get a chance to contribute.  “I keep playing for the love of the game,” said the 37-year-old Dodson, who works as a correctional officer. “It’s more of a stress reliever. It’s simply an escape for a little bit.”  The yards don’t matter to Dodson as much as the feeling he’s contributing to the team. After his record rushing day, the first thing Dodson did was seek out his three children on the sidelines.  “It’s pretty cool when your kids watch you play, and think that you’re a superhero,” he explained. “(The Tomahawks) They gave me an opportunity here and I ran with it – no pun intended.”  Still, he cherishes every carry, like it could be his list. “Football means a lot to us that play this game,” Dodson said. “It’s our first love. Semi-pro football has a lot of has-beens or never was. Guys that might have been stars in high school. Guys that have tried out in high school and never did anything after that. They just want to see if they’re capable of still doing it.”  His last three seasons with Moshannon Valley tested his spirit. “I didn’t have the opportunity to show my skills,” he explained. “Now, I’m doing pretty darn good.  “My new team is giving me an opportunity,” he added. “I can’t ask for anything better than that. My offensive line has been tremendous.”  Stepping away isn’t easy  During the week, Chris McClellan works in information technology, fixing other people’s computer problems. “It’s weird telling people what I do for a hobby,” McClellan said. “But you’re only young once.”  While still suiting up on Saturdays, the 34-year-old McClellan also serves as the Tomahawks’ defensive coordinator. “My planning style and coaching style go hand in hand,” he said.  Now in his 12th season, McClellan shows no sign of slowing down. He realizes Father Time might disagree.  “I remember seeing a flyer (looking for players) and calling the number on a whim,” he said. “A week later, I was playing. I see the league is going through a transition right now. People used to go door-to-door to find players on Fridays. Now, film is readily available. Semi-pro football is more structured. It’s no longer just a backyard league.”  Back in the day, “random teams seemed to show up on Saturdays,” he added.  For the players, Tomahawk football remains an outlet to play the game. “It’s something to do as an extracurricular activity,” he added. “We’re all in the same social circles, we all go to the other guys’ wedding, we all know their kids and families.”  Football also gives a sense of structure and commitment to those who need it.  “There are lots of ups and downs,” McClellan said. “These guys are my best friends … people that I’ve spent the last 12 to 13 years with.”  It’s just Tomahawk football.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxld2lzdG93bnNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS9sb3ZlLW9mLXRoZS1nYW1lLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,"{""China"", ""NuevoLeon"", ""Mexico""}",2023-05-19T11:11:00,"              May 19 (Reuters) - India has approved popular mobile game Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI) to be relaunched for a trial period after a 10-month ban, South Korean game developer Krafton said on Friday.  South Korea's foreign affairs and culture ministries held meetings with their Indian counterparts to help lift the ban, a Krafton Inc (259960.KS) representative said.  The Indian government blocked BGMI, the flagship game made by Krafton last July, citing concerns about its data-sharing and mining in China.  Krafton is backed by China's Tencent (0700.HK) which owns around a 13.5% stake.  The three-month trial approval of the game was agreed after it complied with issues of server locations and data security, Indian deputy minister for Information Technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, said in a tweet.  loading  Daishin Securities analyst Jeeeun Lee said the spillover from political spats with China to Krafton will be limited.  ""It will be tough for India to impose an outright ban on companies affiliated with China over political issues when they operate through a local corporation that hire Indian workers like Krafton for instance,"" she said.  Shares of Krafton rose 1.45% compared to the wider KOSPI index's 0.89% rise when the market closed on Friday.  At the time of its removal from Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Play Store and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store, BGMI had more than 100 million users in India.  A Facebook page for the title says the game will be available for download soon.  The government will keep a close watch on other issues of user harm and addiction in the trial period before making a final decision, Chandrasekhar added.  New Delhi banned another Krafton title, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), in 2020, following which the company launched BGMI.  The ban on PUBG was part of a larger ban on more than 300 Chinese apps, including short-video platform TikTok, after the government ramped up its scrutiny of Chinese businesses in the wake of a 2020 clash between the neighbours.  The government also intensified the scrutiny of investments by Chinese firms in Indian companies.

game,2023-05-19,19:00:00,"{""Maryland"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T23:48:26,"Maryland baseball’s magic number for at least a share of the Big Ten regular-season title sat at one on Friday. With a win, the Terps would have clinched the title for the second season in a row.  After taking the lead in the fifth, the Terps looked to be in prime position to do so.  Both teams were in the midst of a tight pitching battle as the score stood 3-2 in favor of the Terps, but Penn State junior infielder Jay Harry hit a two-RBI single that took back the lead.  Maryland didn’t score the rest of the game, and ultimately fell to the Nittany Lions, 5-3.  Unlike Thursday’s game — in which there were 32 runs scored — both team’s starting pitchers and defense were solid Friday.  Penn State sophomore right-handed pitcher Tommy Molsky held Maryland’s offense relatively quiet in his outing, tossing five scoreless innings. Meanwhile, Maryland junior right-hander Jason Savacool had an up-and-down start, surrendering four runs on eight hits. He did fan six batters, though.  Penn State struck first in the second inning when graduate catcher Thomas Bramley hit a two-RBI double.  Even so, it was night and day for the Maryland defense from Thursday to Friday. It executed a gorgeous double play between junior catcher Luke Shliger and sophomore first baseman Eddie Hacopian with the bases loaded in the third. The Terps committed no errors and stranded nine Penn State runners the entire game.  Maryland’s bats finally clicked in the fifth. Hits by junior shortstop Matt Shaw, senior third baseman Nick Lorusso and sophomore outfielder Ian Petrutz drove in three runs to give the Terps a 3-2 lead.  But the two-run single in the fifth from Harry proved too much for the Terps, who couldn’t get anything else going.  Penn State senior left-handed pitcher Ryan Partridge pitched three innings of scoreless baseball in what might have been the last appearance of his career to secure the win for the Nittany Lions.  With the loss, the Terps dropped to 16-7 in Big Ten play ahead of their regular-season finale at Noon Saturday  Three things to know.  1. Maryland’s offense cooled off. It was a rare occasion in which Maryland’s pitching staff lacked run support. The Terps’ three-run rally in the fifth was the only time they scored all game, as Penn State’s Molsky and Partridge shut down the Terps all game long.  2. The Terps need to wait another day. Maryland was hoping to clinch the Big Ten regular-season title on Friday, but will have to wait until tomorrow with the loss.

game,2023-05-16,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T18:35:00,"Overwatch 2 game director Aaron Keller has provided more insight into why developer Blizzard decided to can a long-promised PvE mode that has been in development since 2019. In a newly released blog, Keller says the discussion going around about “how we’re canceling PvE outright…isn’t accurate” before getting into details about the game’s origins, development process, and future.    Read More: Overwatch 2 Multiplayer Isn’t Good Enough To Justify Gutting Its Long-Promised PvE    Advertisement  Back in 2019, then-director Jeff Kaplan stepped onto the BlizzCon stage and promised an extensive Overwatch 2 PvE experience with skill trees and customizable hero abilities, offered as a buyable add-on to the original game. It would have a shared multiplayer universe with the OG title, that way players who didn’t want to shell out extra for the PvE sequel wouldn’t get left in the dust. Over time, it became clear that we weren’t getting what was promised, as Kaplan left Blizzard, Keller took over, and Overwatch 2 became a standalone sequel that would replace Overwatch 1 entirely.    Overwatch 2 game director on PvE  But on May 16, Blizzard confirmed that the expansive PvE mode would never happen and that the company was instead focusing on shoring up its PvP mode. Keller’s blog makes it clear that Story Missions (“fast-paced, co-op gameplay” that are “leaps and bounds above what we’ve built for PvE previously”) are still happening, and he’ll have more details “in the coming weeks.” But the Hero Missions (“an in-development game mode that allowed players to upgrade individual heroes through talent trees, providing a deeply replayable version of PvE in Overwatch 2”) make up the mode Blizzard is “no longer moving forward with.”    Advertisement  Keller continues:    “The Overwatch team was founded in the wake of a canceled game at Blizzard called Project Titan. That game had many facets, but at its heart, it was an FPS MMO. The Overwatch team, especially at its inception, considered itself an MMO development team. As we transitioned away from that original concept and started creating Overwatch, we included plans to one day return to that scope. We had a crawl, walk, run plan. Overwatch was the crawl, a dedicated version of PvE was the walk, and an MMO was the run. It was built into the DNA of the team early on, and some of us considered that final game a true realization of the original vision of Project Titan.”  Advertisement  After Overwatch launched, however, Keller alleges the team wasn’t “as focused as we should have been on a game that was a runaway hit” and instead tried to continue to build off of a “years old” Project Titan ideology: “Things rarely go as planned in game development. We struggled to find our footing with the Hero Mission experience early on. Scope grew. We were trying to do too many things at once and we lost focus. The team built some really great things, including hero talents, new enemy units and early versions of missions, but we were never able to bring together all of the elements needed to ship a polished, cohesive experience.”  According to Keller, the team kept trying to employ the “crawl, walk, run” plan, but the “audacious” and “gargantuan” PvE mode was “continuously pulling resources away from the live game.” He confirms that there were years of dev work and “emotional investment” put into the Hero Missions mode, and the team “tried to find ways to make all of our ambitions fit together in a plan that we believed in.”  Advertisement  “We couldn’t.”  Keller also attempts to clear up why the team waited so long into 2023 (which was when this mode was promised) before announcing they weren’t going forward with it. “Lastly, people have wondered why this announcement came at this time. After Overwatch 2 had launched, we started refining our plans for future seasons.” The team realized they couldn’t keep pulling focus towards the promised PvE mode “as plans grew,” so they decided to abandon Hero MIssions altogether. “The decision was the start of a long process, not the final piece of it,” Keller writes. Instead of Hero Missions, the team is focusing its efforts on the live service game—which is, ostensibly, Overwatch’s bread and butter.  Advertisement  “This has been hard for us, but as the director on this project, I have to do my best to make decisions that put the game and the community first, even when those decisions are disappointing. In this case, I had trouble pivoting away from a vision that just wasn’t working. And for that I would like to apologize to our players and to our team. I’m sorry.”  He ends the blog post with some flowery language about Overwatch being born from the ashes of Project Titan and how “something beautiful” came from it. “This is another moment of change. And the future of Overwatch will be born out of it.”  Advertisement  I’m not sure I’m as hopeful as Keller is about the future of Overwatch 2, but I’m always happy to be proven wrong.

game,2023-05-13,Not Discerned,"{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T16:18:01,"SALT LAKE CITY – Utah football has a lot of big games in 2023, but there is one Utes game in particular that KSL Sports Live anchor Jeremiah Jensen says is not being discussed enough.  The Utes waste no time jumping into the thick of things hosting Florida at Rice-Eccles Stadium in what many have circled as a bit of a revenge game for Utah in week one. Utah football will then travel to Baylor for a first-ever meeting of the two programs.  Fast forward into the end of October and the Utes will have massive back-to-back Pac-12 games against USC at the Coliseum and then host Oregon at home. These two games seem to be the favorites for determining who ends up winning the regular season in the Pac-12 and moving on to the championship game in Las Vegas. However, according to Jensen, there is one more game for the Utes worth considering.  Utah Football At Washington Football, November 11  Jensen feels like this game in Seattle should be receiving more hype and he’s probably right.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by KSL Sports (@kslsports)  The Utes and Huskies haven’t faced off since 2020, a 24-21 win for Washington at Husky Stadium, and the matchup has historically been an entertaining one. Washington, like Utah, Oregon, and USC also bring back a lot of the talent that made them successful last season while setting them up for another run in 2023.  “I don’t think we are talking enough about Washington,” Jensen said. “I think that game, November 11, on Saturday, in Seattle at Husky Stadium may determine who wins the Pac-12 regular season and then determines which of these teams goes to the Pac-12 Title game. After that, Utah plays Arizona and Colorado, so you figure, if Utah is still in the mix and they beat Washington, they’ll handle the last two games. That could be the make-or-break game.”  Michelle Bodkin is the Utah Utes Insider for KSLsports.com and host of both the Crimson Corner Podcast (SUBSCRIBE) and The Saturday Show (Saturday from 10 a.m.–12 p.m.) on The KSL Sports Zone.

game,2023-10-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T14:16:27,"Apparently not content with headlining arenas around the world, invading international albums charts and seeing their songs go viral, Sweden's satanic superstars Ghost have now announced their own videogame.  Released as a tie-in to the new Phantomime EP, Escape The Ministry is a point-and-click puzzle-based online game in which fans explore the band's mysterious headquarters, with an ominious warning that they must escape before they're found out.  It all ties in to the wider lore and mythos surrounding the band that has been shared across the (semi)-frequent chapters on YouTube, with hints of appearances from members of the wider Ghost family including Sister Imperator and the previous Papa Emeritus lineage.  Armed with a camera (which can download images directly to your desktop), the player walks around Ghost HQ collecting clues and messages that may hint towards what lies in store for the band. A heavy metal take on Monkey Island style puzzle solving, the game can be played online and via VR.  While the band remain typically tight lipped about what the future holds, there have been plenty of hints that the band are gearing up to kill off the current Papa Emeritus - IV - as they traditionally have between each album cycle.  IV remains an anomaly in the Ghost lore, being the only character to serve as a Papa that hasn't been 'killed off' between albums (thus far, at least). Granted, when Copia was introduced in April 2018 he was simply Cardinal Copia, before ascending to full Papa-Dom in March 2020 during a show in Mexico.  Currently Ghost have tour dates running right up until October, playing in Europe, North America and Australia, including appearances at European festivals throughout the summer.  In-game, a room dedicated to the four previous Papas (Papa I - III and Papa Nihil, the apparent originator of the band) includes an empty pedestal with the ominous message ""under construction, this pedestal will be filled at a later time"".  We won't spoil any of the puzzles for you, but suffice to say the whole game ties in to Phantomime in some fiendishly ingenious ways and features plenty of easter eggs from across the band's history.  Naturally, that's also kickstarted a fresh wave of speculation on what the future might hold for the band - and while we don't have answers just yet, we suspect it'll be gloriously ludicrous when it all comes to a head.  Ghost are on tour throughout 2023, for the full list of dates visit their official website.

game,2023-10-01,19:00:00,"{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T17:36:00,"Best known for working on the publisher’s WWE and NBA games, Visual Concepts has found itself behind the wheel of 2K’s latest licensed experiment. Lego 2K Drive is a high-octane competitive racer full of destructible brick-y environments to crash through and a kid-friendly narrative full of fourth-wall-breaking fun.  The game’s best feature is Bricklandia, the playful Lego landscape in which 2K Drive is set. It’s a world begging to be dismantled by the brunt of your screeching tires and custom boat masts. Accelerating across the open-world playmat (that a human would never want to step on) is a thrilling experience, made better by the carefully animated auto-morphing ability. As you cross different terrain, from road to off-road and on water, players automatically switch between vehicles to fit the context.  Tires and water noodles frame the world’s vistas and act as charming obstacles, and it’s this blend of real-world objects with Lego constructs that amplifies the delightful toy box atmosphere. As a budding racer dropped into this striking open world, you tackle an onslaught of revheads, claiming their flags to ascend to the honor of Sky Cup Champion. Mohawked egomaniac Shadow Z serves as your rival in this endeavor, popping up from time to time to remind you of how mean-spirited he is.  To even get close to taking him on, you must explore Bricklandia in search of rival speedsters, each with their own unique driving skills they exercise in instanced Mario Kart-style races. From an actual horse to an alien in a suit, they make for a charming ensemble and provide new cars and perks to play with, as well as Brickbux, with which you can buy new machines and parts. You can also build your own vehicles brick-by-brick at the garage, which let me create some truly cursed rides. While the building system isn’t the most intuitive, it does feel like an appropriate nod to Lego’s humble brick-building origins.  Across Bricklandia’s varied biomes, you also encounter On-The-Go Events, ambient missions that you can drop in and out of for pockets of absurd fun, such as jumping over houses or drifting through a minefield. Conquering the criteria to earn XP and resources feels like getting your license in Gran Turismo on a schoolyard sugar high.  Lego 2K Drive’s constant barrage of dialogue kept me giggling throughout, though the intensity of some missions, like the less-interesting wave-defense or NPC rescue expeditions, left me unable to focus on the jokes. This was always disappointing, given the evident talent of the writers and voice actors, who provide an effective satire of conventional racing games.  Bashing and smashing your way through the map is easy junk food fun, but the must-win races can be punishing due to some devastating pickups and brutal slow down when you veer off track. Some of the open-world missions require you to drive with dexterity and attempt deft movements while herding rockets or smashing through tiny robot invaders, which can lead to frustration, where I often felt too fast for my own good. While I relished how it got my heart pounding, I was left longing for a more low-key approach to exploration.  While it is a little buggy, another delightful surprise was Lego 2K Drive’s couch co-op, which allows you and a partner to peel through the open world together, pooling XP as you go. I found myself getting in the way of bombs or smashing into targets for my partner to make sure one of us got the top spot. Notably, this feature made the dreary defend and rescue missions much more palatable thanks to the collaborative nature of the gameplay.  Unfortunately, the elephant in the room, or in this case, a monkey, is the game’s storefront, Unkie’s Emporium, introduced during the tutorial by its eponymous primate mechanic. Here, you can purchase premium currency with real money that can be exchanged to access cars and characters previously locked behind a costly Brickbux wall. Of course, you could earn all these items by grinding, but the temptation lingers, which is troubling for a game so clearly geared toward younger audiences.  Lego 2K Drive builds an incredibly inviting world where speed and silliness reign supreme as you race and morph across its delightfully destructible setting. Despite some frustrating mission design and a smattering of bugs, Lego 2K Drive quickly won me over with its absurd narrative full of irreverent dialogue and moreish open-world challenges. If only the specter of microtransactions didn’t loom so large in this kid-friendly game, it would make for an even smoother ride.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVpbmZvcm1lci5jb20vcmV2aWV3L2xlZ28tMmstZHJpdmUvc3R1ZC15b3VyLWVuZ2luZXPSAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1laW5mb3JtZXIuY29tL3Jldmlldy9sZWdvLTJrLWRyaXZlL3N0dWQteW91ci1lbmdpbmVzP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-07-01,Not Discerned,"{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T01:49:41,"Reds' manager David Bell is ejected after Clarke Schmidt is sent to wash his hands of foreign substances.  CINCINNATI -- — Aaron Judge has been scorching hot since a mild hip strain sent him to the injured list earlier this month.  The reigning AL MVP hit his seventh home run in as many games and the New York Yankees defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-2 on Friday night.  “When you’ve got Anthony Rizzo hitting behind you, who’s been red hot as well, you’re going to get good pitches to hit,” Judge said.  Rizzo also homered for the surging Yankees, who improved to 9-3 in their last 12 games.  Judge, who received a standing ovation from the many Yankees fans in attendance following his pregame batting session, wasted little time making his presence felt in the teams’ first meeting in Cincinnati since 2017. Judge took the fifth pitch he saw from Reds starter Ben Lively 431 feet to center field for his 13th home run of the season.  “It’s just very reminiscent of what we saw last year,” Yankees starting pitcher Clarke Schmidt said of Judge. “You see the same guy. I don’t think anything’s changed from last year. When you see him catch hot like this, just watch out. It’s definitely a reason for concern for the rest of the league.”  The homer was Judge’s only hit of the night, but he has homered in five of the last seven games — including hitting two in two games during that stretch.  With New York still leading 1-0 lead before the bottom half of the fifth inning, the umpires administered a foreign substance check on Schmidt (2-4).  “When I went out there for the fifth inning, the third-base umpire checked me,” Schmidt said. “He checked my hands and said they were completely fine. He checked the back of my wrist where the glove slides onto, and I’m using a black glove, and there’s like black fur inside the glove.  ""Throughout the game, sweating and rosin, it kind of built up on the back of my wrist where the fur sits.”  The umpires allowed Schmidt to stay on the mound after Schmidt cleaned off his wrist. Reds manager David Bell was ejected while disputing the umpires’ decision to allow Schmidt to continue his scoreless outing. Cincinnati had just three hits off Schmidt at that point.  “David was upset that we made him clean it off and not eject him,"" crew chief Brian O’Nora said via the pool reporter. “I explained the situation. He kept going. I told him it was enough and he kept going. I had no choice but to eject him.”  Bell declined to discuss the ejection after the game.  “I think it was probably obvious what happened, and I’m just going to leave it at that,"" the Reds manager said. ""We don’t benefit from me talking about this, so I’m not going to talk about it. But it was obvious what happened.”  Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán was suspended for 10 games Wednesday by Major League Baseball and fined for violating the sport’s prohibition of foreign substances on the mound.  “I get it,” Schmidt said. “The league is hypersensitive about it right now. You see it all across the league where guys are getting more extensive on the searches, which is completely fine. I have nothing to hide.”  Lively (1-2) was pulled in the sixth after walking Judge on six pitches. Lively allowed just two hits, including Judge’s first-inning home run, while compiling a career-high eight strikeouts as the Red lost for the fourth time in five games.  Following Lively’s exit, Rizzo tagged Reds reliever Ian Gibaut with his 10th homer of the season to score Judge and make it 3-0.  Jake Fraley drove in two runs on a double off reliever Jimmy Cordero in the sixth to chop New York’s lead to 3-2.  The Yankees added three runs in the ninth, including a two-run double by Kyle Higashioka.  BOONE RETURNS  Yankees manager Aaron Boone said before the game he got emotional during the drive to the ballpark.  Boone, who made his big league debut with the Reds in 1997, returned to Cincinnati for the first time as a manager. It was also Boone’s first visit to the city since the All-Star Game weekend in 2015 when he was an analyst for ESPN.  “This place was a huge, huge part of my life,” Boone said. It will forever be a in my heart and a special place to me. Every time I get to come here, it means a lot to me.”  Boone played for the Reds until he was traded to the Yankees in 2003. Boone’s older brother, Bret, also played in Cincinnati from 1994-98. Their father, Bob, was the Reds’ manager from 2001-03.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Yankees: INF Oswald Peraza (sprained ankle) was reinstated from the 10-day injured list after the game and optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  Reds: OF TJ Friedl (mild oblique strain) took some swings and ran before the game. Bell said Friedl has not shown any symptoms of the left oblique strain since being diagnosed with the injury on May 13. Cincinnati placed Friedl on the 10-day injured list on Monday.  ADDING DEPTH  The Yankees announced after the game they acquired OF Greg Allen from Boston Red Sox for minor league RHP Diego Hernández and cash considerations.  It’s the second stint with the Yankees for the 30-year-old Allen, who played in New York in 2021. He also has played with Cleveland, San Diego and Pittsburgh during his six big league seasons.  UP NEXT  Reds RHP Luke Weaver (1-2, 6.26 ERA) is scheduled to get the ball Saturday in the second game of the three-game series.

game,2023-05-01,Not Discerned,"{""SaintLouis"", ""Missouri"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T02:53:48,"Nico Hoerner drives in half the Cubs' runs with a pair of doubles in the team's road win.  PHILADELPHIA -- — Nico Hoerner had two two-run doubles in his return from the injured list and the Chicago Cubs snapped a five-game losing streak, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 10-1 on Friday night.  Marcus Stroman (3-4) allowed one run and three hits in six innings for the victory. The Cubs have won seven straight games over the Phillies dating to the 2021 season.  “It's a great sign for our group that we were able to save the bullpen and create some positivity,” Hoerner said. “That was something we did well earlier in the year.”  The Phillies (20-24) have lost five in a row and showed visible signs of frustration as the game ended.  “The way we play, it's on us,” Phillies designated hitter Bryce Harper said. “Every guy in this clubhouse should be frustrating because of the way we are going about it right now and the mistakes we're making. We're not playing the game the right way. And when you don't play mistake-free baseball, you lose ballgames.”  Part of the issue has been starting pitching, with Ranger Suarez lasting only two innings while allowing five hits and four earned runs on 66 pitches. It was the third time this week that a Phillies starter did not go longer than two innings.  “He looked like he was trying to find his changeup,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “That second inning, he got the ball up and over the plate. And then his pitch count got so high that -- coming off an injury- I had to get him out.”  The Cubs put together a pair of four-run innings with Hoerner, who played in his first game after suffering a left hamstring strain against St. Louis on May 9, playing a key role with the matching doubles that scored Christopher Morel and Nick Madrigal. Morel hit his sixth home run of the season in the ninth.  “It is a continuation of the things that we have done well, which is getting on base and hitting with runners in scoring position,” Hoerner said. “We did a great job of cashing in tonight.”  Stroman allowed only Nick Castellanos' sacrifice fly in the first inning while holding the Phillies to one hit in his final five innings. The Cubs got three hitless innings out of Julian Merryweather and Nick Burdi to finish things.  “I was way better with my mechanics and felt way sharper with great movement,” Stroman said. “Yan (Gomes) did a great job of mixing up my pitches.”  It was a solid outing for Stroman, who allowed six runs and seven hits in just 2 2/3 innings during a 16-3 loss at Minnesota on May 14.  “That was a really good outing for Stroman,” Cubs manager David Ross said. “He was able to overcome some of the mistakes that we made which was important for him and us. He continued to make pitches and get us out of jams.”  MAY DAY  The loss secured the Phillies' second five-game losing streak of the month and dropped their overall record to 5-10. Over the past three seasons, Philadelphia is a combined 27-44 (.380) in May. In the rest of the season, the Phillies are 163-135 (.547).  TRAINERS ROOM  Cubs: OF Cody Bellinger (left knee contusion) was moved to the 10-day injured list, retroactive to May 16 for what the club feels is a precautionary move.  Phillies: LHP Jose Alvarado (left elbow inflammation) threw from 75 feet for the second time since going on the injured list on May 10. ... DH Bryce Harper (right elbow reconstruction) continued to increase his throwing distance with manager Rob Thomson indicating that Harper could stretch his throws to 90 feet in the next week. If that happens, Harper could end up at first base for the Phillies at some point in June.  UP NEXT  The second game of the weekend series features Phillies ace Aaron Nola (3-3, 4.53 ERA) taking on Cubs RHP Jameson Taillon (0-2, 6.66).  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWxiL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE0NzE2ODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-01,Not Discerned,"{""Milwaukee"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T17:04:19,"The 2022-23 regular season will be remembered as one of the greatest seasons of individual scoring brilliance that the league has seen in its 77-year history, rivaled only by the historic 1961-62 season.  This season saw 203 40-plus point performances by 57 different players — both marks shattering the previous records of 142 games (from 1961-62) and 47 players (from 2020-21).  If it felt like there was a player dropping 40 point every single night, it’s because it was almost true. Of the 164 days of regular season games, 111 featured at least one 40-plus point game (67.8%). Additionally, 52 of those days featured at least two 40-point scorers (31.7%).  That feeling has carried over to the postseason as nearly every edition of playoff action features a stellar performance. It took only one game into the conference finals for there to be more 40-point games in the 2023 playoffs (17) than all of 2022 (16), and these playoffs have already seen the second-most 40-point games and tied for the most 50-point games in a single postseason in NBA history.

And with the conference finals just getting going — the Nuggets lead the Lakers 2-0, while the Heat lead the Celtics 1-0 in the East — that means we have a minimum of nine games (if both conference finals series and the NBA Finals end in sweeps) and a maximum of 18 games (if each of those series goes the full seven games) to potentially add more games to this total.

Not only has the 2023 playoffs already doubled that mark to tie the 2020 bubble season for the most 50-plus point games in a single postseason, two of those 50-point games have come in Game 7s.  Stephen Curry set the record for most points in a Game 7 when he led Golden State to a series-clinching win on the road in Sacramento with a playoff career-high 50 points on April 30. That record stood for only two weeks before Jayson Tatum sent Boston to the conference finals for the fourth time in six seasons with a 51-point gem to defeat Philadelphia in the conference semifinals.  Here’s a closer look at the 40-plus and 50-plus point scorers in these playoffs who are still chugging along.  Jimmy Butler (2 40+ playoff games)  But neither Curry nor Tatum holds the mark for the highest scoring game of this year’s playoffs. That honor belongs to Jimmy Butler, who dropped a playoff career-high 56 points on the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 4 of Miami’s first round series with the playoff’s top overall seed. Butler followed that up with a 42-point game in the series clincher to lead the No. 8 seed Heat into the second round.  The phenomenon of Playoff Jimmy has only grown in the 2023 playoffs. Since arriving in Miami in 2019-20, Butler has played 231 regular season games and has zero 40-point games. However, in 53 playoff games with the Heat, Butler has eight 40-point games – the most in franchise history, ahead of Dwyane Wade (7) and LeBron James (3).  Butler is the leading remaining scoring in the playoffs with an average of 31.5 points per game. He has made the biggest leap (plus 8.6 ppg) from regular season scoring average to playoff scoring average of any player remaining in the playoffs, followed by Denver teammates Jamal Murray (7.2) and Nikola Jokic (5.9).  Largest scoring increase from regular season to playoffs (Conference Finals teams only)  Player Team Playoffs PPG Season PPG Difference Jimmy Butler Miami 31.5 22.9 8.6 Jamal Murray Denver 27.2 20.0 7.2 Nikola Jokic Denver 30.4 24.5 5.9 Marcus Smart Boston 15.6 11.5 4.1 Austin Reaves L.A.

Joker is only the 3rd player NBA history to average a 30+ point triple-double in a Playoff series 👀 LeBron James – 2017 NBA Finals  33.6 PTS, 12 REB, 10 AST Russell Westbrook – 2017 WC First Round  37.4 PTS, 11.6 REB, 10.8 AST Nikola Jokic – 2023 WC Semifinals  34.5 PTS, 13.2… — NBA History (@NBAHistory) May 12, 2023  But Jokic’s all-around brilliance goes beyond a single series as he’s maintained that 30-plus point triple-double over the entire postseason. Through 13 games played — five games in the first round, six games in the conference semifinals and two games in the conference finals — Jokic has averaged 30.4 points (5th overall, 2nd among active players); 13.8 rebounds (2nd overall and active) and 10.2 assists (1st overall, 1st active), while shooting 54.9% from the field (11th overall, 2nd active) and 47.8% from 3-point range (8th overall, 2nd active).  During the regular season, Jokic’s points scored and points created with his assists were identical (24.5 ppg apiece) for a total of 49 points either scored or created (42.3% of Denver’s 115.8 ppg). In the playoffs, Jokic has increased both marks as his minutes have risen from 33.7 to 38.4 mpg. Additionally, he’s up to 30.4 ppg scoring by himself and 25.4 ppg created for his teammates, for a total of 55.8 ppg (47.9% of Denver’s 116.5 ppg).  In Denver’s Game 2 win, Jokic posted his fourth consecutive triple-double, finishing with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. It was his seventh of the playoffs – matching Wilt Chamberlain in 1967 for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason in NBA history. With a minimum of four games and a maximum of 12 games remaining this postseason, expect Jokic to take sole possession of that record soon.  Jayson Tatum (1 40+ and 50+ point game)  While Tatum’s scoring average in the playoffs (28.3 ppg, 8th overall, 3rd among active players) is down slightly from his regular season mark (career-best 30.1 ppg, 6th overall), he owns one of the signature performances of the 2023 postseason with his 51-point masterclass in Game 7 of the conference semifinals.  But before he could get to Game 7, Tatum had to overcome a dreadful start in Game 6 — missing his first 11 shots, shooting 1-of-14 from the field and 0-of-6 from 3-point range with less than five minutes to play in the fourth quarter — before catching fire in the closing minutes with Boston’s season on the line.  Tatum shot 4-of-5 from 3-point range in the clutch as he single-handedly outscored Philadelphia in the fourth quarter, 16-13, to send the series back to Boston for a winner-take-all Game 7. Only Butler (28) has more clutch points this postseason than Tatum (28) with Tatum shooting 61.5% from the field and 62.5% from 3-point range.  Once Tatum got hot at the end of Game 6, he never cooled off as he was dominant from start to finish in Game 7 to keep the Celtcs’ hopes of title No. 18 alive.  Anthony Davis (1 40+ point game)  Of course, Boston isn’t the only team in search of its 18th championship. The Lakers are just eight wins away from their own 18th title (and second in four seasons) behind the duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis.  Davis has the Lakers’ only 40-plus point game so far this postseason — he finished with 40 points on 14-of-23 shooting in L.A.’s Game 1 loss to Denver — part of a roller coaster ride of offense for Davis as he has four games with 30 points or more and six games of fewer than 20 points.  Overall, Davis’ postesason scoring (22.3 ppg) is down 3.6 ppg from his regular-season average (25.9 ppg). While Davis’ defense has been strong — a league-best 3.2 bpg as well as 1.5 spg — the Lakers need Davis to find offensive consistency against Jokic and the Nuggets.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy80MC1wb2ludC1wZXJmb3JtZXJzLTIwMjMtcGxheW9mZnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T05:25:00,"After losing its first game of the 4A bracket on Monday, Crimson Cliffs needed a rally of wins against Ridgeline, Green Canyon, Dixie twice and Snow Canyon twice to take the back-to-back 4A title.  The Mustangs went on a tear through the bracket, winning every game needed so far, including Friday’s game against Snow Canyon 9-2 to move within one win of the championship.  Crimson Cliffs head coach Justin Abbott made sure his boys were not letting the early postseason loss affect them mentally, which has helped result in its playoff run.  “We didn’t put any kind of pressure on it,” said Abbott. “We didn’t talk about it; I didn’t think we needed to because we knew what was in front of us. It was an afterthought. It happened and was over with.  “It’s kind of like what we talked about, one pitch at a time. If you didn’t get your pitch and they call it a strike, so what. There’s nothing we can do about it now and there was nothing you could do about Monday when it was over. We haven’t put a whole lot of emphasis on it. We just have to go play it one pitch and one game at a time.”  The Mustangs put their mark on the game early Friday, taking a 3-0 lead after Brexten Starley’s homerun in the third inning.  However, Snow Canyon had made a multi-run comeback in every previous playoff game, so when the Warriors rallied for two runs in the fourth, the game was far from over.  But Crimson Cliffs did not want history to repeat. The Mustangs started the fifth inning with consistent hitting to get multiple players on base to set up teammates for RBIs.  “We’ve been talking about quality at-bats all week,” said Abbott. “We’ve just been talking about all week that it’s a hard-hit ball, and we’re not getting uncomfortable with pitches that we don’t like to hit. “We stayed disciplined enough to get some guys on base and have some big two-out RBIs.”  Crimson Cliffs lead hitter Jayger Baldwin came up big, hitting two of his teammates home in the fifth for a four-run inning and 7-2 lead.  Baldwin got on base on every at-bat and ended the game with four RBIs.  “All I want to do is get on first base so I can give my teammates opportunities to get RBIs,” said Baldwin.  “Stayed composed, lots of confidence, breathing and we just knew we could do it. We are playing with a lot of confidence right now, and after that Green Canyon game we knew we were getting to this spot.”  Abbott says one of Baldwin’s biggest strengths is his mentality.  “He’s so locked in. It doesn’t matter what happens, he is the most positive kid I’ve ever been around. Even if he doesn’t do good you couldn’t tell,” said Abbott.  The Mustangs will have a shot to win the series, and the state title, at 12 p.m. on Saturday.

game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T04:59:11,"Rafael Devers goes deep twice as the Red Sox lead vs. the Padres.  SAN DIEGO -- — Rafael Devers homered twice and drove in four runs to help the Boston Red Sox beat San Diego 6-1 Friday night to hand the staggering Padres their 10th loss in 12 games.  Devers and his friend and former teammate, Padres shortstop Xander Bogaerts, took the lineup cards out for the pregame exchange and hugged. Devers then circled the bases in front of Bogaerts in consecutive innings in his 14th career multi-homer game.  Devers hit a solo shot to right so hard leading off the second that he stumbled back a few steps before starting his trot. He hit a three-run homer nearly to the base of the batter's eye in straightaway center field with no outs in the five-run third for a 6-0 lead. He has 13 homers this season.  Both came off lefty Blake Snell (1-6), who allowed six runs and five hits in four innings.  Before the game, Bogaerts said he hoped Devers didn't hit any homers because “he's a dangerous guy. He's truly one of a kind.""  Devers proved his friend right.  “Very happy today that I was able to hit two runs but you have to keep doing adjustments every day,” Devers said through a translator.  “He put two great swings,” manager Alex Cora said. “Around him, everybody put up good at-bats. That was impressive, the third inning. We were grinding at-bats, fouling off pitches, staying on pitches, taking our walks. It was a fun inning.”  Rob Refsnyder hit a two-run, bases-loaded double ahead of Devers' three-run shot to help the Red Sox to their third straight win.  Other than Fernando Tatis Jr.'s leadoff homer in the third off James Paxton (1-0), the Padres' offensive struggles continued on a day when slugger Manny Machado went on the 10-day injured list with a hairline fracture in his left hand. The Padres were booed at game's end, just as they were Wednesday after a loss to Kansas City. They fell to five games under .500 and are 8 1/2 games behind the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and just one game ahead of the last-place Colorado Rockies.  The Padres managed just Tatis' homer, his sixth, and four singles in six innings off Paxton, who was making only his second start of 2023. He made his Red Sox debut a week earlier, his first big league appearance since April 6, 2021, with Seattle. He missed most of the 2020-22 seasons due to injuries and had Tommy John surgery on April 12, 2021.  “It feels great, just really to contribute to the team and be here pitching again,” said Paxton, who earned his first victory since Aug. 15, 2020, against Boston while he was with the New York Yankees.  Paxton said Devers is ""awesome. His swing is amazing. So good on offense and he does a great job at third base, too. Just an all-around fantastic player, fun to watch.”  Josh Winckowski pitched the final three innings for his second save.  Bogaerts, who left the Red Sox as a free agent and signed a $280 million, 11-year contract in December, was robbed of a single by diving right fielder Alex Verdugo to end the fifth.  EXPLOSION IN SINGLE-A CLUBHOUSE  Two contract workers were burned in a natural gas explosion in the home clubhouse of the Lake Elsinore Storm, the Padres' Class-A affiliate, leading to Friday's game being postponed. The two workers were taken to a hospital. The Padres said no players were involved.  DEVERS AND BOGEY  Devers and Bogaerts went out to eat Thursday, an off day for both teams. “You know what's crazy is, I forgot my wallet at home. I'm not even kidding,"" Bogaerts said. He thought he left it at the ballpark but didn't find it there, and started to get nervous. “I said, 'Man, you've got to pick this up. I don't even have a dollar.'"" Bogaerts said he found his wallet at home, in his backpack, where he put it during the bus ride home from Dodger Stadium last Sunday. ”I haven't told him that piece yet but I told him right away that he's got to pay,” Bogaerts said.  TRAINER'S ROOM  Red Sox: 1B Justin Turner, who was aboard for Devers' three-run shot, left the game with left knee soreness.  Padres: Machado's was hurt when he was hit by a pitch Monday night. His IL stint is retroactive to Tuesday. Manager Bob Melvin said there’s a possibility Machado can return when the Padres play at the New York Yankees next weekend.

game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T04:25:48,"Oklahoma City Dodgers – 7  Sugar Land Space Cowboys – 6  Friday, May 19, 2023 – Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark – Oklahoma City, Okla.  Game Summary: A six-run fourth inning gave the Oklahoma City Dodgers the lead and the Dodgers pitching staff held the Sugar Land Space Cowboys scoreless over the final six innings in the Dodgers’ 7-6 win Friday night at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark. The Dodgers won a 10th consecutive game for the team’s second-longest winning streak since 1998. Sugar Land (17-25) built a 6-1 lead through three innings, fueled by a four-run first inning. The Space Cowboys scored the game’s first run on an OKC fielding error then added two runs on a RBI double by Rylan Bannon. Another run scored on a sacrifice fly by Justin Dirden for a 4-0 lead. The Dodgers (32-11) scored a run in the bottom of the first inning when Michael Busch grounded a RBI double into right field. Sugar Land added two more runs in the third inning, scoring a run on an OKC fielding error and another on a wild pitch for a 6-1 advantage. Then in the fourth inning, the Dodgers responded with six runs, including scoring four runs with two outs. Patrick Mazeika grounded out to bring in a run and Drew Avans hit into a fielder’s choice to score another run. The Dodgers went on to load the bases with two outs before Ryan Ward lined a two-run single into right field. Jonny DeLuca followed and tied the game, 6-6, with a RBI single. An infield RBI single by Justin Yurchak then gave the Dodgers a one-run lead. Dodgers pitchers held the Space Cowboys to one hit over the final six innings and no hits over the final five innings as they retired 16 of the final 18 Sugar Land batters of the game.  Of Note:  -The Dodgers extended their winning streak to 10 games for the team’s second-longest winning streak during the team’s Bricktown era (since 1998). The Dodgers now have their longest winning streak since a team-record 12-game inning streak July 26-Aug. 6, 2013.  -The Dodgers improved their Pacific Coast League-leading record to 32-11 and OKC’s 32 wins are the most by an OKC team through 43 games since 1998. OKC has now won 11 of the last 12 games and are a season-best 21 games above .500.  -The six runs scored in the bottom of the fourth inning by the Dodgers tied the most runs they have scored in an inning this season — April 23 in Albuquerque when they scored six runs in the sixth inning.  -The Dodgers have now trailed at some point in 22 of their 32 total victories this season, as well as in each of their last five wins and in 12 of their last 14 wins…OKC is now 19-2 in games decided by one or two runs this season, including a 13-1 record in one-run games.  -Michael Busch, Yonny Hernández and Justin Yurchak all finished with multi-hit games. Busch recorded OKC’s lone extra-base hit with a double. Ryan Ward led OKC with two RBI and Drew Avans scored two runs.  -The Dodgers bullpen has now allowed just three runs and 20 hits in 54.0 innings over the last 13 games, holding opponents 20-for-172 (.116) with 61 strikeouts. The unit has allowed just one run over 34.1 innings going back to the start of the previous series in Round Rock (10 games).  -The Dodgers took a 4-0 lead in their series against the Space Cowboys and have won the first four games of a series for the fourth time this season.  -Dodgers players and coaches wore special retro OKC 89ers jerseys and hats in recognition of the franchise’s pre-Bricktown history and the game atmosphere and entertainment had a throwback feel. The 89ers played at All Sports Stadium from 1962-97 and won four league titles before the franchise relocated to Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in 1998.  What’s Next: The series between the Dodgers and Space Cowboys continues at 7:05 p.m. Saturday at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark.

game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-20T03:58:37,"Friday’s Game Report: Dodgers 5, Cardinals 0  By Rob Rains  Anytime more proof is needed that baseball is a game of inches, just pop in the tape of the Cardinals’ half of the sixth inning from Friday night’s game at Busch Stadium.  They trailed the Dodgers 1-0 when Paul Goldschmidt led off the inning with a smash headed for the top of the wall in right center – but James Outman timed his jump perfectly and caught the ball, robbing Goldschmidt of a game-tying home run.  Following a single by Nolan Gorman, Nolan Arenado hit a ball that looked like it was going into the left field corner – before landing about an inch outside the foul line. Arenado then grounded into an inning-ending double play.  So instead of tying the game or perhaps taking the lead, which might have altered their pitching strategy for the final three innings, the Cardinals still were down 1-0 – and the Dodgers went on to win the game after adding four runs in the eighth, three coming on a home run by Mookie Betts off Chris Stratton.  The loss was only the third for the Cardinals in their last 12 games.  Here is how Friday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: One night after hitting seven home runs and scoring 16 runs, the Cardinals were held to just two hits – a first-inning single by Arenado and the single by Gorman, which extended his hitting streak to 10 games … Goldschmidt drew three walks for the second consecutive game … Gorman struck out in his other three at-bats … The Cardinals had just four at-bats with a runner scoring position, going 0-of-4 … Their two hits were a season-low, and they were shut out for the fifth time in their 46 games.  On the mound: The only run allowed by starter Steven Matz in five innings was unearned because of a throwing error by Arenado in the fifth. A two-out walk and a balk moved Betts to third before he scored on a double by Chris Taylor … Andre Pallante stranded the two runners and worked a 1-2-3 sixth … Jordan Hicks pitched around a walk and a hit batter in the seventh but Stratton allowed a leadoff single and a two-out walk in the eighth before giving up the home run to Betts.  Key stat: Matz fell to 0-5 on the season in his nine starts. He has won only one of his last 14 starts, dating back to May 7 of last year.  Worth noting: After having to leave Thursday night’s game following an outfield collision with Lars Nootbaar, Tommy Edman was out of the starting lineup but did enter the game as a pinch-hitter in the eighth. He likely will be in the lineup on Saturday night … Former Cardinal Shelby Miller, now with the Dodgers, worked a 1-2-3 seventh inning in his first Busch Stadium appearance in eight years … Goldschmidt took over the team lead with his seventh stolen base, extending the team’s streak to 20 consecutive successful steal attempts … Jordan Walker hit his second home run for Memphis on Friday night.  Looking ahead: Miles Mikolas will get the start on Saturday night in the third game of the series.

game,1938-05-15,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T14:23:19,"The Town of Light  Mental Health Awareness Week this year runs from May 15-22, and we've spent this week so far showcasing games that explore themes of mental illness and wellness. Our coverage has included my own story about games and mental health, a look at Will O'Neill's Actual Sunlight, Eli Piilonen's Fixation and The Company of Myself, and Matt Gilgenbach's Neverending Nightmares. Today, we're looking at LKA's The Town of Light, a psychological thriller set in 1938 about a 16-year-old institutionalized in a mental health facility with dire conditions. By sidestepping tired stereotypes and tropes, The Town of Light instead leverages reality to paint its survival horror story.  CONTENT WARNING: This article explores themes of abuse, rape, and archaic psychiatric treatment  The Town of Light  EXPANDING HORIZONS  Neverending Nightmares  This terrifying horror game about OCD helped me understand conditions different to my own  If you've even a passing interest in survival horror, I'd wager you've played at least one horror game that unfolds in an asylum. From Silent Hill to Outlast, Alan Wake, Until Dawn, and Dead Space 2, to name just some of the games that visit mental institutions, asylums feature heavily in the genre with almost always harmful effects. Patients within these settings are almost always angry, crazed, and out to get the player. They've often lost touch with reality, and are used as pawns to be slaughtered on the protagonist's path to success. And, by way of all of this, mental illness is viewed in the most negative of lights.  Games are less guilty of pandering to these ill-informed stereotypes today, but they still persist in many spaces. LKA's 2016 slept-on gem, The Town of Light, however, takes us to an asylum, tells a horrifying tale, but never once panders to misguided tropes. As mentioned above, the story follows 16-year-old Renée who has been institutionalized in the Volterra asylum, southwest of Florence in Italy. By virtue of flashbacks driven by diary entries strewn around the game's lonely corridors, examination rooms, and isolation chambers – all of which are modeled on the still-standing, real-life Volterra building – players learn the harrowing tale of how Renée wound up here, and, crucially, why it's now so difficult for her to leave.  Story continues  Described as a ""danger to herself and others,"" Renée spends much of her life held against her will, while continuously clashing with orderlies, nurses, and doctors, both mentally and physically. One particularly distressing scene takes place in a changing room where patients have been stripped naked and left in the cold. One internee is seen screaming while lying on her side cowering beneath a wooden bench. Another scene sees Renée being forcibly given electroshock therapy, which the devs researched by watching live videos of inpatients going through the same barbaric procedure. One scene depicts Renée being raped.  It's in these moments where LKA's meticulous attention to detail accentuates the horror of its premise and setting. Renée's narrative is fictitious, yet was wholly inspired by reality. And while the vast majority of horror games take place beneath the cover of darkness, The Town of Light is set in the afternoon, where interminable beams of sunlight split the institution's vacuous, cobweb-covered floors. It's haunting, often upsetting, but always thought-provoking. Not every horror game can be like The Town of Light, but that's exactly what makes it so noteworthy.  The Town of Light is out now on PC via Steam, PS4, Xbox One, and the Nintendo Switch.  Check out these 10 games to help kickstart conversations about mental health",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vaG9ycm9yLWdhbWVzLXRlcnJpZnktd2l0aG91dC10cm9wZXMtMTQyMzE5MjM1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T14:31:48,"Sci-fi horror is all the rage these days, with Scorn, SIGNALIS, The Callisto Protocol and the upcoming Greyhill Incident all capitalizing on the voguish trend. Even Dead Space (a franchise that was driven into the ground by its own publisher and forced into complete dormancy for almost a decade) has managed to make itself relevant again.  Always with its finger on the pulse, Dead by Daylight is looking to get in on the action next with its Chapter 28 DLC. This imminent expansion — which is scheduled for release on DbD’s copper anniversary — will see the multiplayer game take to the stars and promises to really shake things up with fresh content that’s unlike anything they’ve ever done before.  And what better way is there to celebrate 7 years of asymmetrical bloodshed than to go intergalactic? After all, crossing that final frontier is pretty much the crowing achievement of any slasher franchise that has legs.  If you can keep the money rolling in for long enough, then you eventually get to go to space. Those are just the rules. It was only a matter of time then, before Dead by Daylight followed in the footsteps of Hellraiser, Friday the 13th and Leprechaun before it and ditched the confines of Planet Earth.  Bringing a lot to the table, Chapter 28 will introduce an original map, an additional survivor and a totally unique killer. To learn more about what’s waiting for us in the farthest reaches of the cosmos, we attended a recent press conference hosted by developer Behaviour Interactive.  Here, we gained a deeper insight into the DLC’s alien environments and discovered what makes the new “Singularity” character such a distinctly menacing opponent.  The Year Ahead…  Before we got stuck into Chapter 28 (titled End Transmission), we were walked through the content roadmap for the next twelve months.  Fans will be pleased to hear that they are going to be treated to a whopping six major updates this year, the first of which is obviously End Transmission.  After this, there will then be three more fully-fledged chapters (adding both licenced and original characters to the roster), as well as two smaller updates that are billed as “survivor-only” DLCs.  In terms of chronology, the breakdown for 2023/24 is as follows:  1st: End Transmission  2nd: Nicolas Cage Chapter (Survivor Only)  3rd: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  4th: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  5th: Survivor Only Chapter  6th: Original Chapter with Killer + Survivor  Alongside all of this, various quality- of-life improvements will also be rolled out throughout the year.  An anti-camping system will be implemented to promote good sportsmanship and to discourage cheap tactics, while a new search-bar function will enable players to navigate their sprawling inventories with greater ease.  Most exciting of all, however, is the introduction of “survivor disconnect bots.” Swooping in whenever a sore loser rage quits or somebody encounters crippling network issues, these A.I.-controlled teammates will fill the vacancy left behind. They might not be flawless substitutes for your fellow human players, but they will at least ensure that matches can continue in some form if the lobby starts to dwindle for whatever reason.  The Perfect Lifeform…  Speaking of Artificial Intelligence — and the implications of it one day replacing us — it turns out that this will actually be the main theme of the latest DLC.  While many in the DbD community were understandably hoping for an Alien chapter (with a playable Xenomorph), the game’s first foray into sci-fi horror is a wholly original affair instead. That being said, the ideas that it will be tapping into ought to be instantly familiar to anyone whose seen movies like The Terminator, Westworld or Richard Stanley’s Hardware.  Set in the distant future, the basic premise of End Transmission is that a group of human settlers have arrived on a strange, exotic world. Hoping to colonise it for the sake of mankind, they dispatch a state-of-the-art A.I. to scout out this foreign terrain and identify any potential hazards.  Unfortunately, the servile android ends up learning a little too much on its reconnaissance mission and starts to wonder why it should be taking orders from these fragile meatbags in the first place. No prizes for guessing what happens next.  As A.I. is wont to do, the machine inevitably comes to the conclusion that humans are just a waste of oxygen and decides to overthrow its masters, picking them off one by one. By the time the DLC opens, this purge is nearing completion and only a single member of the crew is still breathing.  The ensuing confrontation between Gabriel Soma (the chapter’s new survivor) and The Singularity (the chapter’s new killer) forms the central crux of End Transmission. A teaser trailer sets the adversarial dynamic up nicely, pairing cinematic footage with some Kyle Reese-esque narration from Gabriel.  As he dashes through an alien rainforest, the terrified astro-engineer lays out everything that you need to know about his cybernetic tormenter: “It became self-aware. It has no empathy. It doesn’t feel pain. It learns at an impossible rate and it won’t stop until we are dead. Or worse.”  If you are wondering what fate he could possibly be alluding to here that’s worse than being hacked to pieces by a homicidal robot, Dead by Daylight’s Creative Director, Dave Richard, was able to clear things up. Speaking about The Singularity’s ghoulish M.O., he said: “While it was scouting for potential dangers on this uncharted world, [The Singularity] made contact with old alien technology and was subsequently enlightened.”  Having had a profound revelation of some kind, it now single-mindedly strives to grow and amass even more power. It does this by assimilating other pieces of machinery as well as organic material, in the hope that it will eventually become “the perfect lifeform.”  Richard continued: “This killer is an interesting take on the idea of a cyborg. We’re used to seeing human characters [augment] themselves with technology in science fiction, but The Singularity is doing everything in reverse. It’s a piece of software that’s decided to fuse with human flesh in order to increase its strength and mobility. It’s on a quest to assimilate every living being in the universe.”  The end result is a grotesque amalgamation of synthetic components and viscera. On the subject of its appearance, you’re never going to have an iteration of The Singularity that’s entirely pure (one way or the other), but you will be able to modify its look through various cosmetic options.  According to Richard, there will be different skins to choose from here, with some emphasising the more robotic qualities of the killer, while others suggest that it is being slowly mutated by the planet’s eerie flora and fauna.  As for how it plays, The Singularity has the ability to deploy gelatinous sacs around the environment. Known as “bio-pods,” these can stick to almost any surface and are used as a kind of body-horror version of CCTV.  Richard explained: “They allow the killer to project its consciousness elsewhere. By strategically placing these pods, [Singularity players] can spy on survivors and even spew projectiles at them. We call that last part ‘The Slipstream Effect’. When a survivor is hit with a Slipstream, The Singularity can then teleport to their location and immediately attack.  “To [counterbalance] this, survivors will have access to a brand-new special item; the EMP. This will be peppered in chests around the map whenever you face off against The Singularity and can temporarily disable its bio-pods and even [negate] the Slipstream Effect.”  A Long Way From Home…  Alongside the killer and survivor characters, End Transmission will also introduce a new arena into Dead by Daylight’s map rotation. That being the aforementioned jungle planet where Gabriel’s and his crewmates sealed their collective fates.  Describing this inhospitable environment, Richard said: “Toba Landing is an obscure and foreign place. Its dangerous flora, fauna and structure are unlike anything that can be found on Earth. So it will be very different for our players.”  “There were several big themes that we wanted to explore when designing this realm. First of all, it was important that it’s clearly an alien world. We wanted the player to feel as though they are far from home and lost in space.”  Elaborating upon how they pulled off this vibe, he continued: “We took inspiration from the weirdest things that we could find in real-world nature and then modified them further to make it all feel even less familiar. We also added hints of a long-lost alien civilisation throughout, as a reminder that even powerful civilisations like ours can disappear and be forgotten.”  Rest assured that there will be some recognisable elements in Toba Landing, however, as Richard confirmed that all of the staple Dead by Daylight assets will remain intact. He clarified: “Our lore permits that palettes, hooks and generators can all exist within this futuristic sci-fi universe.  “The Entity creates them so that they can be distributed across all of the different Omniverse realms for its trials. So those things do look the same for gameplay purposes. That way players can quickly identify them and get on with the match.”  END TRANSMISSION will be coming to Dead by Daylight on the 13th of June and will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5LWRpc2d1c3RpbmcuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzM3NjI4ODEvY2hlY2stb3V0LXRoZS1wcm90b3R5cGUtZm9yLWJvZHljYW0taG9ycm9yLWdhbWUtZGVwcGFydC12aWRlby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

He recorded his second home run of the year to tie it up at 1-1 in the second inning.  A four-run inning for the Eagles lifted Boston College to a 5-1 edge over the Irish, but back-to-back two baggers from Zack Pajzner and Carter Putz in the fourth closed the gap to three at 5-2 heading into the bottom frame.

game,2024-01-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T19:59:30,"E3 2023 has been canceled, but there are a number of big-time summer gaming shows coming up, beginning with Sony's PlayStation Showcase on May 24. Events from Microsoft, Ubisoft, and other companies will follow in June and beyond. Naturally, not everything stays a secret. In this post, we're rounding up some of the leaks and rumors we've come across so far.  We will keep updating this story over time and will add more information as it comes to light. Bear in mind, too, that we have not been able to independently confirm these rumors, so be sure to take all of this information with a grain of salt for the time being.  One of the rumors previously reported on, a new Mortal Kombat game, was officially confirmed this week as Mortal Kombat 1. The game launches this September.  For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of the 2023 summer gaming shows. For what it's worth, Nintendo is attending Gamescom this August--and it might be the perfect place for some Nintendo news (but nothing is confirmed at this stage).  Summer Game Show Rumors  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3  Activision has already confirmed that a new Call of Duty game is coming this year, but what is it? And when will it be announced? According to reports, 2023's new Call of Duty game is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, with development led by Sledgehammer.  The game is rumored to launch in November, with multiple beta periods and a campaign early access release coming before the official launch date. It's believed to have multiplayer, campaign, and Zombies. A report said Activision might reveal the game in August, potentially via an in-game teaser campaign in Warzone 2.0. Historically, Call of Duty games have been announced in May, but the playbook very well may have changed this time.  Konami's Metal Gear, Silent Hill, and Castlevania  According to a report from VGC, Konami is gearing up for some ""pretty big"" reveals this summer during the time that was going to be occupied by E3 before the show was canceled. What's on tap? The report suggests the long-rumored Metal Gear Solid 3 and a Snake Eater revival could be announced.  Konami might have a new Castlevania to announce this summer, reports have suggested, while Konami's Silent Hill is confirmed to be coming back with at least three games: Silent Hill: Ascension, Silent Hill: Downfall, and Silent Hill: F. There is also a Silent Hill 2 remake in the works. Could we see more of these games this summer? We sure hope so.  Spider-Man 2 Coming This September?  The PlayStation Showcase coming up on May 24 will focus on PS5 games, and with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 poised to be one of Sony's biggest games of the year, we'd expect it will get some attention. The latest rumor is that it will launch this September, and the PlayStation Showcase could be a venue for a release date announcement.  Persona 3 Remake  Another rumor for this year is that Atlus will announce a Persona 3 remake during the Xbox Games Showcase in June. The game has reportedly been in development for several years already, and it could finally be formally announced this year.  Next-Gen Switch  According to reports that have been circulating for some time, Nintendo might be working on a new, more powerful console. Details are thin at the moment, but one research firm believes the new console might launch near the end of 2024. Nintendo rarely, if ever, comments on future hardware plans, but the company has confirmed it has no new hardware coming until April 2024 at the soonest.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9lMy1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXJ1bW9ycy1sZWFrcy8xMTAwLTY1MTQzODIv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2FtcC1hcnRpY2xlcy9lMy1zdW1tZXItZ2FtZS1mZXN0LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLXNob3djYXNlLXJ1bW9ycy1sZWFrcy8xMTAwLTY1MTQzODIv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Friday's loss to Kennesaw State officially put the Eagles (38-16, 20-9 ASUN) out of contention of earning at least a share of the ASUN Conference regular season title. FGCU will now aim for No. 2 overall seed for the upcoming ASUN Championship as Lipscomb walked-off Jacksonville State 6-5 to clinch the regular season championship.  ""I expected more out of us than what we showed tonight,"" said FGCU baseball head coach Dave Tollett . ""We will regroup and come out on Saturday to get this bad taste out of our mouths.""  A 45-minute weather delay to begin the night did not appear to faze FGCU early, soaring out to a 2-0 lead courtesy of RBI singles by both senior Joe Kinker (North Port, Fla./Venice HS) and senior Alejandro Figueredo (Sucre, Venezuela/West Oaks HS/Seminole State). Kinker missed out on notching his 18th home run of the season by inches, settling for the RBI single off the top half of the right-field wall.  KSU battled to grab its first lead of the contest in the fifth, 3-2. The first three Owls runs were spotted by an FGCU balk, a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly.  In the bottom of the same inning, senior Stephen Wilmer's (Sarasota, Fla./Riverview HS/Pasco-Hernando State/ECU) stand-up triple plated the tying and go-ahead run for the Eagles, giving the FGCU back the lead 5-3.  The lead would be short lived as Kennesaw State cut the deficit to one with a sixth-inning solo shot and reclaimed the lead once-and-for-all in the seventh - utilizing a 3-run frame for a 7-5 advantage.  The Owls battered the FGCU pitching staff for 16 hits and began to finish off the Eagles with a 3-run blast in the eighth inning. KSU scored at least one run in the final six innings to reach its double-digit mark of 14, highlighted by a five-run eighth.  Seven of KSU's 14 runs were scored in the final three frames.

The biggest eye-catching detail of this one would be how it finished. Francisco Lindor came through with a walk-off single.  Remember, Lindor spent six seasons in Cleveland and made quite a mark. He was a four-time All-Star, finishing in the top 10 of MVP voting three times. He played on three playoff teams, including the 2016 AL pennant winner and the 2017 team that won 102 games. He was traded to the Mets prior to the 2021 season and hadn't yet faced his old squad, now named the Guardians.  As such, in and of itself, Lindor's game-winner was worth a mention.  There was so much leading up to that, though.  The Guardians had a 5-0 lead heading to the bottom of the fifth inning. The Mets chipped away with three runs in the next two innings (including homers from Francisco Alvarez and Brett Baty). The Guardians would get two back in the top of the seventh, though, making it 7-3 at the stretch.  And then Pete Alonso tied it with a grand slam in the bottom of the seventh.

Things were not easy, but the Dolphins made the plays again when they needed them. The first batter reached on an error, the lone miscue of the night for JU defensively. Long then engaged in a battle in which the UNF batter fouled off multiple two-strike pitches before striking out on a 3-2 slider.

game,2019-03-15,Not Discerned,"{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T05:08:23,"SAN DIEGO – Tristin Lively finished what he started on Friday night at Tony Gwynn Stadium, authoring his first collegiate complete game in his final career start in New Mexico’s 4-3 Mountain West Conference defeat against host San Diego State.  The fifth-year senior right-hander threw a career-high 120 pitches in his final turn in a Lobo uniform, finishing a memorable career with one of his grittiest efforts since debuting in the spring of 2019. In his eight innings pitched Friday, Lively allowed four runs on seven hits, with four strikeouts and a pair of walks.  Both teams were finished scoring by the end of the fifth inning, as Lively traded zeros with the San Diego State pitching staff for the remainder of the game. The Lobo offense managed just one baserunner over the final four innings, as the Aztecs backed a strong start by TJ Fondtain to secure the win.  SDSU improved to 23-28 overall on the season and 17-11 in conference play, moving into first place in the Mountain West standings with one game left on the regular-season schedule. The Lobos slipped to 26-24 and 13-16 in conference games.  Justin Olson hit his 13th home run of the season and was 2-for-4, and Sean Stephens turned in his second straight two-hit game while making five catches in center field. The Lobos were limited to just seven hits for the second night in-a-row, and struck out 13 times while leaving five runners on base.  Poncho Ruiz went 3-for-3 with two RBIs to lead the SDSU offense, which also managed just seven hits against Lively. Fondtain allowed three runs on six hits with nine strikeouts and one walk in six innings of work, before turning the ball over to four relievers to finish the game. Kelena Sauer earned his team-leading 12th save of the year, retiring the Lobos in order in the ninth.  The Aztecs got on the board first, when Shaun Montoya led off the first with a single and worked his way around the bases eventually scoring on a sacrifice fly by Ruiz.  The Lobos got the run back in the top of the second, which started with a ringing double off the wall by Reed Spenrath. Olson singled to put runners on the corners, and Konner Kinkade made the score 1-1 with an RBI-single.  Lively settled into a groove, retiring 8 of 9 hitters after Montoya’s leadoff single and putting up zeros in the second and third innings. After a leadoff walk drawn by Kyle Smith in the top of the fourth, Olson unloaded his 13th home run of the season with a loud line drive over the fence in right to make the score 3-1.  Ruiz and Fondtain hit back-to-back doubles to start the fourth, and an ensuing RBI-single from Xavier Gonzalez pulled the game even at 3-3. A leadoff walk in the fifth came back to sting Lively, as Charlie Rhee came around to score on a pop-up double by Ruiz that landed near the right-field foul line.  The bloop hit proved to be the final run-scoring at-bat of the game for either team, as both offenses struggled to generate momentum in the late innings. Lively allowed just two singles across his final three innings of work, pitching well to contact and receiving strong support from his defense. Kinkade fielded a ball on the left side of second base and threw across his body on the run to get Gonzalez by half a step and take away a hit. Devon Dixon then helped negate an eighth-inning single by Ruiz, snagging a line drive off the bat of Fondtain and firing a laser of a throw to first in time to double off the runner.  Lively’s final career out was a routine fly ball off the bat of Cade Miller to Stephens in center, as the senior from Las Cruces completed the gutsy performance. It was the first complete game of the season by a Lobo pitcher, and it was the third time this year that Lively went at least eight innings in a game.  Overall in his five seasons as a Lobo, Lively pitched in 43 games making 36 starts, while logging 178 1/3 innings and striking out 159 hitters. Lively recorded a dozen wins in his collegiate career, including six in 2023 which was far and away his best season. Lively had career highs of 77 1/3 innings pitched, 62 strikeouts, and 13 starts in his final spring with the Lobos.  LOBO NOTES: New Mexico is now 84-131 all-time against SDSU and is 37-72 in games played in San Diego…the Aztecs lead the season series between the teams 5-0…Olson’s home run was the 24th of his collegiate career and his 17th in a Lobo uniform…it was the Lobos’ 86th home run of the season, breaking a tie with the 1999 team for the third-most in UNM single-season history…Ashby’s double was the 60th of his collegiate career.

The Tigers, who improved to 47-9, finished with home runs from Caroline Jacobsen, Alia Logoleo, Reedy Davenport and Maddie Moore to help propel them to the win.  The Tigers’ bats came alive early, as Clemson sent 11 batters to the plate in the bottom of the first. Following a McKenzie Clark single to left field, UNCG intentionally walked Valerie Cagle to put two on with one out. Jacobsen jumped on the opportunity to send a three-run shot out of left center, then Logoleo followed by driving the second pitch of her at bat out to dead center, giving Clemson a 4-0 lead.  Action didn’t slow down on the offensive side for the Tigers as Aby Vieira, who returned to the lineup for the first time since April 11, drew a walk, and JoJo Hyatt brought her home with a double into deep right center. In an attempt to get Vieira going home, Hyatt advanced to third. Where Hyatt was on the bases didn’t seem to matter as Davenport sent the seventh pitch she saw out of left center to push the Tigers ahead 7-0.  The Spartans answered with a single run in the top of the second, but Clemson bounced back with two additional runs. Jacobsen reached on a fielder’s choice, Logoleo singled up the middle, and Moore loaded the bases with a walk to bring Vieira back to the plate. Hitting a ground ball through the right side plated both Jacobsen and Logoleo and credited Vieira with a double to make it 9-1.  The momentum continued in the third as Ally Miklesh reached on a fielder’s choice and Cagle drew her third walk of the day. Jacobsen doubled to right center to score both. Two batters later, Moore joined the home run party with a two-run shot out of center to make it 13-1.  Bringing pinch hitters into the lineup, Arielle Oda led off the bottom of the fourth with a walk, and Abi Stuart singled through the left side to put two on. A single by Cagle scored Oda. Jacobsen added her third hit of the game with a single at the pitcher, and Logoleo drew a bases loaded walk to tack on another run. Moore rounded out the scoring for the Tigers with a single to center that plated Sarah Howell, who was running for Cagle, and Jacobsen to make it 17-1.

China’s approval is complicated by the fact that Activision Blizzard stopped offering many of its games in mainland China earlier this year because of a dispute with its local publishing partner.  China and the European Union are the two biggest economies to have approved Microsoft's planned $69 billion takeover of the California game publisher behind popular titles such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush.  European regulators representing the 27-nation bloc approved the deal Monday on condition that Microsoft make some promises meant to boost competition in the emerging cloud-based gaming market.  China’s State Administration for Market Regulation cleared it without conditions, according to Microsoft, though as of late Friday the agency's website didn't mention the decision.  Game sales in mainland China come with a requirement that game-makers work with a Chinese publisher to release titles in the country. And since earlier this year, popular Activision Blizzard franchises such as World of Warcraft, the StarCraft series, Overwatch and Diablo have been suspended because of a disagreement between Activision subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment and its Chinese partner, NetEase.  Blizzard had a longstanding partnership with NetEase dating to 2008, which helped the latter company grow to become China’s second-largest games distributor after local rival Tencent.  But the U.S. company said late last year it would suspend most of its game services in China after current licensing agreements ended, leading to a public spat between the two companies.  Microsoft says its planned Activision acquisition — considered the priciest tech deal in history — now has been cleared in 37 countries, which includes the 27 in the EU as well as 10 others such as China, Japan and Brazil. But the blockbuster deal is still in jeopardy because British regulators have rejected it and U.S. authorities are trying to thwart it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vQnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lyZVN0b3J5L21pY3Jvc29mdC1jaGluYS1hcHByb3Zlcy1wbGFuLWJ1eS12aWRlby1nYW1lLW1ha2VyLTk5NDY5MTk50gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmNuZXdzLmdvLmNvbS9hbXAvQnVzaW5lc3Mvd2lyZVN0b3J5L21pY3Jvc29mdC1jaGluYS1hcHByb3Zlcy1wbGFuLWJ1eS12aWRlby1nYW1lLW1ha2VyLTk5NDY5MTk5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,1911-10-26,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,2023-05-19T00:30:25,"With a franchise like Grand Theft Auto under its belt, it is hard to imagine Rockstar Games needing to deliver other medium-defining titles. Yet that is what the studio does. Dabbling in every genre from noir to high school comedy, Rockstar always manages to craft a unique experience that, more often than not, shapes the video game industry for years to come. But in a catalog of critically-acclaimed and commercially successful titles, 2010’s Red Dead Redemption stands out as the pinnacle of what the company can offer. Not only is it a mechanical marvel for its living world, but it is one of the best-executed narratives in gaming even after 13 years.  Just like every other title in Rockstar’s catalog, Red Dead Redemption can be easily summed up with a simple descriptor: it’s the cowboy game. Just like L.A. Noire is the detective game, GTA is the crime game, and Bully is the ... bully game. All of these are accurate but lack the depth of the games themselves. When it comes to Red Dead Redemption, the cowboy element goes far beyond letting players live their West World-esque fantasies of a consequence less frontier.  John Marston is a man under the thumb of the law. Rockstar Games  Instead, Read Dead Redemption is a deconstruction of the mythologized American West and the idyllic picture of a cowboy. A brutal story of a world defined by the cruelty and betrayal within it, people take more than they need and pay for everything in blood. Players take the role of John Marston, a man who lived by these rules until they caught up with him. Formerly a member of the Van der Linde Gang, Marston got out to live a quiet life with his family. That is until government agents kidnap and blackmail him into hunting down and murdering the remaining members of his old gang.  The player is let loose in a sprawling open world and tasked with killing off each former acquaintance of Marston’s. Combat is fast-paced and violent. Bullets do the talking, and Marston can talk faster than most. So, he keeps on livin’. Despite the perceived freedom that the traditional Rockstar open world offers, Red Dead Redemption makes the player feel like there is a chain around their leg all the time. The government knows how to find you, and how to punish you if they can’t. You are their attack dog.  1911, when Red Dead Redemption takes place, is a time when men like the former Van der Linde Gang members were already out of time. The Old West was over as American industrialization swept through the country. Men were no longer able to live free at the expense of others. This is not a world of the golden age cowboy; it is a world that wants people like Marston gone. That is unless the government has a use for them.  Marston is only ever a tool used to enact the violent will of those holding the reins of his leash. Dutch Van der Linde used him to gain notoriety and wealth as an outlaw which put him on the wrong side of the law. The law is willing to ignore those past indecencies so they can similarly use Marston to do their dirty work. In Red Dead Redemption, Marston helps snuff out the last remnants of a version of the West that the government could not control. Which means it has to go by any means necessary.  It’s the end of the line, partner. Rockstar Games  It's a brutal and depressing narrative, one that seems to run counter to the cheeky crime simulation of Grand Theft Auto. But both titles, as well as L.A. Noire, act as skillful analyses of moments in history that have been mythologized as part of larger American legends. GTA is a parody of the fallacy of the American Dream, L.A. Noire deals with the dream of honorable police and the glamor of the 1940s. Red Dead Redemption is a sobering portrayal of American expansion written in blood red at the cost of numerous lives.  One character Marston can meet while roaming the hills and valleys of the world is the Strange Man. He knows Marston, despite Marston not knowing him, and is widely accepted to be an omen of bad things to come — perhaps a representation of death himself. But not just for Marston. He represents the death of the West as a concept, the end of an era that requires those who can’t live in the next era to die as well.  Red Dead Redemption’s power lies in how it utilizes the open world of a Rockstar game and incrementally removes power from the player. This is not a world they control. The West was never free. It’s an astounding achievement of storytelling that remains the pinnacle of what Rockstar can accomplish.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2dhbWluZy9yZWQtZGVhZC1yZWRlbXB0aW9uLTEzdGgtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktcm9ja3N0YXItYmVzdC1nYW1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-01,19:47:00,"{""Tampa"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T20:54:00,"Game 1 of the 2023 Eastern Conference finals provided fans in attendance with more than double the amount of hockey for which they paid. It took until 19:47 of the fourth overtime period for the Florida Panthers to earn the 3-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes.  During NHL regular-season games, a five-minute 3-on-3 overtime period is played; if no team scores, it goes to a shootout. But in the playoffs, it's repeated 20-minute periods of sudden death until a goal is scored.  Will the Panthers-Hurricanes marathon result in any players getting a rest for Game 2? Not likely.  ""I've got a 38-year-old in the back end,"" Canes coach Rod Brind'Amour said of defenseman Brent Burns, who played over 54 minutes in Game 1, per ESPN's Greg Wyshynski. ""Maybe I shouldn't go to him [in Game 2]. But I can tell you right now that if I confronted him, he would punch me in the face. This is why they play the games. To get in these moments. So I guess that answers [the question] for the rest of the guys, too.""  Nevertheless, Thursday's marathon contest was not the longest playoff overtime game in NHL history. The 79 minutes, 47 seconds of extra game time was the sixth highest in the league's more than 100 years. Courtesy of ESPN Stats & Information research, here's a rundown of the five games that were even longer:  1936: Detroit Red Wings 1, Montreal Maroons 0  Overtime periods: 6  Extra game time: 116:30  The wonderfully named Mud Bruneteau finally scored at 16:30 of overtime No. 6 to break the tie with Montreal in Game 1 of the best-of-five Stanley Cup semifinal series. Per NHL.com, Red Wings goalie Normie Smith lost 12 pounds of body weight during the game and made 92 saves to earn the W. The Red Wings would win the Stanley Cup Final that year against the Toronto Maple Leafs.  Overtime periods: 6  Extra game time: 104:46  It was another Stanley Cup semifinal best-of-five matchup here and the NHL's first true marathon game. Ken Doraty was the hero of this one, and as it was Game 5 of the series, this was a series clincher as well. Veteran NHL writer Stan Fischler recounted in 2017 that a coin flip nearly decided this one after four overtime periods. The Leafs would lose in the Cup Final to the New York Rangers.  Overtime periods: 5  Extra game time: 92:01  The Keystone State rivals have played many an epic playoff game, and this one was nearly two extra games of hockey for fans in attendance. Keith Primeau ended the festivities at 12:01 of the fifth overtime, tying their Eastern Conference semifinal series 2-2. The full game is available on YouTube; bring some snacks, the runtime is 5:22:54. Philly would win this series 4-2 but lose to the eventual Cup-winning New Jersey Devils 4-3 in the Eastern Conference finals.  Overtime periods: 5  Extra game time: 90:27  During the NHL's ""bubble"" Stanley Cup playoffs in 2020, many things seemed like an illusion. The amount of time on ice for the Lightning and Blue Jackets in this game's box score is one of them. Often cited as one of the times that NHL officials ""swallowed their whistles"" in OT, there were 14 total penalty minutes in this game. No matter, as Lightning center Brayden Point scored the game-winning goal at 10:27 at even strength, giving the Lightning the 1-0 series lead even though it felt like this one should've counted extra. The Lightning would win the series 4-1 and go on to win the Cup.  Overtime periods: 5  Extra game time: 80:28  Back when the Ducks were way more into purple, they outlasted the Stars in the opening tilt of the Western Conference semifinals, thanks to a goal from Petr Sykora.

game,2023-05-19,Not Discerned,"{""LasVegas"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T05:37:00,"Brett Howden collects the rebound and finds the back of the net in overtime as the Golden Knights take Game 1 vs. the Stars. (0:53)  LAS VEGAS -- Brett Howden's game-winning goal less than two minutes into overtime gave the Vegas Golden Knights a 4-3 win Friday night against the Dallas Stars in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.  The sequence that led to the Golden Knights taking a 1-0 series lead was just as quick as overtime itself.  Chandler Stephenson carried possession into the Stars' zone before playing a centering pass to Mark Stone. He then fed an instant backhanded pass to Howden, who was left alone at the net front. Howden's initial shot went wide, but he recovered the rebound off the boards and fired a shot beneath the goal line that he banked off Jake Oettinger for the win.  ""I just tried throwing it in there and got lucky that it went in,"" Howden said. ""I think Oettinger put it in himself. I was just trying to throw it in there and see what would happen.""  Howden's goal is the latest in a narrative that has come to define the Golden Knights during these playoffs: They're a team that can get goals from their entire lineup. The Golden Knights have had 14 different players score goals these playoffs, equaling the Carolina Hurricanes and Florida Panthers (the Stars lead the way with 15).  Stars winger Jason Robertson, who did not score in the second round against the Seattle Kraken, staked his team to a 1-0 lead with less than 90 seconds remaining in the first period from a deflection off a shot from Roope Hintz.  Golden Knights center William Karlsson tied it at 1 in the second period before giving the Golden Knights a 2-1 lead just 1:19 into the third period. Both of Karlsson's goals were a byproduct of his constant movement. Karlsson carried the puck into the Stars zone and played a pass to Zach Whitecloud. Karlsson kept skating and was able to get to the net front right as Whitecloud's shot went off the boards with Karlsson there to collect the rebound and fire it into an open net.  His second goal was the result of a blocked shot that led to a 50-50 puck that Karlsson snagged before creating a little bit of separation before firing off a wrister that beat Oettinger for the lead.  ""Well, the first goal, I kind of got lucky, I'd say,"" Karlsson said. ""I'm sure Whitey was trying to put that one on the net. I just wanted to be first for the possible rebound, but it went behind the net instead and perfectly to me. On the second one, I was just kind of backing up and trying to play safe and there was a chance for me to grab the puck. It's hard to explain but I try to be in the right place and that pays off sometimes.""  Hintz, who had a hand in all three of the Stars' goals, tied it at 2 before Teddy Blueger scored what looked like the initial game-winning goal with a little more than 10 minutes left in the third period.  Blueger's goal was his first of the postseason and just his second career playoff tally. But it came at a time that allowed the Golden Knights to take what was ultimately a temporary edge from another source of offensive production.  ""I think we have good depth at all positions -- goaltending, defense, forwards,"" Blueger said. ""I think whoever is in the lineup can do the job. That's probably what it is.""  Blueger's goal also led to a late push by the Stars. Vegas controlled most of the possession in the game with a shot-share of more than 71 percent in the first period, followed by 55.6 percent in the second in 5-on-5 play, according to Natural Stat Trick. Dallas countered by owning the puck with a 63.4 percent shot-share, which played a significant role in why the Stars had 16 shots in the third compared to the Golden Knights with eight.  Creating and maintaining that level of pressure resulted in the Stars pulling Oettinger for a 6-on-5 advantage that set the stage for captain Jamie Benn's game-tying goal. Benn, along with Joe Pavelski and Hintz, were camped at the net front when Miro Heiskanen's shot from the point reached Golden Knights goaltender Adin Hill to create a scramble on net.  Hintz and Pavelski fought for possession with Pavelski sliding the puck over to Benn, who passed it into the net with 1:59 left in the third. And while Benn's goal did tie the score, it also represented something else.  Namely? How these playoffs have seen Hintz go from one of the Stars' most open secrets into a player who has become a front-runner for the Conn Smythe Trophy.  This was the sixth time Hintz finished with more than two points in a game, and he's had more than three points in five of those performances. It's why Hintz will enter Game 2 leading the NHL with 22 points in the playoffs. Panthers star winger Matthew Tkachuk would be the closest player of those still playing and he's trailing Hintz by five points.  With Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals Thursday between the Panthers and Hurricanes going to four overtimes, there was some expectation that the Stars and Golden Knights could possibly create another lengthy battle Friday.  Instead, Howden ended it early.  ""It can't always be the stars, right? Or the guys that you would expect, and that's what's been good about our team,"" Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. ""We've had different people step up in key moments. It's the time of the year where you got to enjoy the moment and kind of embrace it. Raise your hand if you had Howden in your pool in overtime? You probably went in a different direction and that's good for us. That's why we've been able to win.""  Taking Game 1 has not been a necessity for the Golden Knights. They lost 5-1 to open the first round against the Winnipeg Jets before winning in six. But they did win Game 1 versus the Edmonton Oilers before clinching that series in six wins.  Yet here's why beating the Stars in Game 1's this postseason comes with a rather intriguing caveat. The Minnesota Wild beat the Stars in overtime to open their first-round series. The Kraken also beat the Stars in overtime to open their second-round series.  Guess how that turned out for the Wild and Kraken? The Stars beat the Wild in six games before ending the upstart Kraken's season in seven games.  ""The good news is that the other two ended the right way,"" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said when asked about losing a third straight series in overtime. ""That's what we'll hope for, but you got to win some overtime games too in the playoffs. You can't go 0-for-3, 0-for-4 in the playoffs in overtime. That's something we've got to get fixed quickly.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmhsL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2ODkxNDIvaG93ZGVuLXNjb3Jlcy1lYXJseS1vdC1nb2xkZW4ta25pZ2h0cy10b3Atc3RhcnMtZ2FtZS0x0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jby51ay9uaGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY4OTE0Mi9ob3dkZW4tc2NvcmVzLWVhcmx5LW90LWdvbGRlbi1rbmlnaHRzLXRvcC1zdGFycy1nYW1lLTE_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-19T08:17:47,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes each deserved to take a bow, but they probably didn't have the energy.  Still, after the Panthers' thrilling 3-2 quadruple overtime win in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Final at PNC Arena on Thursday, it's going to be difficult to wait for the next one. When Matthew Tkachuk ended the exhausting marathon by scoring with 12.7 seconds remaining in fourth overtime, all you could think was more of the same, please.  But, of course, get some rest before Game 2 of the best-of-7 series is played here Saturday (8 p.m. ET; TNT, CBC, SN, TVAS).  ""I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch,"" Tkachuk said. ""It's little stuff like little battles that maybe people don't realize, but they're very important and both teams are doing it all night long. So they're a great team over there. I'm sure both teams are gassed right now.""  That's understandable. It was the sixth-longest game in NHL history and the longest for each franchise. The game started at 8:10 p.m. ET on Thursday and ended at 1:54 a.m. ET on Friday.  Total elapsed game time was 139 minutes and 47 seconds.  ""I thought it was a [heck] of a battle,"" Hurricanes center Jordan Staal said. ""It's going to be like that every game against that team. That's playoff hockey. I'm not surprised that's the way it looked out there. We'll have to regroup and take it to the next game.""  Video: Tkachuk nets the Game 1 winner in the 4th overtime  Five skaters played more than 50 minutes, led by defenseman Brandon Montour at 57:56 for Florida and defenseman Brent Burns at 54:33 for Carolina. And each goalie went the distance.  Florida's Sergei Bobrovsky was superb again, setting a Panthers record with 63 saves, including 34 in overtime, for his second game in a row with at least 50 saves (50 in a series-clinching Game 5 against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Friday). Frederik Andersen more than held his own at the other end for the Hurricanes with 57 saves, a Hurricanes/Hartford Whalers record, including 39 in overtime.  ""Both teams spent what they had,"" Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. ""That's a huge cost for both teams, and then it's a race to recover.""  By the time Tkachuk's shot from the right circle went in over Andersen's glove for the winning goal, you might have forgotten that Florida led 2-1 heading into the third period after Aleksander Barkov (15:28) and Carter Verhaeghe (17:43) scored 2:15 apart late in the second. Carolina tied it on Stefan Noesen's power-play goal 3:47 into the third period and couldn't add another goal in regulation despite outshooting Florida 14-2 in the third.  That included Bobrovsky's left pad save on Martin Necas on a breakaway at 12:33 and his follow-up shot two seconds later.  ""[Bobrovsky] was good, but so was Freddie,"" Necas said. ""Both goalies played great. We've got to get a little more in, shoot a little bit more with traffic, get the pucks through. Both goalies played great. They got a nice goal at the end there.""  Ryan Lomberg appeared to score the winning goal for Florida 2:34 into the first overtime before it was disallowed after a video review determined Colin White interfered with Andersen. So the teams played on.  The Panthers couldn't convert on a power play resulting from Burns' holding penalty at 3:11 of overtime and Seth Jarvis nearly won it on a Hurricanes power play resulting from Anthony Duclair's high-sticking minor at 11:51 but hit the underside of the crossbar on his rebound chance in front at 12:31.  In the second overtime, Bobrovsky made back-to-back sterling saves on Jack Drury and Sebastian Aho at 11:03 and 11:07, respectively. Andersen fought through traffic to make a glove save on Josh Mahura's shot from the high slot at 11:50.  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  Andersen did his best work in the third overtime, with 11 saves, including one with the shaft of his stick at 5:35 on Montour, who was alone in front with the puck following a Hurricanes turnover. Andersen also made a dazzling glove save on Eric Staal with 47 seconds remaining to push the game to a fourth extra period.  ""Listen, it's the worst way to lose,"" Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour said. ""There's no way around it. ... But we'll regroup and come back at it the next one. It's just one game.""  Something had to give. The Hurricanes were 5-1 at home in the Stanley Cup Playoffs entering Game 1. The Panthers were 6-1 on the road this postseason, including six straight wins.  Florida was 4-0 in overtime in this postseason and had won seven straight playoff overtime games dating to 2021. Carolina was 3-0 in overtime this postseason and also had won seven straight playoff overtime games dating to 2021.  Carolina had 145 shot attempts and blocked 39 shots. Florida had 125 shot attempts and blocked 38 shots.  ""You've got to tip your cap to both teams how they played,"" Tkachuk said. ""Fourth overtime, guys are diving, blocking shots, diving to get pucks out. I don't know how many blocked shots there were on both sides. But both teams are very dialed in and playing smart but hard and very for the team. Both teams are very team first and you can easily tell that.  ""We knew they were going to be tight, low-scoring games against these guys and that's something that we're confident and comfortable in, and it should be good the rest of the series.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5obC5jb20vbmV3cy9wYW50aGVycy10b3AtaHVycmljYW5lcy1pbi02dGgtbG9uZ2VzdC1nYW1lLWluLW5obC1oaXN0b3J5L2MtMzQ0NDY1Mzgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Catcher Julia Mayernik recorded her 100th career hit came in the form of a sharp double down the leftfield line, scoring Jaclyn Carifi and Julia Kinnally to put the Lions up 2-0.    Virginia Wesleyan quickly rallied in the top of the second to tie the game at two apiece. The Marlins would take the lead an inning later by scoring two more to go up 4-2.    The Lions would slash the deficit in half in the bottom half of the third when a Mayernik sacrifice bunt scored Carifi for TCNJ's third run of the game.    The Marlins responded by adding three additional runs in the top of the fourth to go up 7-3. Virginia Wesleyan would ultimately go on to win the match 9-3, sending the Lions into a must-win elimination game later in the afternoon.    Kinnally finished the game with three hits and reached base four total times. Mayernik and senior Alexis Rizzo each recorded two hits, with the catcher also throwing out her second baserunner of Regionals in the game. Carifi rounded out the Lions' hitting with a hit.    GAME TWO (TCNJ 1, Manhattanville 0 - FINAL)  With both teams facing elimination and determined to be the one to advance onto Saturday, the game would become a hard fought pitcher's duel between TCNJ's Elizabeth Gosse and Manhattanville's Shinstine in which both pitchers went the distance and neutralized each other's offenses the entire game.    The bottom of the third saw the Lions' defense make two superb defensive plays. To start, Julia Kinnally made an athletic diving tag out for the first out of the bottom half inning, before Mayernik threw out her third base stealer of the weekend to close out the inning.    The Lions catcher added on to her caught stealing totals in the bottom of the fifth when she threw out her fourth base stealer on another perfectly timed throw down to second base.    Manhattanville nearly broke through the scoreless game first in the bottom of the sixth, when a Valiants' third batter landed a two-out triple down the rightfield line. However, staying composed, Gosse managed to immediately get out of the inning by forcing a pop up to Kinnally at shortstop.    The Lions finally broke through Shinstine's dominant pitching in the top of the seventh, when senior Jaclyn Carifi lifted a single to right field that scored freshman Ashley O'Hagan from second after the Manhattanville catcher was called for obstruction at the plate. The Lions led 1-0 heading into the bottom half of the final inning.    Closing out the elimination game herself, Gosse struck out the first batter looking before forcing a weak groundout to Camryn Kitchin at first. The freshman would punch out the final Valiants' batter to send the Lions onto Saturday's Regionals finals.    Gosse collected her 15th win of the season and completed her 11th complete game as well. She finished with five strikeouts while only allowing four hits.    At the plate, Neveling and Carifi each had two hits apiece, while freshman Reina Jeronimo drew three walks.    UP NEXT  With the hard fought win, the Lions advance onto Saturday's NCAA Regional Title game, with the first pitch scheduled at noon. The blue and gold will need to beat Virginia Wesleyan in consecutive games to win the region and advance onto the Super Regionals round.

game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,"{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T06:52:58,"Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla has received plenty of criticism during the 2023 NBA playoffs for things like timeout usage, lineups, etc. Some of it is warranted, some of it isn't.  Mazzulla could have used a timeout or two during the Miami Heat's red-hot third quarter in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals during which they outscored the Celtics 46-25 en route to a series-opening victory. He also could have used Derrick White and Robert Williams a little more during the fourth quarter of Game 2 when the Heat were making a run.

""We got his back, he got ours,"" Celtics star Jayson Tatum said after his team's 111-105 defeat in Game 2. ""Joe ain't missed no shots tonight. He ain't had no turnovers.

""We have had double-digit leads in both games and a turnover has changed the momentum or offensive rebounds led to a three has changed the momentum.

Despite the 0-2 series hole, Tatum remains confident in his team's ability to bounce back.  ""It's tough. It's a challenge. I mean, there's no point in being up here sad and [expletive], right?"" Tatum said. ""They came in and won two games. They played well, you give them credit. But we're not dead or anything. We got a great opportunity.

game,2023-05-14,Not Discerned,"{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T05:53:00,"Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo take over in the fourth quarter to lead the Heat to another win in Boston. (3:21)  BOSTON -- Over the past two postseasons, the Celtics have repeatedly responded well after losses. They have also repeatedly struggled in close late-game situations.  In control for significant portions of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat on Friday night, the Celtics appeared poised to even this series at a game apiece, but another collapse saw Boston lose Game 2 111-105 and has the Celtics staring at a 2-0 deficit.  Game 3 is Sunday night in Miami.  ""At the end of the day, we have a real, real decision to make,"" Celtics forward Grant Williams said. ""And that decision is going to be, are we going to come back and really set the tone for the rest of this year and really make a statement, or are we going to come out and lay down?  ""And I don't think this team is built for laying down.""  Whether or not the Celtics are ready to lie down, they find themselves in a massive hole after Jimmy Butler and the Heat once again took them apart in the closing moments.  In the fourth quarter of Game 1 on Wednesday night, the Heat held Boston scoreless for over four minutes and forced three turnovers -- including two traveling violations by Jayson Tatum -- inside the final three minutes.  In Game 2, after Williams had a dunk with 3 minutes, 52 seconds remaining, the Celtics didn't make a field goal for the rest of the night, missing their final four shots and committing two turnovers. They essentially had a third turnover on a backcourt violation against Al Horford and saw Tatum nearly lose the ball multiple times late in the contest.  That allowed Miami to close with a 24-9 run over the final 6:37. Butler scored nine of his 27 points in the fourth and Bam Adebayo -- who had 22 points, 17 rebounds and nine assists -- had eight points, eight rebounds and four assists in the quarter, including two huge offensive rebounds.  ""This is a series of discipline and mindset,"" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said, ""and there were times throughout the game where we weren't the more disciplined team.""  For the Celtics, it is a familiar refrain. Against the Heat in Game 7 of last year's conference finals, Boston nearly coughed up a double-digit lead late. The Celtics have repeatedly struggled in these situations at plenty of other points over the past couple of seasons, as well.  Not surprisingly, there was no shortage of answers for what went wrong after this one.  ""We just got to stay poised,"" said Jaylen Brown, who had 16 points on 7-for-23 shooting. ""I think we get sped up at times. Two, we just play basketball. In those moments we got to come alive. It seems like we let the game slip away from us when we are in those situations.""  Tatum, who had 34 points but committed five turnovers and missed all three shots he took in the fourth quarter, said, ""We got to execute better. We have had double-digit leads in both games and a turnover has changed the momentum or offensive rebounds led to a 3 has changed the momentum. So those plays right when we're up 12, when we could go up 15, 16 ... they go on an 8-0 run and now it's at four, and now the momentum has shifted.  ""So we've been up and we got to do a better job of making those, I would call them winning plays, in those situations.""  There were times, as Tatum pointed out, that it appeared the outcome would be different. Boston went on extended runs in both the first and second halves to build double-digit leads on multiple occasions. Mazzulla made several notable adjustments that worked well, from plugging Grant Williams into the rotation to going away from a two-big lineup by starting Derrick White over Robert Williams III in the second half.  But Boston struggled to hit shots, going 10-for-30 from 3-point range. The Celtics are 29-30 in the regular season and playoffs when they shoot under 40% from long range, compared with 36-2 when they shoot 40% or better.  Combine that with another bout of struggles late in a close game, and the Celtics are now 11-4 over the past two playoffs when playing after a loss. Friday's defeat snapped a streak of 16 consecutive games in which a team that lost Game 1 at home had won Game 2.  Now trailing 2-0 in the series and heading to Miami, Boston needs to win four of the next five games -- three of which would be in Miami -- to return to the NBA Finals for a second straight year.  ""Just got to come out fighting,"" Brown said. ""Both of these two games they have been able to come out on top, but who is to say we can't come out on top in the next two games? We just got to come ready to play basketball.  ""We can't lose our confidence. It's the first to four. ... It should make for a better story.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3Njg5MjA5L2NlbHRpY3MtaHVydC1hZ2Fpbi1sYXRlLWdhbWUtd29lcy0yLTAtaGVhdNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3Njg5MjA5L2NlbHRpY3MtaHVydC1hZ2Fpbi1sYXRlLWdhbWUtd29lcy0yLTAtaGVhdD9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-03-01,Not Discerned,"{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}",2023-05-20T06:21:32,"BOSTON — What happened in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals was nothing short of stunning.  We had witnessed the Miami Heat’s resilience before in these playoffs. We’d also witnessed the Boston Celtics’ flakiness. But Miami’s 111-105 victory on Friday was still a shocker.  Home teams had won the last 16 Game 2s in series that they trailed 1-0, and the average margin of victory in those games was 17.3 points. The Celtics should have been the more desperate team, knowing that they couldn’t afford to lose two games at home. At times, they looked the part. They had a 21-2 run spanning the first and second quarters and a 24-8 run in the third.  But they lost, because the Heat just will never die. Miami is now 6-2 in these playoffs in games it trailed double-digits, while every other team is 15-60, with none of the other 15 having a winning record.  In this game, the Heat faced two double-digit deficits, coming back from 12 down in the second quarter to take the lead before halftime and coming back from 12 down again early in the fourth.  “You start to wrap your mind around that it’s going to be a long game, 48 minutes,” said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. “We had to battle through deficits in both halves, but we showed that grit and perseverance to be able to hang in there and make some plays.”  This was the Heat’s third win (they’re 3-2) in a game they trailed by double-digits in the fourth, with every other team in these playoffs being 1-53 in those situations. (The other win was from Atlanta in Game 5 of the first round in this same building.) The three wins after facing a double-digit, fourth-quarter deficits are tied for the most* in any postseason in the 27 years for which we have play-by-play data.  * Tied with last year’s Memphis Grizzlies, who were 3-4 after trailing by 10 or more in the fourth. The 2020 Heat (2-5) are one of the six other teams with multiple such postseason wins.  Here are some notes, quotes, numbers and film from a game that has the Heat two wins from being the first 8 seed in a full (82-game) season to reach the Finals:  1. Been here before  It was a game of runs that, naturally, went down to the wire. And it just seems that the Heat are much more comfortable in high-leverage situations.  Both of these teams have played 97 total games (regular season, Play-In and playoffs). And the Heat have played 16 more *clutch games (63) than the Celtics (47). Boston was 24-13 (second best) in the clutch in the regular season, but is now just 4-6 in the playoffs, while Miami is 6-2, having allowed their opponents to score just 64 points on 70 clutch possessions (91.4 per 100).  The Celtics missed some good looks down the stretch on Friday, but also had a few rough possessions, and they have twice as many fourth-quarter turnovers in this series (10) as the Heat (5). With the score tied and a little less than three minutes left, Marcus Smart simply dropped the ball.  The Heat, meanwhile, scored 36 points on just 23 fourth-quarter possessions (1.57 per) in Game 2. They executed, they made big shots, and they out-worked the Celtics on the glass. The biggest possession of the game may have been one where Miami got four shots, the last being a Bam Adebayo put-back dunk after he discarded Al Horford.  That was a physical play, but Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla agreed that his team’s inability to execute down the stretch was more mental than physical.  “It’s a series of discipline and a mind set,” he said. “So, yeah, it’s mental from the standpoint of who can make the right plays at the right times, who can make the simple plays, who can win those details and those margins. So, yeah, it’s definitely mental.”  “I think they outplayed us,” Jaylen Brown added. “They out-toughed us tonight and they found a way to make plays down the stretch and we didn’t.  2. Poking the bear  Grant Williams has been a rotational staple for the Celtics since he came into the league four years ago … until this past March, when Mazzulla didn’t play him at all on occasion. Williams had three DNPs in the first round, another in Game 6 of the conference semifinals, and a fifth in Game 1 of this series, when Payton Pritchard got (surprising) minutes.  But Williams checked in late in the first quarter of Game 2 and played more than 25 minutes, his second highest total in the playoffs. He did some good things and actually had Boston’s only three field goals in the final eight minutes of the fourth quarter.  “I just liked his physicality,” Mazzulla said. “I liked his rebounding, his ability to communicate defensively. I thought he gave us some really good minutes.”  But Williams also went forehead to forehead with Butler after the Heat star took him 1-on-1 and got an and-1 bucket in the paint with 6:22 remaining.  Now, this is the Eastern Conference finals, when players shouldn’t need any motivation beyond the chance to play for a championship. And Heat coach Erik Spoelstra thinks that Jimmy is going to be Jimmy whether or not an opponent is in his face.  “I love that gnarly version of Jimmy,” Spoelstra said, “but you get that regardless.”  Spoelstra’s players had a different opinion.  “I knew it was going to be good for us,” Caleb Martin said of the fourth-quarter confrontation. “Knowing Jimmy, at that point in the game, you get him going, we’ll take mad Jimmy any time. I knew that you could kind of see it in his eyes that he was ready to go after that.”  Butler kept seeking out his new nemesis. He scored on Williams on the very next possession, and then two more times (one, two) after that. All four of his fourth-quarter field goals were isolations against Grant Williams, and he agreed that their little chat after the first one did put some extra gas in his tank for those final six minutes.  “Yes, it did,” he said. “But that’s just competition at its finest. He hit a big shot. Started talking to me; I like that. I’m all for that. It makes me key in a lot more. It pushes that will that I have to win a lot more. It makes me smile. It does. When people talk to me, I’m like, OK, I know I’m a decent player, if you want to talk to me out of everybody that you can talk to.  “But it’s just competition. I do respect him, though. He’s a big part of what they try to do. He switches. He can shoot the ball. I just don’t know if I’m the best person to talk to [laughter].”  3. Robinson, outside and in  Another guy who hasn’t been a rotation regular is Duncan Robinson. The shooter was out of the Heat’s rotation for the last three months of the regular season and didn’t play in either of their Play-In games. But with Tyler Herro and Victor Oladipo injured, Robinson has gotten regular minutes off the bench since Game 2 of the first round.  Still, he played less than seven minutes in Game 1 of this series and missed both his shots. And then, while his teammates didn’t shoot nearly as well as they did in Game 1, Robinson came up huge in Game 2, scoring 15 points in less than 21 minutes. Eight of those 15 came in the fourth quarter, when he took advantage of both Celtics named Williams.  Robert Williams III started his fourth straight game and was switching screens more on Friday. In fact, Game 2 was just the seventh time this season that the bigger Williams switched more than five ball-screens, according to Second Spectrum tracking.  But dribble hand-offs are different than standard ball-screens, when it’s easier for the screener’s defender to anticipate the action. When Bam Adebayo had the ball at the high post, Williams was sagging off and protecting the paint. But that made him unready to switch out to Robinson, when Adebayo handed the ball off.  Robinson drained one 3 with Williams sagging in the paint:  And then hit another on a more standard pick-and-roll (with Williams late to react) two possessions later.  But Robinson wasn’t just a 3-point shooter on Friday. He got two first-half layups when Derrick White was overplaying him on the perimeter and after those two 3s in the fourth, he got a layup when Butler set a back-screen that Grant Williams (maybe because he was focused on Butler) didn’t switch:  4. No busting the zone  Robinson, of course, can be a defensive liability. And the Celtics were more purposeful offensively than they were in Game 1, targeting him and Kevin Love in pick-and-rolls with Tatum. After three straight scores on possessions midway through the third quarter where Love’s man set a screen for Tatum, the Heat called timeout and Love was done for the night.  But the 2022-23 Heat played the most zone in 19 seasons of Synergy tracking, sometimes to throw a wrench in the opponent’s offensive flow and sometimes to protect their weaker defenders. With the Celtics doing some more pick-and-roll targeting, Miami played zone a lot in the second quarter (when most of the Celtics’ scores were in transition) and it helped them come back from that first double-digit deficit.  It also helped them come back from the second one. The Heat went back to the zone early in the fourth quarter and, basically, stayed in it for the entire period … because the Celtics couldn’t score against it.  “When you play against great teams,” Spoelstra said, “you just have to do whatever is necessary.”  Robert Williams did have a couple of paint scores against the zone, and Grant Williams got a dunk when an inside screen for Tatum had the Heat outnumbered on the weak side. But the Celtics couldn’t put enough of those scores together.  “We just haven’t figured it out in terms of how to exploit it every single time down the floor,” Brown said. “We got to recognize certain situations, and credit to them defensively, they have been able to hide some of their guys defensively in order to slow us down on offense.”  Spoelstra, as he often does, downplayed the significance of the zone.  “It’s not about the schematics or the Xs and Os,” he said. “You have to be committed to doing the multiple efforts to contain, to get to the three-point line, to contain their drives. They do all of that, and then they crash the glass, whether in the man or the zone.”  5. How far they’ve come  It bears repeating that the Heat lost their first Play-In game and were trailing the Chicago Bulls in the fourth quarter of the next one, facing elimination five weeks ago. Now, they’re two wins from the Finals in a conference that had the three best teams in the league. They haven’t been dominant (the Celtics still have the better playoff point differential), but they’ve been remarkably resilient.  The Heat are up 2-0, going back to Miami for the next two games, and thus far undefeated (5-0) at home in these playoffs. Game 3 is Sunday (8:30 ET, TNT).

game,2023-10-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 15:00:00,"Game thread word. Game thread word. Game thread word.  I’m not sure that accurately sums it up. I’m glad I don’t have the job of recapping this one. But holy cow, when you pull the lens back from the close up shot, the wide angle ain’t pretty either. That the Cubs once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory comes as no great surprise to a fandom used to disappointment. But even as someone who thought this team was only going to win about 75 games, I’m stunned at how bad this team is right now.  I am getting tired of reading from many of the prime voices of Cubs Twitter that the Cubs are a good team underperforming. I don’t know how this team can be framed that way. Nothing is ever permanent and things can definitely turn around. But this team is a bad team that overperformed in April. And it overperformed despite a roster that everyone following the team knew was patched together with beer goggles or a whole lot of wishful thinking.  This team was put together with no viable depth. Who knows if that might have been different earlier in the season if the team had opted for players like Christopher Morel, Matt Mervis and Nelson Velázquez. Instead they opted for the ghost of Eric Hosmer and two players in Edwin Rios and Luis Torrens who, even if they were talented, the organization never felt comfortable enough to give them any meaningful playing time.  Then they balanced the lack of offensive depth with the lack of any proven reliever. To be fair, this exact strategy has worked over and over for this front office. They stack the big league team and Iowa with a number of retread major leaguers and some waiver wire pickups with great stuff looking to harness it. The recent vintage has added some organizational prospects. Without any question, this organization has been good at doing this.  But if you roll the dice over and over again, you eventually roll craps. Can they still pull this together? Maybe. But none of the experienced guys appear to be any good at this. And everyone who has pitched in high leverage situations has buckled under the job. This is vaguely reminiscent of the leadoff spot between the time Dexter Fowler left and Nico Hoerner taking over the spot. That is, a lot of guys try it. A few have occasional success, but ultimately none of them appear able to rise to the occasion.  Of course, 43 games is not an enormous sample size. But this team has given away at least half a dozen games already this season. With different choices would they all be wins? We can’t know. Sequencing changes and can have a profound effect. But David Ross is on a jaw dropping run of every decision he makes in tight ballgames fails. The law of averages would suggest you’d occasionally be right.  With the loss tonight, the Cubs are 2-9 in one-run games. They are also 2-5 in two-run games. A strong bullpen is the surest way to stealing close games. Having a deep bench that might give you the advantage in a game late can help too. Both of those things are useful if you aren’t the defending world champions and loaded with talent on both sides of the equation. Even there, the Astros used one pinch hitter in this game. He drew the walk that finished the night of Keegan Thompson.  This sucks. I’m tired of excuses for poor play. There is still way too much deadweight on this team and there doesn’t see to be any quick and easy way to fix it.  Who’s sense of humor created this schedule? The Cubs get an off day Thursday as they travel to Philadelphia to face the other team in the World Series. I mean, this is comical. Maybe they should do it to every team. The World Series challenge. After that series, there are homes series with the Mets, Reds and Rays. Amusingly enough, the Phillies and Mets are both under .500. But the Cubs have now helped what ailed the Cardinals and the Astros. Maybe the two NL East teams are next? For the record, if you have a friend who is a Cardinals fan and you tap danced on the grave of the Cardinals, know that they are now only 1½ games behind the Cubs. Odds are they will finish a long way ahead of the Cubs. Again.  Rant over. For now. Let’s talk about some positives in a game that actually had some.  Hopefully you’ve read about Seiya Suzuki’s incredible accomplishments. Homers in consecutive at bats is some pretty rare air. Reaching base five times is a different and also fabulous accomplishment. For everyone who was ready to give up Seiya after a rough start, he now has a line of .286/.372/.491 (wRC+ 135). If Morel is emerging as the most productive player on this team, Seiya is bidding for the second spot. Speaking of Morel, he had three hits and a walk in six plate appearances. One of the hits was a homer. He now has five of them across his first eight games of the season. He’s entering some record books as well with his blazing start. That’s eight games with at least one hit and eight games with at least one run. Sure, he struck out once and now has 14 strikeouts in only 36 plate appearances. But also 10 runs driven in on a team struggling to score runs consistently. If you were part of the decision to keep Morel off of this team, you are in a painfully difficult spot. The more he dominates, the stupider you look. So what, you either take the L or you root against your team’s hottest player. For the video game craziness of it, Morel’s line is .371/.389/.857 (wRC+ 233). He has a slug higher than all of his teammates except Patrick Wisdom and Ian Happ have OPS. Arguably, I’ve done Drew Smyly a disservice by placing him down here. Drew should have picked up a win for allowing four hits, no walks and one run against a very talented offensive team in six innings of work. I just can’t bring myself to start the conversation of players who might have value in trades come July.

game,2023-05-12,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 18:15:09,"Sci-fi horror is all the rage these days, with Scorn, SIGNALIS, The Callisto Protocol and the upcoming Greyhill Incident all capitalizing on the voguish trend. Even Dead Space (a franchise that was driven into the ground by its own publisher and forced into complete dormancy for almost a decade) has managed to make itself relevant again.  Always with its finger on the pulse, Dead by Daylight is looking to get in on the action next with its Chapter 28 DLC. This imminent expansion — which is scheduled for release on DbD’s copper anniversary — will see the multiplayer game take to the stars and promises to really shake things up with fresh content that’s unlike anything they’ve ever done before.  And what better way is there to celebrate 7 years of asymmetrical bloodshed than to go intergalactic? After all, crossing that final frontier is pretty much the crowing achievement of any slasher franchise that has legs.  If you can keep the money rolling in for long enough, then you eventually get to go to space. Those are just the rules. It was only a matter of time then, before Dead by Daylight followed in the footsteps of Hellraiser, Friday the 13th and Leprechaun before it and ditched the confines of Planet Earth.  Bringing a lot to the table, Chapter 28 will introduce an original map, an additional survivor and a totally unique killer. To learn more about what’s waiting for us in the farthest reaches of the cosmos, we attended a recent press conference hosted by developer Behaviour Interactive.  Here, we gained a deeper insight into the DLC’s alien environments and discovered what makes the new “Singularity” character such a distinctly menacing opponent.  The Year Ahead…  Before we got stuck into Chapter 28 (titled End Transmission), we were walked through the content roadmap for the next twelve months.  Fans will be pleased to hear that they are going to be treated to a whopping six major updates this year, the first of which is obviously End Transmission.  After this, there will then be three more fully-fledged chapters (adding both licenced and original characters to the roster), as well as two smaller updates that are billed as “survivor-only” DLCs.  In terms of chronology, the breakdown for 2023/24 is as follows:  1st: End Transmission  2nd: Nicolas Cage Chapter (Survivor Only)  3rd: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  4th: Licenced Chapter with Killer + Survivor  5th: Survivor Only Chapter  6th: Original Chapter with Killer + Survivor  Alongside all of this, various quality- of-life improvements will also be rolled out throughout the year.  An anti-camping system will be implemented to promote good sportsmanship and to discourage cheap tactics, while a new search-bar function will enable players to navigate their sprawling inventories with greater ease.  Most exciting of all, however, is the introduction of “survivor disconnect bots.” Swooping in whenever a sore loser rage quits or somebody encounters crippling network issues, these A.I.-controlled teammates will fill the vacancy left behind. They might not be flawless substitutes for your fellow human players, but they will at least ensure that matches can continue in some form if the lobby starts to dwindle for whatever reason.  The Perfect Lifeform…  Speaking of Artificial Intelligence — and the implications of it one day replacing us — it turns out that this will actually be the main theme of the latest DLC.  While many in the DbD community were understandably hoping for an Alien chapter (with a playable Xenomorph), the game’s first foray into sci-fi horror is a wholly original affair instead. That being said, the ideas that it will be tapping into ought to be instantly familiar to anyone whose seen movies like The Terminator, Westworld or Richard Stanley’s Hardware.  Set in the distant future, the basic premise of End Transmission is that a group of human settlers have arrived on a strange, exotic world. Hoping to colonise it for the sake of mankind, they dispatch a state-of-the-art A.I. to scout out this foreign terrain and identify any potential hazards.  Unfortunately, the servile android ends up learning a little too much on its reconnaissance mission and starts to wonder why it should be taking orders from these fragile meatbags in the first place. No prizes for guessing what happens next.  As A.I. is wont to do, the machine inevitably comes to the conclusion that humans are just a waste of oxygen and decides to overthrow its masters, picking them off one by one. By the time the DLC opens, this purge is nearing completion and only a single member of the crew is still breathing.  The ensuing confrontation between Gabriel Soma (the chapter’s new survivor) and The Singularity (the chapter’s new killer) forms the central crux of End Transmission. A teaser trailer sets the adversarial dynamic up nicely, pairing cinematic footage with some Kyle Reese-esque narration from Gabriel.  As he dashes through an alien rainforest, the terrified astro-engineer lays out everything that you need to know about his cybernetic tormenter: “It became self-aware. It has no empathy. It doesn’t feel pain. It learns at an impossible rate and it won’t stop until we are dead. Or worse.”  If you are wondering what fate he could possibly be alluding to here that’s worse than being hacked to pieces by a homicidal robot, Dead by Daylight’s Creative Director, Dave Richard, was able to clear things up. Speaking about The Singularity’s ghoulish M.O., he said: “While it was scouting for potential dangers on this uncharted world, [The Singularity] made contact with old alien technology and was subsequently enlightened.”  Having had a profound revelation of some kind, it now single-mindedly strives to grow and amass even more power. It does this by assimilating other pieces of machinery as well as organic material, in the hope that it will eventually become “the perfect lifeform.”  Richard continued: “This killer is an interesting take on the idea of a cyborg. We’re used to seeing human characters [augment] themselves with technology in science fiction, but The Singularity is doing everything in reverse. It’s a piece of software that’s decided to fuse with human flesh in order to increase its strength and mobility. It’s on a quest to assimilate every living being in the universe.”  The end result is a grotesque amalgamation of synthetic components and viscera. On the subject of its appearance, you’re never going to have an iteration of The Singularity that’s entirely pure (one way or the other), but you will be able to modify its look through various cosmetic options.  According to Richard, there will be different skins to choose from here, with some emphasising the more robotic qualities of the killer, while others suggest that it is being slowly mutated by the planet’s eerie flora and fauna.  As for how it plays, The Singularity has the ability to deploy gelatinous sacs around the environment. Known as “bio-pods,” these can stick to almost any surface and are used as a kind of body-horror version of CCTV.  Richard explained: “They allow the killer to project its consciousness elsewhere. By strategically placing these pods, [Singularity players] can spy on survivors and even spew projectiles at them. We call that last part ‘The Slipstream Effect’. When a survivor is hit with a Slipstream, The Singularity can then teleport to their location and immediately attack.  “To [counterbalance] this, survivors will have access to a brand-new special item; the EMP. This will be peppered in chests around the map whenever you face off against The Singularity and can temporarily disable its bio-pods and even [negate] the Slipstream Effect.”  A Long Way From Home…  Alongside the killer and survivor characters, End Transmission will also introduce a new arena into Dead by Daylight’s map rotation. That being the aforementioned jungle planet where Gabriel’s and his crewmates sealed their collective fates.  Describing this inhospitable environment, Richard said: “Toba Landing is an obscure and foreign place. Its dangerous flora, fauna and structure are unlike anything that can be found on Earth. So it will be very different for our players.”  “There were several big themes that we wanted to explore when designing this realm. First of all, it was important that it’s clearly an alien world. We wanted the player to feel as though they are far from home and lost in space.”  Elaborating upon how they pulled off this vibe, he continued: “We took inspiration from the weirdest things that we could find in real-world nature and then modified them further to make it all feel even less familiar. We also added hints of a long-lost alien civilisation throughout, as a reminder that even powerful civilisations like ours can disappear and be forgotten.”  Rest assured that there will be some recognisable elements in Toba Landing, however, as Richard confirmed that all of the staple Dead by Daylight assets will remain intact. He clarified: “Our lore permits that palettes, hooks and generators can all exist within this futuristic sci-fi universe.  “The Entity creates them so that they can be distributed across all of the different Omniverse realms for its trials. So those things do look the same for gameplay purposes. That way players can quickly identify them and get on with the match.”  END TRANSMISSION will be coming to Dead by Daylight on the 13th of June and will be available on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5LWRpc2d1c3RpbmcuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzM3NjI3MDIvc3RlYWx0aC1ob3Jyb3ItZ2FtZS1ob21lYm9keS1yZWxlYXNlcy1qdW5lLTEtZm9yLXBjLWNvbnNvbGVzLXRyYWlsZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Shuvalova is now tied for third, trailing the leaders, GMs Kateryna Lagno and Tan Zhongyi, by half a point.  WGM Dinara Wagner unleashed a spirited piece of home prep on IM Bibisara Assaubayeva, leading to a double-edged game where Assaubayeva was able to navigate the complexity over the board.  GM Aleksandra Goryachkina had a commanding advantage vs. GM Alexandra Kosteniuk, but in the end, the 12th women's world champion found a way to create counterplay and save the game.  The final leg of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix continues with round four on Friday, May 19, starting at 5:00 a.m. Pacific/14:00 CEST.  How to watch?  You can watch live games of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix on our Events Page . The rounds start each day at 5:00 a.m. Pacific/14:00 CEST.  Lagno vs. Tan  In the clash between the leaders, the Petroff took on a more aggressive nature when Lagno used her king to escape Black's pin on the h5-d1 diagonal and Tan reacted by opening the f-file to double her rooks to create more kingside pressure.  After several trades in the center, the position changed into a queen and rook ending where Lagno's heavy pieces dominated the e-file, but Tan's major counterparts kept her few weaknesses well-supported. Though Lagno used the majority of the time left on her clock looking for ways to increase her slight edge, the game eventually winded down to a draw.  Wagner vs. Assaubayeva  Wagner intensified the already notoriously double-edged King's Indian Defense with 12.g4!?―a bolt to Black's kingside. As commentator WGM Keti Tsatsalashvili noted, so far in this event, Wagner's home preparation has been a strength: “Very, very heavy home preparation. Dinara, to me, seems to be well-prepared. I think, in the time from the Munich Grand Prix until the Cypress Grand Prix, she was working hard, many hours of the days.”  Assaubayeva seemed to be surprised, yet unfazed, responding energetically in the center and then offering a pawn sacrifice on the queenside. Though Wagner gained the superior pawn structure and a mighty knight on the e4-outpost, Assaubayeva created counterplay by building up pressure on White's backward f-pawn. In the end, this led to a topsy-turvy balance.  Wagner had hostile intentions against Assaubayeva's King's Indian Defense. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  Shuvalova vs. Mammadzada  Shuvalova is the only player remaining who’s played all decisive games. Her efforts for the win have played off; despite her round-one loss, she’s joined the tie for third.  Shuvalova opted for a Maroczy Bind setup against Mammadzada’s Sicilian Kan, giving White a space edge while Black has few weaknesses, always looking to prepare the pawn breaks …d5 or …b5.  By move 21, Shuvalova gained a vast time edge of nearly 50 minutes to just 10 for her opponent. Black can often struggle to find moves because her plan is less concrete in her solid yet cramped position.  White increased her edge by barreling her forces down at Black’s weak d6-pawn, forcing …e5, permanently weakening d5 and the light-squares. Shuvalova soon took over this potent central outpost and, by move 27, every single white piece was more active than its black counterpart, which was completely tied down to the passive defense of her backward d-pawn.  Shuvalova is proving to be a relentless fighter. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  With such a commanding position, Shuvalova seemed a little over-eager to convert her advantage, rushing to win the weak pawn but allowing her opponent to trade into a rook ending with drawing chances. From there, the world number-16 for women had to win the game all over again, but she was up for the challenge. When Mammadzada gave her a chance at winning, she capitalized. Can you find how she turned a drawish rook ending into a winning one?  In her post-game interview, Shuvalova shared that―although the original rook ending was technically drawn―she intended to press on for as long as possible:  ""In the end, she had probably good chances to save the game if she just stayed, not pushing ...g5 (...). If she just stayed, I would play g3 and f4 at some moment and grab the e5-pawn. And then we will be playing for another hundred moves.""  And then we will be playing for another hundred moves. —Polina Shuvalova  This tenacious victory is our Game of the Day, analyzed by GM Rafael Leitao.  Kosteniuk vs Goryachkina  In the battle between the Aleksandras, the top seed faced the 12th women's world champion. Further, these two competitors currently lead in grand prix points (except for GM Zhu Jiner, who’s already completed three events).  With the black pieces, Goryachkina discovered the chance to weaken her opponent's structure, forcing the creation of doubled backward pawns on the half-open e-file. Then, she increased her advantage by expanding on the queenside, step by step. Gaining a dominant grip on the position, Goryachkina created a queenside passed pawn and maneuvered her knights to centralized outposts on c5 and e5. She won a pawn and seemed on her way to grinding down White's defenses for the full point.  However, after one inaccurate move, Kosteniuk leaped at the opportunity to win her rival's passer and simplify into a queen vs. two rooks ending with ample counterplay, ultimately holding the balance.  Kosteniuk resiliently defended her difficult position vs. Goryachkina. Photo: Mark Livshitz/FIDE.  Kiolbasa vs. Khotenashvili  In an Open Ruy Lopez, IM Oliwia Kiolbasa expanded in the center with a d4-d5 break and later with c4-c5, breaking up Black's queenside structure. GM Bella Khotenashvili kept the position balanced by activating her pieces, doubling on the d-file and sinking her bishop into White's side of the board and d3. With all the heavy pieces facing each other, hinting at mass exchanges, the players drew.  Dzagnidze vs. Dronavalli  This game finished very quickly and looked like neither player had much intention to play for a win. GM Harika Dronavalli and GM Nana Dzagnidze went into a known perpetual check idea in the opening. Despite playing White, it's likely that Dzagnidze intended to draw as a reset to her tough loss in the previous round. While it's certainly disappointing from a spectator perspective to see a game that isn't really a game, the players often pace themselves in a long, high-pressure tournament against top-notch competition, being mindful of their energy and confidence levels.

game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,"{""UnionCity"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 05:03:24,"UNION CITY, MI. - The Union City varsity baseball Chargers managed an exciting two game split with Kalamazoo Christian Thursday night. The Chargers dropped a back-and-forth game one by the score of 7-5 before coming back and taking game two in yet another dramatic walk-off barnburner, winning in extra innings by the score of 5-4.  Game one of the night saw Kalamazoo Christian overcame a two run deficit thanks to a run scored in the fifth inning and three scored in the sixth as the Comets took the 7-5 win.  K-Christian scored first, putting up a single run in the first inning and two in the second for the early 3-0 lead.  Union City came right back however, plating five runs in the third inning thanks to an Owen Jackson RBI double, scoring Luke Watson; a Ryan Zweng RBI single, scoring Jackson; an Aidan Decker two run double, scoring Zweng and Rick Austin; and Phoenix Elkins scoring on a wild pitch, giving the Chargers a 5-3 lead after three innings.  K-Christian closed out the game with four unanswered runs after that, scoring one in the fifth and three in the sixth for the 7-5 win.  Rick Austin took the loss on the mound for Union City after throwing all seven innings in the start. Austin allowed nine Comet hits and seven runs, four earned, with three strikeouts.  Owen Jackson packed the big bat for Union City in game one, finishing a perfect 3 for 3 with two singles, a double, one walk and one RBi with a run scored.

Also adding to the Charger effort was Rick Austin with two walks and a run scored; Ryan Zweng with a single, an RBI and a run scored; Phoenix Elkins with a run scored; and Luke Watson with a single and a run scored.  Game two of the twin bill saw Union City tie the game up with four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning before winning the whole thing in walk-off fashion in extra innings.  K-Christian kicked off the scoring with three runs in the third inning and a single run in the fifth to build a 4-0 lead. Union City came right back to tie things up with four runs in the bottom of the fifth inning. Union City’s four runs came courtesy of an Owen Jackson two run double, scoring Jakob Fosmore and Luke Watson; a Rick Austin fielder’s choice, scoring Ethan Neveraski; and Ryan Zweng with an RBI double, scoring Jackson.  Both defenses buckled down and kept the runs off the board, eventually forcing extra innings as the game stood tied at 4-4 after seven.  After the Charger defense sat Kalamazoo Christian down in order in the top of the eighth it was Union City’s turn to provide the dramatics once again. Senior Tyler Wagley started off the Charger effort with a one out walk, followed by a clutch double from Aidan Decker, putting runners at second and third with one out.  Stepping to the plate was senior Jakob Fosmore who has seen his share of big at-bats over his four year varsity career. Thursday was no different as Fosmore stayed patient and took a 2-2 count to deep centerfield, allowing Wagley to tag-up and score on the Fosmore sac fly, giving Union City the exciting 5-4 walk-off win.  Phoenix Elkins secured the win on the mound for Union City after throwing two innings in relief, allowing no hits or runs with one walk and four strikeouts.  Ethan Neveraski made the start on the mound for Union City, throwing six innings while allowing nine hits and four runs with three walks and three strikeouts.  Union City out hit Kalamazoo Christian 10-9 in the win with four of those 10 hits coming as doubles.

Early lead propels Climax Scotts past Bronson  BRONSON, MI. - The Bronson Vikings dropped a non-conference matchup with Climax Scotts Thursday night, falling by the score of 5-0.  Climax Scotts raced out to the lead and never really looked back, scoring four runs in the first inning. The Panthers went on to add an insurance run in the bottom of the sixth inning as Climax Scotts took the shut-out win. Climax out hit Bronson 8-2 in the 5-0 victory.

It's completely free and we guarantee you'll learn something new every day.  Intel's tired of doing cost-benefit analysis. It's making AI do it instead.  It may sound a little meta, but Intel is working on tech that uses AI to decide whether or not to use AI to regenerate video graphics. Here's how it works: Neural networks are fed reference images of graphics, such as frames of a video game, that have been rendered without the use of AI. Based on the quality of those images, this tech then predicts a ""visual quality score"" of how well an AI could reproduce those graphics.  Intel argues in its filing that this tech essentially does the job of a quality assessment tester to ""maximize quality while minimizing performance budget,"" and can help decide what Intel called the ""cutoff point"" for when to stop training a GPU's machine learning-based renderer.  The current industry standard for testing the visual quality of graphics is to use human opinion scoring, Intel notes, which can be a ""time consuming and expensive"" approach as it involves a large group of people to rate an even larger set of photos and video sequences. The company said this tech automates the process with a ""high correlation to a subjective human opinion score of quality.""  ""To determine whether such AI-based rendering models are able to improve the rendering performance while maintaining the image or video quality, a measure of how good the quality of the image/video is versus the analytic solution may be utilized,"" Intel said in its filing. ""Such a measure of image/video quality should correlate with a subjective human observer's opinion.""  One additional note: Intel mentioned that this tech can be integrated with several gaming devices, including a server-based gaming platform, or handheld, mobile, and online gaming consoles.  Photo via the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Intel's patent isn't the first time we've seen this in gaming QA testing. Just last month, Google patented tech that allows developers to use AI to test their games, claiming that quality testing teams can't ""scale with the complexity of modern games, leading to delayed launches and lower quality products."" While the focus of Google's tech differs from Intel's, the basic point is the same: AI is being used to replace inefficient and typically human-run processes.  Intel, however, is not exactly the shining star of the gaming PC sector. Its latest earnings were grim, with the company seeing revenues for its client computing sector, which includes gaming computers, fall 38% as demand continues to tumble. The company's results echo the industrywide turmoil that started last year and has continued into 2023, with worldwide shipments falling 30% in the first quarter, according to Gartner.  Nvidia far outpaces Intel in the gaming PC market, said Romeo Alvarez, director and research analyst at William O'Neil. Nvidia currently hoards 82% of the market, leaving Intel neck-and-neck with AMD at 9% each. Intel didn't enter into the space until 2020, Alvarez said, and its gaming offerings really started to pick up in 2022 when it started shipping its Arc graphics card. Despite the gaming sector's woes last year, the company managed to nearly double its market share since the end of 2021.  ""Intel's (stock) has been an underperformer for a couple of years now,"" said Alvarez. ""They're definitely becoming more competitive. There is upside there. But I think we still need more confirmation that the market is going to normalize.""  By adding more AI offerings as this patent suggests, the company may be itching to stay competitive. But as rivals race ahead with AI development, Intel is still lagging behind.  ""In gaming PCs, they are gaining ground already,"" said Alvarez. ""In AI applications, I think it remains to be seen whether they can be a competitor. They're definitely moving in the right direction, but I still think by far Nvidia is the king there.""

game,2005-06-17,Not Discerned,"{""Outlook"", ""Saskatchewan"", ""Canada""}",Thu 18 May 2023 22:15:00,"This delve into the virtual world was written with a half-smile and a wink on the writer's face!  Do you like video games?  I suppose such a question may depend on the generation reading this. But if you're around my age range, the odds are pretty good that you grew up as part of the Nintendo generation.  Yes sir, the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 8-bit video game console that was released in North America in late 1985 and introduced the world to Mario, the pint-sized Italian plumber character who would fast become the king mascot of the Nintendo enterprise for decades. There was also Luigi, Mario's thinner brother who wore all green in comparison to Mario's all red, but let's face it, the world knew who the true star was here.  The Super Mario Bros. video game came included with every Nintendo system that was bought, which was exactly what my brothers and I discovered when we woke up on Christmas morning in 1992 to find a Nintendo under the tree. Cheers rang out, and the odds were good that they were probably heard all over Conquest as my mom and dad poured their morning coffee, exchanging smiling glances of, 'Oh man, what sort of chaos did we unleash on this household?'.  It goes without saying that our Nintendo system became a treasured item in our household. Our collection of games grew substantially, and it was a point of personal pride when my brothers and I managed to convince our dad to join in on the fun. If you remember the game Duck Hunt, which also came included with the Nintendo system, then you know that the game was super simple with an easy-to-follow premise; the ducks will fly out of the bush, and you aim with the Nintendo gun and fire away. Duck hits equal points, and the hunt would become increasingly difficult. If you fired and missed, a dog would pop out of the bush and laugh at you.  Well, we got Jack convinced to give this hunting game a shot one night and handed him the gun controller. He knew what to do, and to his credit, he would hit the odd duck here and there, but it was still a hilarious sight to behold watching Jack Edward Ruttle - a gruff, no-nonsense, meat-and-potatoes kind of guy - pointing a plastic gun at a TV screen and trying his damdest to blow away virtual game fowl.  I still remember him sneering at that giggling cartoon dog laughing between missed shots and remarking to me, 'Don't suppose I can shoot that damn dog, eh?'  As the years went on, so did the video game industry. The Nintendo system grew to include the Super Nintendo, or you could ""switch sides"" and join the Sega Genesis side of the fence. From there, the Nintendo 64 came along, which was a legitimate game changer as far as graphics, quality, and gameplay were concerned. And then came the Playstation.  Not long after the Playstation arrived, its sequel, the Playstation 2 (real geniuses coming up with these catchy names) arrived and it seemed like everyone had one. I did too, and I remember playing many games on nights when I wasn't out driving around with friends, doing God knows what around Outlook, worrying about school, or thinking about girls. Hey, I'm a teenage boy at around this time, so girls took up a lot of residency in my brain. If I'm being honest, the opposite sex still does today!  The Playstation 2 was where my favorite video game of all time was released into a society that reacted to it in one of two very definitive ways; you either accepted it and enjoyed it as the fun, but very adult content that it was, or you condemned it as garbage that was ""soiling the minds of our children"". The game was Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, a story of criminals acting like, well, criminals toward each other in a multilayered tale of betrayal, violence, power, and all of it set against the backdrop of sunny Florida in the year 1986.  The game quickly became popular when I was in high school, with my friends and I playing it over and over and over.  And then, there was one night in June 2005 while my buddies Kyle, Chris and I were having a bonfire late on a Saturday night. We were discussing video games, and of course Vice City popped up. I wish I could remember who posed the question, but the question did indeed come up - What if Outlook as a community was a video game? What would the missions be? What's the story? What's the setup?  Well, the three of us must've sat around that bonfire that night for two or three hours coming up with all sorts of missions, character profiles, and twists and turns throughout the story that would eventually lead to the story's conclusion.  Outlook as a video game.......hmmmmmm....  That's an interesting question for 2023, don't you think? The story that my buddies and I came up with in 2005 will stay retired, and let's just say there's an oath of secrecy between us that will never be broken. But here's my crack at it for modern times.  So what are we thinking, Outlook as some sort of medieval war-torn land? Nah, too bleak. I'm thinking of retaining the same Grand Theft Auto model, but without all the shameless stealing from the popular video game series. Make it TRULY unique to Outlook and the surrounding area.  Mission 1: Modestly-popular reporter Eric Tuttle and his newspaper The Lookout have had their names slung in the mud by the local town council. Who's the culprit who stooged you to your higher-ups? What will you do when you find out? And in the end, whose side will the residents of Lookout be on when the dust has settled?  Mission 2: Local rock band Good Intentions have a gig in town coming up, but something's wrong - their bass player has gone missing! Did he join another band? Nope, you'll find out that he's been kidnapped by a rival band from a rival town, and it's up to YOU to rescue him!  Mission 3: You go to your buddy's house to pick him up to go for drinks, but wait, he's not there. You phone him up, and someone else picks up. You learn that your buddy got in a fight with some no-good punks from the next town over in Rosetown. No, wait, we probably shouldn't use real town names here, eh? How about Tulipville?  There are probably a dozen other missions and likely a whole convoluted backstory I could write, but there's only so much space, as they say.  And relax, people. I wrote this with a half-smile and a knowing wink on my face. It's video games, folks; no sense in getting hot about any of this.  For this week, that's been the Ruttle Report.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhc2t0b2RheS5jYS9jZW50cmFsL291dGxvb2svdGhlLXJ1dHRsZS1yZXBvcnQtd2hhdC1pZi1vdXRsb29rLXdhcy1hLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtNzAyMjYyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Fords (17-2), who won the Inter-Ac championship by virtue of an undefeated regular season (10-0), will play Malvern Prep for the tourney crown Saturday at West Chester’s Farrell Stadium at noon. Second-seeded Malvern Prep (15-7) advanced with a 16-7 triumph over Episcopal Academy.  Haverford School led, 4-3, at halftime, but the Blue Devils tied it on a goal by Finn Dougherty (one goal, one assist) with 7:53 to play in the third period and Brendan Dundas (three goals, one assist) put SCH ahead 1:12 later. Just 11 seconds later, Dougherty fed Dundas after another faceoff win by Ross Prince (16 of 22) to give Springside Chestnut Hill a 6-4 advantage.  Haverford, though, converted off a 2-man advantage as Wills Burt (two goals) beat Hayes Schreiner (22 saves) with 1:55 to play in the period. Jack Long tied it with 30.5 seconds left in the period.  Burt then put the Fords ahead, 7-6 early in the final frame and Aydan DiRocco scored to make it 8-6.  Ryan DiRocco led the Fords with four goals and an assist and Brady O’Kane scored twice while Colin Zeller had a goal and two assists. Brody Murphy had 13 saves in goal.  Also for SCH (11-9), Stevie Pileggi had two goals and two assists and Cole Carberry scored twice.  For Malvern Prep, Ennis Udo pumped in six goals and had one assist and AJ Nikolic had four goals and two assists while Michael Ortlieb added two goals and four assists. EA (12-9) – which got two goals each from Lucas Slate and TJ Lamb – opened with a 2-0 lead, but the Friars scored seven unanswered goals to seize control.

Since January, high school students at the Queens School of Inquiry have been playing ""Energetic,"" a new board game that teaches students the complexities of decarbonizing New York’s electrical grid by switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  What You Need To Know ""Energetic"" is a board game teaching kids how to decarbonize New York City's electrical grids    Students learn about the climate crisis and sustainability while playing the game    ""High school students will have a better sense of what the local solutions are, and hopefully, they'll participate in the real ones,"" teacher Adam Zaid said    So far, 13 schools in the city are using the board game in the classroom  ""So we're trying to have a sustainable energy source in New York by 2035, which is 16 gigawatts. And so far we have three,"" ninth-grader Yassin Essa said.  At a time when news of the climate emergency is demoralizing many kids and adults, ""Energetic"" wants to provide knowledge and tools to students so they feel they have a role to play in solving this crisis.  ""Playing this type of electricity game, it kind of opens up your mind to a different type of perspective,"" 10th-grader Lara Joy Jusi said.  Adam Zaid is a math teacher and a member of the Climate Education Leadership Team, a group of over 30 teachers and school administrators that advocate for including climate instruction in the state curriculum.  Zaid thinks ""Energetic"" is a great tool for the classroom.  ""High school students will have a better sense of what the local solutions are, and hopefully, they'll participate in the real ones,"" Zaid said.  The creators of the game wanted to display all the variables in this complicated equation, which include activism, technical difficulties, elections and the influence of public opinion.  ""It was really hard to make people understand the intricacies, the challenges and the details of this energy transition, so this game kind of came out of that frustration,"" Isil Akgul, an architect and lead designer at City Atlas, the organization behind ""Energetic,"" said.  New York state has the goal of an electricity grid with zero carbon emissions by 2040, so the talent to be recruited for that mission might come from schools like the Queens School of Inquiry.  ""I've always wanted to be an engineer. But I think because of this, like it's going to be something based around the climate and like, creating sustainable energy that would help our world,"" 10th-grader Cai Racpan said.

game,2023-04-20,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Fri 19 May 2023 01:00:00,"The Muck: Does Players Selling Action Impact a Poker Game?  May 18, 2023 Jon Sofen Senior Editor U.S.  Doug Polk admitted on social media that he's considering selling some of his action in the upcoming $1 million buy-in games on Hustler Casino Live. That sparked some debate as some claimed that selling pieces impacts the way a backed player plays, while others argued that poker players should only play a certain game if they can afford the entire buy-in.  Eric Persson, who will also be in those historic cash games at Hustler Casino in Los Angeles from May 26-30 gave his thoughts on Polk's decision to possibly sell action. His response is the basis behind our newest edition of The Muck.  @DougPolkVids Anyone who doesnt think beink staked matters, or changes approach to actual game play should reread Doug's post. — Eric Persson (@IAmMaverick888)  Confusing Staking with Selling Action  Rob Yong, also scheduled to play in the $1 million games, agreed with Persson that ""being staked impacts the game."" But Polk jumped in to clarify the difference between being staked and selling action.  @rob_yong_ @IAmMaverick888 Selling pieces and being staked are fundamentally different and you guys constantly lump… https://t.co/KLDl8MC8ja — Doug Polk (@DougPolkVids)  Being staked, as Polk explained, means that a player either has no or little skin in the game, whereas a player selling action will typically still have plenty of skin in the game. It's common in tournament poker for players, even the top pros in the world, to sell pieces, and it's also common for players to find a staking arrangement with a backer.  Yong and Persson, however, argued that the semantics don't matter. In Persson's mind, he believes that his large bankroll is ""the great equalizer"" against, by his own admission, a more skilled player like Polk. The Maverick Casinos owner thinks he'll have more of an edge if a pro like Polk is playing under more pressure, which could happen if he were in for the full $1 million buy-in on his own dime.  Persson has become a regular in the highest stakes live-streamed shows such as Hustler Casino Live and High Stakes Poker. He's always one of the wealthiest players in the game, and that likely gives him an edge as he can fire away large bluffs without fear of being stacked.  Polk Defends Selling Poker Action  Doug Polk  Polk took offense to the notion that selling action impacts the game. He defended his decision to contemplate selling pieces of his buy-in by writing, ""You have a set bankroll. Sometimes games are bigger than your bankroll. To offset this, most of the best players in the world will sell pieces to make the game appropriately sized.""  The upcoming Hustler Casino Live game will be the biggest live-stream poker cash game in history. With rebuys and add-ons in the mix, it's conceivable there will be $15 million on the table at some point during the five sessions. Even though Polk is likely the most skilled player in those games, variance will play a role in determining the outcome of one or a few sessions. One bad cooler or misstep and it could cost any of those players $1 million or more.  For Persson, and some others at the table, that might not be a huge deal even if they have 100% skin in the game. But some of the players will feel it more if they get stacked.  Still, there are no rules against being backed or selling action on Hustler Casino Live or most other games. Polk is doing something that is common practice at all levels of poker, even in low-stakes games. He used a historic example to defend his decision.  At some point, games are good to play in but they are too large to take all of yourself responsibly. I am tired of… https://t.co/O2SVL8oUvF — Doug Polk (@DougPolkVids)  ""The Corporation"" was a group of top pros such as Todd Brunson, Jennifer Harman, and Phil Ivey who put their money together to battle billionaire amateur poker player Andy Beal heads-up in some seven-figure matches in Las Vegas during the 2000s.  Beal was at a significant disadvantage in terms of skill against every member of The Corporation. But he had the bankroll advantage, which is why none of the players were willing to play him on their own. Instead, they pooled their money together and took turns battling the banker. In the end, The Corporation won millions of dollars including one session in which Brunson reportedly won $5 million.  ""This is an example of one of those players who sold pieces,"" Polk wrote above a picture of Ivey, considered by many to be the best poker player of all-time.  Doug Polk, Charlie Carrel Saga Just Took an Unexpected Turn for the Better  What the Poker Community has to Say  Many poker players and fans chimed in to give their two cents on the staking/backing issue. Is it bad for the game? Does it impact the game as much as Persson and Yong claim? Or is Polk right in that it's an acceptable practice? Let's see what the poker community had to say.  ""My prob with action selling/buying. Not enough transparency for how much or who has action and trust is a huge issue. Can lead to overselling where desperate humans with bills to pay/debts make bad decisions/run ponzis. Need someone to design a public site for % verifications,"" Matt Salsberg wrote.  ""Selling pieces to players not in the game should be fine. But selling pieces of yourself to other players in the game is a problem. It's even worse if you trade pieces with another player in the game. That's because it can affect the probability distributions of the hands in play,"" according to Mason Malmuth.  @CamzillaPoker @DougPolkVids It’s not being scoffed at. @IAmMaverick888 @limonpoker & @rob_yong_ are saying it shou… https://t.co/PM03KVs5GH — LEGION | b33njammin80 (@b33njammin80)  ""The main issue is disclosure. There are many ways that external financial arrangements have the potential to distort play in a way that disadvantages unaware players. Ethical players should err on the side of disclosing if there is even the slightest chance it is material,"" @tonycoxphoto argued, similar to that of Malmuth's take.  ""The biggest issue with this debate is it's being driven by people who are heavily involved in various businesses. Why is getting investment to risk capital in a poker game different from selling pieces in a business?"" a valid point made by @gustheoryoptiml.  Ethan ""Rampage"" Yau, another play who will be competing in the $1 million game, had Polk's back. The popular poker vlogger responded: ""You’re stronger willed than I trying to explain to the masses why selling isn’t a bad thing.""  Rampage has often sold pieces of his action to his fans for the high-stakes games he plays, including the big game coming up later this month. Some poker pros such as Rampage, those who have large followings, often sell pieces so their followers can have a little sweat. Daniel Negreanu, for example, sells action to his fans for his World Series of Poker (WSOP) package.  There isn't much of an uproar when Negreanu sells WSOP action, or when Rampage sells pieces for various tournaments and cash games. But Persson wants his opponents to be fully invested in the game so he'll have an edge even against more skilled players.  Sharelines Should poker players sell action in big cash games? It's the topic of the latest PokerNews The Muck.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBva2VybmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1L3RoZS1tdWNrLXNlbGxpbmctcGllY2VzLXBva2VyLTQzNTc3Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-10-01,Not Discerned,"{""Westfield"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 05:35:27,"It’s official, Bratz is back in the zeitgeist.  The resurgence of this franchise was brimming well before the 2022 console release of Bratz: Flaunt Your Fashion, with the brand’s official social media accounts amassing over 2.4 million followers combined in recent years. But the title’s positive reception amongst some mainstream gaming outlets serves as proof there are audiences hungry for content reminiscent of the formative media of their childhoods.  An audience so hungry I had to drive across several suburbs to obtain my copy of Flaunt Your Fashion, as two of my local stores were out of stock.  Bratz resonated with me so strongly growing up, as it was one of the first pieces of media that depicted young girls not only having the ability to become anything they wanted, but having fun in the process.  They were fashion designers, journalists, musicians, and great friends to one another, and the franchise represented an important means for me to playfully engage with and embrace themes surrounding ambition in girlhood.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  Dr Stephanie Harkin has beautifully highlighted how video games can be used as a vehicle for exploring girlhood and its complex coming-of-age themes. She explains how titles like Jane Friedhoff’s Lost Wage Rampage lean into rebellious gameplay to communicate how its protagonists re-empower themselves after discovering they are earning less than their male colleagues – describing it as a game that is as playful as it is political.  It’s valuable for young audiences to see these topics depicted in fun, relatable ways that don’t diminish their abilities to seriously discuss them in real-life contexts.  Read: What can games tell us about girlhood?  Passion for Fashion  The peak sales period of Bratz products, in the mid-2000s, also serves as an interesting case study when analysing the impact of media targeted at young girls, as the brand was popular amongst not just pre-teen age groups, but adolescent markets as well. Officially licensed homewares, video games, and film and television programs that went beyond traditional toys made Bratzseem not just appealing in a broader lifestyle context, but genuinely cool for consumers to engage with. ‘Girlhood’ was treated as a legitimate consumer product – and inadvertently, this allowed young girls to claim a sense of ownership of their interests.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  Old media lost to history reveals more about this style of marketing, as Girl Gamer – Nintendo’s mid-noughties published magazine, whilst promoting a somewhat oversimplified take on young girls’ overall engagement with games, did celebrate its readership and their uniquely ‘cool’ interests.  Pages stocked with ‘Who’s The Cutest?’ video game character listicles and ‘Extreme Makeover’ advertisements pushing the latest peripherals for the ‘rock chick’ could read as patronising. But I know for sure that my younger self would have taken pride in celebrating all of my interests through media that wasn’t shaming me for my passions.  This influence has followed me well into adulthood. I’ve adorned my current living space with Bratz memorabilia, filled my wardrobe with branded apparel, have regularly hosted Barbie and Bratz watch parties, and compared notes on Flaunt Your Fashion with friends who wouldn’t have otherwise played a new game that month, if it weren’t for its release.  None of this is performed as an act of irony. It’s genuine self-expression that brings me a real sense of joy to participate in.  frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  This sentiment is sometimes undervalued in a world that is becoming increasingly commercialised, and it’s challenging to make a compelling case for why a Bratz game holds weight in a games media landscape, as so much of the conversation is widely critical, from a technical standpoint.  Games like Flaunt Your Fashion should exist. The Bratz franchise has historically celebrated hyperfemininity and themes surrounding girlhood, and has never looked at how any of the characters present themselves through a shameful or humorous lens.  It has been a beacon of representation for so many young audiences who have carried values of playful femininity and ambition into their adult lives. It’s invaluable for young girls, in particular, to see these values represented positively in the games they play.  Image: Petoons Studio / Outright Games  In real-life contexts, audiences have reclaimed once derogatory terms heralded by a resurgence of noughties culture, and it’s empowered newer generations to embrace these ideals as a means for self-expression, and to challenge layers of internalised misogyny.  Senior Lecturer and Author Hannah McCann has also explained the broader impact of ‘Critical Femininities’ in academia, and how lovingly labelled movements like ‘Bimbo Feminism’ have given space for Bratz-adjacent media to be revisited in more progressive contexts.  There is by no means one set way to promote femininity, and it’s valid that not everyone chooses to adopt these traits in their own lives. Bratz is just one example of a franchise that makes it feel safe and fun for a lot of audiences to do so, and that’s something that shouldn’t be overlooked.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2JyYXR6LWZsYXVudC15b3VyLWZhc2hpb24tZ2FtZS1iaW1iby1mZW1pbmlzbS1lbXBvd2VybWVudC0yNjE2ODIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-15,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Fri 19 May 2023 01:47:50,"Square Enix officially shut down their popular mobile game, Echoes of Mana, on May 15.  By Jason Collins |  Just months after shutting down its Final Fantasy 7: The First Soldier, the now-controversial Square Enix decided to pull the plug on yet another video game. This time, the company is pulling a plug on Echoes of Mana, a mobile entry in the popular Mana gaming series—the official support ended on May 15, 2023, making the game inaccessible for players.  According to ComicBook.com, Square Enix announced the game’s official shutdown on May 15, though the plans for a shutdown were made public in February this year. The company expressed its gratitude to all players who joined in on the adventure. They haven’t offered any official reasons as to why Echoes of Mana was shut down.  They only linked to their original post regarding the end of service. So, the Echoes of Mana ended with a whimper, and only after a few years on the market. Such is the fate of live service games, and it makes the fans unhappy.  There’s a lot of disappointment surrounding the end of service for Echoes of Mana, but many fans actually expressed their gratitude to Square Enix for giving the game’s narrative a satisfying conclusion. Giving Echoes of Mana a satisfying conclusion is already more than most mobile games, and their fans can hope for these days. Still, despite being disheartened by the game’s shutdown, most of the fandom actually praised the various aspects of the game instead of expressing their frustration—well, at least it fared better than Marvel’s Avengers.  Of course, skeptics also raised their voices, stating that Echoes of Mana is among the few games in the series that haven’t been ported to other platforms, so this shutdown actually means that the game is likely to be lost to time for those who’d like to experience it. With that said, the Mana series also isn’t a stranger to remakes and re-releases, and given Square Enix’s money-grabbing tactics—with which they actually managed to “out-greed” Electronic Arts—bringing Echoes of Mana back from the video game cemetery isn’t so far-fetched.  The company that gave us Echoes of Mana, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts made a series of questionable decisions, which resulted in some abhorrent gaming titles, such as Marvel’s Avengers or an upcoming NFT video game with over 10,000 microtransactions. The latter will forever remain a testament to the fact that companies can’t just take a mediocre video game, slap a popular brand sticker on it, and expect the fans to love a gaming title that’s essentially ruined by greed.  Echoes of Mana is an entry in the Final Fantasy spin-off gaming series that began with Secret of Mana, released in 1998. That particular series subsequently spawned spin-offs of its own, growing into a full-fledged gaming series that initially launched on Android and iOS platforms. Echoes of Mana was the only one that was released as a free-to-play game supported by microtransactions, which is why it wasn’t ported to other platforms, and the reason for its shutdown might very well lie in poor profitability.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9nYW1lcy9zcXVhcmUtZW5peC1zaHV0LWRvd24tZ2FtZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Each one is easily worth their full MSRP, but right now, you won't even have to come close to paying that much to get them. That's because a special Metro Series Sale has officially kicked off on Steam, offering each title for massively reduced prices until May 25.  The highlight of the sale is an incredible deal for 85% off the Metro Saga Bundle, giving you access to Metro 2033 Redux, Metro: Last Light Redux, Metro Exodus, and each game's DLC for a jaw-dropping $12.49 (down from $84.96).  (opens in new tab) Metro Saga Bundle | $84.96 $12.49 at Steam (opens in new tab) For less than $15, you can get every Metro game and all of their DLCs while this sale is active.

In it, you'll explore the Moscow Metro tunnels and see what happened before the events of Metro Exodus.  (opens in new tab) Metro 2033 Redux | $19.99 $3.99 at Steam (opens in new tab) Metro 2033 is the game that started it all, and the Redux edition makes a slew of improvements much like Last Light's does. It's undeniably a classic, and will introduce players to the early days of Artyom's adventures both in the underground metro and on the irradiated post-nuclear surface.  Metro 2033 introduces players to the story and setting of Metro, putting them into the shoes of series protagonist Artyom. It tasks you with making your way through the underground Moscow Metro that various communities took shelter in when nuclear bombs fell in 2013, with occasional dead ends forcing you to ascend to the irradiated, mutant-infested surface. Your goal is to reach the metro's ""capital"" station of Polis — something you'll only be able to do with careful management of ammunition, gas mask filters, and other supplies — to get help and save Artyom's home station from mysterious supernatural dangers.  Metro: Last Light continues where the first game left off, with several of the metro's factions learning about a special military facility Artyom visited in the first game. You, along with ""Spartan"" peacekeeping companions, must travel through the tunnels and on the surface to discover their plans and stop them if possible. Then, in Metro Exodus, Artyom and the Spartans discover shocking information about the outside world and commandeer a train, exploring the Russian countryside.  Notably, the non-Redux Complete Edition of Metro: Last Light is free for a limited time on Steam, as the developers at 4A Games are celebrating the game's 10th Anniversary. If you download it now, you'll own it forever, even after the promotion ends on May 25.  All three of these games are phenomenal, though Metro Exodus is my favorite of the bunch. Between its fantastic storytelling, its engaging and polished non-linear open world gameplay, and its top-notch presentation, it's nothing short of a must-play masterpiece. Not only is Metro Exodus my favorite open world shooter, it's also one of the best PC games in recent memory.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvZ2V0LXRoZS1lbnRpcmUtbWV0cm8tZ2FtZS1zZXJpZXMtb24tc3RlYW0tZm9yLWFuLWluY3JlZGlibGUtODUtb2Zm0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 19:48:00,"Maybe Pete Alonso’s game-winning blast Wednesday night did finally get the Mets going.  After that thrilling comeback win, the Mets followed it up Thursday by beating the Rays, 3-2, giving them their first back-to-back victories in nearly a month.  And it came against the team with the best record in the sport.  “We needed it,’’ said David Robertson, who picked up the save at Citi Field. “It didn’t matter who we were playing. It just so happened we ran into the Rays, a hot team that’s been good all year. For us to be able to scratch two out of three [against them], it’s big for us and for our confidence.”  Once again, Alonso’s power played a big part in the win.  Despite being under the weather the past few days, the first baseman homered for a third straight game.  Pete Alonso hits a home run in the fourth inning of the Mets’ win over the Rays on May 18, 2023. Charles Wenzelberg/NY Post  His Thursday blast was his 16th of the season, tops in the majors.  “I want what he has,’’ Jeff McNeil joked of Alonso’s success despite not being 100 percent.  “If I’m out there, I’m gonna shoot my best bullet, always,’’ Alonso said. “I approach it like I normally do. … If I’m physically able, I’m willing to go. It’s something I take pride in.”  Even after Alonso’s homer, they needed another run to take the lead for good, and the go-ahead run came on a soft infield single by Tommy Pham in the sixth.  Tylor Megill pitched six strong innings before Brooks Raley and Jeff Brigham each tossed scoreless innings and Robertson closed it.  The Rays got to Megill quickly, as Josh Lowe led off the game with a double and moved to third on an infield single by Randy Arozarena.  Mets starter Tylor Megill pitching against the Rays on May 18, 2023. Charles Wenzelberg/NY Post  Lowe scored on a Harold Ramirez groundout, but Megill escaped further damage when Brandon Lowe grounded into a double play.  The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the inning with a Francisco Lindor walk, a single by McNeil and a walk to Alonso.  Lindor scored to tie the game on a Brett Baty groundout before Pham whiffed to end the inning.  Alonso put the Mets ahead in the fourth with his 446-foot blast to center.  Megill didn’t allow a hit after the first until Lowe’s two-out solo shot to center tied the game at 2-2 in the sixth.  With two on and two out, backup catcher Michael Perez caught Ramirez off first to end another Tampa Bay threat.  In the bottom of the inning, Pham came up with runners on the corners with one out after singles by McNeil and Baty against right-hander Zack Littell, and Pham’s dribbler to third did the job.  Robertson gave up a one-out double to Arozarena, but got Ramirez and Lowe to end the game.  The victory gave the Mets consecutive wins for the first time since winning two straight in San Francisco on April 20-21.  Tommy Pham notched a pair of hits and drove in a run on Thursday. Robert Sabo for NY Post  “We know we’re talented,’’ Alonso said. “Our talent has been here the entire year. It’s just a matter of performing and this performance against a high-quality opponent is a good sign for us. The past few weeks have been tough. You can’t deny that. Hopefully this is a springboard into the next series.”  That comes against the Guardians.  Asked if the series win and a couple of gritty victories over the Rays would provide a jolt to his team, Buck Showalter said, “We’ll see.”  “We have to turn the page,’’ the manager said. “There’s a long way to go and it starts again [Friday].”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L21ldHMtZmluYWxseS13aW4tY29uc2VjdXRpdmUtZ2FtZXMtYWdhaW4taW4tc2VyaWVzLXdpbi1vdmVyLXJheXMv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvbWV0cy1maW5hbGx5LXdpbi1jb25zZWN1dGl2ZS1nYW1lcy1hZ2Fpbi1pbi1zZXJpZXMtd2luLW92ZXItcmF5cy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Discovery said during a call that Mortal Kombat 12 would be coming this year. He did not give any details about what form the sequel would take. Then, earlier this month, MK social media accounts posted a video where a clock hand approached 12 and then skipped straight to number one.  Advertisement  Now, we’ve finally gotten confirmation that the highly anticipated sequel in the fighting game series is actually a reboot. It sort of makes sense, since Mortal Kombat 11 was centered on a struggle over the power of a magical hourglass, which the heroes canonically use to restore time. This game likely takes place during a new timeline, which gives NetherReam Studios more leeway to flex creatively on such an old and beloved game. These resets are something that the developers have been doing since MK 9, which is probably a smart decision considering the size of the series’ lore up to this point.  Mortal Kombat 1 will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and the Nintendo Switch on September 19. It will also mark the Switch’s second $70 game, following this month’s highly anticipated release of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

He’s played the game since he was young and even started his own YouTube channel, where he posts 2K-related content. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight But the most recent game, “NBA 2K23,” has shaken his faith.  “Before, I would say I wouldn’t ever leave 2k behind,” he said. “I still somewhat hold onto that thought process. If the trend continues this way with 2K, I could see a time in which I never play it again.”  Jones is not alone. “NBA 2K” fans aren’t happy about the state of the game, especially after developers posted their latest blog post Wednesday, sharing what’s coming in the next six weeks — or, as some fans said, what’s not coming. Mega-fans are concerned that the game isn’t giving them much to do and question whether it’s a sign that 2K isn’t listening to its community anymore.  Advertisement  “I think the community just wants the company to act like they care whatsoever about the consumer,” said Jones, who previously partnered with 2K through the company’s NextMakers initiative, a training program that gives creators access to 2K Games’ intellectual properties and professional development network.  Since “NBA 2K21,” the NBA 2K franchise has taken hints from other video games like “Fortnite” and “Call of Duty” by adding a seasons concept, where players can earn specific in-game rewards and items over a set course of time. (In “NBA 2K23,” seasons last every six weeks.)  The seasonal rewards are vital to one of the modes called “MyTeam,” in which gamers collect digital basketball cards of past, present and future NBA players that they can then use in the game. The digital cards are earned through playing the game, buying them on the game’s auction house or opening digital packs, which can be purchased with real money. A single pack costs about $5 and, on most occasions this year, offers less than a 2% chance at the most valuable cards, which have enhanced abilities in the game.  Advertisement  These packs appear to be the focus of the upcoming Season 7. According to the 2K blog post, the game will make 450 cards available in each new pack for the season. In addition, the packs will feature cards based on NBA players in the league’s playoffs, which began on April 15 and will conclude with the NBA Finals beginning on June 1. Much to the chagrin of fans, no specific events, challenges or in-game competitions to reward gamers (other than the typical seasonal rewards) were mentioned in the blog.  “Now it feels like the only reason to play the game is if you enjoy the thrill of gambling on packs,” said Mick Curley, a 26-year-old from Ireland who runs a YouTube channel under the name “DBG.”  Curley, something of a “NBA 2K” YouTube historian who records documentaries on each year’s games, said he won’t walk away from the game for now because he’s still creating content. “But I can’t see myself ever booting up 2K again” when he’s not running the channel, he added.  Advertisement  Hector Ostolaza, a 41-year-old Twitch streamer from Boston, said he was “anticipating disappointment” from the Season 7 blog post, “and my expectation was right.”  That’s a problem, he said, because it seems 2K wants to “engage less” with fans and not participate in “the general discourse regarding their game.”  One of the biggest issues, Ostolaza said, is that the best player cards are unlocked in the digital packs — not from playing the game. If something is earned through playing the game, it can’t compete with what you may earn in packs.  “Our time is not being rewarded, and neither is our dollar, frankly,” he said, citing the poor odds of the packs.  The 2K community will “get fed up” if there’s more of the same, Ostolaza said. “I’m already less engaged in the game, and many others are in the same boat. The user base feels like it’s being taken advantage of and taken for granted.”  Advertisement  Michael Knight, 29, of Prince George’s County, Md., said he didn’t have a negative reaction to the blog “because I don’t have high expectations for 2K anymore.”  “It honestly felt like they gave up,” he said. “The company shows they don’t care about their product at all and it’s become just too much honestly.”  But Knight may not walk away yet, because “2K still gives me those moments where I feel like this is the best basketball game I’ve ever played.”  The NBA 2K franchise is still played by millions worldwide. The company’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an earnings call Wednesday that “NBA 2K23” has sold more than 11 million units — a record for the series, he said — and had its highest-ever sales of virtual currency, too (which is used for buying packs, accessories and more). The game has about 2.3 million daily active users, he said.  Tyler DeBondt, a 23-year-old YouTube creator and two-time winner of NBA 2K’s online tournament, said 2K needs to address its fan base.  “2K needs to realize that the community and our thoughts are important and should be taken into consideration instead of pushing us away,” he said.  A 2K Games spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

game,2023-05-13,Not Discerned,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 06:09:07,"The Panthers outlast the Hurricanes in a marathon Game 1 as Matthew Tkachuk scores the winning goal in quadruple overtime.  RALEIGH, N.C. -- — Back and forth they went, the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes playing a game that seemed destined to have no end while leaving legs growing wobbly with each passing minute.  Then, just as the teams appeared headed for yet another extra period, Matthew Tkachuk pounced on his chance to finish off yet another overtime and road victory for the Panthers in these playoffs.  Tkachuk beat Frederik Andersen in the final seconds of the fourth overtime to give the Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Hurricanes early Friday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final.  Tkachuck took a feed from Sam Bennett after Florida won a battle for the puck as Carolina tried to clear it from the zone, then whipped a shot from the right circle past Andersen with 12.7 seconds left.  That sent Tkachuck racing toward center ice to celebrate with teammates in what turned into the longest game in either franchises' history, as well as the sixth-longest game in NHL history.  “Definitely, tired but I think you're less tired when you win,” Tkachuk said, adding: “I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game, because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch.”  Florida won its seventh straight road game in these playoffs and improved to 5-0 in overtime. Game 2 is Saturday night in Raleigh, less than 48 hours after the teams played more than two full games worth of hockey.  This one ended roughly six hours after the puck drop.  “We didn't even know what overtime we were in,” Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said.  Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe scored in regulation for the Panthers, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 63 saves in what turned into a goaltender battle as the game got more ragged and players racked up the ice time.  Andersen finished with 57 saves for Carolina, which got power-play goals from Seth Jarvis and Stefan Noesen.  “It was a good goalie battle,” Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. “It was unfortuante we just couldn't find one.”  Tkachuk finally ended a game that had multiple wild sequences in critical late moments.  Most notably, there was Lomberg appearing to have the winning goal in his return to Florida’s lineup from injury, beating Jalen Chatfield in a battle and then whipping the puck by Andrersen 2 1/2 minutes into the first OT.  But Carolina successfully challenged the play for goaltender interference. Replays showed Florida’s Colin White — while being bumped by Carolina’s Jack Drury — making skate-to-skate contact with Andersen, then bumping him as Andersen ended up on all fours on the other side of the crease before Lomberg’s shot found the net.  Later in that first OT, Jarvis — who had the game’s first goal on a power-play blast from the slot — nearly ended it on a loose rebound but rang the crossbar.  It turned out, the game was nowhere near its epic finish.  Florida hadn’t been to an Eastern Conference final since 1996, before a large chunk of its roster had even been born. But these Panthers had turned a late surge to qualify for the final wild-card spot into a postseason-shaking moment by taking down Boston following the Bruins’ record-setting 65 wins and 135 points, followed by beating a Toronto team buzzing off its first series win in nearly two decades.  Now the Panthers have handed the Hurricanes — who had the league's second-best regular-season record — their first series deficit of the postseason.  Carolina is in the Eastern final for the second time in five years. The last time, it was a feel-good surprise for a young core that had just ended a nine-year postseason drought. They had since accomplished the goal of building a consistent winner and Cup contender, though second-round exits the past two seasons on home ice had cast a damper on some of that sustained success.  This time, Carolina beat the New York Islanders in six games and then the New Jersey Devils in five to make it back. But on a night when both teams had plenty of chances to end this one in any of the OTs, Carolina ended up losing its ninth straight game in the conference-final round dating to 2009 in brutal fashion.  “It was kind of really who was going to make the last mistake,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “Unfortunately, it was us.”  LONGEST GAME  The longest game in NHL history came on March 24, 1936, when the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1-0 in the sixth overtime on Mud Bruneteau’s goal at 116 minutes, 30 seconds of extra play.  FRANCHISE MARKS  Florida’s previous record for longest game was 104:31 in Game 4 of the 1996 Stanley Cup final against Colorado. Carolina’s previous record was 114:47 for Game 3 of the 2002 Stanley Cup final. The teams each lost those games.  SEMIFINAL SKID  Carolina's losing streak in the NHL semifinals dates to Pittsburgh's sweep of the Hurricanes in 2009 when Maurice was in his second stint as Carolina's coach. Boston then swept the Hurricanes a decade later.  WELCOME BACK  Both teams welcomed back forwards from lengthy injuries.  Carolina’s Teuvo Teravainen hadn’t played since suffering what the team described as a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders. The injury required surgery on April 20 and left him with a scar running the length of his left thumb.  Lomberg had missed eight straight games due to an upper-body injury.  ------  Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap  ------  AP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmhsL3JlY2FwP2dhbWVJZD00MDE1NDg0MzHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

In addition to Dispigna and Giesler, Kristian Campbell and Jackson Finley led the way with two hits apiece, while Jake DeLeo also turned in a hit.  On the mound, starter RHP Luke Schmolke (6-4) took the loss, struggling in the first four innings to allow eight runs on six hits.

A release date has just been announced for episode 1 of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, a game that follows the early exploits of Camina Drummer before the start of The Expanse show.  We’ve been hearing rumbles about The Expanse: A Telltale Series for a while, but now we actually know when we’ll get to play it: the first episode releases on July 27.  The Expanse video game is coming in July!  Telltale Games famously made a run of Game of Thrones narrative video games back in the day, which forced players to make difficult choices with long-lasting repercussions. We can expect that trend to continue in The Expanse: A Telltale Series, which will see Drummer and her Belter scavenger crew explore wrecked starships, survive mutinies, and more. Drummer was played by actor Cara Gee in the Amazon series, and Gee will be returning to the role for the Telltale game.  The Expanse: A Telltale Series is being produced by Telltale Games and Deck Nine Games in association with Alcon Television Group. It marks the first new game series from Telltale following a restructure of the company in 2019, and from the early footage we’ve seen, it looks really promising. Drummer will have to utilize iconic Expanse tech like mag boots to traverse wrecks, as well as make the sorts of tough decisions Telltale is known for. Remember when Drummer had to make a split-second decision to amputate one of her polyamorous crewmate’s arms in season 6 of the TV show? Expect more of that sort of stuff in the Telltale game.  In addition to the base game, the release date press announcement also promises DLC (downloadable content) down the road. So not only are we getting the base game with Drummer and her crew, but it sounds like there are even more plans for The Expanse: A Telltale Series after the main story concludes.  The Expanse: A Telltale Series Episode 1 releases on July 27 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC via the Epic Games Store. Four more episodes will follow, with a new one being released every two weeks. Mark your calendars, Beltalowdas!

Game 3, if needed, will follow 30 minutes after that.  “That was a really good game,” said Forsan coach Shanna Taylor, who will retire after 18 years at FHS at the conclusion of this season. “Bangs is really scrappy, but our team has a lot of fight in them and a lot of grit, so I was glad to see them come back and fight for that win.”  You need to be logged in to view the rest of the content.

As reported by NME, the upcoming reality show based on the popular Netflix show Squid Game will give 456 people the chance to win $4.56 million, though no specific premiere date was shared.  “The worst fate is going home empty-handed,” Netflix said when it was announced, making clear the reality show wouldn't be as intense as the original series.. However, they will still be competing in a series of ruthless children’s games, much like the original show.  “Squid Game took the world by storm with director Hwang’s captivating story and iconic imagery. We’re grateful for his support as we turn the fictional world into reality in this massive competition and social experiment,” said Netflix VP of unscripted and documentary deries Brandon Riegg.  The show hasn't been without controversy, however. Squid Game: The Challenge has already come under fire after a report alleged “inhumane conditions” for contestants.  During filming in a former aircraft hanger outside London, contestants faced freezing temperatures and fatigue after being woken up at 3:30 am. They remained on set for nine hours, unable to move for lengthy periods of time due to the specific game they were playing.  Other reports allege that at least 10 contestants collapsed during filming, while contestants claimed they were getting injured shortly after filming began. Medics were called to the set repeatedly with one contestant referring to the show as a “warzone”.  “The second time the song played, I saw in my left peripheral vision that this girl was swaying,” they claimed. “Then she just buckled, and you could hear her head actually hit the ground. But then someone came on the [microphone] and said to hold our positions because the game is not paused. After that, people were dropping like flies.”  Squid Game: The Challenge will feature multiple games across ten episodes, with a series of challenges inspired by the original show along with some “surprising new additions”.

Cheerful laughter and banter rung around the tables after the announcer gave all the COVID hygiene announcements.

Walter Ward, 51, started playing the game around the end of 2003 when it became popular here in the United States. He remembered that his son, who primarily was into Pokemon, developed an interest in Yu-Gi-Oh when the anime was released for western audiences.  “I got into the game with my son,” said Ward. “I learned how to play with him.”  He believes that the stores where the trading card community thrives are great places to meet new people and feel welcomed no matter a person’s background. Also, part of the fun is the competitiveness that these games promote.  The impact of the trading card scene spans worldwide, and has shuffled around the Jersey shore for decades. Magic the Gathering was the first of its kind, started in 1993 and going strong today. It incorporates fantasy worlds similar to Dungeons & Dragons. Pokemon is another popular one, where players collect and duel with “pocket monsters,” just like in the show. Many other licensed properties, from Star Wars to My Little Pony, have been adapted to card games.  Multiple stores around our county give access to enthusiasts of all ages and backgrounds to express their hobbies by trading, collecting, building decks, and then challenging each other with a healthy dose of competitiveness and the occasional saltiness.  Trading card games also help to improve a good bit of tactical thinking, math, and imagination skills due to their spectacular art.  Joseph Coppinger, 22, who started playing when he was 10 years old, shared how he was enamored by how cool the monster cards looked, and that everyone can play their own deck.  When it comes to beginners starting out in the game, Coppinger and Ward share similar advice for new players. When newcomers find something that they like and want to play with, they should stick with it and take the steps until they learn how to play it with ease.  Tournament events provided by the local game stores are the perfect spot for beginners to get a grasp on the game, Cottinger said. During those events, they will be able to see players using different decks and tactics, as well as meet new people. Most stores post their gaming schedule online or in the shop.  A piece of advice he also gives out to parents who might have kids that are interested in the game: “Let them go to events and talk to people… let them have fun,” said Cottinger.  Just like Ward enjoys spending quality father-son time with his boy while playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, he suggests that this can be a great way for parents to get involved with their kids.  And while it might be a challenge at the very start of a person’s dueling journey due to a learning curve, the trading card scene here at the shore has created a close-knit community where everyone is welcome.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplcnNleXNob3Jlb25saW5lLmNvbS9icmljay9nYW1lLWRheS1mb3ItamVyc2V5LXNob3Jlcy1tYWdpY2FsLWNvbW11bml0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Sony was having some problems with PlayStation Plus games this week. Commenters in forum posts on Reddit, ResetEra and NeoGAF reported various users being alerted to a notification, reading, “The game will expire in 15 minutes,” and then booting them to the PlayStation home screen. Engadget’s Kris Holt also ran into the issue Wednesday evening while playing Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. However, as of Friday, Sony appears to have fixed the issue.  Users experiencing the glitch said it appeared to happen with any game in the PS Plus catalog. Fortunately, you could still return to the game from the home screen and quickly continue playing. However, the cycle would repeat in regular 15-minute (and possibly other) increments.  It isn’t yet clear how widespread the issue was. (Even before PlayStation stepped in, some users in the Reddit post claimed they were playing PS Plus games without seeing the alert.) Additionally, the bug didn’t have any known fixes, leaving us to wait for PlayStation to step in. We reached out to the company for comment, but it appears to have fixed the issue without publicly acknowledging it.

game,2023-05-17,Not Discerned,"{""Leominster"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 09:03:30,"LEOMINSTER — Here be dragons.  A first-of-its-kind game is coming to the city for live-action play.  “The Quest for the Golden Keys” is an enchanting adventure game setting players on a medieval quest based in the Renaissance. There are eight physical activity games (including an obstacle course and archery) plus riddles to solve over the course of an hour, some of which involve dragons. Players who find and score on the Golden Keys can double their points.  The decor is handmade and hand-painted with mostly wood, stain, and other basic materials to be kept as realistic to the Renaissance as possible. It’s themed like a medieval castle with amazing dragon artwork on the walls.  Games are a medieval twist on yard games and some are completely original, with a cohesive storyline and period music playing for ambiance, so players really become immersed in being a knight.  It doesn’t have to be a one-time thing — participants can return to play the game over and over to compete with friends or improve their personal best. It’s also very family-friendly — ages six and up are recommended, but younger children can participate with a larger group.  The new game is a collaboration between Live Action Escapes in Worcester and The Gate Escape in Leominster. Michael Paquette and Rene Sorette, the respective owners, have been long-time friends.  “They met for the first time at an escape room owners’ meet-up in 2016. They learned very quickly that as much of a competitive business escape rooms are, the owners are also a community of entrepreneurs and artists working together to grow the escape room industry … if players experience the games that one company currently offers, why not send them to go play the games enjoyed at other escape rooms?” said Sabrina Paquin, office manager at Live Action Escapes.  Sharing a game was a natural extension. With “Quest for the Golden Keys”, The Gate Escape had the location providing enough space at 375 Harvard St. in Leominster and Live Action Escapes had the game.  The quest started as a portable rental, a replayable game option offered by Live Action Escapes to accommodate extra-large group events that were too big for their business location.  It now has grown in its permanent base and takes up a 3600 square foot room at The Gate Escape, with alterations and improvements to better fit the new room and improve the overall experience to fit the new location.  But they have other games that can still be rented as portable games to people looking to bring escape games home or to a different venue.  Escape games have grown in popularity since Live Action Escapes and The Gate Escape both started in 2016 with 45-minute games. The former was the 129th escape room in the U.S., and now there are thousands.  “Escape rooms are a fun way to get people together and do something different! They require you to think outside the box and let your imagination run wild. There are endless possibilities in how a puzzle could be solved. Really challenging your brain in ways everyday life might not. These types of games also promote good problem-solving skills, out-of-the-box thinking, and teamwork. You’re stuck in a room with a group of people, whether you know them all or not, you will work together to achieve the same goal, and win!”, said Amanda Paquin, general manager of Live Action Escapes.  She continued, “The setting, solving the puzzles, and the time limit releases dopamine, known as the ‘happy hormone.’ So when you unlock something, that ‘ah ha!’ exciting moment lifts your mood and plays a role in your ability to think, focus, and plan. Escape rooms aren’t just fun, they’re good for your brain!”  Both companies also have other escape games at their respective locations, intricately designed with their own storylines and objectives, usually meant to be completed within a sixty-minute limit, and built by them. All different, but mostly an investigation or mystery.  “The Quest for the Golden Keys” is different because it has more of a “faire or field day” said Amanda, with players competing against each other to score points rather than a typical escape room experience with a team objective, “giving each player a chance to hone their skills” every time they play.  Normally, employees at escape rooms are called the “Game Masters” but at this new game they’ll be “Quest Masters.” They greet players, give them instructions, answer questions, monitor the game, check on activity stations, and give clues as needed to make sure things are running smoothly.  They also reset the game for its next players, which can take only eight minutes for those who know how the game plays and its answers well and have memorized all the passcodes for the locks, but sometimes a group can check or move everything, and then it can take a lot longer.  “With the theme of the game, fans of Renaissance fairs and medieval roleplaying games would [especially] have a blast,” Sabrina said, but “everyone should play at least once.”  The game can accommodate up to 40 players per hour, making it ideal for large groups such as scout troops, family reunions, or a work team-building event.  Game stations require some physical activity like walking, talking, and using a bow, so if groups have players with physical limitations they should reach out before making a reservation to ensure everyone will be able to get the most out of the game.  They have plans to rotate and add stations to keep things “fresh and interesting” and repeatedly playable, Amanda said. “We designed a place that we would want to go!”  The new quest will open on Friday, June 2. Reservations opened on Wednesday, May 17 on questforthegoldenkeys.com. It will run indefinitely year-round.  More new games are to come from both companies, separately and together, in even more locations. In fact, Live Action Escapes will soon open a second location in Worcester with four escape room games, an art gallery featuring local artists, and a new original experience called “SmashLanes.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnRpbmVsYW5kZW50ZXJwcmlzZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOC9saXZlLWFjdGlvbi1yb2xlLXBsYXlpbmctZ2FtZS1maW5kcy1wZXJtYW5lbnQtaG9tZS1pbi1sZW9taW5zdGVy0gF2aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VudGluZWxhbmRlbnRlcnByaXNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2xpdmUtYWN0aW9uLXJvbGUtcGxheWluZy1nYW1lLWZpbmRzLXBlcm1hbmVudC1ob21lLWluLWxlb21pbnN0ZXIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

After a disappointing 4-6 road trip, the Rays are looking to regroup Friday night as they open a three-game series with the Milwaukee Brewers in St. Petersburg, Fla.  ""We just have to move on,"" Rays outfielder Josh Lowe said. ""We'll come out (Friday) and get back after it.""  The Rays dropped two of three at the New York Mets, including a 3-2 setback on Thursday afternoon. Lowe was a bright spot at the plate, collecting a double and home run.  ""I'm just trying to stay within myself,"" Lowe said postgame Thursday. ""Like I've been saying all year -- just get good pitches to hit, and putting good swings on those pitches over the plate.""  Tampa Bay opens a 10-game homestand after being on the road for 10 days.  Shane McClanahan (7-0, 2.34 ERA) will be on the mound for the Rays. The left-hander has never faced Milwaukee.  The Brewers will turn to right-hander Adrian Houser (0-0, 5.19), who has never pitched against Tampa Bay.  Losing close ones was the story for the Rays on the road. They dropped five by one run and the other by two.  ""Two or three games didn't go our way,"" manager Kevin Cash said. ""We were close in a couple, but close doesn't necessarily cut it.""  In recent games, Tampa Bay witnessed one of its top players start to snap out of a slump. Brandon Lowe entered the series with the Mets in a 4-for-48 skid, but in the first two games at New York, he went 4-for-8 with a home run.  For Milwaukee, Houser opened the season on the 15-day injured list due to a right groin strain, and he made his season debut on May 7. This will be his third start, and he has yet to complete five full innings. In his first outing, he worked 4 2/3 innings, and he went four innings in his last outing, a no-decision against the Kansas City Royals.  The Brewers head to Tampa Bay after dropping two of three at the St. Louis Cardinals. The club had a day off Thursday, which gave them a chance to regroup.  Against the Cardinals, the Brewers scored four runs in three games, and endured a tough 18-1 loss on Monday. After pulling off a 3-2 win on Tuesday, Milwaukee was blanked 3-0 on Wednesday.  ""They outplayed us,"" Brewers right-hander Corbin Burns told MLB.com. ""They smacked us around the first night, we responded well (on Tuesday) night and then we came out and played flat.""

The Brewers, one of the serious contenders to win the National League Central, have been like many of the anticipated favorites this season. They haven't put it all together yet.  ""We have stretches where we play really well, and then we have stretches where we come out and play flat and lose some series that we probably shouldn't lose,"" Burns said. ""We'll regroup.

game,2018-12-05,Not Discerned,"{""Kyoto"", ""Kyoto"", ""Japan""}",Thu 18 May 2023 19:07:32,"Nintendo’s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom—the latest iteration of a series created in 1986—is likely the Game of the Year. You may have seen it on the front page of The New York Times or you may have bought one of the 10 million copies it sold in its first three days. For my book All Your Base Are Belong to Us, Shigeru Miyamoto told me he was inspired to create the series after remembering a scouting field trip he took as a child near his home in Kyoto. Tears of the Kingdom comes almost 40 years after the original, and its brilliance is that the hundreds who worked on it know precisely how to lure players into fantasy worlds of excitement and emotion.  That’s seen from moment one when the series leads, elf-human Link and Princess Zelda, find themselves in the murky, subterranean gloom beneath Hyrule castle, where the young royal has been told never to tread. Armed with a torch and descending into the depths (the single piano notes rising in tension with every step), the two discover hieroglyphics which begin to explain the kingdom’s violent history. Immediately, you know you have to solve the mystery of the Hyrulian ages.  It’s happily unusual that Zelda is with you to begin the story. Often, she’s in the background or needs to be found and saved. But now, she’ll share the adventure! Silent, never-speaking Link will have a smart, loquacious pal. Only just as you settle into having a constant partner in crime, she’s taken away by evil forces. In an apocalyptic tragedy of bright red fire and earthquakes, she begins to fall into nothingness. Link reaches out for her, but can’t grasp her hand. (In fact, Link’s right hand seems to be damaged.) Once again, as through video game time immemorial, you must save the princess.  You want to. It’s set up that way. In these first minutes, the game makers have assembled a human bond. Zelda is an intelligent but caring friend, not royalty as much as a peer. There’s a need to find this important compatriot.  After ascending the rocky steps to daylight with a new arm that has a number of powers to unlock, you take a leap off a cliff, a seeming swan dive of doom. Descending from high above through the clouds feels a little like the start of a quick game of Fortnite, but there’s no fighting against 100 others to be the last one standing. It’s just you as Link landing with a loud splash into a lake, which also protects you from enemies while you swim. That descent isn’t Nintendo lifting an idea. It’s Nintendo reinventing the best to create something new that fits perfectly.  There’s also a riff on Minecraft and Roblox present in the vast kingdom of Hyrule: players craft things to move forward. The Ultrahand, your bionic appendage, leads you to lift massive things like walls, put things together, even make weapons. Toys and games that involve making things have been around since well before Lincoln Logs were invented more than a century ago — kids have used sticks for games since prehistoric times. The thing is, no matter if it’s the Fallout or Borderlands series, I’m not a fan of taking the time to construct items to help solve puzzles or beat ever-present forces of evil. I like pushing boxes around to make steps. That’s as far as it goes. Especially in a world as immense as this I want to get to the adventure and explore the expanse of new lands. I also want to listen to the subtle but perfectly spare soundtrack, reminiscent of early Laurie Anderson.  Putting three logs together to cross a broken bridge, as Tears of the Kingdom asks, takes too much time. I’d rather learn about the lore of Hyrule by talking to its varied, often lovable residents. The tales they tell are nuanced and considerable. It seems like every non-playable character has a personalized, compelling story. That’s what kept me going in “Elden Ring,” the wildly idiosyncratic denizens.  Not wanting to create my own things in Zelda may make me sound lazy, or maybe like I don’t want to think while playing. Rather, it’s that I prefer thinking in a different way about the world within Tears of the Kingdom. I got used to my tasks, but using Ultrahand took me out of Hyrule for just a little too long. And placing the items I made I encountered a spatial issue that sometimes led me to drop, say, a sailboat, over a precipice and into the nothingness of sky.  It’s easy enough to get back into Tears of the Kingdom with its puzzles, demons, and layers of Hyrule, the Surface, the Sky and the Depths. While riding vehicles like rockets in the sky is fun, I still like the terra firma best. Peppered throughout is something of a pastoral essence with frogs, birds—all manner of flora and fauna. You notice purple smoke, signals of colorful Great Fairy Fountains, first introduced in Breath of the Wild, but made more beautiful here. These allow you to upgrade your weapons.  The dazzling lands and varied residents along the way keep you going through scores of hours. It makes the price increase to $70 worth it. The successful recipe includes the right amount of humor and nods to other forms of ancient and pop culture. For instance, the one-hour final boss battle is called The Menace Unleashed, an homage to the Star Wars series. But it’s not George Lucas. It’s dreamy and celestial, this battle of all Zelda battles. At the end, without revealing spoilers, it isn’t a castle or kingdom which indicates great wealth or power. It’s something between Zelda and Link, the bond that survives. It’s not corny, not cliche. It’s just about the richness of love and friendship.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvdGhlLWxlZ2VuZC1vZi16ZWxkYS10ZWFycy1vZi10aGUta2luZ2RvbS1yZXZpZXctbGlrZWx5LXRoZS1nYW1lLW9mLXRoZS15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2020-05-19,Not Discerned,"{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 00:41:25,"Take-Two has claimed that it’s not seeing consumer resistance to its games being priced at $70.  During the company’s earnings call on Wednesday, one analyst said there were recent examples of unnamed Take-Two competitors offering discounts on some AAA games “within days and weeks” of their release.  Over two years since the $70 price point was adopted by some publishers for their current-gen games, are players still struggling to come to terms with it somewhat, they asked.  Lego 2K Drive | Director's Cut Reveal Trailer | Coming May 19  “We’re not seeing a pushback on frontline price,” Zelnick responded (transcribed by VGC). “What we’re seeing is consumers are seeking to limit their spending by going either to the stuff they really, really care about, blockbusters, or to value, and sometimes it could be both. And the good news is, we have a bunch of blockbusters and we have a wonderful catalogue.”  One recent example of a Take-Two release that failed to meet expectations was Marvel’s Midnight Suns. It came out last December priced at $70 on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and $60 on PC, but the publisher discounted all versions of the game by 33% a month after release.  “The other news is we have a robust frontline release schedule and without regard to price, there has been some pressure, as a result, if a consumer sees something that’s interesting but not necessarily yet a huge blockbuster,” Zelnick continued.  “We think that will change. This is a growth business, and this is a unique market, and nothing that’s going on now is inconsistent with the view that we outlined during the pandemic. We said at that time that we were benefitting greatly from people being at home due to an odd turn of events.  “And we set out expectations that post-pandemic, we as an industry would be at a better place than pre-pandemic, and at a worse place than during a time when people were sheltering at home. And that’s exactly what’s happened, exacerbated by a challenging, mixed economy, and what I believe is a recession, at least if you look at it through the lens of people who purvey digital entertainment consumed at home and ecommerce suppliers, there’s a lot of pressure in those markets.”  In August 2020, Take-Two’s NBA 2K21 was announced as the first current-gen game to be priced at $70. Sony and Activision also decided to charge $70 for their big new releases at the start of the current console cycle.  EA and Square Enix soon followed suit, with the Final Fantasy publisher even bringing the new price point to some of its PC games.  Microsoft and Nintendo released their first $70 games this month. Ubisoft has said its long-delayed Skull & Bones will be its first $70 title, and Sega recently said it was considering raising game prices too.  Zelnick said on Wednesday that Rockstar owner Take-Two is forecasting a sharp jump in sales during its fiscal year starting in April 2024, driven by the release of “several groundbreaking titles that we believe will set new standards in our industry”.  He also said he thinks it’s likely there’ll be mid-generation console refreshes during the current cycle, and discussed Take-Two’s plans to continue supporting Switch and last-gen consoles",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpZGVvZ2FtZXNjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL25ld3MvdGFrZS10d28tc2F5cy1pdHMtbm90LXNlZWluZy1wdXNoYmFjay1mcm9tLXBsYXllcnMtb24tNzAtZ2FtZS1wcmljaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-18,13:00:00,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 20:45:07,"Steamforged Games, the British company behind tabletop crossovers like Elden Ring: The Board Game and Dark Souls: The Roleplaying Game launched and successfully funded a new product Thursday. The Kickstarter campaign for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne The Board Game began at 1 p.m. EDT and has already crossed the finish line with the equivalent of more than $620,000 pledged. The campaign runs through June 1, with an estimated delivery date of November 2024.  The announcement and successful funding of Iceborne comes amid a flurry of news about Steamforged. On Monday, the company said that it had completed shipment of the last 174 copies of Monster Hunter World: The Board Game to eager backers around the world. Then, on Tuesday, Dicebreaker reported that the company had previously laid off some 20% of its staff in March of this year. Steamforged characterized that move as a restructuring, not a sign of financial weakness. The company quickly bounced back Thursday morning by announcing a long-term, four-game partnership with Kickstarter — a first-of-its-kind partnership for the Brooklyn-based crowdfunding pioneer. Steamforged simultaneously launched and funded Iceborne.  Steamforged burst onto the scene in 2016 with Dark Souls: The Board Game. It went on to stack one success on top of the other, using Kickstarter to promote and successfully fund many more video game crossover titles inspired by Resident Evil, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Monster Hunter. It’s biggest misstep, however, has been with the Dark Souls tabletop RPG. The initial print run of the book was so riddled with errors and inaccuracies that the company opted to reprint the book free of charge for its most loyal early adopters.  According to Steamforged and Kickstarter’s joint announcement, the partnership between the two companies will include “collaborating on educational content for emerging games creators as a way to support the next generation of tabletop publishers.”  Kickstarter used the occasion to push back against the idea that Kickstarter is, in some way, detrimental to the ongoing health of small businesses, creating a boom-and-bust revenue cycle that many creators have mentioned to Polygon in the past.  “There’s a common misconception that creators need to ‘graduate’ from Kickstarter but, especially in the tabletop industry, that isn’t the case,” Kickstarter’s chief strategy officer Jon Leland said in the company’s blog post. “This partnership with one of our biggest tabletop games publishers is a testament to the fact that Kickstarter can be part of an ongoing business model that works beyond initial success. This is the first time we’ve done a partnership like this and we’re hoping to continue finding impactful and creative ways to deepen our relationships with creators of all sizes, across all categories.”  Tabletop games remain the single largest source of crowdfunding income for Kickstarter, comprising roughly one third of its total revenue from backers. In 2022 the company saw the first decline in tabletop revenues since 2014.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbHlnb24uY29tLzIzNzI4OTgzL21vbnN0ZXItaHVudGVyLXdvcmxkLWljZWJvcm5lLWtpY2tzdGFydGVyLWxheW9mZnMtc3RlYW1mb3JnZWTSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2x5Z29uLmNvbS9wbGF0Zm9ybS9hbXAvMjM3Mjg5ODMvbW9uc3Rlci1odW50ZXItd29ybGQtaWNlYm9ybmUta2lja3N0YXJ0ZXItbGF5b2Zmcy1zdGVhbWZvcmdlZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

So certainly a three-game series against each other ought to have both teams figuring this would be a good time to make some gains. Those matchups begin Friday night in Washington.  The Nationals return home with a three-game losing streak after they were swept in a series at Miami. They lost those three games by a total of four runs.  ""We've got to stay with the good things we did and turn the page (Friday),"" Nationals third baseman Jeimer Candelario said. ""At home, we've got to dominate from the first inning to the ninth.""  The Tigers had an off day Thursday for their second idle day of the week. They went 2-3 on a five-game homestand that ended with Wednesday's 8-0 setback to the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Detroit has been a shutout victim in three of its last seven games. The offense continues to take untimely dips, squashing momentum that tends to be building.  ""We're not all where we need to be yet,"" Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. ""We've got to do a lot of work, but the vibe is great.""  Center fielder Matt Vierling had the Tigers' only hit in Wednesday's game. Detroit has been so mundane offensively that only one batter in its most recent game finished with a batting average above .250 for the season.  The Tigers will try to get going against Nationals rookie right-hander Jake Irvin (1-1, 4.11 ERA).  This will be Irvin's fourth big-league appearance since he was called up from Triple-A Syracuse. His only rough outing was the most recent one, when he suffered the loss to the New York Mets, allowing six runs in 4 2/3 innings.  Still, Irvin's contributions have been important across the past couple of weeks.  ""Jake has done well,"" manager Davey Martinez said. ""I want to continue to get him an opportunity. ... With some of our young guys, the innings are going to build up.""  Until splitting with Pittsburgh, the Tigers had won all four series this season against National League opponents.  Those results might bode well for this upcoming season, and they've also put Detroit in a decent situation a month and a half into the season.  ""As we've won a little bit more, I've seen a great spirit and personality on this team build,"" Hinch said.  Left-hander Matthew Boyd (2-3, 6.47 ERA) of the Tigers will try to get back on track. He had a rough stint last Friday, giving up six runs -- five earned -- in 1 1/3 innings to the Seattle Mariners.  Boyd has pitched in 166 career games in the major leagues, but none of those has come against the Nationals. He has only pitched for American League teams.  Joey Meneses had one of the most productive bats in Washington's lineup in last weekend's home series, but he's absent for now as he was placed on the paternity list. That makes it uncertain when he might return to the lineup. His nine-game hitting streak ended Tuesday before he missed the past two games.  --Field Level Media            Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9iYXNlYmFsbC90aWdlcnMtbmF0aW9uYWxzLWVhY2gtc2VlLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LXVwY29taW5nLTMtZ2FtZS1zZXJpZXMtMjAyMy0wNS0xOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

About a month later, Kings sharpshooter Kevin Huerter looked back on Curry’s historic performance and admitted that it played a part in slowly breaking Sacramento’s spirit before being eliminated.  “In the fourth quarter, I think what broke our spirit, like as they continued to make shots -- tough shots -- we weren’t making the ones that we were used to making and we were turning the ball over,” Huerter said on a recent episode of “The Old Man and the Three,"" which was released Thursday.  “And so it was like we wanted it so bad, especially in that fourth quarter trying to make a run, and not shooting well and it was like, ‘Alright, at some point, we’re going to see one go down, we’re going to get a turnover and go on a mini run.'

So I wouldn’t say our spirit broke until we knew, I think when [Kings coach] Mike [Brown] took us out at the end of the game and they just put in our subs and that was it.”  Curry finished the game with 50 points, eight rebounds and six assists on 20-of-38 shooting from the field and 7 of 18 from 3-point range, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50 points in a Game 7 until Boston Celtics star forward Jayson Tatum dropped 51 against the Philadelphia 76ers two weeks later.  Huerter called Curry’s performance “unbelievable” and said Golden State’s ability to get hot at any given moment and go on a deep run was a focus for Sacramento heading into the game.  “Add Klay [Thompson] to that bunch, when Steph gets going it feels like Klay always has a 3 mixed in there too, and Jordan Poole has the ability to do it at times. But for us, it was not letting them get to that point.  “That was a big emphasis for us, especially going on the road, if they make a 3, we need to score a layup on the other end every time they make a 3, cause they’re going to make one and they’re going to celebrate, they’re going to point to the crowd, and if we can lay the ball in, that’ll break their spirit.  “But Golden State is just known to do that. When they go on those runs, they’re impossible to stop.”  Even though their game plan fell apart in their final game of the season, the Kings learned their lessons. Surely, this won't be the last time these teams meet.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vYmF5YXJlYS9raW5ncy9ob3ctc3RlcGgtY3Vycnktd2FycmlvcnMtYnJva2Uta2luZ3Mtc3Bpcml0LWdhbWUtNy1rZXZpbi1odWVydGVy0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2tpbmdzL2hvdy1zdGVwaC1jdXJyeS13YXJyaW9ycy1icm9rZS1raW5ncy1zcGlyaXQtZ2FtZS03LWtldmluLWh1ZXJ0ZXI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2018-07-24,22:00:00,"{""Redmond"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 16:29:42,"Since its launch in 2017, Microsoft has convinced over 25 million people to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a substantial library of Xbox Game Pass titles. For those not as interested in a monthly subscription, though, Microsoft is now floating a potential model where players could view an ad in exchange for a short period of game time.  The nod toward potential ad-supported game time comes from Xbox Corporate VP for Game Creator Experience and Ecosystem Sarah Bond, who told Rolling Stone UK that she's constantly looking to ""introduce more business model diversity"" for game developers.  ""We’ve talked about how we’re experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile—are there models of that that work well in PC and console?"" Bond said. ""Are there other models where you might have timed slices of games and stuff like that?""  Would players tolerate it?  Bond's tease comes a few months after some Game Pass players noticed a Spanish-language survey gauging their interest in a cheaper Game Pass tier that included ""advertisements before the game"" (reminiscent of Netflix's recent ad-supported tier rollout ). And Insider reported last year that Microsoft was working with ad agencies to ""let advertisers place ads inside free-to-play Xbox games"" (expanding on the current practice of ads running on the Xbox dashboard).  Microsoft's signaled interest in attaching ads to games isn't new; the company bought in-game ad network Massive in 2006 before shutting it down in 2010. That effort was part of a rising wave of in-game ad interest that crested during the early years of the millennium.  Advertisement  But that wave of in-game advertising in console games was overwhelmingly focused on messages placed in game worlds, like messages plastered on in-game billboards or even NPCs hawking other games . One in-game ad study from 2009 warned developers not to interrupt the game experience and found marketing that ""obstruct[s] the game’s flow might ruin the whole effort and generate irreparable damage"" to a brand.  Since then, mobile gamers have widely accepted interstitial video ads as the price they pay to enjoy many free-to-play titles (though the frequency and length of those ad breaks can vary widely). But it's less clear if these kinds of ad breaks would be as welcome during loading screens or between levels of high-end console games.  ""There’s an understanding by gamers that [free-to-play] games will carry ads, but that understanding isn’t necessarily there for AAA-quality games,"" Naavik analyst Fawzi Itani wrote last year. ""How will players react if ads are placed in these experiences? Since Xbox Game Pass already provides so much value as a bundle, these ads have to be very unintrusive to maintain a suspension of disbelief core to the game experience.""  Bond seemed to acknowledge this elsewhere in the Rolling Stone interview, saying that any gaming business model should have ""an endemic link to the nature of the gameplay. ... Providing creators with options and choice enables them to experiment and do what they like and actually create more immersive and creative experiences without having to fit into a mold.""  Finding those new revenue-generating options could be a key focus for Microsoft, which has seen Game Pass subscription growth slow down in recent months. And regardless of subscriber numbers, analyst firm DFC Intelligence recently said that Game Pass ""does not appear to be a sustainable long-term business model,"" largely because of how much valuable first-party content Microsoft has to include to attract those subscribers.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2dhbWluZy8yMDIzLzA1L21pY3Jvc29mdC1oaW50cy1hdC1sZXR0aW5nLXBsYXllcnMtd2F0Y2gtYWRzLWZvci10aW1lZC1zbGljZXMtb2YtZ2FtZXMv0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9hcnN0ZWNobmljYS5jb20vZ2FtaW5nLzIwMjMvMDUvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWhpbnRzLWF0LWxldHRpbmctcGxheWVycy13YXRjaC1hZHMtZm9yLXRpbWVkLXNsaWNlcy1vZi1nYW1lcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,1996-07-12,Not Discerned,"{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 04:08:42,"Thursday’s Game Report: Cardinals 16, Dodgers 8  By Rob Rains  When the Cardinals were swept by the Dodgers in Los Angeles last month, they scored a combined total of six runs and did not hit a home run in the three games.  It was payback time on Thursday night.  The Cardinals tied a franchise record by hitting seven home runs, including two each from Willson Contreras and Nolan Gorman, to pound the Dodgers in the opener of a four-game series at Busch Stadium.  Four of the home runs came in the third inning, including back-to-back-to-back blasts from Juan Yepez, Gorman and Paul DeJong after Contreras had hit his first of the game earlier in the inning.  The Cardinals had a 9-2 lead at one point in the game but the Dodgers pulled within 9-8 before a seven-run eighth inning put the game away, including the second homers of the night from Contreras and Gorman.  Gorman has 12 home runs for the year, tied for third in the NL, and his 36 RBIs ranks second in the league, two more than Arenado.  The big offensive night helped Adam Wainwright pick up his first victory of the season and the 196th win of his career.  It was only the second time the Cardinals hit seven homers in a game at home; the other coming on May 7, 1940 at Sportsman’s Park – against the Brooklyn Dodgers. That was also the last time the Cardinals scored 16 or more runs in a game against the Dodgers, winning 18-2.  The combined total of nine homers were the most in game at Busch Stadium 3.  The win was the ninth in the Cardinals’ last 11 games.  Here is how Thursday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Both of Contreras’ home runs were three-run shots, tying his career high of six RBIs … Nolan Arenado also homered, his sixth in the last seven games, a two-run blast in the fourth that allowed him to match his career high by driving in at least one run in eight consecutive games … Gorman’s first home run of the night was the first of his career off a lefthanded pitcher … Yepez’s home run came as a pinch-hitter … Oscar Mercado, recalled from Memphis on Wednesday, got the start in left field and went 3-of-4 with two stolen bases, including a delayed steal of home, and scored three runs … The only other time the Cardinals hit four home runs in an inning at home was on June 6, 1948 and this was the first time since 1957 the Cardinals had multiple innings in which they scored six or more runs.  On the mound: After allowing two runs in the first inning, Wainwright pitched into the sixth inning, when an error by Goldschmidt led to a third run … After Wainwright left the game, Genesis Cabrera gave up a grand slam to Freddie Freeman and a leadoff homer to Max Muncy in the seventh that reduced the Cardinals lead to 9-8 … Drew VerHagen allowed two hits but got out of the seventh without allowing the tying run and Jordan Hicks retired the Dodgers in order in the eighth, also protecting the one-run lead.  Key stat: The Cardinals have now hit 20 home runs over their seven games and 33 so far in their first 16 games in May, tying them with the Yankees and Braves for the most in the majors this month.  Worth noting: Edman had to come out of the game with what was described as “lower abdominal soreness” after he and Lars Nootbaar collided in the outfield in the second inning while chasing a fly ball, which Edman caught … The last time the Cardinals hit seven homers in a game was July 12, 1996 against the Cubs in Chicago … The errors by Goldschmidt and Paul DeJong were the first committed by the Cardinals in their last 10 games … After losing the first game of each of their first 11 series of the season, the Cardinals have now won the first game of their last four series … The three stolen bases extended the Cardinals streak without having a runner caught stealing to 19 steals in a row, dating back to April 26 … Contreras became the first Cardinals’ catcher with six RBIs in a game since Tom Pagnozzi did it in 1991.  Looking ahead: Steven Matz will get the start on Friday night in the second game of the series.

Run Legends is available today on the Apple App Store as well as the Google Play Store, said Jenny Xu, founder and CEO of Cupertino, California-based Talofa, in an interview with GamesBeat.  Run Legends is a movement game where you unleash attacks and special skills as you walk or run. You can use these skills to defeat the villainous Sappers who are draining humanity’s energy. Level up your gear, make new friends, and learn more about the world of Run Legends as you level up your fitness in real life.  “Fitness and gaming do not need to be mutually exclusive, and we are extremely proud to build a game that enables players to improve their health while having fun and playing with friends. We look forward to working with our players to scale this new social fitness experience and create a happier, healthier world,” said Xu.  Event GamesBeat Summit 2023 Join the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.  Register Here  But what sets Run Legends apart from other fitness games is that it lets you play in real-time alongside your friends in a co-op mode, no matter where they are in the world. Whether running around your neighborhood or walking on the beach, you can control your character’s movements and unleash powerful attacks by moving faster or slower.  “The goal of the game is to run and walk outside to fight Sappers, which are enemies that represent real-life anxieties,” Xu said. “So players are building mental and physical health as they upgrade their gear. They can make friends as it’s a cooperative game, but they can also learn more about the players’ character backstories.”  You can play with different character classes to take on different types of enemies. Each session takes around five minutes to 15 minutes to play.  “It’s short, but meant to get people moving,” Xu said. “You can run or walk to play. What we do differently is that we set the game’s difficulty level to where the player calibrates it. So you can actually play no matter what skill level you’re at in the real world. Somebody who is an Olympic athlete can play with somebody who just got off the couch, and not feel any worse about their performance, because what we reward is consistency rather than physical ability.”  Run Legends takes a unique approach to promoting mental and physical health by using a storyline that involves battling and overcoming symbolic representations of anxiety and fear, like the Critical Grandma.  During the open beta period of the game, friendships were forged between players from South Korea, Ukraine, the U.S., and dozens of other countries, who regularly worked together to defeat enemies by joining the same missions, Xu said.  The most active players have logged hundreds of miles by playing an early version of the game. That’s easy to do when the virtual announcer, the Operator, is calling out your team’s actions and accomplishments, to keep you fully immersed in the midst of epic battles.  “We’ve already had players tell us about how they’ve lost five pounds, found slivers of their former selves, and gotten more quality time with their dogs through Run Legends,” said Xu.  The game has unlockable missions and rewards, events with leaderboards and prizes, invite codes to send to your teammates for co-op battles, collectible resources to craft into new gear that support a variety of movement styles and tactical roles and customizable pace settings so players of any skill level can be the MVP of their team.  You can buy virtual currency in the game and in the future there will be battle passes, cosmetics, and powerups. But for now, the company is going to try to get as many users as it can. Xu said the game is targeting GenZ audiences as well as anyone who wants to exercise.  A long run  I first met Xu when her team won the grand prize for the Niantic Beyond Reality Contest in 2019. For that contest, Xu and her family created Run to My Heart. Then going by JC Soft, the company created a social running game built on the Niantic Real World Platform, where you had to run in the real world to certain locations in order achieve goals in the game.  “This is the spiritual evolution of that game where we won the contest,” Xu said. “It has come a long way.”  As a concept, the game has been in the works for four years. In the middle of that time, Xu decided to reboot the whole project and start again from scratch.  “We had this whole game story world that had to just be thrown away,” Xu said. “That was probably the hardest reset. We had to cut the team and bring in new people. So it was a really hard time.”  When the company pivoted, it shifted to using the Unity game engine.  About the same time in 2021, the company shifted from being a bootstrapped studio to raising VC funding. The company has a team of seven people now, as well as six contractors.  “That also changed how we thought about it. We now want to make this into like a much larger thing and with a much larger team,” Xu said.  The company also went through Apple’s Entrepreneur Camp, and that made it easy to onboard the game onto the iOS platform.  The Talofa team has been built up with game veterans from Riot Games, EA, and thatgamecompany. Xu has created mobile games with over 10 million downloads. The company hasn’t announced how much money it has raised.  “This has just been a dream project for me coming from making indie games for over 13 years. I started when I was 12. I was a runner and a collegiate athlete,” Xu said. “The combination of these two things and my interest in mental health all manifested into this one product. And I think that the authenticity of that love is one of the more special things that our players have picked up on. It’s like, wow, the devs really love this game. And I think that’s what’s going to help us at launch.”  A new audio feature  Run Legends has been in the works since 2019.  Apple welcomed Xu’s company into the camp because it was using audio in a novel way.  “They liked the fact that we use spatial audio, which is a relatively new feature,” she said. “When you have Air Pods, and you turn your head, they allow you to actually move within the virtual space. The game is uses interactive audio and immersive audio. And we rely on that because we don’t want somebody to look at their screen while running outside. They’re actually just relying on audio experience. And when they turn their head, they’ll hear like the enemy in front of them. And then they turn and now it’s on their left side of their head. So that like real world, immersiveness is also really important to like the experience of the game, and making it feel very different from what’s out there.”  The company has been in testing in the U.S., Ukraine, Russia, and South Korea. The company found users through Discord and Twitter, and more than 20,000 people have played it. On Google, more than 25,000 people preregistered to play.  “The community is super interested in it,” she said.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL3RhbG9mYS1nYW1lcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1ydW4tbGVnZW5kcy1maXRuZXNzLWJhdHRsZS1tb2JpbGUtZ2FtZS_SAV9odHRwczovL3ZlbnR1cmViZWF0LmNvbS9nYW1lcy90YWxvZmEtZ2FtZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtcnVuLWxlZ2VuZHMtZml0bmVzcy1iYXR0bGUtbW9iaWxlLWdhbWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

(0:40)  RALEIGH, N.C. -- The Carolina Hurricanes got a big lineup boost for Thursday night's Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, as winger Teuvo Teravainen returned from injury.  Teravainen, 28, broke his hand on a slash from New York Islanders forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau in Game 2 of their first-round series. He had surgery to repair the hand and missed the remainder of that series and the Hurricanes' six-game second-round series win over the New Jersey Devils.  There were encouraging signs for his progress this week. On Monday, he shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice. Then it became a matter of whether the hand was rehabbed enough to play.  ""I'm not going to throw him in if he can't shoot,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said.  Teravainen was an active participant in the Hurricanes' morning skate ahead of Thursday's Game 1 against the Florida Panthers. He took line rushes with center Eric Staal and winger Martin Necas.  ""He should be ready to go,"" Brind'Amour said. ""He gave me a thumbs-up yesterday, and I think he was fine this morning. We've got to get him in.""

game,2024-07-12,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 17:01:26,"Disclosure: Humble Bundle, the publisher of Lost Skies, is owned by Ziff Davis, the parent company of IGN. Humble Bundle and IGN operate completely independently, and no special consideration is given to Humble Bundle announcements or promotions for coverage.  Bossa Games, developer of I Am Bread, I Am Fish, and Surgeon Simulator, has announced its next game. It’s called Lost Skies, and in many ways, it’s a significant departure from Bossa’s previous humorous sandbox efforts.  Loading Play  Lost Skies is an upcoming open-world, co-op adventure where up to six players work together to explore a world composed of floating islands, build flying ships, and take on gigantic monsters. It’s planned for a PC launch in 2024, but will enter what Bossa calls “open development” later this year, allowing the community to access and test vertical slices and offer feedback to shape Lost Skies’ development.  Expecting the Unexpected  According to Bossa Games CEO Henrique Olifiers, Lost Skies is able to be played single player as well as co-op, and single player play is in fact incentivized at times to assist the overall cooperative efforts of a group. He tells us that combat includes two components. One is “ground” combat, where “ground” is used a bit loosely because, per Olifiers, everyone will be hook-shotting around “Spider-Man-style” in very vertical spaces. The other is ship combat, with customizable flying ships built to tackle much larger creatures that serve as both enemies and puzzles.  While he’s not willing to share too many deep details about gameplay just yet, Olifiers described the two “drivers” of gameplay as surviving the world, and fighting these massive “guardian” creatures with friends, one in each of Lost Skies’ regions. With those two drivers, Olifiers adds that he wants players to feel a sense of freedom - similar to the freedom of Bossa's previous smaller sandboxes - that they are “always looking at something on the horizon” that sparks curiosity and strategy. He wants players to feel they can do anything they can imagine.  “I have this saying that ‘A good game is when something that you didn't expect took place,’ ” he says. “The fondest memories I have of multiplayer games was when in Ultima I was standing there when someone exploited the [fire field] bug to kill Lord British in the game, or when I go into raids in World of Warcraft, and my friends ask, ‘Who's got the potions?’ and we look at each other: ‘What potions?’ That's what we go to the pub later to talk about. So we want to create those in Lost Skies. Every hour one of those [experiences] happens, and the only way for us to craft that is to give players the means to play in the way they want.”  When we spoke with Olifiers ahead of Lost Skies’ announcement, we asked why the studio was going in such a grander, more adventurous direction after years of games where you play as a slice of bread trying to make its way to a toaster through a room full of hazards. Olifiers acknowledged that Lost Skies was a shift in “form and theme” from previous Bossa games, and said the studio’s reasoning came out of its long-standing development process of constantly doing internal game jams.  According to Olifiers, every Bossa game is made out of a game jam, and the studio has dozens of internal prototypes that never see the light of day. But, he continues, this means that all of Bossa’s games historically have been started from scratch: because they’re not building on the foundation of something else, development takes a lot of time.  So Bossa Games wants to focus, and through discussion the team found that many of its members were excited by co-op survival games and building such as Valheim, Project Zomboid, and 7 Days to Die. In focusing on that space and game jamming in it very specifically for a time, Bossa came up with Lost Skies.  Returning to Worlds Adrift  Notably, Lost Skies is meant to take place in the same universe as its previously shuttered MMO, Worlds Adrift. Worlds Adrift entered early access in 2017, but was discontinued two years later due to the game no longer being commercially viable. We asked Olifiers why Bossa was revisiting that universe despite the struggles its first endeavor had.  “We tried well to put to good use all the hindsight that we had with Worlds Adrift,” he says. “What worked, and what didn't work, and to create a brand new game in that universe that so many people fell in love with and we never could fully realize…Hindsight is super useful. You have the advantage of going back and doing something again, but, with that experience, it's like riding a bicycle. You never ride a bicycle well the first time you do it.”  “ You never ride a bicycle well the first time you do it.  One way Bossa is working to ensure the success of Lost Skies is by releasing it early in “open development.” Olifiers says that currently Bossa has a group of a few hundred community members with full access to game builds who are giving feedback and actively discussing with Bossa devs what they want to see from Lost Skies. The plan is to slowly grow this community over time.  While this might seem like a risky strategy, Olifiers says it’s one Bossa has a lot of experience with in its past games. It has a website, Bossa Presents, where it shows off “weird and wonderful prototypes” for community feedback, and Olifiers says I Am Fish specifically was the result of a game jam prototype that community members fell in love with.  “I remember we were watching videos of people doing things in Surgeon Simulator that we never thought possible, and then going back to the game, updating it, and putting achievements if someone else did that,” he says. “So, this kind of positive feedback loop is what we are trying to do on Lost Skies from day one.”  Lost Skies is currently in development for a full PC release sometime in 2024, and Olifiers says Bossa is still considering a potential console release. And there are big plans long-term, too. Bossa has a “huge post-launch roadmap” in mind for long-term Lost Skies support, in hopes the game will sustain them for years to come.  “It's meant to be our bread and butter, going forward, right?” Olifiers says. “Our life.”  Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Sophomore southpaw Tucker Novotny (4-5) went 5.2 innings on the mound for the 'U', striking out four and giving up just one earned run. Fellow sophomore left-hander Connor Wietgrefe came in for Novotny in relief, going 3.1 innings with two strikeouts and one earned run, collecting his team-best fifth save.    The Gophers got multi-hit outings from Brett Bateman (3-for-3, BB), Brady Counsell (2-for-4, 2B, RBI) and Jake Perry (2-for-4). Four Gophers delivered RBI singles in the first inning.        HOW IT HAPPENED  Minnesota scored four times in the bottom of the first, including three times with two outs. After Bateman and Boston Merila walked to start the game, Weber Neels delivered the first RBI single up the middle.

They're really tough to beat at home.""On Waldrep's sixth inning…""I told him that before he went out there. It was a really long inning for him. When he went out for the sixth, we scored the five there. The bottom line is I just told him that we're going to turn the lineup over and this is the most important inning of the game. He did a real nice job of stranding a leadoff double. We still made some mistakes. We didn't cover first that one inning and we were late another time. We made the base running mistake with Cade and one out, going on contact. There are some things that we obviously need to clean up like everyone does. All-in-all it's a road win.

game,2017-07-12,22:00:00,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 17:05:59,"(Firmament screenshot)  Firmament feels like it was thrown into a time capsule at some point around 1993, with beautiful vistas, a haunting storyline, and a difficulty curve like the side of a skyscraper. If you’re in the market for a truly difficult puzzle-adventure game, albeit one with occasionally baffling controls, that’s what Firmament’s offers you.  It’s about what you’d expect from the team that made Myst. Firmament is the latest game from Mead, Wash.-based Cyan Worlds, and it’s exactly the sort of game Cyan likes to make. It’s an immersive first-person adventure set in a surreal alternate world, with no violence or danger, but featuring some of the toughest puzzles in the business.  In Firmament, you play as the newest and only living member of the multiverse’s maintenance team. The Keepers used to work behind the scenes to fix and repair the strange machines that kept several worlds running, but something went horribly wrong and only one Keeper was left. Now she’s dead, you’re her replacement, and you’ve got a lot to do.  If I had to sum Firmament’s mood up in one word, it’d be “melancholy.” It’s a game about abandonment, set in and among strange technologies that have run by themselves for too long. Firmament is full of spectacular vistas and surreal imagery, but it’s all overgrown or too quiet or just a little broken, like an art museum after the end of the world. If nothing else, Firmament is a beautiful game to simply look at.  It’s still a game from Cyan, however, and some of Cyan’s trademark sadism has snuck into this project. Firmament was made via a successful Kickstarter campaign, and like a lot of crowdfunded games, it’s laser focused on a specific, narrow niche. Firmament, like Myst, Riven, and Obduction before it, is for people who like tough, borderline unfair adventure games. If your idea of a productive weekend’s entertainment is spending six hours beating your head against two or three puzzles, then Firmament was made for you.  (Firmament screenshot)  In fact, it went too far in that direction. There are a lot of puzzles in Firmament that aren’t difficult so much as obtuse, or maybe just old fashioned. While I played it, I found myself thinking of games from the early CD-ROM era, around the heyday of the original Myst, when developers were still figuring out what the new technology was good for.  It’s not that Firmament has bad controls, but that it occasionally has really backwards controls. There are parts of this game that feel like they’re 30 years old, because they’re making the sorts of mistakes you’d have seen in a bad Sega CD game from 1994.  A good example comes from one of the first puzzles in the game, where you’re asked to use a crane to move a cargo crate into a particular position to use it as a makeshift bridge. It’s a classic.  However, the control panel for that crane is a couple of hundred in-game yards away from the gap you’re trying to bridge and faces in the opposite direction. You can’t actually see what you’re doing, aside from making an educated guess from the control panel’s heads-up display. If you get it wrong, you have to turn around and run towards the gap to check. It’s like trying to parallel-park by remote control.  (Firmament screenshot)  This isn’t the only time it happens. A few different puzzles in Firmament have similar issues, where you have to solve them blind or use some backwards interface just for that section of the game. It’s an exercise in frustration. I was particularly annoyed by a sequence at roughly the game’s halfway point where I had to pilot a drone with a control interface that made it feel like a really big, really broken shopping cart.  I suspect the idea here was that Cyan wanted to preserve the sense of immersion above all else. The idea is that you never leave your character’s perspective under any circumstances, in order to preserve the illusion that you’re actually inhabiting this world. It’s a big part of what makes VR games as absorbing as they are. Immersion and frustration aren’t the same thing, though.  Cyan’s really turned up its art and narrative design with Firmament; even when I was annoyed by a particular puzzle, I put up with it because I wanted to find out more about what had happened to the Keepers, in this strange world between worlds that Cyan’s created.  As it is, Firmament is a throwback to the ‘90s, for better and for worse. It’s unapologetic about its difficulty and does some really clever things with the medium, but at a couple of particular points, it feels like a game that was made by somebody who hasn’t played any other video games since Deep Space Nine went off the air.  Firmament is available now for Windows, MacOS, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation VR.

This new LOTR MMO game will be a persistent open world Middle-earth set in the third age, but not based or connected to Amazon’s billion-dollar The Rings of Power TV series. Development is currently planning to launch on PC and console.  Reviews for Amazon’s New World currently sit at 6/10 on Steam with 200,000+ reviews, and a Metacritic score of 70. Metacritic is basically Rotten Tomatoes for video games, averaging review scores from professionals and the community. From what we have read, New World was praised for good modern graphics and multiplayer engagement, but with a limited set of innovative game mechanics.  This new game is unrelated to the cancelled LOTR online MMO game that was being developed in China. Amazon is building this in-house with its team from an earlier acquisition of Double Helix, a successful studio responsible for many franchise spinoff games like Enter the Matrix, Star Wars Episode III, Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, Killer Instinct, G.I. Joe, Silent Hill, and more.  Fans may welcome a next-gen Lord of the Rings MMO experience, as one of the common knocks on the hugely successful (and still updating) LOTRO is the dated graphics. Amazon Games will have their work cut out for them to differentiate from Peter Jackson’s cinematic world, Standing Stone Games’ deep lore gaming in LOTRO, and the future secrets from The Rings of Power.

game,2023-05-13,19:00:00,"{""Raleigh"", ""NorthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 06:52:37,"The Panthers outlast the Hurricanes in a marathon Game 1 as Matthew Tkachuk scores the winning goal in quadruple overtime.  RALEIGH, N.C. -- — Back and forth they went, the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes playing a game that seemed destined to have no end while leaving legs growing wobbly with each passing minute.  Then, just as the teams appeared headed for yet another extra period, Matthew Tkachuk pounced on his chance to finish off yet another overtime and road victory for the Panthers in these playoffs.  Tkachuk beat Frederik Andersen in the final seconds of the fourth overtime to give the Panthers a 3-2 victory over the Hurricanes early Friday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final.  Tkachuck took a feed from Sam Bennett after Florida won a battle for the puck as Carolina tried to clear it from the zone, then whipped a shot from the right circle past Andersen with 12.7 seconds left.  That sent Tkachuck racing toward center ice to celebrate with teammates in what turned into the longest game in either franchises' history, as well as the sixth-longest game in NHL history.  “Definitely, tired but I think you're less tired when you win,” Tkachuk said, adding: “I hope you guys and everybody else enjoyed that game, because what I'm seeing is two really good teams fighting it out for every inch.”  Florida won its seventh straight road game in these playoffs and improved to 5-0 in overtime. Game 2 is Saturday night in Raleigh, less than 48 hours after the teams played more than two full games worth of hockey.  This one ended roughly six hours after the puck drop.  “We didn't even know what overtime we were in,” Panthers forward Ryan Lomberg said.  Aleksander Barkov and Carter Verhaeghe scored in regulation for the Panthers, and Sergei Bobrovsky made 63 saves in what turned into a goaltender battle as the game got more ragged and players racked up the ice time.  Andersen finished with 57 saves for Carolina, which got power-play goals from Seth Jarvis and Stefan Noesen.  “It was a good goalie battle,” Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said. “It was unfortuante we just couldn't find one.”  Tkachuk finally ended a game that had multiple wild sequences in critical late moments.  Most notably, there was Lomberg appearing to have the winning goal in his return to Florida’s lineup from injury, beating Jalen Chatfield in a battle and then whipping the puck by Andrersen 2 1/2 minutes into the first OT.  But Carolina successfully challenged the play for goaltender interference. Replays showed Florida’s Colin White — while being bumped by Carolina’s Jack Drury — making skate-to-skate contact with Andersen, then bumping him as Andersen ended up on all fours on the other side of the crease before Lomberg’s shot found the net.  Later in that first OT, Jarvis — who had the game’s first goal on a power-play blast from the slot — nearly ended it on a loose rebound but rang the crossbar.  It turned out, the game was nowhere near its epic finish.  Florida hadn’t been to an Eastern Conference final since 1996, before a large chunk of its roster had even been born. But these Panthers had turned a late surge to qualify for the final wild-card spot into a postseason-shaking moment by taking down Boston following the Bruins’ record-setting 65 wins and 135 points, followed by beating a Toronto team buzzing off its first series win in nearly two decades.  Now the Panthers have handed the Hurricanes — who had the league's second-best regular-season record — their first series deficit of the postseason.  Carolina is in the Eastern final for the second time in five years. The last time, it was a feel-good surprise for a young core that had just ended a nine-year postseason drought. They had since accomplished the goal of building a consistent winner and Cup contender, though second-round exits the past two seasons on home ice had cast a damper on some of that sustained success.  This time, Carolina beat the New York Islanders in six games and then the New Jersey Devils in five to make it back. But on a night when both teams had plenty of chances to end this one in any of the OTs, Carolina ended up losing its ninth straight game in the conference-final round dating to 2009 in brutal fashion.  “It was kind of really who was going to make the last mistake,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “Unfortunately, it was us.”  LONGEST GAME  The longest game in NHL history came on March 24, 1936, when the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Maroons 1-0 in the sixth overtime on Mud Bruneteau’s goal at 116 minutes, 30 seconds of extra play.  FRANCHISE MARKS  Florida’s previous record for longest game was 104:31 in Game 4 of the 1996 Stanley Cup final against Colorado. Carolina’s previous record was 114:47 for Game 3 of the 2002 Stanley Cup final. The teams each lost those games.  SEMIFINAL SKID  Carolina's losing streak in the NHL semifinals dates to Pittsburgh's sweep of the Hurricanes in 2009 when Maurice was in his second stint as Carolina's coach. Boston then swept the Hurricanes a decade later.  WELCOME BACK  Both teams welcomed back forwards from lengthy injuries.  Carolina’s Teuvo Teravainen hadn’t played since suffering what the team described as a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders. The injury required surgery on April 20 and left him with a scar running the length of his left thumb.  Lomberg had missed eight straight games due to an upper-body injury.  ------  Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap  ------  AP NHL Playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY28udWsvbmhsL3JlY2FwL18vZ2FtZUlkLzQwMTU0ODQzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-03,Not Discerned,"{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 06:21:00,"DENVER -- Jamal Murray took a handoff from Nikola Jokic on the left wing and drilled his fourth 3-pointer of the fourth quarter over LeBron James.  ""Bang!"" Murray yelled out, a nod to ESPN play-by-play man Mike Breen's trademark call, while pointing at the ESPN broadcast table on his way back down the court.  After missing 12 of 17 shots and scoring just 14 points through the first three quarters, Murray gave the Los Angeles Lakers a taste of ""Playoff Murray"" in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals at Ball Arena. Murray exploded for 23 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter to help the Denver Nuggets win 108-103 to push the Lakers down to a 2-0 series deficit.  Murray -- who also had 10 rebounds, 5 assists and 4 steals -- said he grew up dreaming of clutch fourth-quarter playoff performances like this. It was his fourth 20-plus-point fourth quarter in the playoffs, the most since the play-by-play era began in the 1997-98 season and two more than Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson, who are tied for second, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information.  ""When I was little, I used to count down the seconds off the shot clock and make the shot and talk like Marv Albert and Mike Breen,"" Murray said after the game. ""Just the imagination running as a kid. When you get in that moment and you see your fam in the crowd, see your little brother, see Mike Breen there, all these little reminders, they all pay dividends and make that moment a little more special. Just kind of lock you back in.""  He added: ""Playing in the Western Conference finals against the Lakers and LeBron James. It's an amazing opportunity, and it's something you're going to look back in history and remember for the rest of your life.""  The Nuggets also got a fourth straight triple-double from Jokic, who had 23 points, 17 rebounds and 12 assists. It was also his fifth triple-double in six games.  But it was Murray who played the role of finisher. He had been battling an ear infection that sidelined him last weekend and prevented him from doing much at all.  But he has scored 31 or more points in both of the Nuggets' home wins against the Lakers. On Thursday night, Murray scored the final 12 points of the game for the Nuggets. That is the second-most consecutive points scored for a team to end a game in a conference finals or NBA Finals win over the past 25 years, according to ESPN Stats & Information.  ""He was special and he won us the game,"" Jokic said. ""His energy, he played 42 minutes, so ... I think he was amazing. Yes, maybe in the first half, he struggled to make shots. But when it mattered the most, he made shots and won us the game basically.""  It was a moment Denver coach Michael Malone cherished. He has seen how hard Murray has had to work to fight his way back from a torn left ACL in April 2021, forcing him to miss the previous two postseasons.  ""I love Jamal Murray,"" Malone said. ""This is not just like I'm coaching him. We've been together seven years and been through a lot of ups and downs, and to see him back playing at the level he's playing at, the first thought for me is just tremendous pride and just so happy for him. Because I saw the dark days coming back from that ACL.  Malone added: ""He needs to continue to do that. Obviously our goal is not done. We have to win this series. Our goal is to win a championship, and he's going to be a big part of that.""  Murray's clutch performance helped the Nuggets bury the Lakers -- who led by 11 in the third but watched Denver score 20 of the first 25 points in the fourth quarter -- when they made seven 3-pointers.  Murray's fourth quarter outscored James' 22 points for the entire game. With Anthony Davis struggling through a 4-for-15 shooting night for 18 points and 14 rebounds, the Nuggets head to Los Angeles looking to add to their series lead.  While the Nuggets continue to surprise some despite their No. 1 seeding and best record in the West, Murray said Denver has become accustomed to this for several years now.  ""We're the Denver Nuggets; we're used to that,"" Murray said. ""Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the Clippers in the bubble, they talk about the other team. Same old, same old. It fuels us a little more and will be sweeter when we win the chip.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjgyMzk0L251Z2dldHMtamFtYWwtbXVycmF5LWJ1cmllcy1sYWtlcnMtMjMtcG9pbnQtNHRoLWdhbWUtMtIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjgyMzk0L251Z2dldHMtamFtYWwtbXVycmF5LWJ1cmllcy1sYWtlcnMtMjMtcG9pbnQtNHRoLWdhbWUtMj9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-13,Not Discerned,"{""Denver"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 06:46:44,"DENVER — The roles were reversed in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals. After being down by as many as 11 in the second quarter, the Denver Nuggets came back to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 108-103.  The star of Game 2 was Denver guard Jamal Murray, who joined elite company with his fourth quarter performance.  Denver remains undefeated at home in the playoffs and is powered by two-time MVP Nikola Jokic, who had his 13th career playoff triple-double in the game, moving him to third most in the playoffs all-time.  The Lakers, now down 2-0 in the series, will host the Nuggets in Game 3 on Saturday and both teams will make their adjustments, even if one side's gets talked about more than the other.  Lakers in trouble?:LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Lakers need more, but do they have it in the tank?  Follow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules  Here are three takeaways from Game 2 of the Western Conference finals:  We haven’t seen the full potential of Jamal Murray, which is scary  Murray was listed as questionable ahead of Game 6 of the second round series against the Phoenix Suns, but he has not missed a game. Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said he still wasn’t 100% ahead of Game 2. Murray showed it as he played lackadaisical in the first half, starting 5-of-17 from the field.  But he woke up in the fourth quarter and had 23 points, finishing as the team’s leading scorer with 37 points. This is his fourth time scoring 20 points or more in the fourth quarter of a playoff game. He joins Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players in the past 30 years to have multiple games with 20 points in the final period of a playoff game.  ""He was special and he won us the game,"" Jokic said. ""He scored 20-something in the fourth quarter. He got us the lead, his energy, he played 40-something minutes, 42 minutes, so I think he was amazing.""  ""The game would have been a lot easier if I made them the first half,"" Murray noted of his performance, ""so just come out focused and knock them down, don't lose any confidence or anything like that. Just play my game and you know that they're going to fall if I keep shooting.""  The 26-year-old is no stranger to adversity as he experienced the NBA bubble with the team and this is his first year back after missing all of last season with a torn ACL. Malone was snarky all day, making comments about his daughter's lengthy graduation and bemoaning the lack of credit his team is getting, but he turned heartfelt when speaking on Murray's development.  ""It's so rewarding. This is not just coach and player,"" he said. ""... I love Jamal Murray. This is not just like I'm coaching him. We've been together for seven years and been through a lot of ups and downs and to see him back playing at the level he's playing at, the first thought for me is just tremendous pride and just so happy for him.""  Rui Hachimura's Game 1 performance was not a fluke  Rui Hachimura was widely credited with slowing down Jokic in Game 1 and he came off the bench to power the Lakers' offense in Game 2. He finished with 21 points and there was a stretch between the first and second quarters where he had 11 of the Lakers’ 13 points. He also scored the last bucket of the first half, an alley-oop dunk from LeBron James that put the Lakers up 53-48 at the half.  James finished with 22 points, tied with Austin Reaves for the team lead, and played stronger in the second half. He didn’t score until a dunk with 6:49 left in the first quarter and massively whiffed a breakaway windmill dunk that had Ball Arena reveling in his embarrassment. He was visibly gassed as the final buzzer sounded.  PAYING TRIBUTE:Rui Hachimura picked Kobe Bryant-inspired number after being traded to Lakers  As James ages and works through his injuries, young stars like Hachimura have stepped up to keep Los Angeles' hopes of an 18th title alive.  ""I'm just trying to be aggressive on both ends, especially (against) their big,"" Hachimura said. ""So I think for this series, the coaches have been telling me it's going to be a big series for me. So I was ready for this.""  The Nuggets do not care that the 'national narrative' is about the Lakers  After the near-comeback in Game 1, the national media talk was about how the Lakers would adjust to try and even the series.  For the Nuggets, this is nothing new. In the 2020 bubble, the conversation was around the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers as Denver outlasted both in seven-game series where it completed 3-1 comebacks.  Michael Porter Jr., who had 16 points and a key shot that tied the game in the fourth quarter, explained the team mentality.  ""We got a lot of dudes who aren't really big into the social media thing, feeding into that,"" he said, ""which I think that plays to our advantage, being the type of small-market team that we are. So I don't think we mind that at all.""  Murray and Jokic echoed the sentiment.  ""The outside noise is outside noise,"" Murray said. ""We're the Denver Nuggets, we're used to it. Even when we win, they talk about the other team. We beat the Clippers in the bubble, they talk about the other team. Same old, same old, it just fuels us a little more and will be sweeter when we win the 'ship.""  ""Since we made playoffs, it's like that, so it's nothing new for us,"" Jokic said. ""To be honest, I like it. We don't care. Whatever.""  Malone had the strongest statement of all.  ""You put that in your pipe, you smoke it,"" he said, ""and you come back and you know what, we're gonna go up 2-0.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbmJhLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvbnVnZ2V0cy1sYWtlcnMtZ2FtZS0yLXRha2Vhd2F5cy83MDIzNDYxMTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 19:52:13,"National Basketball Association Did Jayson Tatum's poor fourth quarter in Game 1 hurt his 'superstar' case? Updated May. 18, 2023 4:00 p.m. ET share facebook twitter reddit link  After setting the NBA record for points in a Game 7 with 51 as the Boston Celtics cruised past the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday, Jayson Tatum fell short in the pivotal moments in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Miami Heat.  Tatum failed to register a shot in the fourth quarter and committed three turnovers over a span of four possessions en route to a 123-116 loss for the Celtics on Wednesday.  Tatum scored 30 points on an efficient 9-of-17 shooting from the field while grabbing seven rebounds and a block, but his offensive struggles in the fourth quarterback overshadowed his early success, especially with Boston surrendering a 13-point lead.  FOX Sports' Skip Bayless was among those befuddled by Tatum's latest playoff performance, leading him to question if Tatum is actually a superstar.  ""You have elevated him to the highest pedestal,"" Bayless said to ""Undisputed"" cohost Shannon Sharpe on Thursday. ""He made first-team All-NBA. You have proclaimed him a superstar. I keep saying, ‘I’m trying, but I can't get there,' because, especially through the playoffs, it is a wild roller coaster ride of great game, sorry game, great game, ‘Huh?’ [game], great game and a ‘Where did you go? What happened to you?’ [game].""  Jimmy Butler leads Heat to 123-116 Game 1 win vs. Celtics Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat upset the Celtics in Boston in Game 1, 123-116. Shannon Sharpe breaks down why the Celtics lost Game 1.  As Bayless mentioned, Tatum has had some up-and-down performances throughout his playoff career. Just in the Eastern Conference semifinal against the 76ers, Tatum had several head-scratching performances. In the first half of Game 4, Tatum scored three points on 1-of-9 shooting before finishing with 24 points, 18 rebounds, six assists and four blocks in an eventual Celtics loss.  Tatum got off to a slow start in Game 5, too. He missed his first six shots of that game before scoring 36 points on 11-of-27 shooting in another Celtics loss. Game 6 was Tatum's worst start yet, shooting 1-of-14 from the field through the first three-plus quarters before hitting four 3-pointers in the final minutes to keep the Celtics' season alive and force a Game 7.  ADVERTISEMENT  Bayless isn't sure if the blame should necessarily fall on Tatum for not getting a shot off in the fourth quarter of Game 1, believing some blame might fall on Celtics point guard Marcus Smart and coach Joe Mazzulla. But the one thing he does know is that ""the best player on what many consider to be the best team"" failed to show up in the fourth quarter as a ""prohibitive favorite"" against the eighth-seeded Heat.  ""I don't get it,"" Bayless said of Tatum's up-and-down play. ""He's almost like a Kevin Durant-like figure where we see all the talent, we see all the explosiveness. We saw it in Game 7 against Philly. We saw it at the very end of Game 6 at Philly. We see him explode. He's so long at 6-foot-8 that when he extends to the basket, it's almost like his arms can extend another extra foot, like they're elongated arms. I've never seen anything quite like it.  ""But he can go as cold as anybody in the league. What happened in the playoffs last year? He led the whole playoffs with 100 turnovers. It seemed like he cleaned up some of his act this year in these playoffs until the home stretch of last night's game. Not only is he not taking a shot in the fourth quarter, but with under three minutes left, he had three turnovers, too.""  Tatum will look to get back on track when the Celtics take on the Heat in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Friday night in Boston.

What are the odds of that happening two games in a row?  Not very good, according to those charged with the task of setting the odds for Game 2. Miami poured in a club playoff-record 46 points in the third quarter final of Game 1, rallying for a 123-116 victory in the opener of this best-of-seven series. But as the two clubs ready for Game 2 on Friday at TD Garden (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT), bookmakers are doubling down on the hometown Celtics.  Boston is set as a nine-point home favorite, even though the Celtics are 0-4 both straight up and against the spread in the past four games during which they’ve been given such a wide berth in the betting line.  Heat vs. Celtics betting trends  With their Game 1 victory, the Heat are now 8-2 SU and ATS over their past 10 games. Miami is 8-3 SU and 9-2 ATS in the last 11 games in which the club took the court as the betting underdog.  Boston hasn’t exactly been taking advantage of home-court advantage. Since winning and covering in their first two playoff home games against the Atlanta Hawks, the Celtics are 2-4 both SU and ATS at TD Garden.

There might be a rash of ankle injuries with all of the people suddenly abandoning the Boston bandwagon. In the NBA public betting trends, Miami at +9 is pulling 66% of handle and 75% of bets in the spread splits. Public moneyline bettors are divided. While the Celtics are grabbing 64% of handle in the moneyline splits, there’s 52% of bets on the Heat.  The public is seeing the over on the total of 215.5 points as almost a sure thing. It’s garnering 94% of handle and 87% of bets. Nine of Miami’s last 10 games have gone over, as have five of the last six Heat vs. Celtics games played at TD Garden.  Can Celtics cool down Heat?  Boston as a prohibitive home favorite in Game 1 made perfect sense. It was after all a showdown between the No. 2 and No. 7 seeds in the East. Handing Boston an even larger margin in the spread for Game 2 is a puzzling decision to say the least.  What does Miami need to achieve before the experts will begin to back the Heat? They are an NBA-best 9-3 SU in the postseason. Miami is 6-1 ATS this season when an underdog of 8.5+ points. Granted, the one time the Heat didn’t cover was as 9.5-point underdogs in a 134-121 loss at Boston on Nov. 30. In the playoffs, though, Miami’s been money as a heavy underdog.

In Game 3, Jimmy Butler was himself for Miami, which is to say he was outstanding. Playoff Jimmy scored 35 points. What was significant was the backing he received from the Heat’s supporting cast. Bam Adebayo scored 20 points. Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent, Max Strus and Kyle Lowry each contributed 15 points. Boston is supposed to be the team in this series with scoring depth. Miami also dominated Boston from long range. The Heat shot 51.6% (16-of-31) from beyond the arc. The Celtics were a disappointing 34.5% (10-of-29). Tenacious Miami also made 12 steals, compared to six by Boston.  The standard theory in sports betting is to fade the public. In this case, though, go with the flow. Boston probably wins Game 2. But the Celtics won’t win by more than nine points.  Pick: Miami Heat +9 (-110).  Miami vs. Boston same-game parlay  The total points for the Heat in Game 2 is set at 103.5 points, which seems like a good launching point to begin a same-game parlay. Miami has gone over that total in 10 of 12 playoff games. The Heat are averaging 114.1 points per game in the postseason. Take the over here at odds of -105.  FanDuel Sportsbook MA $150 BONUS BETS!

game,2023-05-01,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Fri 19 May 2023 04:44:23,"We’ve been here before. A year ago, the Miami Heat had a 1-0 series lead over the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals, having come back from 13 points down in Game 1.  This year’s series is the same, but different in that the Heat got their Game 1 victory on the road. So the Celtics, having already lost home-court advantage, should be more desperate to win Game 2. The last 16 Game 2s in this scenario (road team won Game 1) have been won by the home team, with the average margin of victory being 17.3 points.  One of those 16 Game 2s was the Celtics’ 34-point victory over Philadelphia in the conference semis, and two of them were losses from the Heat in these playoffs. But Miami, playing without Jimmy Butler two weeks ago, led Game 2 in New York in the fourth quarter and lost by just six. If the Heat can keep this Game 2 close, they’ll do so believing (for good reason) that they’re the more hardened team in regard to clutch situations.  Here are three things to watch in Game 2 on Friday (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT)…  1. Tatum targeting  Jayson Tatum and Duncan Robinson were both on the floor for about six and a half minutes in Game 1, with the Celtics having 14 offensive possessions in that time. But not once did the guy Robinson was guarding set a ball-screen for the Celtics’ star. Tatum is one of the biggest weak-defender seekers in the league and, among defenders in the Heat’s rotation, Robinson has the biggest target on his chest. So it was a surprise that Boston didn’t seek out that matchup right away.  Tatum still had a strong scoring game, scoring 30 points on 9-for-17 from the field and 11-for-11 from the line. Also, after missing both of his shots in the first half, Robinson didn’t play after halftime. But the Celtics could have been more purposeful with their offense in the fourth quarter, when the window was still open for them to come back.  While Tatum scored efficiently, he had one assist and four turnovers (three in the fourth). Miami showed him extra defenders without committing to a double-team (until he gets into the paint), which didn’t give him obvious decisions to make with the ball…  Tatum did try to attack Max Strus a couple of times in that fourth quarter, but Strus was able to stay in front.  “I know they’re going to keep doing it,” Strus said Thursday, “but these are the moments I want to be in. That’s why I’m on the floor. I’m ready for the challenge and I believe in myself and my team to have my back when I’m in those positions. I’m not going to shy away from the moment.”  2. Heat will (probably) need to find another way  The Heat shot 10-for-15 (67%) from mid-range and 16-for-31 (52%) from 3-point range in Game 1. That’s definitely unsustainable and probably unrepeatable.  “I wouldn’t say we’re accepting that,” Kyle Lowry said Thursday, “because we think we can do it. At the same time, we know we can win games all types of ways.”  Belief in the ability to shoot better than 50% from outside the paint only goes so far, so the Heat will likely have to find other ways to win going forward, either scoring more inside (or at the line) or, more likely, defending better. The Celtics’ 116 points on 97 possessions was the third most efficient performance against the Heat in these playoffs.  “We’ve had to do that all season long,” Spoelstra said. “We’ve had to win with a lot of different identities and different ways to find solutions. And that’s likely what’s going to happen in this series.  “You have to try to get to your ‘A’ game, but [the Celtics] are going to have something to say about that. And if we don’t get to that, we still have to find a way to get the job done.”  3. Big minutes  One game is a small sample size, but it wouldn’t be a surprise if Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla makes a quick change to his starting lineup. The Celtics’ big lineup — with Robert Williams and Al Horford together — was critical to their wins in Games 6 and 7 of the conference semis, but was outscored by 10 points (with rough numbers on both ends of the floor) in 8.7 minutes on Wednesday.  Mazzulla subbed Horford out less than four minutes into the third quarter, with the Heat having begun the second half on a 15-6 run. He didn’t go back to the two-big configuration after that. Malcolm Brogdon and Derrick White (the starter for the Celtics’ first 11 playoff games) both played well off the bench, combining to score 30 points on 11-for-20 shooting.  The Heat, meanwhile, struggled without Bam Adebayo, getting outscored by 11 points (allowing 33 points on 24 defensive possessions) in the 11:03 in which he was on the bench. Cody Zeller remains a foul magnet and there was no rim protection in the couple of minutes in which they played Kevin Love at the five.  Butler played more than 43 minutes in Game 1, never coming off the floor in the second half. Adebayo played just 37, but if his off-court minutes continue to be a struggle, they could be reduced quite a bit.  * * *",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy8zLXRoaW5ncy10by13YXRjaC1jZWx0aWNzLWhlYXQtZ2FtZS0y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Its collection of golf courses at launch includes major championship venues such as Augusta National and Oak Hill — site of this week’s PGA Championship — alongside some of the more unique gems around the world like Tara Iti (New Zealand), Wolf Creek (Nevada), Teeth of the Dog (Dominican Republic) and Top of the Rock (Missouri). Not only has EA acquired the inclusion of preeminent brands across the industry, but new golf brands like G/FORE, Bad Birdie, Seamus Golf & VESSEL all making an appearance for the first time.  An in-game image of EA SPORTS PGA TOUR. (EA SPORTS)  Being an avid gamer with experience across many golf games on console, EA SPORTS PGA TOUR is the best representation of golf courses and swing mechanics of its players. I’ve even heard that the caddies at Augusta National use the game to learn about the contours of the greens and fairways — it’s that accurate! And this week, EA released a new patch for gamers to tackle more courses, including the East Course at Oak Hill, where they can tackle the PGA Championship venue themselves.  The main differentiator between this game and others is the sheer amount of shotmaking capabilities and interchangeable difficulty metrics that you must learn to play better.  Sean Thornberry, PGA, playing EA SPORTS PGA TOUR.  There’s a PGA Coaching and PGA Coach: Skills Trainer portion within the game that features 180 different challenges that provide basic to expert level practicing of differing shots around the golf course. This can be a great resource for newer golfers to understand the different nuisances and considerations that need to go into playing the game, and ultimately what can be practiced in real life.  I can envision a PGA Professional utilizing the video game to teach a young junior golfer how to make better decisions for choosing the right club and shot around the greens, with consideration to the lie, contours of the green, the distance to the flag, the elements — all these external factors are mimicked in the game to represent how we all as PGA Professionals determine the best approach to the next shot.  PGA Associates at the Home of the PGA of America playing EA SPORTS PGA TOUR.  My only gripe is that there’s not enough content! I wish we saw more playable courses and professional golfers, as well as their own individual swing mechanics. Right now, the create-a-player mode only features 3 possible stock swings. It would be amazing if in the future you had the ability to craft your own swing or even digitally upload your own.  The fact that you can compete in various modes with a career that spans from historic amateur events, Qualifying School, the Korn Ferry Tour and onto the PGA TOUR — and, ultimately, in men’s majors like the PGA Championship — is incredible. There’s also the ability to compete head-to-head with other players from around the world in the online multiplayer mode, earning in-game rewards and climbing the leaderboards to become globally ranked through practice and playing.  EA SPORTS PGA TOUR is by far the best golf video game I’ve come across and undoubtedly countless hours will be spent trying to improve my customized player’s skills and gameplay — and win the PGA Championship!",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBnYS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZWEtc3BvcnRzLXBnYS10b3VyLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUtd293cy13aXRoLW5ldy1mZWF0dXJlcy1wZ2EtY29hY2hpbmfSAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZ2EuY29tL3N0b3J5L2VhLXNwb3J0cy1wZ2EtdG91ci12aWRlby1nYW1lLXdvd3Mtd2l0aC1uZXctZmVhdHVyZXMtcGdhLWNvYWNoaW5nP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2019-02-08,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 08:02:08,"Game Over: Metroid Prime Remastered  I missed out on playing the original Metroid Prime from 2002 on the GameCube because I was knee-deep in my PlayStation 2 while also having to navigate the troubles of being a kid with four older brothers and a busy life schedule. So years went by before I could try it on the Nintendo Switch after the remaster was shadow-dropped on the 8th of February following a Nintendo Direct. I was beyond excited to finally get my hands on this thing because, somehow, I could never secure a copy of the original game despite its various ports. After playing the title, it has earned a spot on my all-time favourite games list, and I can see why so many people loved it all those years ago. Everything about Metroid Prime Remastered is so good, whether it’s the atmosphere, the upgrades, the lore, or THAT music. It is a complete experience. My favourite tracks would have to be the Phendrana Drifts and Magmoor Caverns main themes, but I could’ve picked any song because it’s all amazing. It’s also cool how each area stands out from the rest because of their unique colour palettes, and if you were to show them all side-by-side to someone, that person would easily be able to tell them apart just by looking at their visuals. Now, that is some good game design.  Metroid Prime is a first-person shooter with Metroidvania elements that emphasises agile movement instead of precise aiming. The focus is on isolation and exploration more than anything. I don’t think there is any point in going into plot details because all you do is land on a spaceship, chase Ridley to Tallon IV, and then explore the planet while searching for upgrades. That’s fine, though, because there isn’t any point in cluttering the experience with unnecessary plot details. Plus, all that story stuff can be found in the various lore sections that can be read with Samus’ scan visor. The movement has also been vastly improved over the original release by adding dual-stick analogue controls. I’m not planning on experimenting with other control options because I’ve found dual-stick to be the most comfortable, and Retro Studios did a great job with them.  The upgrades and suit abilities still play and look great after all these years, but the visuals are even more remarkable. I don’t know how they did it, but somehow the developers were able to get this title running at 60 frames per second with graphics that resemble a PlayStation 4 game at times. It’s awe-inspiring for the perceived limits of the hardware and shows the developers still cared about the project that made them famous over two decades ago. Now, I’m a relative newcomer to the Metroid series as my introduction to the franchise was with Metroid Dread, and then I went on to play Metroid Fusion and now the remaster of Metroid Prime. It’s now become one of my favourite videogame series ever, so the amount of support it’s been getting in recent years just warms my heart. I wasn’t around for the franchise’s dark years, and I feel bad for anyone who had to experience that era, but at least we can enjoy this sudden reawakening of the Alien-inspired space epic. Of course, until Nintendo forgets about it for another decade.  One of my favourite parts about this game is how you’re never doing something separate from the core experience. I know that sounds a bit trivial, but in the age of expansive AAA releases, I’ve grown fond of titles that require the player to get good at doing one thing and then build around that thing with upgrades and the like rather than adding on a bunch of pointless gameplay mechanics to support a generic story. It just shows that focusing on what makes your game great in the first place instead of trying to come at it from the outside can pay off in spades. For example, you’re always playing as Samus whilst collecting upgrades throughout the entire experience. You never have to do something separate from that, such as flying a spaceship or driving a vehicle. There are other ways of executing this approach, but it’s something Nintendo and its various studios have always excelled at, and I love it.  If you haven’t played Metroid Prime by now, I genuinely can’t imagine a better way of doing so. The graphics have been updated, the controls are better, and the atmosphere is still top-notch. I believe you should be required to play it if you’re a fan of Metroidvanias or first-person shooters, and I’m incredibly grateful for getting the chance to play it myself. So Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption better get a similar treatment, or I’ll lose it! But at least the future of this series is looking brighter than ever, and I couldn’t be happier about that.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVncmluLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9nYW1lLW92ZXItbWV0cm9pZC1wcmltZS1yZW1hc3RlcmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-16,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 01:28:00,"Players of the video game “The Sims” can now bake a challah or dish up a bowl of matzo ball soup, after updates made by the game’s creator that are designed to increase Jewish representation.  The new updates add traditional Jewish foods to the expansive menu available to users of “The Sims,” a best-selling life simulation game in which players customize characters and build homes and communities. The game’s developers periodically release expansion packs offering additional items for use in the role-playing.  On Tuesday, the developers released an update focused on one family of characters, the Calientes. But it also added Jewish foods that some users had mounted an extended campaign to secure.  “Get ready to dig in because today’s Sims Delivery Express adds matzah ball soup & challah bread to The Sims 4 recipe book for the whole family to enjoy,” the game announced on Twitter. An accompanying GIF showed a table with four loaves of challah, two covered by a tree-motif cover. The table is surrounded by diners scooping soup and speaking with their hands.  A gaming PC keyboard and X Box controller (illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY)  Simmers had been pushing for Jewish additions to the game  The announcement elicited gratitude from the community of players, known as Simmers, who had been pushing for Jewish additions to the game.  “The Sims team HAVE LISTENED and have finally brought Jewish food to The Sims 4!” tweeted a user who goes by HufflePom on social media. “Thank you to everyone who has liked, retweeted, commented and supported my posts over the last 462 days. We did it!”  Later, HufflePom tweeted a picture of a multicolored challah and thanked a programmer who had been working on the addition “for doing such a beautiful, thoughtful and respectful job.”  HufflePom was the leader of a movement to press “The Sims” and its parent company, Electronic Arts, to add more Jewish options to the game.  “Sims” players have long come up with creative workarounds to permit Jewish practice in the game, such as letting their Sims keep kosher by changing their characters’ traits to “vegetarian.” Some players let their Sims celebrate Shabbat by baking bread and setting it on a table and lighting decorative candles. Players who use “custom content” modifications not created or endorsed by the game developers have also long created Jewish content for The Sims, such as kippahs, other versions of menorahs, chuppahs, Torahs, shofars, mezuzahs and dreidels. Some have Sims performing Jewish rituals, such as stomping on a glass at a wedding.  But other than a menorah that permitted players to light individual candles for each night of Hanukkah, there was no Jewish content provided by the game’s creator. HufflePom and others had noted gaps in other additions over time: An expansion set aimed at providing culturally diverse wedding options, for example, did not include a chuppah, or Jewish wedding canopy.  Neither HufflePom nor the programmer responded to requests for comment on Wednesday.  An online petition launched last year by another Sims user noted HufflePom’s advocacy. “For over a year, Simmer HufflePom has been asking for Jewish representation in The Sims 4 by adding Jewish head coverings and food like challa, babka, hamantashen and brisket,” said the petition, which drew nearly 800 signatures. “This has been done for other cultures like Muslims and it’s important for all cultures to feel represented in their beloved life simulation game.”  Some people who signed the petition said they were Jewish and wanted to have more true-to-life options when they played the game.  “I am Jewish and am tired of not being able to have Jewish Sims,” wrote a signer named Michelle Jackson. “Stuck eating just turkey or fish during grand meals.”  But others said their support for the Jewish expansion was less about their own identity than about an abiding belief that their favorite game should offer flexibility for users of all backgrounds.  “Everyone deserves representation. We need more cultural items and gameplay so people from anywhere can play their own lives because that has always been what the Sims is about,” a signer named Madison Graham wrote in November. “We did it with skin tones and pronouns, we can do it for Jewish rep too. No rep is too much or needless.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9qLXNwb3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMzOTbSAS1odHRwczovL20uanBvc3QuY29tL2otc3BvdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzM5Ni9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.  Good morning. You’re tempted to try a version of the Harvard newspaper’s headline after the underdog Crimson rallied to tie Yale in a 1968 football game: “Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.” Maybe: “Lakers beat Nuggets 126-132.” Both teams won something last night.  In other headlines:  • The Dodgers couldn’t find big hits against Minnesota and cost Clayton Kershaw a win, but they got encouraging news when Walker Buehler said he thinks he can return to pitch in September.  • The Angels were beaten in Baltimore as Jose Suarez’s replacement in the rotation was hit hard early.  • The NCAA transfer portal has led to important changes on the UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Long Beach State and Cal State Northridge basketball rosters.  • Jon Wilner reports on a bill in the California legislature that would further shake up college sports by creating revenue sharing between schools and major-sport athletes.  • New Sparks forward Dearica Hamby, whose allegations against the Las Vegas Aces were substantiated by the WNBA, said she expects to be ready to play in Friday’s season opener.  • “Angel City,” a three-part documentary about the founding and first season of Los Angeles’ women’s pro soccer team, takes on misconceptions about women’s sports, Damian Calhoun writes.  • Next week’s LA Grand Prix track and field meet at Drake Stadium will proceed without headliners Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Athing Mu, Scott Reid reports.  The Nuggets’ victory in Denver to open the NBA Western Conference finals was a missed opportunity for the Lakers to steal the first game on the road as they did in their playoff victories over Memphis and Golden State.  But it also should give the Lakers confidence they can get the road win they need as early as tomorrow and can handle the conference’s No. 1 seed.  After beginning the game sluggishly in Colorado’s rarified air and overmatched against the even more rarified Nikola Jokic, and quickly falling behind by 16 points in the first quarter, the Lakers played the Nuggets even-up and then outplayed them to make it a one-possession game late.  Going into the off day, the Nuggets have as much to figure out as the Lakers do.  “Slowing Jokic, a two-time NBA MVP, might prove to be impossible for the Lakers. Or anyone else,” reporter Eliott Teaford writes in the Southern California News Group papers this morning. “But summoning greater energy for Game 2 should be imperative for the Lakers.”  Jokic finished with 34 points, 21 rebounds and 14 assists – accounting for most of the Nuggets’ 15-5 edge in offensive rebounds – and won the anticipated battle with Anthony Davis even though the Lakers center was superb with 40 points and 10 rebounds.  As columnist Jim Alexander points out, making the Nuggets work for the win in a game they led by 21 in the second half isn’t all good news for the Lakers.  “LeBron James played 39:52 (minutes) and Davis 41:50, and accumulated mileage plus altitude plus one day between games does not do the Laker veterans any favors” going into Game 2, Alexander writes.  Catching their breath won’t be the Lakers’ only adjustment, and we saw the beginning of one in the middle of Game 1. After starting with Davis guarding Jokic as Coach Darvin Ham had said they would, the Lakers put Rui Hachimura on him beginning late in the third quarter, allowing Davis to roam. That made a difference, Jokic taking only two shots, missing them both, and committing a turnover when matched up with Hachimura in the fourth quarter.  Playing two games in one – 72-54 Denver for the first half, 72-60 L.A. for the second – gives both teams good reason for hope for the next three to six games.  “We’re up 1-0, so that beats the alternative,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said, sounding relieved late last night.  The Lakers were closing in at the end, and they should feel the same way.

game,1972-10-12,Not Discerned,"{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}",Wed 17 May 2023 18:36:00,"Welcome to the Hammer Factory. This month we dissect Demons of the Mind (1972).  While Hammer Studios has been in business since 1934, it was between 1955 and 1979 that it towered as one of the premier sources of edgy, gothic horror. On top of ushering the famous monsters of Universal’s horror heyday back into the public eye, resurrecting the likes of Frankenstein, Dracula and the Mummy in vivid color, the studio invited performers like Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt and so many more to step into the genre limelight. Spanning a library housing over 300 films, Hammer Studios is a key part of horror history that until recently has been far too difficult to track down.  In late 2018, Shout Factory’s Scream Factory line began to focus on bringing Hammer’s titles to disc in the US, finally making many of the studio’s underseen gems available in packages that offered great visuals as well as insightful accompanying features. Over the course of this column, I will focus on these releases, gauging the films in context of the Hammer Studio story as well as analyzing the merits of the release. It’s time to highlight the power, impact and influence of Hammer Studios and ignite new conversation surrounding some forgotten classics.  The Context  While Hammer had built its reputation on a foundation of gothic horror, classic monsters and marketable stars, the demands of the 1970’s genre audience challenged their tried-and-true production strategies sparking change and innovation. With a desire to expand the scope of their talent both on screen and off, Michael Carreras and his son and successor James turned their attention to sources outside of their usual circles for pitches and potential productions.  Having worked with the studio tangentially by penning the lyrics to the title song “Strange Love” for Lust for a Vampire (1971), producer Frank Godwin was one such fresh face. Along with prolific screenwriter Christopher Wicking, who had penned AIP favorites The Oblong Box (1969) and Cry of the Banshee (1970) along with Hammer’s own Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb (1971), Godwin approached Hammer with a concept based on a legend of his own fabrication.  Claiming that he read about it in a museum in Germany, Godwin pitched the story Blutlust. A 17th century folk tale chronicling high born families prone to incest and cursed with polluted blood, those infected were supposedly driven by the full moon to revitalize themselves by devouring human flesh. Godwin claimed that the only recourse was to sever the left hand, sapping the soiled blood and to finally drive a cross aflame into the heart of the impure. Based on the story, a screenplay was ordered and a poster commissioned with the intention of leaning on a lycanthropic angle to provide the film a monster to capitalize on in its campaign.  Wicking wrote Blood Will Have Blood in response, a Shakespeare reference that went over producer’s heads and was ultimately altered due to the overuse of the word “blood” in the title. It was a script that expanded upon Hammer’s tradition of gothic moviemaking, embracing moral ambiguity in the face of conservative righteousness and seeking out psychological terror in the place of monsters and cavernous castles. Steeped in metaphor and melodrama, what became Demons of the Mind (1972) was truly an original, modern take on the classical gothic and more in line with Roger Corman’s AIP Edgar Allan Poe cycle of films than anything Hammer had made with Frankenstein or Dracula in the title.  Peter Sykes was invited to direct in light of his horror film Venom (1971) and Hammer staple Arthur Grant was brought on as cinematographer in what would be his final credited film. Casting had its complications as Eric Porter, James Mason and Paul Scofield all turned down the leading role of Zorn before Robert Hardy finally accepted the mantle. Elizabeth was cast as Marianne Faithfull but she too had to be substituted at the last minute with Gillian Hills, as her openness about her drug use made it impossible to insure her on set. The casting delays pushed production back several months. In the meantime, Michael Carreras requested the removal of all werewolf adjacent narrative components for fear of a similarly poor box office reception to Hammer’s only other werewolf outing The Curse of the Werewolf (1961).  When all was said and done Demons of the Mind emerged as a fresh and distinct imagining of Hammer’s traditional gothic style. With Sykes’ experimental, strikingly beautiful visuals and Wicking’s anthropological approach to the mythology, characters and science of the story, the atmospheric poeticism of the classic gothic evolved onscreen, ready to meet a new audience. Unfortunately, distributor Anglo-EMI had ordered a Hammer movie and had received a movie which lacked all of the studio’s hallmarks. It seemed the very elements which made it artistically successful would be its commercial doom.  The film was shelved for over a year and finally released as the bottom half of a double bill with gratuitous slasher Tower of Evil (1972). It wouldn’t see US distribution until 1974 and would ultimately land to unenthusiastic reviews, relegated to the exploitation drive-in circuit. It would take decades for Demons of the Mind to be rediscovered and reappraised, finding acknowledgment long after the studio it was meant to help rejuvenate had met its unfortunate demise.  Still, few of Hammer’s efforts, especially those that came in its final years, represent the metamorphosis and creative revolution the studio was capable of like Demons of the Mind. A Freudian psychological terror that bridged the smaller thrillers and grander gothic pictures of Hammer’s past, ushering in a new, almost modern approach that might’ve welcomed the sort of audience that Hammer Studios so desperately needed had it been given the chance.  The Film  “‘Blood will have blood,’ they say. Well, there must be no more blood on our souls.”  A bustling carriage makes its way through the wood as its driver whips the horses to haste. A young woman inside reaches through the window but is pulled back by her caretaker who forces medicine upon her. The young woman’s consciousness blurs as the surrounding world dilutes as though filtered through a watery prism. Visions begin to penetrate the carriage ride as the woman finds herself running through the trees, disoriented and afraid, before coming upon a young man and a cottage. The ride continues as the burgeoning romance flashes in and out of the young woman’s memory, finally halted by a hulking man and the carriage in question. She’s taken to an old manor where her father awaits, praying over his deceased wife’s grave and pleading that his flesh and blood might bring him light instead of darkness.  From the beginning, Demons of the Mind is a different breed of Hammer horror movie. With its quiet, introspective and near wordless opening, the film ushers in a psychological undercurrent that moves hand in hand with the mesmerizing visuals. Taking full advantage of Christopher Wicking’s thought provoking script and Arthur Grant’s eye for lush visualization, director Peter Sykes uses every frame and set piece to tell a story in pictures and mood, crafting a metaphorical fantasy-like gothic the likes of which Hammer had never seen.  The story concerns Baron Zorn, a repressed man of a long decayed nobility, torn asunder by the neurotic madness that can only come from generations of incest and isolation. Convinced of a centuries-old evil that plagues his bloodline, Zorn imprisons his incestuous children, Emil and Elizabeth, and hires a doctor named Falkenberg to help root out the psychological demons inhabiting the minds of his accursed offspring. All the while, the nearby village is under assault from an unknown killer targeting young women who bear a striking resemblance to Elizabeth.  Channeling themes of class, generational trauma and corruption, the story offers a modernized, allegorical approach to the conventional gothic dynamic. Mental and intellectual complexity accompany key sequences, like when Zorn is being hypnotized by Falkenberg with a slowly rotating candle as images of violence and sexual duress play with liquidity over Zorn’s struggling eyes. It’s this sequence that sheds light on the origins of Emil and Elizabeth’s manias, for it reveals that Zorn’s wife killed herself in front of them after years of forced sexual repression and mental abuse.  The cast is made up of performers mostly new to Hammer, an effort that was purposeful and perhaps detrimental to its eventual release. Robert Hardy plays Zorn, a role akin to Vincent Price’s Roderick Usher and one that might have been better suited to Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee had Hammer been willing to consider it. Hardy’s take is heightened and exaggerated, at times feeling like an unflattering imitation of a gothic horror patriarch rather than an authentic performance embodying one. While serviceable throughout and a fine actor on the whole, Hardy’s turn in Demons of the Mind is easily its weakest element.  Conversely, Shane Briant and Gillian Hills are wonderful as Emil and Elizabeth. Briant’s lustful desperation and emotional confusion comes through with every pale and pathetic glance while Hills’ otherworldly disconnectedness and fluctuating emotional frailty shimmers throughout the film. Patrick Magee as Falkenberg is also a standout. Based on the real life story of German physician Franz Mesmer, Magee brings a pointed confidence and acuity for curiosity that a man pushing the boundaries of human understanding and consciousness would most certainly require. Rounding out the core cast is the great Yvonne Mitchell’s Aunt Hilda, obeying Zorn’s insane demands with cult-like belief and understated pathos.  Instead of supplemental, the nearby village serves as its own world, separate from the walls Zorn has constructed around himself. In this way, the film can explore the greater impact of the murders and the belief systems which arise to protect those that do not have the luxury of wealth or title. A traveling Priest presides there, played wonderfully by Michael Hordern, Hellbent on ridding the village of the terror that haunts it. There’s even a sequence depicting a ritualistic ceremony, born out of actual practices, complete with chanting, jeering and the burning of a pagan totem in the face of the village’s most sexually active occupant Inge, as portrayed by Virginia Wetherell. The scene is the type of proto-folk horror that one might expect to find in The Blood on Satan’s Claw (1971) or The Wicker Man (1973) and serves to further diversify the genre-bending approach Demons of the Mind takes to gothic horror.  Even the death sequences are handled with artistic care as the killer always sprinkles the bodies with rose petals, calling attention to the fragility and beauty of life and the physical form. The flowers seem to represent the stunting of a life in bloom, the pieces of potential lost in blood red shreds just as they achieve peak physicality. Emil is soon revealed to be the perpetrator, murdering Inge in the heat of passion after he was tricked into believing she was his sister Elizabeth.  The crux of his violent acts hangs on one fact. His broken, forbidden lust for his sister drives him to seek women who resemble Elizabeth. The truth of who they are shatters his fantasy and then he kills.  The film climaxes and concludes in tragedy, a nihilistic finish that has our fractured protagonists find no reward. Carl, played somewhat blandly by Paul Jones, is the closest thing the film has to a traditional hero, but he amounts to a non-entity in the film, an afterthought and reverie for Elizabeth to cling to but that offers little comfort against the horrors of her heritage. It’s a decision that feels purposeful and in line with the motivations of the story— it’s not about good triumphing over evil, rather the poisonousness of hysteria and its capacity for ruination.  Demons of the Mind contains some of the most grotesque and affecting sequences in Hammer’s canon, but not because of the onscreen effects. Rather, it’s the burrowing nature of its psychological horrors that make it so affecting along with the dreamy lyricism of its visual pallet. Like Elizabeth’s disorienting carriage ride in its opening moments, the film is a vision dancing in and out of darkness and light, unable to find footing in either shadow or sun.  The Special Features  This release comes equipped with the 2017 StudioCanal transfer that was released in the UK in its 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The transfer handles contrast well, accenting both the shadows and vibrant splashes of color that coexist throughout. The DTS-HD Master Mono track is crisp, servicing the dialogue and atmospheric score. A solid presentation for this underrated gem from Hammer’s vast catalogue.  Audio Commentary, by Steve Haberman  (Shout! Factory, 2020)  Author and film historian Steve Haberman returns to deliver an insightful track chronicling the history of the production and the many creatives who coalesced to bring the film together. He details Frank Godwin’s faux legend of Blutlust and the way in which Christopher Wicking and Peter Sykes transformed it into what would become Demons of the Mind. He provides a detailed history of the actors and crew along with his own personal analysis of the film’s themes and evolved gothic stylings. It’s a wonderful, informative listen that any fan of Hammer or the film would benefit from hearing.  Audio Commentary, by Director Peter Sykes, Writer Christopher Wicking, Actress Virginia Wetherell— Moderated by Author Film Historian Jonathan Scott  (Anchor Bay, 2002)  Ported over from the original US DVD release, this commentary collects many of the film’s key creatives to provide a more anecdotal history of Demons of the Mind. Virginia Wetherell recalls working with Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sykes muses on the creative decisions at work on the screen, not to mention the purported criminal who owned the manor they were shooting in. From Christopher Wicking’s dealings with Vincent Price at AIP to his efforts to connect Hammer with Marvel Comics, a great deal of stories are told. It’s a fun and fascinating track that offers an inside look into the film, the studio and the industry at the time.  Blood will have blood: Inside Demons of the Mind (15:42)  (StudioCanal, 2017)  A collection of renowned Hammer historians, including Kevin Lyons, Jonathan Rigby, Alan Barnes and John Johnston, discuss the film and its place in Hammer history on this brief reflection ported over from the UK StudioCanal release of the film. Beginning with the disparate elements that formulated the script to the film’s eventual issues with release and distribution, this high level discussion covers a lot of ground. As is usual with these types of vignettes, it offers a satisfying and digestible overview.  Interview with Camera Operator Neil Binney (3:41)  (Shout! Factory, 2019)  Excised from an interview that was included on Shout! Factory’s release of Blood From the Mummy’s Tomb, this chat with Neil Binney provides a short and sweet recollection. He recalls shooting the rotating candle, issues with laughing on set and the consummate professionalism of Arthur Grant. It’s quick and airy, but a nice inclusion.  Theatrical Trailer (2:57)  “What madness lies like a curse upon this family?” the voice asks as people hurry down a hallway while a caretaker fumbles with keys in hot pursuit. Images of a man cornering a woman in the woods and a spinning candle accompanied by odd, off-putting music passes by whilst the same voice speaks of secrets and conspiracies binding brother and sister together. A pagan ritual unfolds “as old as the druids” as the players are introduced with title cards, leading to the bold, red words: A NIGHTMARE OF TERROR. An eye fills the frame as a girl runs out of breath in the background— DEMONS OF THE MIND.  Final Thoughts  Despite Hammer’s efforts to escape their gothic laden past as the 1970’s dawned, it seems that their future could well have been solidified in embracing and progressing their foundational design rather than suppressing it. The creatives behind Demons of the Mind understood that sentiment, even if the studio and distributors did not.  Shout! Factory preserves this piece of somewhat forgotten Hammer history for the US audience in a release that ports over the transfer and special features from the StudioCanal UK Blu-ray of the film. Steve Haberman’s commentary track is the standout benefit of the disc, arriving as an invaluable resource to those seeking to understand the machinations and thematics of the film and its production. All told, this is a fine release and an essential title for any Hammer enthusiast’s collection.  Over the years, Hammer’s horror films delved ever deeper into the murky depths of morality and the magnetic allure of the occult. Still, their key titles and directors tended to stick to more conservative perspectives, as is the case in something like Terrence Fisher’s The Devil Rides Out (1968). While the 1970s brought about the studio’s downfall, it also marked the exciting collision of their classic “Golden Age” methodologies with a more modernized approach to psychological terror that traversed far more ground than “right” or “wrong”.  With movies like Countess Dracula (1971), Twins of Evil (1971) and eventually Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter (1974), Hammer was combining fresh voices with their signature style and forging new genre possibilities out of tired trends. Demons of the Mind is further proof that, even toward the end, Hammer was a studio with something to add to the broader creative conversation and one can’t help but wonder what might’ve been had the audience been given the opportunity to properly hear what they had to say.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2R5LWRpc2d1c3RpbmcuY29tL3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLzM3NjI1OTAvd2h5LXdheWZvcndhcmRzLTIwMDktaG9ycm9yLWdhbWUtbGl0LWRlc2VydmVzLWEtc2Vjb25kLWNoYW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2016-07-06,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 00:25:23,"Pokemon GO developer Niantic has soft-launched its next free-to-play augmented reality game, Marvel World of Heroes in Australia. Based on the Marvel comic book universe, it casts players as an accidental hero that must team up with famous Marvel heroes, clean up crime in their neighbourhoods, and fight supervillains in the process. It’s now available on the Australian iOS App Store, and Google Play Store.  The Australian soft-launch of Marvel World of Heroes comes shortly after the global launch of Niantic’s Tamagotchi-inspired game, Peridot.  Like Peridot and Pokemon GO, Marvel World of Heroes encourages you to go out into the real world (the ‘Real-World Metaverse,’ as Niantic puts it).  Patrolling your neighbourhood will reveal packs of bad guys to fight in cinematic, turn-based battles with flashy animations.  The combat system is relatively simple – each character has an armour meter and a health meter, and players will need to use a mix of ranged and melee attacks to strategically whittle away the assailants. Players can bring two teammates into battle – the game prominently features newer Marvel heroes such as Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan), and America Chavez, though much-beloved characters like Wolverine, Iron Man, Venom, and several of their associates are also available to eventually unlock.  The game’s progression revolves around a gacha/loot box system, which randomly provides you with currency, weapons, costume parts, and health replenishment – which allows you to keep taking on battles. Loot boxes can be found after various battles, though they will need keys to unlock – keys which are gradually granted over time, or can be purchased from the store.  From initial impressions, Marvel World of Heroes looks like a far more involved and action-packed twist on Niantic’s augmented reality game concepts. Given the strong appeal of Marvel properties, it’s likely the company has high expectations for its success when it eventually sees a global release.  However, it’s worth noting the company’s foray into Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, was shut down after just three years in operation.  frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"" allowfullscreen>  On the opposite spectrum, Pokemon GO remains a force to be reckoned with, years after its initial boom.

Thursday, the Dodgers placed May on the injured list with a ""right forearm strain.""  After the game Wednesday, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts told reporters that May was diagnosed with a flexor pronator strain in his throwing elbow and that there's no timetable for a return to the rotation, but said ""the floor"" would be a month off. The injury did not appear to involve May's surgically reconstructed UCL, a source tells The Athletic's Fabian Ardaya.  May, 25, had surrendered a hit and struck out two batters on 16 pitches during his abbreviated outing. Despite those results, he had shown greatly diminished velocity on his pitches. Statcast had him averaging 94.7 mph on his sinker, a two full ticks below his season average. Additionally, his cutter was down 2.2 mph from his norm and all of his offerings had reduced spin rates.  May has already missed significant time in recent years. He underwent Tommy John surgery in May 2021 and was able to return to game action last August, when he ended up pitching six times down the stretch. (Tommy John surgery is often considered to include at least a 14-month recover these days, with some teams taking an even more conservative approach.)  May has tallied a 2.63 ERA (167 ERA+) and a 2.13 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 48 innings over his first nine starts.  The Dodgers, who are now 28-16 record on the season and in first place in the National League West, are already without several other key pitchers. Walker Buehler is hoping to make a September return following his own Tommy John surgery.

It starts with the opening: a gorgeous, pre-rendered movie of pure eye candy tastefully showcasing events from the game; no spoilers, just promises of what was to come with elegant characters capable of expressing emotion amid beautiful landscapes and environments. And it wasn’t just the opening: Each character’s introduction cutscene was full of life, making them instantly memorable and charismatic despite never speaking an actual voiced word.  On original, period-appropriate hardware, Final Fantasy VIII’s real-time polygon characters sat perfectly against the pre-rendered 2D backdrops—and in a way that the current Remastered version does not replicate (it’s making me rethink my current playthrough of the modern release in favor of the original). In select sequences, FF8 would also do this wondrous thing where the characters would be controllable over a pre-rendered cutscene, making it feel like you were actually playing amid those gorgeous visuals. Leaving the infirmary is a great example early on, but so is the Edea sequence in Deling City.  Final Fantasy VIII’s environments were a beautiful dreamy landscape of science fiction meets fantasy. The Lunatic Pandora, Sorceress Memorial, the halls of the Ragnarok, and more were all brought to life with delightfully clear pre-rendered backdrops that felt like real, lived-in places. The game weaves its gorgeous riddle of a fantasy tale through that fantastic visual fidelity, and is a large part of why I’m becoming more and more convinced that Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite of the era. — Claire Jackson",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8va290YWt1LmNvbS9iZXN0LWdhbWUtZ3JhcGhpY3MtcHM1LXhib3gtbmludGVuZG8tc3dpdGNoLXBjLWFsbC10aW1lLTE4NTA0NDQ3NjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Discover GG  Gala Games announced this week that it has removed or “burned” almost 21 billion GALA tokens after completing its V2 token airdrop—more than $637 million worth at the time of the burns—from its own reserves in an effort to reduce concerns surrounding a possible “dump and exit” scenario.  “The tokens we hold we have received as ecosystem rewards over the last several years,” the Gala Games team wrote in a blog post. “While they have always been tokens we were to use to fund the growth and curation of the ecosystem, we know that many people see them as a fundamental risk to the overall tokenomics of the project.”  AD  AD  In short, Gala Games believes that the massive token burn will help reduce concern among holders who may worry that the company could sell off mass amounts of its token—a move which could lead to a decline in price.  Gala detailed its approach to the burn in the post, noting that it had already planned to burn 2 billion GALA tokens as part of its “2023 Vision Paper” for the year. Another 3.96 billion tokens were then burned, which Gala Games said was “equivalent to the total revenue in GALA we have ever received.”  The additional and largest burn of 15 billion tokens represents Gala’s response to community concerns over the noted “dump and exit” possibility. Gala pointed to on-chain Ethereum network transactions for each part of the overall token burn, and wrote in the post that it represented $660 million worth of tokens. According to CoinGecko data, the tokens were collectively worth approximately $637 million at the time of the burns.  Gala Games—the publisher behind Web3 games like Mirandus, Grit, and The Walking Dead: Empires—also burned the tokens with its future in mind, the firm’s President of Blockchain Jason Brink told Decrypt in a message.  “At a fundamental level, we believe that if the ecosystem is going to work and be sustainable in the long-term, we need to be able to live off the rewards we receive from the ecosystem as well—not have a gigantic pile of GALA we could dip into whenever,” Brink said.  The executive added that post-burn, Gala’s own treasury is now “almost completely eliminated.”  “It also means that rewards for Founders Node operators will go up roughly 4x because the halving is supply-based,” Brink added of the rewards for those who operate Gala nodes, which validate crypto transactions for the network.

game,2023-05-17,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 20:41:21,"When the Stars escaped with a 2-1 victory in Game 7 against the Seattle Kraken to keep their season alive, one glaring statistic nearly got in the way of the triumphant victory.  The Kraken blocked 21 of Dallas’ shots Monday night — 13 of which came in the first period. Kraken defenseman Adam Larsson had a team-high six blocks, including four in the first 20 minutes.  During Dallas’ first-period power play, Seattle blocked seven shots and did not allow a single attempt on goal during the only man-advantage the Stars had that night, despite Dallas keeping the puck in their offensive zone for almost the entire two minutes.  Though frustrating, Dallas wasn’t fazed. It proceeded to take a lead during the second period on Roope Hintz’s goal and put the game away in the third with a score from Wyatt Johnston.  Ticket Ticker Get the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more. Email Address By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy SUBMIT  But as the Stars prepare to face the Las Vegas Golden Knights in the Western Conference finals beginning Friday, blocked shots could once again be a determining factor.  Vegas led the NHL in blocked shots per 60 minutes this regular season with 17.94 a game. In the playoffs, it increased that average to 18.87, good for second in the league.  That’s a significant increase from the Kraken, which ranked 25th in the league in blocked shots in the regular season and fifth in the playoffs.  Meanwhile, Dallas ranks 13th in the postseason in that same category.  As playoff hockey intensifies, the window to get off shots closes. Against a speedy Vegas team, finding those openings will be crucial for the Stars, head coach Pete DeBoer said.  “They’re going to block shots,” DeBoer told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “I don’t have a magic plan that we’re gonna go, and all of a sudden, they’re not gonna block a bunch of shots next game, but we’ve got to find a way to get enough through to win games.”  Stars forward Jason Robertson has specifically put focus on the number of his shots that have been blocked. Back in the 2021-22 season, he ranked 13th among NHL forwards with 107 of his shots blocked. He spent the offseason watching all 400 shots he took the season before, studying how to prevent those blocks from continuing.  According to statistical website Hockey Reference, Robertson ranked second on the Stars in the regular season in total shots and unblocked shots. In the postseason, he dropped to third in total shots and fourth in unblocked attempts.  MoneyPuck.com’s advanced statistics have Robertson ranked second on the Stars in the regular season with 153 of his 565 attempts (27.1%) blocked. That number has risen slightly in the postseason with 23 of his 82 shots stopped by defensemen (28%).  The Stars also finished with the highest percentage of shots blocked as a team in the regular season at 28.18%. In the postseason, 29.65% of Dallas’ shots have been blocked, which ranks seventh.  Given Seattle’s ability to block 44 of Dallas’ shots over the last two games and Vegas’ success in that category, DeBoer said Wednesday that is one of his opponent’s strengths the Stars have identified heading into the series. But he’s confident how the team overcame the wall the Kraken put up in Game 7 will bode well for its success in the conference finals.  “That Game 7 we played against Seattle will translate to anybody we play the rest of the way here,” he said.

BEARS IN GAME 3  HARTFORD, CT – The Hartford Wolf Pack have their backs against the wall for the first time during the 2023 Calder Cup Playoffs. Tonight, the Pack will look to keep their magical season alive as they try to stave off elimination against the Hershey Bears in Game Three of the 2023 Atlantic Division Finals.  Puck drop is set for 7:00 p.m. and coverage is available on both AHLTV and Mixlr.  Tale of The Tape:  The Wolf Pack and Bears met six times during the 2022-23 regular season, with the Bears taking four of the six meetings. Hershey ended the season series with a 4-2-0-0 record, while the Wolf Pack posted a mark of 2-3-0-1. The Bears won two of three meetings at the XL Center, going 2-1-0-0. They claimed a 2-1 victory on November 25th and a 1-0 shootout decision on November 26th.  Hartford won 4-2 on October 28th, their lone home-ice win in the season series. That victory was their first of the season.  The Bears won each of the final three regular-season meetings between the clubs and have since extended the winning streak to five games with victories in Games One and Two. In Game Two, the Bears put the Wolf Pack on the brink of elimination with a 4-2 triumph.  Mason Morelli opened the scoring 3:12 into the tilt, converting on the first powerplay attempt of the game. Will Cuylle drew Hartford even at 11:32, burying a centering pass for a powerplay goal of his own. The goal was Cuylle’s first career Calder Cup Playoff tally.  The draw would last just 72 seconds, however.  Beck Malenstyn sprung into the offensive zone and snapped a shot by Dylan Garand to give the Bears a lead they never lost. Mike Vecchione potted the eventual game-winning tally 8:48 into the middle stanza, making it 3-1 at the time. Hendrix Lapierre would then convert an odd-man rush at 13:14 of the third period, putting the Bears ahead 4-1 and cementing the 2-0 series lead.  Adam Clendening scored at 15:09 for Hartford, firing home his second goal of the postseason. It would not be enough to spark a rally, however.  Hartford’s last victory against Hershey came on November 20th by a score of 4-2 at the Giant Center.  Wolf Pack Outlook:  The Wolf Pack have dropped back-to-back games for the first time since a four-game losing streak (0-3-1-0) that spanned from March 5th through March 11th. After going 1-for-2 on Saturday in Game Two, the Wolf Pack powerplay is 3-for-6 in the Atlantic Division Finals. They had been 2-for-16 through five prior playoff games.  Cuylle’s powerplay goal in the first period of Game Two was the first goal of his Calder Cup Playoff career. He became the tenth Wolf Pack player to score his first career playoff goal this spring.  Tanner Fritz, who racked up two assists in Game Two, leads the club in playoff scoring with ten points (1 g, 9 a) through eight games. It was Fritz’s third multi-point game of the postseason. Lauri Pajuniemi, meanwhile, paces the club in goals with four.  Bears Outlook:  The Bears finished second in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference with a record of 44-19-5-4 during the regular season. Their 97 points placed them fourth overall in the entire AHL during the 2022-23 regular season. The Bears received a First Round bye in the 2023 Calder Cup Playoffs, then eliminated the Charlotte Checkers in four games (3-1) in the Atlantic Division Semifinals.  During the regular season, the Bears were the stingiest defensive team in the Eastern Conference, allowing just 184 goals. Only the Calgary Wranglers (174) allowed fewer goals in the entire league.  The eleven goals allowed by Hershey through six playoff games are tied for the fewest allowed by any team with a minimum of five games played. They are tied with the Texas Stars.  Aliaksei Protas (3 g, 4 a) and Sam Anas (2 g, 5 a) are tied for the team lead in points with seven each. Protas, Morelli, and Connor McMichael are all tied for the team lead in goals with three each through six games.

In an interview with Rolling Stones UK, Bond was asked how developers can see success on Xbox.

Bond says Xbox is looking into other strategies, too.  ""We've talked about how we're experimenting with other models, like what does it mean for advertising in games which is more prevalent in mobile--are there models of that that work well in PC and console?

Bodie also said that Jesper Frödén would re-join the Firebirds, provided he clears waivers. Frödén cleared waivers Wednesday.  Kartye, the American Hockey League rookie of the year, was a breakout star for the Kraken after joining the team in their first round series against the Colorado Avalanche. He and Frödén combined for 55 goals and 54 assists for the Firebirds this season.  Kartye, a 22-year-old forward, scored three goals and added two assists in 10 games for the Kraken this postseason. He scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game, becoming just the eighth player to do that in the playoffs.  Frödén, a 28-year-old forward, played one playoff game with the Kraken. He was the Firebirds’ leading goal scorer until he was called up to Seattle on Feb. 23, having recorded 47 points (25 goals, 27 assists) in 44 games.  Driedger is a goaltender who has started 60 NHL playoff games.

Coachella Valley will also benefit from Monday’s return of AHL all-star Andrew Poturalski, a 29-year-old center who has won a pair of Calder Cups and led the league in points last season.

They have split the first two, with Baltimore winning 7-3 last night.  The Orioles (27-15) remain 4.5 games behind Tampa Bay, which won again Tuesday night. Overall, the Orioles are 5-3 on this 10-game homestand; they are 14-7 in home games for the season and 9-2 in their last 11 games versus the Angels.

game,2023-05-17,22:00:00,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 13:04:51,"As a fan of the Bayonetta action franchise, I admittedly had low expectations for “Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.”  I say that as someone who has played countless spin-offs of popular games that proved to either be underwhelming or were blatantly obvious cash grabs.  Once in a while, however, you get gems such as Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance that do justice to the popular franchise that they were born from. Now we have another game to add to the list with Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.  More:Is the Dream Controller worth the price?  It’s the spinoff game that I didn’t know I needed — until I played it, that is.  The story of a younger, less confident Bayonetta  Chesire, we’re not in Kansas anymore.  More accurately, we’re not in the same type of Bayonetta game anymore as Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon serves up a different gameplay style from the fare that franchise fans have come to know and love.  Gone are the 3D models based on stylized realism as well as the kinetic action that the main line Bayonetta games are known for. Instead, you have a storybook approach that uses narration and visuals that emulate dreamy watercolors and pastels.  It’s an approach that is reminiscent of games such as “The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince” and “The Cruel King and the Great Hero” from Nippon Ichi Software — two games that I absolutely love, by the way. It’s also an approach that is likely to be polarizing for some Bayonetta fans, especially those who expect something more similar to the typical Bayonetta action games.  Such a reaction would be understandable.  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon looks like a complete departure from the games that inspired it. Instead of the confident and sensual Umbran Witch, Bayonetta Origins shows a much younger and even much less confident witch apprentice filled with plenty of fear and self-doubt.  Some might not like to see this particular Cereza. As someone who loves storytelling, however, seeing this more vulnerable side of her while knowing the kind of powerful and confident character she ultimately turns into in the future was quite heartwarming.  Many times, I found myself going, “aww, hang in there little one” as young Cereza struggles to find her way out of the forbidden Avalon Forest while looking for a mysterious power to save her mother. In this case, knowledge of the three original Bayonetta games instantly grants character development for Cereza in this game among fans who know her full story.  Equally heartwarming is her relationship with Cheshire, the wayward demon from hell who Cereza accidentally summons into her stuffed toy cat. What starts as a partnership of convenience ultimately turns into a powerful bond of friendship — one that ultimately drives the heart-wrenching culmination of Bayonetta Origins’ tale.  The original Bayonetta games gave me excitement and chills as I played through the awesome sequences of those games. In contrast, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon never got my heart pumping but it did do one thing. The dang thing actually made me almost cry. OK maybe I cried just a little bit. Either that or a bunch of onion-cutting ninjas invaded my living room. Dang it, now I think I’ve got something in my eye.  In some cases, the narrative of Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon — while seemingly understated — ends up being more powerful than the storytelling in the original games. It’s certainly one of the game’s strengths for sure.  Don’t sleep on the action in Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon  One of the more surprising things about Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is just how solid the action is.  While action is the calling card of Bayonetta 1, Bayonetta 2 and Bayonetta 3, I didn’t expect Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon to have compelling gameplay.  Boy, was I wrong.  While Bayonetta Origins doesn’t have the same fast-paced action that the original Bayonetta games were known for, its more deliberately paced gameplay proved to be fun in its own way. It’s honestly what sets it apart from the Liar Princess and Cruel King games, which boasted excellent storytelling but weren’t as polished when it came to their gameplay.  A mix of adventure, puzzle-solving and action, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon conjures a pretty fun experience as you try to explore the many twists and turns of the mysterious Avalon Forest.  As the sanctuary of mischievous and even devious scheming faeries, Avalon Forest can be a magical maze filled with deadly creatures, traps and illusions. As you venture through the forest, you’ll have to figure out how to traverse and reach various places while collecting resources that you can use for crafting potions and other items. Along the way, part of your job is to also break the illusions from otherworldly realms known as Tir na Nogs, which essentially serve as dungeon trials for Cereza to overcome.  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon also serve up several optional activities throughout its many chapters. These include acquiring collectibles or doing sidequests such as rescuing wisps to gain various rewards. There’s certainly a lot to do for folks who like trudging off the beaten path.  The biggest surprise for me, however, was the action, which is quite solid.  Instead of the fast-paced, combo-driven action of the original games, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon has you controlling both Cereza and Cheshire at the same time. This can be done independently via the two analog sticks, with the left one controlling Cereza and the right one controlling Cheshire when the demon is summoned.  Unlike her adult version in the Bayonetta games, this game’s Cereza is not a fighter but more of a support character who backs up Cheshire. Cereza, for example, can be used to hold foes in place via spells while Cheshire beats them up with brute demonic force. There will also be times when you need to control both of them while taking different paths so they can meet up again.  Admittedly, controlling both at the same time can be discombobulating at first, kind of like learning to drum with a double bass. Once you get used to it, though, it turns out to be quite the fun session. Cheshire can also do things when unsummoned and hidden in Cereza’s cat plushie. These include triggering bear traps or helping our little witch vault over gaps.  Add a skill tree for both Cereza and Cheshire and you have a pretty deep system for a story-based adventure game. It’s something I honestly did not expect and it’s a big reason why I like this game even more.  Granted, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is not perfect. The game can be susceptible to difficulty spikes that can be exacerbated by having to control two different characters at the same time. It can also be quite wordy during its narrative sequences, which I personally don’t have a problem with but others might react differently. The game’s map could be better implemented as well as it can be confusing at times.  The biggest issue, however, will arise from Bayonetta fans who get this game expecting it to feel more like a traditional Bayonetta game, which it is not. This is an action adventure puzzler — and a good one at that — so it’s important to be aware of just exactly what this game is.  That being said, while Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a marked departure from the aesthetics and fast-paced action of the main series, it still emanates the Bayonetta franchise’s soul.  In an industry where it can be risky to experiment, it’s nice to see developers take that risk and come up with something new and different. This honestly plays like an incredibly polished indie game, one that likely would have been lauded if it wasn’t attached to a well known IP. Just like I think Capcom should be commended for coming up with something like Monster Hunter Stories 2, I think Platinum should be commended for Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon.  I originally started out unsure of this game when I first saw it. Now I’m glad that I gave it a chance and actually played it. I just hope the game does well so we get a sequel.  Final thoughts on Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon  Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a totally different take on the Bayonetta formula, eschewing the series’ kinetic action for a story-driven game that’s part action adventure and dungeon puzzler. Fans expecting good, old Bayonetta action might feel disappointed with it. Folks who aren’t married to classic Bayonetta, however, will find a great experience with a compelling story and surprisingly solid tandem action between Cereza and her rambunctious demon summon Cheshire. It’s certainly one of the best gaming surprises of 2023.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZ2ouY29tL3N0b3J5L2xpZmUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9iYXlvbmV0dGEtb3JpZ2lucy1jZXJlemEtYW5kLXRoZS1sb3N0LWRlbW9uLWlzLWJheW9uZXR0YS1nYW1lLWktZGlkbnQta25vdy1pLW5lZWRlZC83MDIyNjI4ODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-10-01,Not Discerned,"{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 20:48:13,"Most NFL teams have signed the free agents they sought, the draft is in the rearview mirror and OTAs are beginning next week. So now is the perfect time to break down the Browns’ 2023 schedule.  Using strength of schedule as a barometer, a tabulation that takes into account the aggregate 2022 record of the opponents on the 2023 slate, the Browns have the seventh-easiest schedule (26th of 32 teams) in the league. Their upcoming opponents were a combined 131-154-2 last season. The Bengals’ strength of schedule ranks 17th (146-140-2), the Ravens 21st (138-147-2) and the Steelers 25th (134-151-2).  Weeks 1-4  Bengals home Sept. 10, at Pittsburgh Sept 18, Titans home Sept. 24, Ravens home Oct. 1.  The Browns are the only team in the NFL playing half their division schedule in the first four weeks of the season.  “I think it’s a unique thing to have the three division opponents in the first four weeks,” Coach Kevin Stefanski said. “I believe we’re the only team that has that in the NFL, and I look at it as a great opportunity.”  The heavy AFC North schedule to start the season might tempt Stefanski to play his starters in the preseason more than he normally would. He said he isn’t ready to make that decision yet.  The Browns have won their season opener only twice since 1999, but one of those victories came last year when Cade York kicked a 58-yard field goal on the final play to beat the Panthers, 26-24. The other was in 2004 when they beat the Ravens, 20-3.  • Cincinnati is 22-11 over the past two seasons, and Joe Burrow has the best set of receivers in the league with Ja’Marr Chase, Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins. But Stefanski is 5-1 vs. the Bengals.  The revamped defense with Juan Thornhill at safety plus Za’Darius Smith at end and Dalvin Tomlinson at tackle is going to get the chance out of the gate to prove how much better it is.  The Browns finish the regular season in Cincinnati the first weekend in January on a date to be determined.  • The “Monday Night Football” game with the Steelers Sept. 18 and a Thursday night home game with the Jets on Dec. 28 are the only prime-time games on the Browns’ schedule. That could change late in the season if they are playing well enough to have a game flexed.  The Browns haven’t won in Pittsburgh since they beat the Steelers, 33-13, in a Sunday night game in 2003 when Tim Couch was the quarterback. Deshaun Watson was 8 years old at the time.  Running against the Steelers is always difficult. They gave up only seven rushing touchdowns in 2022, and they improved by drafting cornerback Joey Porter Jr. in the second round and defensive tackle Keeanu Benton in the third round.  Watson is 0-2 in his career vs. the Steelers. He was sacked seven times as the Browns’ starting quarterback in the season finale last year. Except for James Hudson starting at right tackle in place of injured Jack Conklin, Watson will be playing behind the same offensive line.  The Browns will host the Steelers on Nov. 19.  • The Titans drafted quarterback Will Levis from Kentucky with the second pick in the second round last month. Ryan Tannehill is the veteran starter. Titans coach Mike Vrabel, a hard-nosed linebacker in his playing days, won’t just hand the job to Levis. The Browns should expect to see Tannehill, especially since they’re playing Tennessee so early in the season.  *The game with the Ravens at Cleveland Browns Stadium on Oct. 1 features two very rich quarterbacks — Watson vs. Lamar Jackson, who after two years of haggling signed a five-year, $260 million contract with the Ravens. Watson is in the second year of his five-year, $230 million deal.  Both teams are vastly improved at wide receiver. The Browns traded for Elijah Moore, signed Marquise Goodwin in free agency and drafted Cedric Tillman. The Ravens signed Odell Beckham Jr. plus Nelson Agholor. They used their first draft pick (22nd overall) on Zay Flowers from Boston College.  The Browns are on their bye Oct. 8. They play the Ravens in Baltimore on Nov. 12.  Weeks 6-9  49ers home Oct. 15, at Colts Oct. 22, at Seahawks Oct. 29, Cardinals home Nov. 5.  • The 49ers expect quarterback Brock Purdy to be ready for the regular season. Purdy suffered a right elbow injury that required surgery to repair when he was sacked on the first series of the NFC championship game with the Eagles in January.  San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan, a former Browns offensive quarterback, recently told an audience of 49ers fans “I think (Purdy is) gonna be a lot better” than last year when Purdy was 5-0 as a starter with 13 touchdown passes and four interceptions.  Purdy was selected with the 262nd and final pick in the 2022 draft, making him Mr. Irrelevant. Trey Lance and Sam Darnold are the quarterbacks behind him.  • The Colts are in a massive rebuild. Shane Steichen, formerly the offensive coordinator of the Eagles, is in his first year as head coach in Indianapolis. The Colts used their first draft pick, pick fourth overall, on quarterback Anthony Richardson from Florida.  Steichen wants to pattern the Colts’ offense after the way the Eagles played. But he doesn’t have Jalen Hurts at quarterback, nor the Philadelphia defense that allowed the Eagles to play from ahead most of the time.  • Seahawks coach Pete Carroll is in his 50th year of coaching. He will be 72 by the time the Browns play his team in Seattle.  The Seahawks are riding quarterback Geno Smith, who last season had the best year of his career. He completed an NFL-best 69.8 percent of his passes (399/572 4,282 yards) with 30 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. Still, the Seahawks were only 9-8.  Seattle had four selections among the top 52 picks in the 2023 draft. They took Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon fifth overall and Ohio State wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba 20th.  • Bet on it — Stefanski will say the Cardinals are a very good team before the Browns host Arizona on Nov. 5. But this could be the easiest game on the schedule. Quarterback Kyler Murray has a long road of recovery ahead of him after undergoing knee surgery in late January.  Colt McCoy, a third-round draft pick by the Browns in 2010, David Blough and rookie Clayton Tune, a fifth-round pick from the University of Houston, are vying for the starting quarterback job while Murray mends.  Weeks 10-13  At Ravens Nov. 12, Steelers home Nov. 19, at Broncos Nov. 26, at Rams Dec. 3.  This figures to be the toughest part of the schedule with three of the four games on the road. The Browns are planning to spend a week in Los Angeles after playing in Denver rather than flying home and returning to the west coast six days later.  • The NFL will know weeks before the Browns play in Denver whether the problem with the Broncos last year was coaching or whether quarterback Russell Wilson has a bad case of diminishing skills.  The Broncos hired Sean Payton to revive Wilson, who was 4-11 as a starter last year with 16 touchdown passes and 11 interceptions. He was sacked a league-high 55 times. He has been sacked 183 times over the past four years.  Denver did not use a draft pick on an offensive lineman until they selected Oregon center Alex Forsyth in the seventh round. They did, however, sign offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey (49ers) and guard Ben Powers (Ravens) to four-year deals on the first day of free agency.  • The Rams went from Super Bowl champs in the 2021 season to 5-12 last year. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is healthy after missing eight games with a back injury in 2022 when he was 3-6 as a starter.  Star defensive tackle Aaron Donald missed the last six games because of an ankle injury and wide receiver Cooper Kupp needed ankle surgery after being injured in the ninth game. The Rams are healthy again, but they are eyeing 2024 to contend with the 49ers for the top spot in the NFC West.  Weeks 14-18  Jaguars home Dec. 10. Bears home TBD, at Texans Dec. 24, Jets home Dec. 28, at Bengals TBD.  *The Jaguars won the AFC South last season, albeit with a 9-8 record. They are counting on Coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Trevor Lawrence to continue to improve together.  Wide receiver Calvin Ridley is new to the Jaguars. He was suspended all of 2022 for betting on games when he was with the Falcons in 2021. The Jaguars acquired him in a trade with the Falcons for a sixth-round pick in 2023 and a fourth-round pick in 2024 while he was suspended.  The Jags want to improve their pass rush, but failed to do that in free agency or the draft. The Jaguars had only 28 sacks last season. Notably, they signed former Browns running back D’Ernest Johnson in free agency.  • The Bears earned the first pick in the draft by finishing 3-14 last year. They traded it to the Panthers. Carolina used it on quarterback Bryce Young from Alabama.  The trade was a show of faith in Justin Fields as the Bears quarterback. The trade with the Panthers sent wide receiver DJ Moore to Chicago. The Bears strengthened their offensive line by signing guard Nate Davis in free agency and drafting Tennessee tackle Darnell Wright 10th overall with a pick acquired in the trade with the Panthers.  • Houston would have had the first pick in the draft, but the Texans beat the Colts, 32-31, to finish 3-13-1. Having the second pick meant settling for the second-best quarterback in the draft — C.J. Stroud from Ohio State.  The Texans are betting favorites in only three games this season. They are four-point underdogs to the Browns on early betting lines.  Houston had the third pick in the draft and used it on edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. from Alabama.  • The Dec. 28 Thursday night game might be the last chance for Browns fans to see Aaron Rodgers in person in the NFL.  The Jets are expected to make the playoffs. They finished 7-10 last year, but they lost their last six games because they didn’t have a legitimate starting quarterback. Rodgers changes that.  • Ending the season the way it started, with a game against the Bengals, this time in Cincinnati, could define the Browns’ season. The Browns may have already clinched a playoff spot or they might need to win to make the postseason.  There is one other possibility. It will be an interesting offseason if the Browns are out of contention on the final weekend.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MtaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2Jyb3ducy0yMDIzLXNjaGVkdWxlLWJyZWFrZG93bi1nYW1lLWJ5LWdhbWXSAVdodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLWhlcmFsZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9icm93bnMtMjAyMy1zY2hlZHVsZS1icmVha2Rvd24tZ2FtZS1ieS1nYW1lL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2004-07-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 19:00:59,"As long as there have been videogames, there have been penalties for dying in videogames. In the earliest days dying meant losing out on a high score or having to put another coin in the arcade machine. As technology progressed, so did our protections against the harshest deaths—we got saves, checkpoints, bonfires. But a few game developers decided all that progress was nonsense. Games didn't just need to be harder, actually—they needed to be mean as hell.  And thus the cruelest game mechanic of all time was born: XP debt.  I first came across this abomination of game design playing 2004’s otherwise outstanding MMO City of Heroes. The twisted idea behind XP debt is this: if you die, a percentage of your XP bar is turned into debt. As long as you're in debt, your XP gain is reduced, usually by half, until the debt is repaid. From there, you can resume your merry way leaping from building to building doing hero stuff, battling baddies, saving citizens, having your dial-up connection severed because someone needed to make a phone call…  XP debt and dial-up were a truly agonizing combination.  Now, as an ancient MMO guy myself, I can hear all you other ancient MMO guys lurching from your Aeron chairs ready to ‘Well, akshually’ me about how other death penalties were just as brutal. I’ve been there: I’ve bound my EverQuest toon at the Temple of Veeshan, fallen asleep during a Vulak standoff, and woken up to my character losing a month’s worth of progress as he respawns, dies, respawns, dies, respawns, cries. I’ve carefully taken my nascent Jedi in Star Wars Galaxies to the ends of the galaxy to try to level him up, only to lose one of my precious three lives to a lag spike. I’ve failed to notice the iron maiden on some skelly knights doing my eight thousandth Diablo run on hardcore and had my barb instantly splattered across the wall.  (Image credit: Daybreak Games)  We had it all kinds of rough with online games back then.  But man, there is nothing quite as disheartening as seeing your whole XP bar lit up in red. A grim, inescapable, ever-present reminder of your failure as a gamer and a human. A trophy, of sorts, to the kind of catastrophe that hurts in the way that only something you brought upon yourself can hurt. A promise, written in blood, that the next chunk of your life grinding experience for your character will literally take twice as long and there’s not a thing you can do about it.  Because what are your options? Do you go on tilt, chasing the highest reward missions and experience, trying to burn it off as fast as possible? Those are the most dangerous, so you can soon find yourself dining at the table of compound interest as your frustration leads to poor play leads to more deaths leads to more debt.  Or do you play it safe and settle in for the long grind? Your paltry experience gains will get you out of the red, to be sure, but when you’re paying half of your points to the alimony of gamer fail, it’s not a fun place to be.  Perhaps XP debt was intended to be a gentler penalty than losing experience and de-leveling. After all, at least with XP debt there’s a cap—at a certain point you’re as indebted as you’re ever going to be. You can’t lose your level, it doesn’t take away your gear. But tell that to the poor bastard knifing komodo dragons in the head on a remote planet playing Icarus for the 10,000th time because a bear charged him while he was trying to make a campfire (it's me; I'm the poor bastard).  Somehow two decades on devs are still using this mechanic! It was in 2004's EverQuest 2, which came out not long after City of Heroes. EverQuest creator Brad McQuaid liked it so much that he then used it in his next MMO, the ill-fated Vanguard: Saga of Heroes in 2007. I know those are both ancient history, but more recently it resurfaced in the survival genre in 7 Days to Die and Icarus. Somehow in their quest to design systems that punish players for failure, they settled on something even the old testament provided relief from.  Death should matter in games. Not all games have to be hardcore, high skill ceiling, deathgrip-on-the-mouse extraction games, but much of the enjoyment from gaming comes from there being stakes. Ultimately games are a kind of story, and a story with no stakes isn’t much of a story. If there’s no chance the hero fails, then we don’t really care that much whether or not they succeed. Even cozy games like Stardew have systems in place to encourage good play, gently frustrating the player or nudging them in the right direction.  I’ve sunk countless hours into early roguelikes like Stone Soup and Nethack, love a Hades playthrough, and occasionally roll a hardcore Path of Exile character because there is value in striving. Great games encourage you in that journey—no matter how painful it is losing a bunch of runes in Elden Ring, you know that you gathered them once. Despite your setback, you can do it again.  XP debt actively discourages you from this striving. Whatever you were trying to do at the moment of your untimely demise, whether it was mining for rocks, battling a supervillain, or just walking from point A to point B, is now half as rewarding. It ups the stakes, but also saps the joy out of any success that comes off the back of failure. It’s one thing to take something away from me, and quite another to tell me that my effort in the future is less valuable. It’s just so much more discouraging.  I still get a thrill out of games that make death scary, but XP debt isn't The Exorcist scary, it's ""you're being audited"" scary. I hope XP debt's appearance in Icarus doesn't lead to a resurgence of some kind. Let it stay dead and buried—or at least sequestered to the City of Heroes private server where it can't hurt anyone who isn't asking for it.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL3hwLWRlYnQtZWFybHktbW1vcy1tb3N0LXBhaW5mdWwtZ2FtZS1tZWNoYW5pYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-11-01,22:00:00,"{""Sweden"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 00:14:47,"Video games have the ability to tell unique immersive narratives that is unlike any other medium. Whether they are fictional tales like the father-son journey in God of War or the depiction of heroism during World War One in Battlefield 1. 198x explores the appreciation for video games and what they mean to us through the scope of retro games.  This indie title, developed by Hi-Bit Studios in Sweden, puts players in the shoes of a character that resonated with many, including me.  In-game Screenshot  Why is 198x Important?  198x follows the story of the protagonist, titled The Kid, as they navigate the challenges of growing up and maturing into young adulthood. The local arcade becomes a refuge for The Kid, where they cope with the changes of life through the machines. The unique combination of story and character allows players to relate to the game and understand the protagonist’s emotions from beginning to end.  For me, 198x is an inspiring game that has changed my perception of gaming. It has shown me that gaming is not just a niche activity to be looked down upon, but a coping mechanism for many people. After a long day, gaming can provide a form of escapism, bringing players into a new world for the duration of the session. This sense of immersion inspires a feeling of confidence and acceptance, promoting gaming as a passion rather than a bad habit.  Playing through the levels of 198x opened my eyes to the gaming world and its transformations both on screen and behind the scenes. It was an experience that I had never considered before taking the game’s journey.  In-game Screenshot  Appreciating the Past  In my perspective, there are two significant strengths associated with 198x. Firstly, it offers players a nostalgic experience of 80s/90s games inspired by real-life counterparts. Throughout the story, The Kid engages with five distinct titles that have universal appeal. Games like Outrun, Final Fight/Streets of Rage, and Gradius pay homage to the foundational genres of gaming. This significance lies in the beauty of nostalgia itself.  As a new generation of gamers emerges, it is essential to not only anticipate the future and the innovative limits games can reach but also to reflect on the past and acknowledge the games that laid the groundwork. By immersing oneself in the world of 198x, one might discover hidden gems and be inspired to explore the rich history of gaming. It is worth noting that each level in the game faithfully replicates a real-life counterpart, a testament to the developers’ remarkable tribute.  In-game Screenshot  Understanding Emotion in Video Games  Another notable strength of 198x lies in its writing, which reflects the perspective of game developers who, at their core, are passionate gamers themselves.  Spoiler Warning: In the level “The Getaway,” which draws inspiration from Sega’s arcade racer Outrun, The Kid delivers a monologue. Imagine driving a sports car late at night, spotting lights on the horizon as the city comes into view. During this sequence, The Kid expresses, “Another life was just one credit away,” accompanied by captivating synthwave music, as you continue your journey towards the city. This moment resonated deeply with me, followed by the phrase, “Nothing could beat the rush of the highway. Speeding cars reminds me that there was a way out.” It felt as though the game understood my emotions.  Playing through this level, I experienced a sense of liberation, embarking on a long and thrilling adventure under the night sky. I sincerely hope that other players can have a similar experience, fostering a profound love and appreciation not only for the unique worlds crafted by games but also for the games themselves and the people who create them.  In addition to what has been mentioned, 198x also shines a spotlight on indie titles, which have been steadily gaining popularity in recent years. Despite its relatively short gameplay, this game has left an enduring impression on me, one that I will carry with me for years to come.  I will continue to keep an eye on Hi-Bit and eagerly anticipate more remarkable releases for others to enjoy. I sincerely hope that more people have the opportunity to play 198x and discover new genres along the way.  You can purchase 198x on Steam for US$9.99 / AU$ 14.50.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhbWVjcmF0ZXIuY29tLzE5OHgtaG93LWl0LWluc3BpcmVzLWEtZGVlcGVyLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24tZm9yLWdhbWVzLXBlb3BsZS1jcmVhdGUv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ2FtZWNyYXRlci5jb20vMTk4eC1ob3ctaXQtaW5zcGlyZXMtYS1kZWVwZXItY29ubmVjdGlvbi1mb3ItZ2FtZXMtcGVvcGxlLWNyZWF0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2025-01-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 17:30:00,"Subscribe to Nintendo Life on  You might remember Deneos' adorable Save Me Mr Tako! from a few years back. The definitive edition on Switch is now celebrating its two-year anniversary (how time flies) and the developer has today revealed that there is more to come from the Tako saga as it provided a first look at Tako no Himitsu: Ocean of Secrets.  This game will see you playing as a group of six heroes who set out on a journey to defeat the shadow monsters that have plagued the land. In the process, truths will be exposed, shining a light on some tough themes in the characters' lives up until this point. Deneos has cited a number of inspirations for this one including Eastward, CrossCode and Undertale, and has even gone as far as to say that the game is ""like if Golden Sun met Illusion of Gaia"" — no pressure then, eh?  Ocean of Secrets is currently still in development and the team will be launching a Kickstarter later this year with a Switch version of the game as one of the fundraiser's stretch goals. You can find the game's Kickstarter page here, though note that it is not live just yet.  Once again, Deneos is drawing inspiration from the GBA era, and today's reveal trailer (above) gives a good look at the pixel art visuals that we can expect from this one. The developer has described the upcoming title as ""a spiritual sequel of Save Me Mr Tako"" and we are starting to see why (the cute little octopi weapons were a bit of a giveaway).  For a little more information about the game's story and a look at some screenshots, check out the following from the developer:  In a world where shadow monsters are appearing, the discovery of an octopus will put a light on the lies that the people in power wanted to hide. Start a great adventure with colorful characters and try to save this world slowly consumed by the secrets of its past.  We understand that the game is being targeted for a 2025 release, though nothing is set in stone at these early stages. You can find even more details over on the game's Steam page.  From the little that we have seen so far, the game is certainly a pretty one to look at and promises to tackle some tough themes as it progresses — always a strong combo. We will be keeping an eye out for more information over the coming months and have our fingers crossed that it makes its Switch stretch goal quickly.  What do you make of this one so far?

game,2023-05-10,19:05:00,"{""Rochester"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 20:40:42,"GAMEDAY NOTES & QUOTES: ROUND 3 | GAME 3  The North Division Final series makes its way to Rochester tonight, with the Amerks holding a 2-0 series lead over the Toronto Marlies. After stealing two big victories in Toronto, the Rochester squad knows tonight will be the toughest battle yet.  “This is going to be Toronto’s best effort — physically, mentally, and execution-wise,” Amerks head coach Seth Appert said this morning. “At the same point in time, you understand that, but you don’t worry about that.”  “We try to keep most of the focus on ourselves: what do we need to do to prepare ourselves to be the best version?”  A narrow focus has been the mindset that the coaching staff has given the players since Round 2 against the Syracuse Crunch. It’s important to look at each game, no matter the circumstance, as the one game you need to win.  “How do we execute our team play? How do we execute the adjustments we want to make against Toronto?” Appert asked the team. “If we do those things at a high level, we’ll give ourselves a chance to win. It doesn’t guarantee anything, though. We’re playing a great team.”  LINEUP NOTES  Linus Weissbach is out of the lineup for the second-straight game, but he’s close, according to Appert: “He’s headed in a good direction, and he’ll be back sooner than later.”  Appert noted that they’ll use the same 11 and 7 lineup tonight as in Game 2, which means that Mitch Eliot will be the seventh defenseman.  That also means the top line of Brett Murray, Mason Jobst, and Michael Mersch will likely see a lot of ice time again tonight. “He’s the best he’s ever been in his career,” Appert said of Murray. “The most consistent. The most physically engaged. Look what he does now: he’s first line, physical presence, power play. He’s penalty killing.”  Jobst and Mersch both lead the team with nine points a piece in the seven postseason games so far. Mersch, who tallied a Round 2, Game 3 hat trick, has five goals so far. Jobst has tallied seven assists.  Rookie forward Jiri Kulich has five goals as well: one in every playoff game he’s suited up for. “I don’t think pressure gets to him,” Appert told Sabres live today. “He seems to perform extremely well when the lights are bright.”  Appert also explained that both Syracuse and Toronto targeted Kulich, and fellow rookie Isak Rosen, but that they both haven’t got caught up “in the nonsense.”  WORTH MENTIONING  Kulich leads all AHL rookies with five goals. He also paces the league with four power play goals and two game-winning goals in the postseason.  Lawrence Pilut, who scored the game-winning overtime goal in Game 5 against Syracuse, ranks third in scoring amongst all AHL defensemen with seven points (3+4). He also carries the longest active point streak by a defenseman, currently sitting at five games.  A win tonight would give the Amerks a series sweep for the first time since eliminating Hamilton in the opening round of 2005. It would earn the team a trip to the Conference Finals for the first time in 19 years.  Rochester has a 10-4 record when they have a chance to sweep an opponent in the postseason, and have won each of their last seven games to sweep an opponent.  ABOUT THE OPPOSITION  The Toronto Marlies ran away with the North Division with over a month left in the season. They defeated the Utica Comets in four games in Round 2.  The Maple Leafs returned goaltender Joseph Wall to the Marlies on loan after Woll appeared in Game 3 and started Games 4 and 5 for the Leafs in the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.  When asked if he was worried about Woll’s return on The Sports Bar, Appert responded, “I don’t worry about things I can’t control. I didn’t even look at their ‘clear day’ roster; I have no idea who they could’ve sent down. I don’t care.”  Appert explained that the team is not preparing for one player — whether they’re in the lineup or not. “My focus is on us and getting our guys to play the right way.”  Forward Bobby McMann could return to the Toronto lineup as well tonight after missing 29 games. McMann tallied 21 goals in his 30 games played during the regular season.  The Marlies owned the second-best power play throughout the regular season, and scored on four opportunities during Game 2. The Amerks, who have seen an excellent penalty kill for most of the second half of the season, have made a few tweaks to their special teams ahead of tonight’s game.  “We’ve made adjustments every game of the playoffs,” Appert said. “That’s the nature of the playoffs. It’s not like we’re going to go away from our identity… but it’s our job as a coaching staff to bring solutions to them in areas of the game that maybe we’ve struggled.”  GAME NIGHT INFORMATION  Very few tickets remain for tonight’s Game 3 at Blue Cross Arena. The first 5,000 fans will receive red Round 3 Amerks rally towels.  Fans can enjoy $2 draft beers until puck drop at Pregame Happy Hour in the Genesee Brewhouse inside Blue Cross Arena.

game,2023-05-13,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 20:23:03,"ABC’s broadcast of last weekend’s XFL championship game drew 1.43 million average viewers, the league’s highest TV audience since its regular season opening weekend.  Saturday night’s title game on ABC and ESPN Deportes peaked at 1.8 million viewers, according to The Athletic. The XFL’s two opening weekend games on ABC in February averaged 1.5 million and 1.6 million viewers.  But viewership slumped after the first weekend, as the XFL’s 10-game regular season averaged 622,000 viewers per game on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, FX, ESPN+, and ESPN Deportes. The eight ABC games averaged 1.13 million viewers.  Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson’s 2023 XFL drew fewer viewers than the league’s 2020 season cut short by the pandemic. The 2020 XFL—whose TV partners spanned ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, FOX, FS1, and FS2 had three million viewers during its opening weekend, followed by an average of 1.87 million viewers per game in its season that lasted just five weeks of play.  And neither the 2020 nor 2023 XFL came close to replicating the success of Vince McMahon’s original XFL debut broadcast in 2002 of an estimated 54 million viewers on NBC. Ratings for subsequent games plummeted as the league folded after just one season.  The modern XFL competes with FOX’s USFL, as the two spring football leagues began overlapping on April 15. But for now, The Rock’s XFL is gearing up for a second season next year, which is further than the league’s 2001 or 2020 interactions ever reached.  “Renewals are going out now for ’24 season tickets, and we still have data coming in from this season,” Janet Duch, the XFL’s chief marketing and team business operations officer, told FOS. “What is the engagement? Where is the growth? For us right now, we are taking all the learnings from ’23 and applying them to ’24.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZnJvbnRvZmZpY2VzcG9ydHMuY29tL3hmbC10aXRsZS1nYW1lLXNjb3Jlcy0xLTQzLW1pbGxpb24tdmlld2Vycy1hcy1sZWFndWUtcHJlcGFyZXMtZm9yLXNlY29uZC1zZWFzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-09-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 16:05:21,"For millions of Americans, playing some type of video game is a daily occurrence. Games can be a welcome form of entertainment and relaxation for many, and the internet can even make gaming a social activity. However, excessive video game playing to the point of isolation, addiction or changes in mood or behavior are growing concerns with this pastime. These possible negative effects may also contribute to anxiety and depression in some people and gaming may have varying effects on social connections.  A new study published in Sociological Focus builds on existing research hinting at the importance of social connectivity and support for online gamers. In this study, Dr. Tyler Prochnow and Dr. Meg Patterson of the Department of Health Behavior at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health, along with colleagues from the University of North Carolina and Baylor University, used social network analysis to examine the social structure of an online gaming site at two points in time. The goal of this analysis was to see how social support, sense of community and symptoms of depression affect social connections over time.  The research team analyzed a social network consisting of members of an online football simulation gaming site, surveying members at the beginning and end of the game’s season. In the game, players play as the head coach of a football team and compete against other members of the site over 10 months. Members are able to communicate directly with each other through the site’s forums, chat and direct messaging capabilities.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Prochnow said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  There were 37 members who responded to the survey at the beginning and 40 who responded at the end, with 30 members represented in both samples. The researchers collected data on age, sex and other demographic factors as well as the number of hours members spent on the gaming site and playing other video games. Members also answered survey items on depressive symptoms and perceived ability to talk to someone about problems. The researchers also asked members to list people in real life and on the gaming site that they talked to about important life matters.  Research has found correlations between social network strength and depression, with stronger social networks giving people more opportunities to find support. Informal social networks, such as those found in online gaming, could play a crucial role in coping with stressors and seeking formal help for anxiety or depression. This, combined with research finding that people turn to social networks for help in times of trouble, add to the relevance of this study.  The study found that social support, sense of community and depressive symptoms played a role in changes to the game’s social structure over time. The researchers observed that people who reported more social support online, and those who reported less real-life support, were more likely to reach out to other members. They also found that communication ties were more likely to form when communications were reciprocated or transitive (involving three people groups or clusters). In addition, players who spent more time on the site were more likely to have communication ties.  The researchers also found that members who reported feeling a greater sense of community and placing value in being a part of the site were more likely to form communication ties over time. In addition to being more likely to connect, these members might feel more comfortable with conversations about real life issues. This points to the importance of a sense of community in online gaming sites; however, online communities can carry some downsides such as the potential for sites to serve as political and ideological echo chambers.  The study noted that although members with less real-life support were more likely to form communication ties, those reporting greater depressive symptoms were less likely to send communication ties over time. This could indicate a need for more formal support for members experiencing depressive symptoms, including telehealth mental health care options.  This study’s findings reinforce existing research on connections between mental health, social support and online gaming and point to the need for more research into the complicated relationships in these areas. More research into these areas and their interactions could help inform interventions to improve social connection and mental health for socially isolated communities and populations living in socially isolating times such as the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdG9kYXkudGFtdS5lZHUvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy9jb3VsZC1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtaW5nLXNvY2lhbC1uZXR3b3Jrcy1oYXZlLWEtcG9zaXRpdmUtaW1wYWN0LW9uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Subscription services offering access to a library of games for a fixed monthly charge are anticipated to gain widespread popularity as the number of people who own smartphones increases and mobile internet speeds improve. We also foresee a rise in the use of NFTs and blockchain technology in games, making it possible for developers to implement novel ways of making money off of their creations. We hope to see a continuous dedication to making games featuring people, themes and settings that reflect the diversity and inclusivity the gaming industry strives for.  How would you describe the differences between American and European gaming at the moment?  Comparing the rising expansion of the American and European gaming industries offers important insights into how different cultural quirks translate into various gameplay experiences worldwide. Numerous contributing factors significantly impact the landscape of this ever-expanding industry across regions, from subject matter selection to production methods to player preference.  While many memorable video games played around the world are inspired by one ancient legend, American game developers place more emphasis on contemporary issues affecting Americans today, such as pop culture trends or controversial political barbs. The populace’s attitude when sitting in the player’s seat greatly influences their gaming choices.  There are considerable differences in gaming preferences between different geographic areas. European gamers like strategy and simulation games with deep story lines, whereas American players favor first-person shooters with lots of action.  As for Israel – where do you think the Israeli gaming industry fits into the global gaming ecosystem?  Israel has differentiated itself by making significant recent advancements across various elements of contemporary video game design, despite being relatively minor compared to well-known worldwide marketplaces like Europe or America’s Game Development community.  Another feature generating headlines recently was their significant influence on properly offering top-notch quality products focused on Mobile gamers one after another while supporting local economies through successful business ventures.  The innovative Game Network infrastructure on which the adtech market sub-sector primarily relies to provide analytical data metrics and customer acquisition benefits and grow the local scheme, while competing against global industry leaders frequently results in sizable rewarded corporatized Investments along with successful Acquisitions. Israeli game creators, studios, start-ups, and IT corporations are increasingly collaborating with foreign businesses; this is a relatively recent trend.  Given Israel’s exceptional workforce’s wealth of technical know-how and unparalleled creativity, both crucial building blocks for creating long-term success, it is not surprising that these well-known international organizations have chosen to collaborate with Israel. As time passes, their cooperation is mutually beneficial, further solidifying Israel’s standing as one of the major global hubs for developing video games.  What are the biggest opportunities for Israeli gaming developers this year? What are some of the challenges they will face?  This year, the opportunities for young Israeli game makers are limitless. Innovative business owners have many opportunities to develop engaging experiences globally thanks to expanding global markets accessible through mobile platforms and partnerships with well-established international gaming outlets.  In addition to the difficult task of obtaining vital capital that enables them to transform their notions from concepts on paper into reality, these visionaries must contend with fierce competition within a cutthroat sector. Israeli game makers face a complex web of data privacy laws and content limitations when attempting to expand their abilities outside their native market.  Israeli developers can establish a perfect workplace that attracts top talent and frees them up to concentrate on innovation and quality with the help of Xsolla. Through our investment and partnership programs, we can secure funding and resources for game development while ensuring compliance with regional laws and regulations through our platform. Israel is currently one of the hotspots in the gaming industry due to its growing number of tech specialists and state-of-the-art infrastructure.  As a result, many regional studios are looking for new methods to engage with gamers worldwide, but doing so necessitates overcoming some particular challenges. Enter Xsolla, a company that provides developers looking to enter new markets outside of their native country with anything from efficient payment processing options to all-encompassing marketing solutions.  The best part is that we’re dedicated to assisting Israeli game developers in developing settings that draw and keep top industry talent, which is essential for remaining competitive in today’s gaming business.  Moving forward, we are committed to establishing a solid presence, expanding our network, and supporting both the emerging ecosystem and enterprise-level companies.  By focusing on best practices, data, examples, and specific solutions like Web Shop, Payments, Payouts, and Funding Club, we aim to captivate our audience and become a top priority for the market.  We will collaborate with GameIS, visit the market every quarter, and carefully position ourselves as valuable partners for these intelligent and well-established organizations.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzQzMzc00gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmpwb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzQzMzc0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2007-01-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 14:01:05,"With the vast majority of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom beholden to the players' imagination and drive to discover, no two journeys through Hyrule will ever be completely alike. The only true power Nintendo has over your adventure is the start and end point of its main story, with the former needing to be expertly curated in its direction to give you everything you'll need to flourish from that point onwards. It’s a level of bold authorship that trusts the player to write the rest of their story.  Crafting an opening as strong as Tears of the Kingdom’s is no mean feat, and while many games of the past have wowed with their introductions, I’m not sure any have quite nailed it like Nintendo has here. Breath of the Wild was close, delicately introducing key gameplay mechanics scattered around its Great Plateau. The Last of Us kicks off a story like no other, masterfully reaching narrative highs as Joel sinks to personal lows. Bioshock and its sequels craft a sense of place like no other, the fallen utopias of Rapture and Columbia welcoming you with states of unease. But, magically, Tears of the Kingdom manages to hit on all three of these fronts, combining them to create a video game opening like no other.  Loading Play  Mechanical Engineering  Nintendo has long been the master of naturally introducing gameplay mechanics into the early levels of its games. From Mario's first 8-bit jump onto a Goomba, through the GameCube era and Metroid Prime's all-action opening, to Breath of the Wild and beyond, Nintendo is a master of setting out rules that never feel restrictive, but are there to nurture the fun. There are obviously parallels to be drawn between both Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild’s opening hours, from the reawakening in a cave to the inescapable tutorial area full of lessons to be learned. But the echoes seem stronger with games in the Metroid series this time around, and not just due to the literally heartbreaking intro scene in which Link has his maximum health decimated.  Metroid loves nothing more than to tease you with a full arsenal of abilities only for them to be torn away as you spend the following hours collecting them all back as you battle physical amnesia. It’s essentially what Tears of the Kingdom is doing here, but instead of removing all of the special skills you’ve become accustomed to over dozens of hours in Breath of the Wild and tasking you with getting them back, it replaces them with a whole new suite of physics-based gadgetry. Thankfully, Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t make you wait anywhere near as long as Metroid Prime, for example, instead granting you the inventive and endlessly fun Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall abilities within its first couple of hours.  By carefully spreading these abilities out across the tutorialised Great Sky Island, each shrine and journey between them in this relatively limited space is there to teach you the basics of how these powers work before setting you free to unleash them on its wider world. It’s a delicate balance pulled off perfectly, as you’re forced to use them to solve basic puzzles – like building a raft to cross unswimmable waters – but also rewarded for exploring and experimenting with them, such as using Ascend to acquire handy warm-weather clothing.  “ Great Sky Island is only the tip of the iceberg of what Tears of the Kingdom has to offer, but gives you so much to play with.  Although ‘rules’ are set out when you’re granted each new ability, like Breath of the Wild you’re encouraged to break them. Great Sky Island is only the tip of the iceberg of what Tears of the Kingdom has to offer, but gives you so much to play with so early that what might take less than an hour to complete could easily blossom into three or four. The pacing of how quickly you get the powers, as well as their geographical spacing, is masterfully executed as Nintendo keeps things consistently fresh without ever threatening to overwhelm. Playing at your own pace is part of the joy of open-world Zelda, and mastering these new abilities will only be to the benefit of unlocking more fun later on. Of course, this sense of starting again is not only bound to gameplay systems but intrinsically linked to the story it's trying to tell.  Tale as Old as Time  Loss is the catalyst for many great tales. Whether it’s the deeply personal loss of a loved one as depicted in The Last of Us, or the galaxy-ending threat posed after the iconic tragedy of the Normandy at the beginning of Mass Effect 2, loss is something we’ve all experienced. It’s a specifically painful and relatable event in terms of Tears of the Kingdom as the Hyrule you got to know so intimately well in its predecessor is changed forever within minutes of playing.  Loading Play  Of course, Tears of the Kingdom threatens to inflict both personal and world-threatening disasters. The beginning of Link’s latest adventure takes us on an expedition into the bowels of Hyrule Castle as Princess Zelda searches for clues as to what’s causing the mysterious gloom. It’s an immediately engaging introduction that delivers mystery and spectacle, and births a dangerous new threat all in the space of under 10 minutes.  The Princess may once again be in another castle, but there’s something about TOTK’s introduction that doesn’t feel as scripted or plagued with cliche as it could so easily be. It’s an altogether more exciting start to the story than Breath of the Wild because it holds you back before setting you free, which gives more of an emotional charge to spark your mission. Losing Zelda – seeing her slip away, just out of grasp – powerfully highlights the emotional connection between her and Link, and now it’s severed. It’s a fantastic sequence that culminates in the ripping up of the Hyrule you've been familiar with and an introduction to its stunning new Sky Isles.  A Sense of Place  Some of the most effective game openings use the trick of starting in the familiar but quickly plunging into somewhere wholly strange and wondrous. Tears of the Kingdom’s transition from Breath of the Wild’s well-known Hyrule to its new, devastated form is the perfect example, as Link leaps onto the Great Sky Island as the majestic score swells. It’s a more serene dive compared to Bioshock's bathysphere into Rapture, but one that serves as much purpose. In Irrational’s 2007 masterpiece, the familiar is a passenger aircraft, and the firmly unfamiliar an underwater city gone to hell. In Tears of the Kingdom, the familiar is waking up in a cave, just like you do in Breath of the Wild, but the yellow grass outside is nothing like the lush fields found below in Hyrule. It’s simple, but something as subtle as changing the colour of the grass can have as much effect as a transition from a burning plane to an ocean metropolis.  Of course, its Sky Isles conjure up images much more akin to those found amongst the clouds of Columbia in Bioshock Infinite. Booker's walk through a Utopia harbouring dark layers plays out expertly and is one of my favourite opening stretches of any game. The world-building is second to none as a vivid sense of place is developed at every turn. NPCs tell tales of the city's history, serving as both a welcoming smile to your new surroundings but also a warning of the sinister secrets lurking behind them. While the Great Sky Island isn’t a bustling city complete with barbershop quartets, it has non-hostile Constructs to talk to. Their main purpose is to aid with gameplay tips, but they also offer unique insight into the land they inhabit. The same can be said for Rauru, your Zonai guide, who serves as both a storyteller and worldbuilder during these opening moments.  Loading Play  This new layered Hyrule is a world that at first feels foreign and to an extent daunting, but soon becomes the playground for Tears' jewel in the crown – its gameplay, something Nintendo has historically valued more than anything else. Breath of the Wild was a fantastic example of gameplay limited only by your imagination, set in a vibrant open world, but its story was a lot shallower. The Last of Us gave us an all-too-familiar world-turning-to-hell-before-our-eyes tale but its gameplay roots were well-trodden. Tears of the Kingdom achieves a rare feat: its spellbinding opening pays equally close attention to the trifecta – or Triforce, if you will – of story, world, and gameplay.  Near the end of your time on the island, one last masterstroke is played. You return to the cave where your story began, in a place that feels familiar yet exciting, but this time with a fresh suite of skills begging to be experimented with. It’s a poetic nod to your newly-acquired Recall ability, which allows you to unlock new doors of discovery. It completes a cadence expertly constructed in an opening hour or two that sets the foundations of adventure for hundreds more to come.

game,2021-09-05,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 16:42:38,"Panic, the publisher behind Firewatch and Untitled Goose Game, is dropping a unique soccer title on PS5, Xbox and PC next year. It’s called Despelote and is described as a “beautiful slice-of-life adventure” about childhood and the world’s favorite sport. Created by Julián Cordero and Sebastian Valbuena, the title’s set in Ecuador in 2001, which was when the country had its first succesful qualifying run for the World Cup.  Gameplay involves exploring the city of Quito, playing soccer and engaging in “playful, funny interactions” with various townspeople. It boasts a first person perspective and a highly unique art style that merges grainy photo realism with flourishes of animation. Not sure what that means? There’s a teaser trailer.  Panic says the game was inspired by co-creator Cordero’s childhood and it boasts full voice acting in Spanish with the option for localized subtitles. Much of the dialogue was actually captured in real life on the streets of Ecuador to give it a bit more flavor. The same goes for the background ambient noise.

Netflix revealed that Squid Game: The Challenge will premiere on its service in November. It comes 17 months after the series was handed a greenlight by the streamer.  The news was unveiled at Netflix’s first Upfronts event, which was a pre-taped affair after it canceled its in-person event in New York.  Netflix’s biggest series ever will see a reality series featuring 456 players competing for a $4.56M cash prize – the largest cash prize for a reality series.  The ten-part series will see contestants competing in a series of games inspired by the show plus some new ones and their strategies, alliances, and character will be put to the test while competitors are eliminated around them.  It is produced by Studio Lambert, the All3Media-backed producer behind Netflix series such as The Circle, and Peacock/BBC hit The Traitors, and The Garden, the ITV Studios-backed producer behind Channel 4 ob-doc series 24 Hours in A&E. It was filmed in the UK.  Stephen Lambert, Tim Harcourt, and Toni Ireland from Studio Lambert and John Hay, Nicola Hill, and Nicola Brown from The Garden serve as executive producers.  Earlier this year, Deadline revealed that Netflix faced an independent safety assessment after contestants required medical attention during filming.  Britain’s Health and Safety Executive — or HSE as it is more commonly known — reminded producers to plan properly for risk on the re-creation of the blockbuster Korean drama, but ultimately decided that no further action was necessary.  Also announced as part of the event was a rough date for the return of Love Is Blind. Season 5 will launch in September.

game,2021-01-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 05:59:47,"ENGLEWOOD — It was all about late-night dramatic victories Wednesday at Englewood High School’s Randy Penn Stadium. No. 1-seeded Castle View and No. 2 Mead both scored 1-goal wins over the last two Class 4A girls lacrosse state champions to punch their tickets to the title game.  Castle View scored its game-winning goal with 17 seconds against defending state champion and No. 5 Green Mountain to grab a 10-9 victory in the first semifinal. Mead put in its game-winning goal with 5 seconds remaining versus the 2021 state champion and No. 3 Evergreen for a 13-12 win in a game that ended at 10:50 p.m. due to a more than an hour and a half lighting delay.  The Sabercats and Mavericks will square in the 4A state championship game at 5:30 p.m. Friday, May 19, at the University of Denver’s Peter Barton Lacrosse Stadium.  (1) Castle View 10, (5) Green Mountain 9  Castle View senior Evie Tanella sent the Sabercats back to the Class 4A girls lacrosse championship game with a game-winning goal Wednesday night at Randy Penn Stadium.  Tanella scored the eventual game-winning goal with 17 seconds to play in the first state semifinal. Top-seeded Castle View came away with a 10-9 victory over Green Mountain — 4A defending state champions.      “It was really stressful,” Tanella said about Green Mountain tying the game 9-9 with 61 seconds left in regulation-time. “On the next draw I just knew that had to be our ball. The draw is all that mattered to me.”  Tanella was able to win the draw against Green Mountain sophomore Avery Freedman. Tanella eventually got the ball back and rifled a shot past Green Mountain senior goalie Gretchen Hoffman with 17 seconds left to give Castle View a 10-9 lead.  Green Mountain (12-6 record) had one last chance to tie the game after getting control on the next face-off, but the Rams couldn’t get a shot on net before time expired.  “It’s hard to be back at the same field you were at last year and we didn’t make it happen,” Castle View coach Samantha Silverman said about the semifinal loss to Thompson Valley a year ago. “We held it together this year which was awesome. We’ve been working a lot of the situations we might see here. We were able to hang onto the ball for three minutes. The last two years helped us be prepared for this.”  Castle View jumped out to an earlier 5-1 lead in the first 15 minutes of the opening half. The Sabercats (17-1) never trailed, but the Rams rallied pouring in three goals in the final 10 minutes.  Freedman, who finished with four goals on the night, put one into the back of the net with 1:01 left to tie the game at 9-9.  “They put everything on the field today,” Green Mountain coach Gia Lombardi said. “I’m so proud of them. Especially how we started this season. Making to semifinals with a 16-player team. I’m so proud of them.”  The Rams had their Cinderella story run to the 4A state title last year, also as the No. 5 seed. Green Mountain defeated the No. 4, No. 1 and No. 2 on its way to its first girls lacrosse state title.  Castle View also has some rich state history. The Sabercats were the state runner-up in 2021 as the No. 10 seed and advanced to the semifinals last season.  “We have been talking about that all season,” Silverman said of the Sabercats’ run to the title game in 2021. “It is very different being that No. 1 seed. We have kind of let that go and just played our game.”  Tanella had a team-high four goals and junior Tessa Boehm added a trio of goals for the Sabercats. Senior Riley Schultz had a pair of goals and senior goalie Gabby Goodwin made a huge save with 13:30 left in the second half that kept Castle View in the lead.  “We were playing team ball and no one was playing hero ball,” Tanella said. “We wanted everyone to get a touch.”  Castle View will attempt to win it first girls lacrosse title Friday night at the University of Denver.  “We are such a better team now and it is really just mental,” Tanella said. “Last year we were so far in our heads and almost against each other. This year we are all a team. We work well together and we are a family. This is a true team.”              (2) Mead 13, (3) Evergreen 12  Mead midfielder Allie Hartman literally dropped the ball before putting in the game-winning goal into the back of the net Wednesday night against Evergreen.  With the semifinal tied 12-12, the Mavericks (15-2) held the for nearly two minutes after winning a key face-off. Mead coaches call ‘Raptor” for the final play, a play for Hartman — senior at Silver Creek High School who’s mascot is the Raptors — to drive and score.  Hartman started her drive with about 10 seconds to play. She dropped the ball for a split second before regaining it and getting past Evergreen senior Averi Gardner for an open look.      “We got the look that we wanted. I take pride in my drives,” said Hartman, who scored four of the Maverick’s six second-half goals. “It worked out.”  Hartman and junior Sierra Ryan carried the load offensive for Mead in its 12th straight victory.  “We have so many sets,” Mead coach Katie Coleman said. “We always say that if we call out something that they don’t feel comfortable with that’s OK. We like to have options for them.”  The Mavericks used the right options after trailing by as many as three goals in the first half against the Cougars (11-7). Evergreen held a 6-5 lead with 7:37 remaining in the first half when the game went into a lightning delay.  It took nearly two hours for the lightning and driving rain to clear, but Mead made the most of its time in the locker room.  “With the postseason you never know how much time you have left,” Coleman said. “This group loves each other so much it was just bonus time for them to hangout with each other.”  Mead is in its first year with a girls lacrosse program.  It was the second meeting this season between the Cougars and Mavericks. Mead took a 13-8 win two weeks ago on May 4. Hartman led the way for the Mavericks in the first meeting with a game-high five goals.  “We knew we would have to face (Evergreen) again,” Coleman said. “I’m really good friends with Rachel Sanford (Evergreen coach). She has been a part of my lacrosse journey and coached me. She is a phenomenal coach and it’s hard to beat a great team twice.”  It was the final high school game for Evergreen seniors Averi Gardner and Bella Reece, who both will be heading to Boulder to play for the Buffaloes next season. Gardner and Reece were both key parts of the Cougars’ 2021 state championship team.  Evergreen won CHSAA’s first-ever 4A girls lacrosse state title in 2021 dominating the rest of the field with double-digit wins in all three state tournament victories.  Gardner finished with over 200 goals and 100 assists in three seasons. Reece missed the majority of games this season due to injury and gutted out playing during the postseason.  The championship game Friday will be a rematch from the season-opener for both Castle View and Mead on March 9. The Sabercats edged the Mavericks 7-6.  “Friday isn’t going to be easy, but we’ll be better prepared for it,” Coleman said of rebounding after falling behind early against Evergreen and going through the long delay.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2hzYWFub3cuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE3LzRhLWdpcmxzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLWFkdmFuY2UtdG8tc3RhdGUtdGl0bGUtZ2FtZS5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 13:38:48,"There are few things more difficult than studying the end of the world, and how humanity would react before it. If you try when the world isn't ending, then you probably won't get an accurate impression, given that the world isn't really ending. If you try while the world is actually ending, people won't be that interested in the results given their ""other concerns"" at the time. When an asteroid is about to dinosaur the humans, it's probably going to be difficult to get people to check out your preprint.  One team, attempting to find another way to study humans during the end times, tried to get around these problems using a computer game analogue. The team used the open world, massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) game ArcheAge for their experiment. In the study, which took place during a beta test, players were left to play as normal, completing quests, exploring, leveling up, and hoarding equipment as they wished. However, at the end of the 11 weeks players knew that the server would be deleted and all their progress and characters lost.  Advertisement Advertisement  ""And thus,"" the team wrote in their non-peer reviewed preprint paper, ""the outcome (or penalty) of players’ in-game behaviors in the last few days loses its meaning.""  The team believed that the deletion of the world provided a good proxy for the end of the real world, giving players no consequences to their actions. They believed it would help them answer age-old questions of whether humans would abandon moral ideals as the apocalypse looms.  The team analyzed over 270 million records of player behaviors in the game, such as leveling-up data and quest logs, to see if behavior of the players changed when they knew the ""world"" was ending. The game was surprisingly peaceful, bar a few outliers who chose to go on killing sprees.  ""Our findings show that there are no apparent pandemic behavior changes, but some outliers were more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior (e.g., player killing),"" the team wrote. ""We also found that contrary to the reassuring adage that 'even if I knew the world would go to pieces tomorrow, I would still plant my apple tree,' players abandoned character progression, showing a drastic decrease in quest completion, leveling, and ability changes at the end of the beta test.""  Advertisement Advertisement  Essentially, when the world is ending you probably won't spend much time on self-improvement (e.g. jogging). The team write that the people who stayed to the end of the game tended to be the most peaceful, perhaps having the most loyalty to the game. Meanwhile people who left the game earlier of their own volition, who the team called ""churners"", tended to exhibit the most antisocial behavior such as killing other players, as they lost ""their sense of responsibility and attachment to the game"".  Overall, though the team stress the study is of course limited by the fact that it took place in a video game, the end of this world was fairly peaceful, and at times even positive, with an emergence of pro-social behavior towards the end.  ""Our findings that the sentiment of social grouping specific chat channels trend towards 'happier' as the end times approach is a first indication of this pro-social behavior: existing social relationships are likely being strengthened,"" the team concluded. ""Further, we saw that players that stayed until the end of the world exhibited peaks in the number of small temporary groupings: new social relationships are being formed.""

BC is ranked for the 10th consecutive week, peaking at No. 21 in the USA Today Coaches Top-25 and NCBWA writer’s poll. Senior center fielder Barry Walsh leads the BC lineup with a .310 batting average and 12 stolen bases. He has hit leadoff in each of the last five games and homered twice in that stretch. Junior first baseman Joe Vetrano is slugging a team-high .590 with 15 home runs, including three at No. 2 Wake Forest, and nine doubles to go with a .295 average.

The series began in 1996 when the Fighting Irish joined the Big East. When the two sides reunited in the ACC in 2014, the Eagles won the initial match-up; 4-1 in 11 innings at Chicago State.  Postseason Positioning: Despite having already clinched a spot in this year’s ACC Championship, BC faces Notre Dame on the final weekend of the season for the third time since 2017. In the final games played on Shea Field, the Eagles swept the Irish in 2017 to earn a trip to the ACC Championship.

game,2017-12-03,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 21:32:05,"The developers of The Lord of the Rings Online have reacted to the news this week that Amazon Games is creating its own Lord of the Rings MMO that will seemingly exist alongside the older game.  LOTRO developer Standing Stone Games said in a forum post that it has received ""a number of notes from excited and concerned community members"" regarding Amazon's new game. Some said they are concerned that Amazon's game coming to market might signal the end of the road for The Lord of the Rings Online, but that is not the case.  ""LOTRO is not going away!"" Standing Stone Games said.  Standing Stone went on to say that Middle-earth Enterprises, the company that controls the rights to the Lord of the Rings series, continue to be ""huge fans"" of The Lord of the Rings Online. The game is now in its seventeenth year of continuous operation, and Standing Stone said the game is ""evergreen.""  ""LOTRO is like the long-lived Ents, Elves and Dwarves; and we mere mortals, are the stewards of LOTRO and its community,"" Standing Stone said. ""Standing Stone has every intention of growing and supporting this community. The road goes ever on...""  Amazon Games executive Christoph Hartmann said in an interview that he is a fan of Lord of the Rings Online. He said it's ""not a bad game,"" but mentioned that Amazon's own title will be ""worlds apart"" from it.  The new Lord of the Rings game from Amazon won't be here anytime soon, so the game and LOTRO won't be going head-to-head anytime soon.  Video game rights for massive franchises aren't always given to just one publisher. Gone are the days that Electronic Arts held the exclusive rights to Lord of the Rings video games. Middle-earth Enterprises, which is now owned by Embracer, has deals with a number of gaming companies for Lord of the Rings games, including EA (Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle-earth), North Beach Games (Return to Moria), WB Games (Shadow of War), and Private Division for an unannounced new Lord of the Rings game from Weta.  It's a situation not unlike Disney with Star Wars, as there is no longer one exclusive developer for Star Wars games, but instead many.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzcG90LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sb3JkLW9mLXRoZS1yaW5ncy1vbmxpbmUtZGV2LXJlYWN0cy10by1hbWF6b25zLW5ldy1nYW1lLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC8xMTAwLTY1MTQyOTMv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2FtcC1hcnRpY2xlcy9sb3JkLW9mLXRoZS1yaW5ncy1vbmxpbmUtZGV2LXJlYWN0cy10by1hbWF6b25zLW5ldy1nYW1lLWFubm91bmNlbWVudC8xMTAwLTY1MTQyOTMv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Maybe it will be close. Maybe the clubs’ head-to-head record will matter, since that determines division tiebreakers.

Google isn’t as restrictive as Apple with the types of apps and games that you can download, so you’ll always have a wider range of gaming experiences.

So whether you like simple, yet challenging puzzle games, in-depth strategy MMO (massive multiplayer online) games, or just looking for something fun to play every once and a while, you’ll find a great selection of games worth playing, below:  TL;DR – These are the most popular Android games  Free Android Games  Paid Android Games  Most Popular Free Games  Monopoly Go! is one of the most popular games on Android  1. Monopoly Go!  Monopoly Go! is one of the most popular games on Android for a few reasons, it’s a classic that’s easy to play, quick to learn, and just flat out fun. This is the “Go!” version of the board game, which is faster-paced and more ruthless—instead of just bankrupting your opponents, you also have to destroy their properties in this take-no-prisoners mobile game.  2. 2248 - Number Puzzle Game  The app 2248 - Number Puzzle Game is easy to pick up and learn, but difficult to master.

Camo Sniper  The enemy is elusive and clever, so if you want to be the best, you have to track ‘em down and shoot ‘em.

What to Look for in Android Games  The Google Play Store is the primary place where Android users find and download games with nearly four million apps available. It may sound daunting to search for games, but Google’s most popular free and paid games lists are a good place to start. Here’s what to look for in Android games.  The first thing you should do is check to see if the mobile game you want to play is compatible with your Android device. Most apps in the Google Play Store require that your smartphone is running, at least, Android version 4.4 KitKat—which was released in October 2013. Older mobile devices might not be able to run most modern games.  You should also consider how much storage space is available on your device. While some games have small file sizes of only a few hundred megabytes, there are others that have very large file sizes of up to 20GB. Luckily, there are Android devices that are designed with an expansion card slot built-in. If you run out of space, you can always pop in a microSD card to add extra storage. But if your device doesn’t have an expansion slot, then you’ll have to delete a few apps, photos, or videos to free up some space or get a new smartphone with a larger capacity altogether.  Meanwhile, when it comes to price, the Google Play Store divides games into two categories: Free-to-play and paid. And while free-to-play sounds self-explanatory, it doesn’t mean these games are completely free. Free versions of games might have commercial breaks or some limitations to gameplay, while in-app purchases can upgrade or remove restrictions. For example: Cooking Craze: Restaurant Game includes in-app purchases for additional items and bundles, but purchases are not required to play this game.  Additionally, most paid games download to your Android device completely unlocked. But, it might also include in-app purchases for upgrades. For example: Monopoly has in-app purchases to unlock special editions of the game. There’s also a gaming subscription called Google Play Pass for Android users. Games available for the service include zero ads and in-app purchases, so you’re free to play without restrictions for $5/mo.  Finally, the most important thing about picking an Android game is if it’s fun to play. Whether you’re going to spend a few minutes or hours upon hours playing it on your smartphone or tablet, games have to look like a fun and immersive challenge to conquer.

German will not appeal and began serving the suspension Wednesday. He cannot be replaced on the roster and the Yankees will be forced to play with 25 men instead of 26.  The right-hander was ejected in the fourth inning of Tuesday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays for having his hand coated with something tackier than rosin, umpire James Hoye said.  ""The instant I looked at his hand, it was extremely shiny and extremely sticky,"" Hoye told a pool reporter Tuesday night. ""It's the stickiest hand I've ever felt. My fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.""  German denied Hoye's accusation, saying he didn't have anything on his hand other than rosin.  ""It was definitely just the rosin bag,"" German said through an interpreter. ""It was sweat and the rosin bag. I don't need any extra help to grab the baseball.""  Hoye's crew examined German during an April 15 start against Minnesota but allowed him to stay in that game after Hoye had asked German to wash rosin off his hand and some had remained on the pitcher's pinkie.  The suspension and fine was announced Wednesday by MLB senior vice president Michael Hill. Barring rainouts, German will be eligible to return May 28 against San Diego.  ""He went over the line that umpires deemed and now we've got to live with the consequences of that,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday in Toronto. ""No one player needs to carry this load. We'll share it all and we'll do it together.""  Yankees right-hander Luis Severino, 29, who hasn't pitched this season due to a right lat strain, is expected to be activated off the injured list Sunday to take German's spot in the rotation against the Cincinnati Reds.  A two-time All-Star, Severino has not pitched for the Yankees this season because of a right lat strain. He allowed two runs and six hits over 3⅓ innings Tuesday in a rehab start with Double-A Somerset.  Also on Wednesday, the Yankees put reliever Ian Hamilton on the 15-day injured list because of a strained right groin. New York recalled left-hander Nick Ramirez from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.  In other news, left-hander Carlos Rodón threw from 90 feet without pain Wednesday. He has not pitched this season because of a sore left forearm and an ailing back.  German's ejection was the fourth since Major League Baseball started its crackdown on prohibited grip aids two years ago and the second this season.  New York Mets pitcher Max Scherzer was suspended for sticky stuff on April 20, and Seattle's Hector Santiago and Arizona's Caleb Smith were suspended in 2021.

Developer and manufacturer Glass Cannon Unplugged is raising funds until June 8, and it’s hoping to secure at least $244,491 to move forward with the project. In case you were wondering, the company’s credentials include the board game adaptation of the video game Frostpunk, which secured close to $3 million during its 2020 Kickstarter campaign.  The Apex Legends board game is a team-based, tabletop skirmish game for up to four players, anchored by some great-looking miniatures in three-dimensional terrain. Each game takes around 60 minutes to complete (you can see some gameplay here), and the gameplay is about using abilities, resource management, and clever maneuvering, all of which mirror many of the aspects of the popular battle royale shooter.  Anyone who’s looking to secure a copy of the game can pledge their support starting at the core tier for $87, which saves you roughly $37 off the planned retail price. The core tier gets access to the boxed copy of the game when it launches (or if it launches — this is Kickstarter, after all). The base game includes four legends (Bangalore, Bloodhound, Wraith, and Gibraltar) represented with highly-detailed, unpainted minis. The company has plans to launch additional characters in future expansions.  Apex Legends board game $86 Prices taken at time of publishing.

Investing in the Full Team or All-in tier in advance will save you $54 or $113, respectively, versus their planned retail prices.  As an added bonus, backers of any tier of the board game will get a free copy of the planned Loba expansion pictured below when it launches (the launch date hasn’t been announced).

game,2023-03-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 15:17:21,"gorodenkoff / Getty Images/iStockphoto  Games like Fortnite, the Candy Crush Saga and Counter-Strike are free to play for everyone who downloads these games. But premium subscriptions and other in-app upgrades are tempting some gamers to spend over $200 per month, Money reported.  Discover: Keep an Eye Out for Rare Dime Worth as Much as $2,000 — How To Spot It  Learn: How To Build Your Savings From Scratch  Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, a first-person shooter available to play for free online, is played by more than 5 million people every month and made an average of $3.2 million per day in March. Money says the popular battle royale-style game Fortnite made over $20 billion in its first four years through cosmetics alone. Candy Crush saw $1 billion in revenue in 2022 from purchasing extra lives and power boosts.  These numbers are impressive, but only a small fraction of players spend money on in-game purchases.  The 2021 study “No Such Thing As a Free App” by Imam Salehudin, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Indonesia, and his research partner Frank Alpert, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Queensland, shows that only about 5% of users spend money on in-app purchases. About 70% of all “freemium” app revenue comes from the top 10% of spenders, Salehudin says. But Money noted that those who do spend money, spend a lot of it. The study found that the average Pokémon Go user spent $267 in July of 2016, the month it was released.  Salehudin says that the biggest spenders tend to be the ones who can’t control their spending — especially children.  Nara Ward, a mother to two young children in Barbados, told BBC News that keeping track of her kids’ spending when playing games is a full-time job. When her 12-year-old son started playing Roblox, a game with a largely young fanbase, he spent $200 in Apple credit in a few days.

game,2023-05-17,07:58:00,"{""Calgary"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}",Thu 18 May 2023 04:52:45,"Not even the return of two star players could push the Coachella Valley Firebirds to a decisive victory over a desperate Calgary Wranglers on Wednesday.  Facing elimination from the Calder Cup Playoffs, the top-seeded Wranglers held off the Firebirds with a 1-0 Game 4 win in their best-of-five series in front of 7,758 inside Acrisure Arena.  American Hockey League rookie of the year Tye Kartye and Jesper Frödén, who led the Firebirds in goals before being recalled by the NHL’s Seattle Kraken, were back in the valley Wednesday. It was their first Firebirds action in weeks after joining the Kraken on their Stanley Cup Playoffs run.  They returned to the valley on Tuesday along with goaltender Chris Driedger, an NHL veteran.  But the Wranglers, the AHL’s top team during the regular season, evidently weren’t quite ready for their season to come to an end. Coming off what appeared to be a physically and emotionally draining Game 3 triple overtime loss, Calgary scored the first goal of the game in the second period and held on to stave off elimination.  The best-of-five series is now tied, 2-2.  ""You've got to give them credit with the way they played,"" Firebirds head coach Dan Bylsma said of the Wranglers. ""They were backs against the wall and they came out pedal down and they put pucks behind our defense and made it tough on us.  ""They came with a lot of gas and we didn't deal with it very well,"" Bylsma added.  Just as most suspected, the series between the AHL’s two top teams during the regular season will now head to a winner-take-all Game 5 on Friday inside Acrisure Arena. Puck drop is set for 7 p.m.  Both Kartye and Frödén, who combined for 55 goals and 54 assists for the Firebirds this season, started Wednesday, along with forward Cameron Hughes, blueliners Brogan Rafferty and Gustav Olofsson and netminder Joey Daccord.  It was Frödén’s first game in a Firebirds’ jersey since Feb. 20, and Kartye’s first since April 23. The two played with the Kraken, Coachella Valley’s NHL affiliate, until the Kraken’s postseason run came to an end Monday night in Dallas.  The game was the second since all-star Andrew Poturalski returned for the Firebirds following an absence since Jan. 26. Poturalski spent more than three months rehabilitating from a leg injury before returning to the lineup Monday.  With their full lineup back in action for the first time in months, the Firebirds had chances to score but couldn’t get the puck into the Calgary net. Perhaps their best chance came on a power play with 8:30 remaining in the game. Coachella Valley had multiple good looks at the net yet came up empty against AHL MVP Dustin Wolf, the Wranglers’ goalie.  After allowing the game-winning goal in the third overtime of Game 3, Wolf had a gutsy performance Wednesday. He saved 27 shots and recorded just the second shutout against the Firebirds inside Acrisure Arena.  ""Obviously, we didn't capitalize, but we'll be back Friday and do a better job,"" Frödén said.  Despite the loss, Daccord recorded 31 saves in the game. Calgary’s second-period goal ended a remarkable streak for Daccord, who went 123 minutes and 17 seconds spanning Monday and Wednesday's games without allowing a goal.  The Firebirds were 0-for-3 on the power play and 1-of-3 on the penalty kill in the game.  Kartye and Frödén will now be a part of a second elimination game this week, in a different league and for a different team. Kartye emphasized one key that the Firebirds will need to focus on Friday.  ""A fast start is going to be key on Friday,"" Kartye said. ""In the NHL it was the same thing. Dallas had a fast start (Monday) and ended up winning the game. I feel like if you can gain control of the game early and get up, it's hard to come back in those games because of the tight checking.""  In three previous elimination games this postseason, the Firebirds came out fast. They led 4-0 after one period in the first round and led 2-0 and 3-0 in the first period in two elimination games in the second round.  ""It seems like a story,"" Bylsma said with a smile, ""and one we have to write on Friday night.""  The goal  1-0, Wranglers: At the 12:40 mark of the first period, Cole Schwindt fired the puck past Daccord to give Calgary the lead. The goal came at the end of a power play after Carsen Twarynski was called for hooking.  Firebirds goal waived off  The Firebirds put the puck into the back of the net to take the lead in the first period, but referees waved off the goal due to goaltender interference. Play was paused for a few minutes while referees discussed the play and then explained it to Bylsma.  ""Clearly we were in the crease to start the power play there and there's pushing and shoving from their goaltender to our player and there's a bump that ensued as the play went off to the right of the goalie,"" Bylsma said. ""The referee's explanation was that the goaltender wasn't allowed to play his position to his ability.""  Bylsma wouldn't go as far as to say that he didn't agree with the call.  ""Let's just say that his explanation and my viewpoint weren't the same,"" Bylsma said. ""But he's the referee and he gets to make that call. Our guy was clearly in the blue paint to start with and there was contact there, for sure, and the play kind of ensued as a result of it. I can argue with it, but he made his call.""  Out of town scores  In the other Western Conference series, Milwaukee topped Texas 4-3 on Wednesday to take a 2-1 lead in that series. The winner of that series will face the winner of the Firebirds-Wranglers series for a spot in the Calder Cup final.  In the Eastern Conference, both series ended Wednesday night in 3-0 sweeps. Hershey defeated Hartford 3-1 to sweep that series and Rochester beat Toronto 8-4 to sweep that series. That means the Hershey Bears (Washington Capitals affiliate) will face the Rochester Americans (Buffalo Sabres affiliate) for a spot in the Calder Cup Championship.

Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Discover GG  Step aside, xenomorphs—a new alien is in town, and his name is Reyu.  Reyu is the first playable character NFT to emerge from Random Games’ upcoming Unioverse franchise. So far, the team has released one Reyu comic book, 20,000 Reyu NFTs on Ethereum scaling network Polygon, eight short fiction stories with visual illustrations, and “The Proving Grounds”—an immersive mini-game of sorts in which players can race through a dystopian game environment and destroy bots as they try to top the leaderboard.  AD  AD  But this is no Dookey Dash—the Proving Grounds is an incredibly beautiful, cinematic experience, and feels like the beginning of a AAA game.  Take a look inside the Unioverse:  It’s unsurprising that the Proving Grounds looks so good—Random Games has a team of veteran game developers and writers. Random CEO Tony Harman helped create Grand Theft Auto while president at original developer DMA Design, and Random Games writer Brent Friedman has worked on narrative development for games like League of Legends and Call of Duty, as well as for TV series like “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” and “Star Trek: Enterprise.”  “With the Proving Grounds, we wanted to showcase what our Unioverse heroes can do in a gameplay environment and provide a taste of what’s to come,” Random Games CTO and co-founder Wyeth Ridgway told Decrypt via email.  Image: Random Games.  During Decrypt’s Proving Grounds playtest, the lighting was realistic and detailed, the character movement was smooth and polished, and the environments looked reminiscent of an “Alien” film. The music was immediately appealing, while the maze-like map of the Proving Grounds itself felt a bit like a 3D puzzle—like if Valve’s 2007 smash hit game Portal became the world from which Reyu must escape.  Reyu himself is a highly-detailed model and is equal parts menacing and chiseled, with a muscular exoskeletal armor, what appears to be a magic laser sword, and a gun that feels like part rifle, part crossbow.  Reyu in the Proving Grounds. Image: Random Games.  The Unioverse website describes Reyu as a “warrior monk,” and the company plans to release more characters from its franchise in the coming months and years. To me, Reyu looks like a human-xenomorph hybrid… imagine the intergalactic peace—or chaos—such an alliance would bring!  AD  AD  All comparisons aside, Ridgway told Decrypt that the Unioverse will be more like “a Roblox for AAA gaming” than a closed-source Web2 franchise. In fact, he emphasized that anyone can download the Unioverse assets and tell their own stories based on the parent lore.  What’s next for the ambitious franchise? The studio is taking a game-first and community-first approach.  “The next step is the multiplayer, battle royale game, then we’ll share an SDK with all the assets and tools,” Ridgway said, “and continue adding heroes and functionality so the community can build whatever they want.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjcnlwdC5jby8xNDA0NzQvZW50ZXItdW5pb3ZlcnNlLWNpbmVtYXRpYy1zY2ktZmktZ2FtZS10YWtlcy1zaGFwZS1wb2x5Z29u0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNyeXB0LmNvLzE0MDQ3NC9lbnRlci11bmlvdmVyc2UtY2luZW1hdGljLXNjaS1maS1nYW1lLXRha2VzLXNoYXBlLXBvbHlnb24_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

An EA Sports representative confirmed to ESPN on Wednesday that it has contracted with OneTeam Partners to ""facilitate collegiate athletes' names and likenesses"" into the game, solving one of the major questions about college football's return to the video game space.  The partnership will include the chance for all eligible FBS players to opt in to have their likenesses in EA Sports College Football, the representative said. Those players will receive compensation for being placed in the game.  Details -- such as how much an athlete will receive and the structure of payments -- are still being finalized, but the EA Sports representative said the goal is to be ""as inclusive and equitable as possible."" On the OneTeam website, the company stated that if the influence of individual sales couldn't be figured out -- including for video game licensing -- then ""revenue will be divided equally among the athletes included in each licensing program.""  If a player does not want to be in the game, EA Sports would create a generic avatar and player in that athlete's place.  For participating players, it is possible a face scan of their likenesses could be in the game, the representative said, though not every athlete will receive a face scan because there are thousands of FBS players across the country. The representative said more than 120 FBS schools have committed to being in the game -- along with all 10 FBS conferences and the College Football Playoff -- with the goal remaining to have every FBS school in the game.  When EA Sports announced the return of its college football series in 2021, questions surrounding name, image and likeness were among the biggest it needed to answer. At the time, Notre Dame was among a small number of schools that indicated through statements or news reports that it would not agree to participate until NIL compensation was worked out.  Much has happened since many of those declarations, including the passage of NIL legislation and college athletes making money off their name, image and likenesses.  Following Wednesday's agreement, officials at Wisconsin, Northwestern, TCU, Fresno State and Tulane said their schools would now opt in to the game.  A Notre Dame source told ESPN on Wednesday that the school had been in touch with EA Sports to help with NIL integration for the video game. It doesn't seem, though, that Notre Dame has made a decision on being in the game.  OneTeam, which has partnerships with players' unions, including the NFLPA, MLSPA and USWNT Players Association, has previously worked with EA Sports on the Madden football and FIFA (now EA Sports FC) franchises.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtZm9vdGJhbGwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2ODA4OS9lYS1zcG9ydHMtbGV0dGluZy1mYnMtcGxheWVycy1vcHQtMjAyNC12aWRlby1nYW1l0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjY4MDg5L2VhLXNwb3J0cy1sZXR0aW5nLWZicy1wbGF5ZXJzLW9wdC0yMDI0LXZpZGVvLWdhbWU_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The win puts Seattle up three games to one in the best of seven series and leaves them one victory away from winning the Ed Chynoweth Cup. Their first chance to win it is Game Five Friday, also at the accesso ShoWare Center. Game time is 7:05 p.m.  The goal was Guenther’s league leading sixteenth of the postseason. Reid Schaefer and Luke Prokop had the assists.  “It was just kind of a fast break out of the D zone,” explained Guenther of the game winner. “Reido made a nice play. I cut to the middle; I really didn’t see a lot of support. Kopper (Prokop) was there, he made a nice play to Reido, a nice pass to me. There was some traffic in front and around me, so I just decided to get the shot off and it went in. It’s a pretty exciting goal.”  Seattle continues to win the third period in the playoffs, adding two more goals to their postseason total in the Game Four win. They’ve outscored their opponents 38-11 through their first eighteen playoff games. Thunderbirds head coach Matt O’Dette called it their best period of the night.  “It needed to be,” he said. “There were some good stretches, but also some bad stretches through the first forty (minutes). They’re a good team. They’re playing well and they made it hard on us. Sometimes you just have to stick with it, keep your composure and wait for your opportunity to score a big goal.”  For the third time in four games, Winnipeg opened the scoring when Carson Latimer struck at 16:25 or the opening period. Seattle responded when Kevin Korchinski fired home his third of the playoffs with just seventeen seconds remaining in the first.  “Sconer (Lucas Ciona) made a good play,” said Korchinski of his goal. “Working down low, heads-up play. He found me. There was a great screen in front from Dacher (Colton Dach) I think. He took away the goalie’s eyes and I found the back of the net.”  The teams traded goals in the second period. The Thunderbirds got their first lead on a Gracyn Sawchyn power play goal at 4:31 with Jeremy Hanzel and Kyle Crnkovic assisting. The ICE tied it four minutes later when Evan Friesen scored.  That brought us to the third period and Guenther’s game winner. Nico Myatovic then put the game away with an empty netter with eight seconds left.  “Both teams are going to play extremely hard Friday,” remarked O’Dette on Game Five. “We’ll have to play extremely well and give our best effort to win that game.”  If Game Six is necessary, it would be Sunday in Winnipeg. Should the series go the distance, Game Seven would be next Monday in Winnipeg as well.  T-BIRDS EXTRAS  With an assist on the game winning goal, Reid Schaefer extended his point streak to seven games.  Thomas Milic got the win in net with a thirty-one save effort. The win was his fifteenth of the playoffs, one more than he had last spring in the postseason.  With an assist on the empty net goal Jared Davidson now has fifty-two career playoff points with the Thunderbirds. He is three points back of Ethan Bear for second in franchise history.  The is the first time in Thunderbirds history they will have a chance to clinch a league title on home ice.

Games have announced the next Mortal Kombat game will be officially revealed on Thursday, 18 May 2023, following a number of major teasers. A post on Twitter confirmed these grand plans with an ominous message: ‘Tomorrow is a new dawn.’  An accompanying teaser video confirmed it’s now ‘time’ for the game’s grand reveal. As for what form this will take, it remains a mystery – but we can expect a formal trailer of some kind, potentially with meatier details than prior teasers.  So far, NetherRealm has taken a more symbolic approach to the game’s reveal, with early teasers revolving around the motif of time. The first contained an hourglass with exploding grains of sand. The second featured a ticking clock counting up from 9, 10, 11 – and then skipping 12 entirely, to hit 1.  This led many to assume the next Mortal Kombat wouldn’t be Mortal Kombat 12 – but rather a reboot, following previous events in the franchise which saw protagonist Liu Kang gaining the ability to re-write time and history.  Read: Mortal Kombat 12 could be ‘Mortal Kombat 1’ per leaker  A subsequent leak suggested this was exactly the case, as reliable insider billbil-kun claimed the next game in NetherRealm’s beloved franchise would be a total refresh actually known as ‘Mortal Kombat 1‘. Tied to these leaks were rumours that characters including Homelander from The Boys and Peacemaker from The Suicide Squad could be guest fighters.  So far, these leaks have yet to be confirmed, but we won’t have to wait long to discover more about the upcoming game. The official reveal for the next Mortal Kombat is currently set for 18 May at 6:00 am PT. Here’s a quick rundown of how that translates to local timezones:  Australia – 11:00 pm AEST | 10:30 am ACST | 9:00 pm AWST (18 May)  – 11:00 pm AEST | 10:30 am ACST | 9:00 pm AWST (18 May) New Zealand – 1:00 am NZST (19 May)  – 1:00 am NZST (19 May) United States – 6:00 am PT | 9:00 am ET (18 May)  – 6:00 am PT | 9:00 am ET (18 May) United Kingdom – 2:00 pm BST | 3:00 pm CET (18 May)  Stay tuned to see what NetherRealm Studios has in store.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVzaHViLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MvbW9ydGFsLWtvbWJhdC0xMi1nYW1lLXJldmVhbC1tYXktMTgtMjAyMy0yNjE2NTc0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Since the schedule was announced, we've examined the entire slate, chosen the top matchups and looked at Denver's prime-time games.  Now, it's time to go game by game through the 2023 schedule.  Week 1: Broncos vs. Raiders (Sunday, Sept. 10, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting in Denver: 2022 season – Raiders 22, Broncos 16 (OT)  A year ago: Las Vegas finished 6-11 and missed the playoffs (third in AFC West)  Player to know: RB Josh Jacobs.

The speedy wide receiver was a thorn in the Broncos' side in Kansas City, and he posted a career-high 1,710 yards and 119 catches in his first year in Miami. Combined with Jaylen Waddle (1,356 yards in 2022), Hill is a formidable threat.  Major storyline: The Broncos will face off against their 2018 first-round pick, Bradley Chubb, and former head coach Vic Fangio. Miami head coach Mike McDaniel is also a former Broncos staffer.  Week 4: Broncos at Bears (Sunday, Oct. 1, 12 p.m. CT, CBS)  Last meeting: 2019 – Bears 16, Broncos 14  A year ago: Chicago finished 3-14 and missed the playoffs (fourth in NFC North)  Player to know: QB Justin Fields.

In 2021, Surtain was selected two picks ahead of Fields, who recorded 25 total touchdowns last year but threw 11 interceptions and was sacked 55 times.  Week 5: Broncos vs. Jets (Sunday, Oct. 8, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting: 2022 – Jets 16, Broncos 9  A year ago: New York finished 7-10 and missed the playoffs (fourth in AFC East)  Player to know: QB Aaron Rodgers.

Week 8: Broncos vs. Chiefs (Sunday, Oct. 29, 2:25 p.m. MT, CBS)  Last meeting in Denver: 2022 – Chiefs 34, Broncos 28  A year ago: Kansas City finished 14-3 and won the Super Bowl (first in AFC West)  Player to know: TE Travis Kelce. The 33-year-old player shows no signs of slowing down, as he caught a career-high 110 receptions and 12 touchdowns in 2022. A first-team All-Pro selection, Kelce posted 1,338 yards in 2022 and nabbed his eighth consecutive Pro Bowl appearance.

Up next for the Celtics: Joe Mazzulla said it in his interview during the broadcast: The Celtics lost their focus and took their foot off the gas pedal. You need 48 minutes to beat this Miami team. Boston really sagged off defensively and allowing 123 points is eye-opening. The other element? Late-game offense. Boston has to get Tatum and Jaylen Brown on the same page.  ADVERTISEMENT  Up next for the Heat: Miami should not change a thing. They can go for the dagger in Game 2 and will play with house money. Just keep it close for Butler time. One big thing: keep getting Bam Adebayo involved offensively. He had 20 points, eight rebounds and five assists in the win and his activity inside rattled Boston.

game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Thu 18 May 2023 05:56:00,"Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla points to the third quarter as the reason the team let Game 1 slip away vs. the Heat. (0:42)  BOSTON -- At halftime of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, things looked pretty darned good for the Boston Celtics. They'd controlled the paint, taken care of the ball and made shots, and as a result they had a 66-57 lead over the Miami Heat 24 minutes into this best-of-seven affair.  Then the third quarter started. And, yet again, the Dr. Jekyll version of Boston disappeared and the Mr. Hyde version took over.  By the time those 12 minutes had expired, the game had been turned on its head. The Heat had outscored the Celtics 46-25, turning a nine-point deficit into a 12-point lead, and Miami was on its way to a stunning 123-116 win to steal back home-court advantage in this series and leave the second-seeded Celtics reeling from how quickly things got away from them.  ""It's a choice. It's a decision,"" Jaylen Brown said when asked what happened in the second half. ""Just come out and play with a different mentality. We came out too cool. It was just almost like we were just playing a regular-season game. It's the Eastern Conference finals. Like, come on.  ""We've got to play with more intensity than we did today. We've just got to be better, including me.""  If there was something that could have shifted from the first half to the second, it did. Boston had 15 assists and five turnovers in the first half; it had seven assists and 10 turnovers in the second. On the other side, Miami took much better care of the ball, going from nine assists and 11 turnovers in the first half to 11 assists and four turnovers in the second.  The Celtics dominated points in the paint in the first half, outscoring the Heat 40-16. In the second half, Miami edged Boston 24-22. There was a similar change in second-chance points, for which Boston had an 11-2 edge in the first half compared with a 10-7 advantage for Miami in the second.  Sprinkle in the Heat shooting 16-for-31 from 3-point range on the night and Boston found itself, for the second straight series, stumbling out of TD Garden trailing 1-0 to an underdog.  ""The only thing we need to adjust to is picking up our physicality and playing some damn defense,"" Marcus Smart said. ""That's the only thing they switched. They didn't change anything from the first half that they weren't doing, they just upped their physicality and that's it.  ""There's nothing tactical, X's and O's, it's just come out and guard your yard. They scored 46 in that third, and they got going, and they made us pay, and they led into the fourth quarter.""  And while Boston's defense cost the team dearly in the third quarter, it was the offense that fell apart in the fourth. Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla tends to make observations and adjustments with an offensive mindset -- unlike predecessor Ime Udoka, who would typically lean into more physical and defense-oriented lineups. Mazzulla typically goes the other way: smaller, quicker lineups with more spacing and more shooting.  Going to reserve guard Payton Pritchard in both halves Wednesday night over Grant Williams, who was a key part of last year's playoff rotation but has disappeared this year, was a prime example. It also shows up whenever Mazzulla explains what is giving Boston issues in a game, his answers typically centering on problems on offense.  After Boston's strong ball movement in the first half disappeared down the stretch, with the team failing to make a field goal over more than four minutes late in the fourth quarter, Smart -- who had 10 assists in the first half and just one in the second -- said Boston got ""antsy,"" trying too hard to make plays individually rather than collectively.  No one exemplified that better than Jayson Tatum, who had 30 points but didn't take a shot in the fourth. He made three of his four turnovers inside the final three minutes, including on back-to-back possessions with under two minutes to go.  ""I turned the ball over, threw it to Jimmy,"" Tatum said, referring to his turnover out of a Mazzulla timeout with just under three minutes remaining. ""That was on me. Doing a shot fake, I just got sped up a little bit. Just got to slow down a little bit in those moments.""  Mazzulla chose not to call any timeouts in that disastrous third quarter, reviving a season-long storyline around his penchant for letting his players sort things out themselves.  ""I called two in the first quarter,"" Mazzulla said when asked about his lack of timeouts in the third.  When asked again, he said, ""Don't call two in the first quarter. Save it for the third-quarter run.""  Smart defended Mazzulla, saying it's not on the coach to bail the players out.  ""Joe is real big on a lot of times not bailing us out on stuff when we're playing like s---,"" Smart said. ""So, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror. Joe can call a timeout, and then what? We come out and do the same thing? It's on us.  ""Joe and his coaching staff, they put in a lot of work to come up with a game plan and put us in the right spots to succeed, but they're not out there playing. We've got to come together and we've got to start helping each other out on both ends.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25iYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3Njc0NDUzL2NlbHRpY3MtY29tZS10b28tY29vbC0ybmQtaGFsZi1nYW1lLTEtbG9zcy1oZWF00gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbmJhL3N0b3J5L18vaWQvMzc2NzQ0NTMvY2VsdGljcy1jb21lLXRvby1jb29sLTJuZC1oYWxmLWdhbWUtMS1sb3NzLWhlYXQ_cGxhdGZvcm09YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Thu 18 May 2023 06:49:04,"BOSTON — For the third time in these playoffs, the Miami Heat have won Game 1 on the road. On Wednesday, they came back from a 13-point deficit to steal home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference Finals from the Boston Celtics with a 123-116 victory.  Jimmy Butler led the way once again, filling the box score with 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and six steals. He was, simply, awesome. And having a star on your team like that certainly makes it easier to deal with a double-digit deficit.  “You know, there’s just a settling effect that is impossible to quantify,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said afterward. “Like, all right, we are in striking distance. Let’s just settle into our game, and Jimmy will make a bunch of plays, Bam [Adebayo] will make a bunch of plays, and everybody will be all right and everybody will just fit into their roles. But what’s that the great players do.”  The Miami offense went beyond Butler. Five of the other six Heat players who logged at least 10 minutes also scored at least 15 points, as the team registered its most efficient offensive performance (123 points on 97 possessions) since Game 1 of the first round.  The Celtics were more efficient than that in the first half, but couldn’t get stops in the third quarter and couldn’t stop turning the ball over in the fourth.  “I thought we just let go of the rope in the third quarter,” head coach Joe Mazzulla said, “lost that sense of urgency.”  Here are some notes, quotes, numbers and film from a game that dropped the Celtics (who were 32-9 at the TD Garden in the regular season) to just 4-4 at home in the postseason.  1. Outside game  In the regular season, the Heat ranked 20th in mid-range field goal percentage (40.8%) and 27th in 3-point percentage (34.4%). Those numbers were up through the first two rounds of the playoffs, but the Heat hit another level on Wednesday.  Miami shot 10-for-15 (67%) from mid-range and 16-for-31 (52%) from 3-point range in Game 1. Their effective field goal percentage of 73.9% on shots from outside the paint was their third-highest mark of the season in 96 total games.  Butler was the man from mid-range, shooting 6-for-9 from between the paint and the 3-point line. But he was just one of six Heat players who made at least two 3-pointers and one of four Heat players who had at least two assists on 3-pointers.  The Celtics can be pretty confident that their opponent won’t shoot that well from the outside again. But this was not just a lucky shooting night from the Heat. And the Celtics had some defensive issues, particularly in the first 12 minutes after halftime.  2. Third quarter of doom  Boston won three of the four quarters in Game 1. But they lost the third by 21 points, allowing the Heat to score an amazing 46 points on just 25 possessions, the second most efficient quarter for any team in these playoffs. And those 46 included almost half (18) of the Heat’s 40 points in the paint.  A couple of those nine buckets in the paint came off live-ball turnovers, including what would have been a beautiful dime from Robert Williams III to Kevin Love if they played for the same team. The Celtics were slow to get back against an incredible outlet pass from Love. They also got beat to the glass.  And on the Heat’s final possession of the period, Malcolm Brogdon somehow chose to guard Cody Zeller at the 3-point line instead of Max Strus:  3. Rolling below the switch  While the Heat shot ridiculously well from the outside, the Celtics dominated the paint. They scored 40 of their 62 points in the paint in the first half, when they had some success rolling below the switch.  Miami was switching more ball screens than they did in their conference semifinals series against New York. That should flatten the Celtics’ offense out, but Boston was able to get into the paint by having the screener quickly roll to the rim below the initial ball defender.  Late in the second quarter, Marcus Smart set a ball screen for Jaylen Brown along the left sideline. Strus switched it, but Caleb Martin stayed with the ball. Smart rolled into the paint, drew weak-side help, and kicked the ball out to Al Horford for an in-rhythm corner 3:  A few possessions later, Brown set a ball screen for Smart and rolled below the switch. The Heat had to rotate and Jayson Tatum was able to attack Gabe Vincent off the dribble. And on the Celtics’ last possession of the half, Smart hit Williams with a lob after Adebayo switched a screen and Williams got below the other defender (Strus):  After giving up 40 points in the paint in the first half, the Heat held the Celtics to just 22 in the second half, in part because they did a better job of getting between the roll man and the rim when they switched screens:  4. The open man  Martin is going to get some shots in this series. These are the playoffs, when more attention gets paid to the stars and more open shots are available for the role players. And in the fourth quarter on Wednesday, a couple of open shots were available for Martin.  With the Heat up five and about four minutes left, Vincent collapsed the defense with a baseline drive. He kicked the ball out to the right corner, where Martin had a great look that was off the mark, part of a five-possession scoring drought for Miami.  That drought was ended by what was probably the biggest shot of the night. And that shot was from Martin in the same exact spot. He was being guarded by Smart, who left him to double Butler in the paint. Butler found the open man and Martin drained the shot:  Martin isn’t a pure shooter. Sometimes, he’ll run himself off an open 3 and try to attack the basket. He had an incredible reverse finish late in the second quarter watching Smart (weirdly) fly by him at the 3-point line. But there was no hesitation on that one with a little more than two minutes left in the fourth.  “I knew I was shooting that one,” he said afterward, “because I missed the one before, but I knew why I missed it. I knew they were going to [leave him open] again. I knew the ball was going to come back. So I had my mind already made up.”  The Heat play a lot of close games, where every possession and every shot matters. Martin was on the floor down the stretch in place of Kevin Love on Wednesday, taking 11 shots in his 30 minutes.  “You got to be ready to knock those shots down,” he said. “That’s what the playoffs are about, for guys to step up. When your moment comes, you take advantage of it. That’s the only way you’re going to be able to overcome those moments and continue to thrive in those moments.”  5. Celtics go big again    A big reason the Celtics came back from a 3-2 deficit in the conference semis was a lineup change: Williams starting instead of Derrick White in Games 6 and 7. This is a very different series, but Mazzulla stuck with the double-bigs look for Game 1.  It didn’t work. The starting lineup was outscored by 10 points in nearly nine minutes on the floor. And like the Heat, the Celtics had a reserve — Brogdon instead of Williams — on the floor down the stretch.  The Celtics weren’t able to come all the way back from what was a 12-point deficit at the start of the period, in part because they committed four turnovers on one critical stretch of five possessions. But the Brogdon lineup was a plus-11 in its 12.0 minutes, and the Celtics looked crisper offensively when they played four guards/wings with just one big.  We’ll see if Mazzulla goes back to smaller look in Game 2 on Friday (8:30 p.m. ET, TNT). The Celtics have been in this spot before. They lost Game 1 of the conference semifinals at home to Philadelphia. And exactly one year ago, they lost Game 1 of the conference finals to this same opponent. They won both of those series in seven games.  * * *  John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here, find his archive here and follow him on Twitter.

Jauhari struck a minute into the first additional period after Yotsakorn Burapha had netted in the dying seconds of normal time to take the game into extra time with Rahman and Putra adding the gloss on a dramatic victory.  Ramadhan Sananta's first-half double had looked set to earn Indonesia the gold medal, the 20-year-old opening the scoring in the 21st minute when he steered a long throw by Alfeandra Dewangga beyond Thai goalkeeper Soponwit Rakyart.  The 20-year-old doubled the lead in first half stoppage time in spectacular fashion, lobbing home from 25 yards with Soponwit stranded on the edge of his penalty area.  Thailand, looking to claim the title for a record-extending 17th time, halved the deficit when Anan Yodsangwal headed in a 65th minute corner and then dramatically pulled level deep into stoppage time through Yotsakorn.  However, Jauhari put Indonesia back in front when he deftly lifted the ball over Soponwit before a bench-clearing brawl on the touchline raised tensions further.  Soponwit and Indonesia's Komang Teguh were sent off for their involvement in the altercation while the Thais were reduced to nine men in the 101st minute when defender Jonathan Khemdee received a second yellow card.  Rahman hit his side's fourth two minutes into the second period of extra time and Putra put the result beyond all doubt in the final minute to earn Indonesia gold for the fourth time.

Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4  WORCESTER, M.A. — A pair of rehabbers on the mound and a trio of home runs gave the Worcester Red Sox (20-20) a 9-4 win over the Lehigh Valley IronPigs (19-20) on Tuesday night at Polar Park.  Garrett Whitlock got the start for the WooSox, posting the following line: 4 IP, 5 H 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K on 49 pitches (35 strikes). The lone run allowed against him came in the third, a solo shot to Jake Cave. Whitlock reached 95-miles-per-hour on his sinker and recorded four swing-and-misses on his changeup.  Kutter Crawford followed, also on rehab, and delivered a strong outing in relief: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 0 BB, 4 K over 41 pitches (26 strikes). Lehigh Valley’s run against the right-hander also came on a long ball, a solo home run by Jordan Qsar in the sixth. Crawford's four-seamer topped out at 95.6 miles-per-hour, as he mixed in all five of his pitches. He recorded eight swing-and-misses, including three with his changeup.  Offensively, the WooSox scored in five consecutive offensive innings to take a stranglehold on the game.  Bobby Dalbec opened the scoring in the second, smashing a 112 mile-per-hour, 471-foot home run to center for his fifth of the Triple-A season. Dalbec now has 11 extra-base-hits in 23 games with Worcester.  In a 1-1 game in the third, David Hamilton delivered his team-leading eighth homer, a solo blast to right. Including tonight, Hamilton has 19 RBI in 35 games.  In the fourth, Greg Allen doubled off the Worcester Wall in right, plating Jorge Alfaro. After a walk, Nick Sogard came up with two in scoring position and drove both runners home with a single to center, putting the WooSox up 5-1.  Ryan Fitzgerald drove home two in the fifth with a moonshot of his own, his seventh of the season. Six of Fitzgerald’s seven home runs have come in the month of May, and he has 16 total hits in 12 games.  Worcester made it 8-1 on a wild pitch in the sixth that allowed Sogard to score. Manager Chad Tracy was also ejected in the inning, arguing a foul tip call with Hamilton at the plate.  In the eighth, Hamilton made it his sixth multi-RBI game of the season with a run-scoring groundout.  Out of the bullpen, Cam Booser allowed a run in the eighth on an RBI double play, while A.J. Politi got the final four outs while allowing one run to seal the home team's win.  The WooSox continue the homestand on Wednesday afternoon at 12:15 p.m. against the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.

game,2023-05-20,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 14:38:00,"Celtics Redemptive Game 7 rout put to rest some misconceptions about the Celtics Any discussion of redemption must begin in one place: with Jayson Tatum’s career-defining, climb-on-my-back-boys tour de force. Jayson Tatum went 4 for 4 on 3-pointers when guarded by 76ers big man Joel Embiid. Barry Chin/Globe Staff      The shriveling Sixers weren’t the only thing the Celtics put to rest with their rousing 112-88 rout Sunday in Game 7 of their Eastern Conference semifinal.  They also buried an assortment of negative narratives and perceptions — some fair, some never fair at all — about themselves. And that’s another fulfilling victory in itself.  Any discussion of redemption must begin in one place: with Jayson Tatum’s career-defining, climb-on-my-back-boys tour de force.  You may know the stats by heart now: 51 points, the most in a Game 7 ever. (Even more impressive, Tatum scored 67 points since the start of the fourth quarter in Game 6.) A game-high 13 rebounds. A team-high 5 assists. Tatum knocked down 17 of 28 shots, including 6 of 10 threes, and that latter stat felt more like 9 of 10.  Advertisement:  Beyond the breathtaking numbers, Tatum played a remarkably poised and intelligent game. He did not commit a turnover in 41:40 of action. For parts of the series, he would become flummoxed when coming face to face with Joel Embiid in the lane, leading to altered and awkward shots.  Sunday, he put Embiid in the blender, blowing past him at will and going 4 for 4 from three when the big man was his primary defender, including a pair of threes within about a minute of each other early in the third that put the Celtics up, 65-55, and planted the seed that this might be a runaway. It was, largely because Tatum solved the Embiid mystery.  Tatum struggled mightily at points in this series, including shooting a combined 1 of 24 — that’s 4.2 percent — from the field in the first quarters of Games 4-6. He is long proven as a superb player, having made first-team NBA two years running, but his struggles (particularly in the Finals against the Warriors last season) tended to overshadow his big-moment success (46 points on Game 6 on the road against the defending champion Bucks in last year’s East semis).  It got so tiring hearing from fans that called him soft or said he was, to paraphrase, dispassionate. But it was tough to push back on that when he was essentially absent from the first quarter in multiple games in this series.  Advertisement:  Tatum is just 25, works relentlessly on his game, and there’s still room to grow (Paul Pierce didn’t become a champion until he was 30), but as the weight on his shoulders got heavier as this series went on, it began to feel like a referendum on his status among the NBA elite and his place in Celtics lore.  Let’s just say the referendum passed in a landslide. I saw Larry Bird’s entire career, and Pierce’s too, and I’m not sure I ever saw either of them dominate a game quite like this, and that’s even without considering how Tatum’s reputation was at stake.  There’s no perfect comparison for his performance, but it reminded me of various spectacular moments in Celtics lore. It was a little bit of the Bird-Dominique Wilkins shootout in Game 7 of the ‘88 Eastern Conference semifinals … and a little of Larry’s 60-point game against the Hawks in March 1985 … and a little of Pierce’s 41-point gem in Game 7 against the Cavaliers in 2008 … and, in a team sense, of the Celtics’ 36-6 run in the third quarter against Atlanta in the clinching Game 5 of the 1986 conference semis.  Whenever you’re reminding someone of the 1985-86 Celtics — the best single-season team I’ve ever seen — you’re doing something extraordinary.  Advertisement:  (There is a common thread through those aforementioned games, by the way. Doc Rivers was involved in all of them. Isn’t that wild?)  Funny, but no one has texted or messaged me today that Tatum is soft. Hopefully that nonsense is over for good.  As for other perceptions that were proven to be either misguided or no longer existent during this series, how about this one, the notion that Tatum and Jaylen Brown don’t bring out the best in each other. I thought Game 7 was the best they have ever played in tandem, with Brown setting the tone early, scoring 25 points in total, and tormenting first-ballot Hall of Fame quitter James Harden up and down the court.  The energy, as they say, shifted when Harden whacked Brown in his unmasked face with 8½ minutes left in the second quarter and the Sixers up, 35-27. The Celtics tore off an 8-0 run after that, playing with a relentless pace that you knew would eventually wear down the Sixers. (The Celtics were the far better- conditioned team.)  I thought it was telling in all the right ways at the end of Game 6 when no one was happier for Tatum after his breakout 16-point fourth quarter than Brown. Some stars would be annoyed that their teammate kept shooting through a miserable slump with the season on the line. But Brown, who would have had every right to want the ball down the stretch, greeted Tatum with a grin, an elaborate handshake, and a big hug afterward. There is no doubt. Those two are in this together.  Advertisement:  We’ll save the discussion of Joe Mazzulla’s standing after this series for another day, and just note one more change in perception for now.  It seemed at times during the season, and even in the first-round series against the Hawks, that both Al Horford and Marcus Smart had lost a step defensively. I don’t know if they were aching or pacing themselves or what, but it became clear in this series that both remain forces on the defensive end.  I’m not sure there’s another player in the league who enjoys beating a specific team the way Horford enjoys beating the Sixers, and the 36-year-old wore down and wore out Embiid. And Smart seemed to pester, agitate, and lock down every Sixer at one time or another; he was back in his Defensive Player of the Year form from a season ago.  If Horford, Smart, and Brown too continue to set the tone with their defensive intensity, and Tatum can keep playing like a Celtics legend in his own time, anything isn’t just possible with this team. It might just be probable.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2Jvc3Rvbi1jZWx0aWNzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvY2VsdGljcy1zaXhlcnMtZ2FtZS03LWNvbHVtbi1jaGFkLWZpbm4v0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYm9zdG9uLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYm9zdG9uLWNlbHRpY3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9jZWx0aWNzLXNpeGVycy1nYW1lLTctY29sdW1uLWNoYWQtZmlubi8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

It might have been a couple of sloppy plays in the field that led to several runs. The lack of hitting certainly didn’t help, and neither did a dose of plain bad luck.  In the end, it all added up to a 6-1 loss to Manchester Academy in Game 1 of the MAIS Class 3A baseball championship series that put the Trojans’ backs to the wall.  Email newsletter signup  Manchester pitcher Brodey Walker had 10 strikeouts in a complete-game victory, and Garner Burton was 2-for-3 with one RBI and one run scored.  “I thought we would be better, but they battled. If I thought they weren’t trying it’d be a different story. But (Walker’s) a legit lefty and lefties give people trouble,” Tallulah coach Stuart King said. “He’s got three good pitches. I don’t think he’s been touched up all year. We had a game plan for him. Having one and executing it is two different things.”  Game 2 of the best-of-three series is Thursday at 5 p.m. in Yazoo City. If Tallulah Academy (24-7) can win, it’ll force a deciding Game 3 back in Tallulah on Saturday.  “We’ve got tomorrow to regroup and then we go there. We will not see the lefty. I feel like we’ll bounce back and make a game of it. I think we’ll get back here,” King said.  Tallulah never got out of the blocks offensively against Walker. The left-hander retired the first 10 batters he faced and only gave up one hit through the first six innings.  Walker also helped himself with his glove. After Wyatt Bedgood singled with one out in the fourth inning for Tallulah’s first hit, Dee Morgan followed with a hard grounder back up the middle. Walker stuck his glove down to snag it, and threw to second to start an inning-ending double play.  The double play helped Walker face the minimum number of batters through five innings. Another runner was caught stealing to end the fifth inning.  “They threw their ace at us and he was better than us tonight,” King said.  Tallulah wasn’t blessed with the same kind of luck. In the top of the fourth inning, Burton led off with a double and Ryan Johnson followed with a ground ball to shortstop, right into a defensive shift. Tallulah’s Landry Tweedle caught Burton off of second base, but the Manchester runner made it back to the bag on a close play.  Two batters later, Reed Roberts and Mills Paul hit back-to-back RBI singles to put the Mavericks ahead 5-0.  Manchester added a run on a passed ball in the fifth inning. Roberts also had an RBI single in the third, and Burton had one in the second.  “Baseball is a game of momentum. If you’ve got the momentum they’re 7 foot tall. If they don’t they’re about 3 foot tall. As a coach it’s my job to keep them level, but that’s not as easy as putting the game plan together,” King said.  Tallulah finally got on the board in the bottom of the seventh inning. Tweedle led off with a walk, went to second on an infield single by Bedgood and third on an error, then scored on a groundout by Morgan.  Hayes Hopkins kept the rally going with a single, but Walker struck out the last two batters to end the game before it blossomed into anything more.  “Our game, we’re not a big home run, gap hitting team. We have to get on base, steal bases, bunt. It’s just the way it is,” King said. “When you fall behind 6-0, even 3-0, in the later innings you have to change your game plan a little bit.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvdGFsbHVsYWgtYWNhZGVteS1kcm9wcy1nYW1lLTEtb2YtY2xhc3MtM2EtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLXNlcmllcy12cy1tYW5jaGVzdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2019-04-10,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 15:10:00,"BOSTON -- — Red Sox center fielder Jarren Duran's night started out pretty poorly. He finished it off by contributing to a slump-breaking victory.  After striking out twice and misplaying a line drive into a triple, Duran homered, singled in a run and stole a base to help Boston snap a four-game losing streak by beating the Seattle Mariners 9-4 on Tuesday night.  “It’s baseball. I punched out the first two at bats and I was like, ‘I’ve got to flush it,’” said Duran, who is batting .351 and already matched his career high of three home runs. “Just pick up my boys and just think about the guys. Like, it’s not all about me.”  Masataka Yoshida doubled, tripled, scored on a wild pitch and drove in three runs for Boston. Justin Turner and Triston Casas also homered for the Red Sox, who were swept by the last-place St. Louis Cardinals and lost the series opener to Seattle.  Nick Pivetta (3-3) allowed four runs on six hits and four walks, striking out six in 5 1/3 innings.  Taylor Trammell homered for Seattle, which had won three out of four and 10 of 14 since starting the season 11-16. Luis Castillo (2-2) allowed seven runs — five earned — on six hits and two walks while striking out six in five innings.  Yoshida tripled and Turner and Casas homered in Boston’s four-run first. But Seattle tied it in the fourth, thanks in part to Teoscar Hernandez’s sinking liner to center that Duran dove for and missed; the ball rolled past him toward the wall.  “He’s trying to make a baseball play. I’d rather have that than lack of effort,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “He’s in a great place. He’s going to make mistakes, but overall his game has been a plus everywhere.”  Trammell followed with a two-run homer to make it 4-4. Alex Verdugo doubled leading off the bottom of the fifth, and Yoshida’s one-bounce, ground-rule double in the right field corner broke the tie. The Japanese left fielder took third on a flyout and scored on Castillo’s wild pitch before Duran homered for a 7-4 lead.  Duran singled in another run in the seventh and improved to 7 for 7 on stolen bases.  “He’s a game-changer,” Turner said. “He’s got power. He’s got speed. He uses the whole field and plays great defense in the center. So it’s good to see him having success hitting the ball all over the place and running the bases like it is.”  Yoshida made it 9-4 in the eighth on a bases-loaded groundout.

game,2020-08-06,Not Discerned,"{""Oakland"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 00:30:49,"Videos by OutKick  The Oakland A’s are rapidly becoming one of Major League Baseball’s biggest embarrassments.  Attendance in Oakland has been, say, problematic, for a significant period of time.  The reasons for the erosion of fan support are multi-faceted. Partially due to ownership disinterest, fan disinterest and the worst stadium in professional sports.  But whatever little interest remains has been even further reduced in recent weeks.  Team ownership essentially announced their intention to move the A’s to Las Vegas by agreeing to purchase land off the strip.  That agreement has somehow already changed, but the overall plan remains.  READ: OAKLAND A’S ALREADY CHANGING VEGAS STADIUM PLANS DESPITE PREVIOUS BINDING AGREEMENT  That announcement combined with the longstanding issues has brought fan support to an unbelievable low.  So low, in fact, the A’s announced an attendance figure of just 2,064 for Monday’s game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.  And given video from inside the stadium, that figure may have been inflated.  Oof.  OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 06: A general view of play between the Oakland Athletics and the Texas Rangers at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum on August 06, 2020 in Oakland, California. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)  Oakland A’s Embarrassing MLB  That announced attendance, almost certainly an over-estimate, marked a new low for Oakland.  How low? The lowest announced crowd size for a home game since 1979. 44 years ago.  It also ranks as one of the least attended MLB games in the league’s recorded history. Just two other games have seen fewer fans, outside of the 2020 lockdown season.  One of those two games had a game time temperature of 34 degrees. It was not 34 in Oakland on Monday.  The attendance to see the A’s and Diamondbacks play was lower than the average of 97 different minor league franchises.  For a major league team.  Quite simply, this is an unacceptable embarrassment. And fans aren’t to blame.  The A’s organization has essentially told locals they no longer care. Investments in talent have been nonexistent. They’ve stopped pretending to want to stay in Oakland, while openly admitting to be focused on Las Vegas.  Oakland has by far the worst record in the league, on pace for historic ineptitude.  Why should anyone support them by spending money on tickets, concessions or transportation?  The fact that it’s gotten to this point is a disaster for MLB, especially considering the team has many, many more home games to play before leaving for the desert.  Given this is just May, we may see some new attendance lows set the rest of the season.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGtpY2suY29tL3RoZXJlcy1oaWxhcmlvdXMtdmlkZW8tb2Ytb2FrbGFuZC1hcy1sb3dlc3QtYXR0ZW5kZWQtZ2FtZS1zaW5jZS10aGUtMTk3MHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-15,Not Discerned,"{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 01:00:48,"By Phil Sheridan  As experiments go, this was the kind that leaves you with test tube fragments in your hair and a gaping hole in the laboratory wall.  Trying to help starting pitcher Bailey Falter get past his first-inning woes, Phillies manager Rob Thomson decided against anything so basic as letting the big lefthander work on his problems himself. Thomson’s plan: Have relief pitcher Connor Brogdon pitch the first inning and bring Falter in after an inning or two.  It was not a good idea, as illustrated by the Phillies’ 6-3 loss to the San Francisco Giants Monday night in the opener of a 3-game series.  Thomson wound up desperately turning to Falter with 2 outs in the first inning. Brogdon, who “opened” one game in his 130 career appearances, gave up two singles and a walk to load the bases with 2 out. With lefthanded-hitting Brandon Crawford due up, Thomson brought in Falter.  Instead of facing the top of the order with no one on base, Falter was facing a veteran All-Star with the bases loaded. And what do you know? Falter struck Crawford out to end the threat. So no harm, no foul, right?  Wrong, Opener-Breath.  As Ricky Bottalico pointed out on the pregame show, whenever Falter comes in, that’s the first inning for him. The bottom of the second appeared to be the first inning – ever – for Falter and his teammates.  After Falter gave up a couple of singles, second baseman Bryson Stott forgot to keep his glove open until the ball is actually in it. This was on a potential double play-starting throw from shortstop Trea Turner. It was Stott’s first error of the season. But that was just the warmup act.  With the bases loaded, the Giants’ Wilmer Flores stroked a line drive to right field. Nick Castellano held his glove out but had the same procedural difficulty as Stott. The ball bounced off his closed glove. Castellanos was able to pick up the ball and throw out the runner who had stayed at first expecting Castellanos to catch the ball.  That came up huge when Falter gave up a 3-run home run to Michael Conforto on his next pitch. That was the first of four consecutive hits Falter surrendered. When the smoke cleared and the glass bits were all over and there was a big old hole in the wall. Falter had given up 6 runs on 6 hits. The Phillies’ early 2-0 lead was a distant memory.  “I don’t think he was executing that inning,” Thomson said.  But at least Falter’s first-inning ERA wasn’t a problem! Success!  In fairness, Thomson wasn’t wrong to identify Falter’s vulnerability. After that second-inning generosity, Falter did pitch the way Thomson envisioned when he decided to delay his entry into the game. Falter did not allow another run in 3 more innings of work. He gave up a triple to Thairo Estrada in the third and a double to Casey Schmitt in the fifth.  “Credit to him, he settled in and gave us a little bit of life,” Thomson said. “He didn’t give up another run. He kind of kept us right there.”  Thomson said no decision has been made on Falter’s next start.  The question is whether Falter would have been better off just working through his early-inning woes from the mound instead of the bullpen. As it turned out, he was singled out as the guy who needs a teammate to start his game, and then gave up 6 runs in his first full inning of work. Meanwhile, the Phillies fell behind 6-2 early and were never really able to get back into it. Which just goes to show you, as Bailey Falters, so falter the Phillies.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhL3BoaWxsaWVzL3BoaWxsaWVzLWZhbHRlci1waXRjaGluZy1leHBlcmltZW50LXJvYi10aG9tc29uLWdvZXMtd3JvbmctZ2lhbnRz0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9waGlsYWRlbHBoaWEvcGhpbGxpZXMvcGhpbGxpZXMtZmFsdGVyLXBpdGNoaW5nLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtcm9iLXRob21zb24tZ29lcy13cm9uZy1naWFudHM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

James Derflinger and Jack Sand each added an RBI in the fifth to give the Saints a 9-2 advantage.

For the Bears, finishing 9-8 would certainly be respectable after finishing with the worst record in the league in 2022. Overall, Chicago has a favorable schedule. Not that it’s worth much given the turnover in the league. Aside from some juggernauts, including the Chiefs and Chargers, there are plenty of winnable games on this schedule for the Bears. We’ll see how things shake out with a Chicago team with plenty to prove heading into 2023.  Brendan Sugrue: 8-9  Things may look bleak to start the year with the Bears going 1-4, but they’ll rally to climb back to .500 by the middle of the season. Their schedule is favorable on paper, minus a few matchups. For example, having to travel to Tampa Bay in September could mean dealing with scorching temperatures. But given they will have plenty of rest throughout the season, the Bears will make huge strides from their record a year ago and be in the playoff hunt all the way until the end. Whether it’s enough to actually make the postseason is another question.  Ryan Fedrau: 8-9  8-9 is a great place to start, given the chance that a few games can go their way and they’re in the playoffs. I believe the Bears are a year away from being a playoff team. This is their year where they mold everything and next season, they put everything together and become a contender. Still, a few games bounce their way and they can be a wildcard team in 2023. If that happens, I wouldn’t be surprised.  Nate Atkins: 8-9  Possibly optimistic, but if Justin Fields makes the next step as a passer, I could see the Bears winning eight games. The Bears split the divisional matchups and won the games they should. Maybe with a couple of lucky breaks, they could win ten games by upsetting Kansas City and Los Angeles or winning both matchups with a divisional opponent.  Jarrett Bailey: 9-8  I really like what Ryan Poles is building in Chicago. They recognized their needs going into the offseason and addressed them. The linebacker position is dull? The Bears added two of the best off-ball linebackers available in Tremaine Edmunds and T.J. Edwards. Right tackle a weak spot? Chicago drafts Darnell Wright.

game,2023-05-18,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Wed 17 May 2023 05:40:02,"NEW MANCHESTER — With their backs to the wall, Oak Glen’s experienced seniors told their teammates prior to Tuesday’s elimination game that everyone needed to “play for each other” in order to stay alive.  Fittingly, it was two members of that group that led the way for the Golden Bears in the second game of the Region 1 Championship Series.  One day after passing the 500 mark for her career, Lizzie Kell racked up another 10 strikeouts to surpass the 300 mark for the season in tossing a complete game, four-hit shutout, and fellow 12th-grader Dez Carter had all three RBIs in a 3-0 win over Keyser to knot the series at 1-1.  “The seniors told the rest of the group (Tuesday) they have to play for each other, that’s valuable leadership from them and a lesson for (the underclassmen),” Golden Bears head coach Sherrie Garner said of the senior group that’s been to back-to-back state tournaments. “They know (from experience) everyone had to put their best foot forward (after the loss Monday) so we could perform as a team.  “Win to extend, that was the saying this morning. This senior group has been here before, they’ve been in these situations before and they’re the leaders of this group. We have to fall behind them whichever way we can.”  The teams will play a winner-take-all Game 3 today at Keyser with a trip to the state tournament on the line.  Aside from simply keeping the season alive, it also gave the Bears six seniors one more win at the Field of Dreams Complex as it was their final home game regardless of the result today.  After being held off the board until the seventh in Game 1, the Golden Bears (24-9) wasted no time in getting on the board in Game 2.  Sarah Brown started a two-out rally in the first with a single, then, after the first of three Keyser (23-6) errors, scored when Carter singled to make it 1-0.  That would have been enough for Kell.  The Golden Tornado perhaps had its best chance to score in the top of the fifth when, after a dropped pop up in foul territory with two outs kept the inning alive, Averi Everline hit a hard-liner with runners on the corners that seemed destined to score at least one run — but senior Liv Munoz made a jumping, acrobatic snag and held on after falling to the ground to preserve the 1-0 lead.  In the bottom half, again with two outs, Carter put another ball into the outfield grass, plating two runs to provide the final margin.  Keyser’s Charity Wolfe finished with a double and Susie Cosenza two singles.  “We just couldn’t get anything going offensively,” Keyser head coach Colton Jones said. “Our pitching and defense weren’t bad. We need to execute a little bit better and put the ball in play.  “Game 3 is at our place, you definitely want to play for all the marbles at home.”  WVSSAC Class AA  Region 1 Championship Series  Game 2 at Oak Glen High School  Oak Glen 3, Keyser 0  Keyser 0-0-0 0-0-0 0 – 0 4 3  Oak Glen 1-0-0 0-2-0 x – 3 7 1  KEYSER (23-6): Mongold (LP, 6IP, 3R, 2ER, 7H, 7K, 1BB) and Likins.

game,2023-04-17,Not Discerned,"{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}",Wed 17 May 2023 05:15:00,"TORONTO - Domingo German might have been baffled by his ejection Tuesday for a sticky substance on his pitching hand, but two things were abundantly clear.  ""It's the stickiest hand I've ever felt,'' said umpire crew chief James Hoye, telling a pool reporter that ""it was definitely not rosin,'' despite German's claims.  And the Yankees are in deeper trouble as a pitching staff, with German facing an automatic 10-game suspension.  ""That's Domingo's responsibility,'' manager Aaron Boone said of German's use of, well, whatever he's applying to his pitching hand during a start.  ""The reality is, we should all have a very good idea what the line is and apparently Domingo crossed it.''  David Wells' perfect game:25 years later, teammate David Cone tells us how it impacted 1998 season  And for the second straight night, the Yankees became steeped in a controversy against the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre.  After three perfect innings Tuesday, the right-handed German was ejected following a routine inspection of his pitching hand.  Yet, in another test of the Yankees' resolve, a wearying bullpen - and another clutch, go-ahead home run by Aaron Judge - sent them toward a 6-3 victory against the tough Toronto Blue Jays.  ""Just another gutsy effort by that group out there that keeps competing,'' said Boone.  Anatomy of another Yankees controversy  At least, the Yankees should have Luis Severino back in their rotation Sunday at Cincinnati.  Sidelined since spring training due to a lat strain, Severino made his second minor league rehab stint Tuesday, going 3.1 innings (58 pitches, two runs, six hits, one walk, three strikeouts) for Class AA Somerset.  That determination should be made Wednesday, when German - barring appeal - would begin his suspension.  ""I’ve got to apologize to my teammates,'' German said through an interpreter. ""I’m putting them in a tough position right now, and how much the bullpen is being used.''  It was Hoye's crew that warned German of excess use of rosin, April 15, in a game at Yankee Stadium against the Minnesota Twins.  At that time, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli felt that German should have been ejected since the umpires told him to clean off the excess rosin and he came back out with some sticky substance still on part of his hand.  German, through an interpreter, said it was because he works the rosin bag between innings, in the dugout.  Mindful of that, with Hoye's umpiring crew Tuesday, German only used the sandy rosin bag exclusively and he only used it on the mound, not in the dugout.  Domingo German disputes umpires' claims  First base ump DJ Reyburn checked German after the first inning, but not again until German came out to pitch the bottom of the fourth inning, with the Yankees leading 2-0.  ""(German's) hand was clearly shiny on the palm and his fingertips, and it was extremely sticky,'' said Hoye, who confirmed Reyburn's claim, as did the other two umpires.  ""We all had the same opinion: shiny, extremely sticky, and it's the worst hand we've ever felt during a game,'' said Hoye. ""So, we got together, we decided we were going to eject him at that point for foreign substance.''  Hoye insisted it was not rosin, which ""usually is kind of like a little tackiness. This was sticky, as in my fingers had a hard time coming off his palm.''  German says he ""didn't get a pure explanation at the moment'' of his ejection. He expressed confusion about not getting ""a clear direction from them to find out what’s appropriate and what’s too much'' with what he insisted was rosin and sweat and nothing else mixed in.  As to the substance TV cameras caught on his pants, German smiled and said: ""That was chewing tobacco.''  After the game, an unsmiling Boone said he had ""a good conversation,'' with German. ""I’ll just leave it at that.''  More Yankees headaches, controversies  Ian Hamilton replaced German, who is now likely headed to the injured list.  Given all the time he needed to warm up, Hamilton loaded the bases with two out and exited the game due to groin tightness. He's headed to New York for tests and he's likely ""going to be down a little bit,'' Boone said.  Before the game, MLB officials became involved with the Yankees and Blue Jays, regarding the positioning of Yankees base coaches Travis Chapman and Luis Rojas following Monday night's 7-4 Yankees win.  In the eighth inning of that game, TV cameras caught Aaron Judge's eyes darting toward the Yankees dugout right before several of reliever Jay Jackson's pitches, the last of which Judge crushed for his second homer of the game.  During the third inning of Tuesday night's game, umpires seemed to warn Rojas, the Yanks' third base coach, about straying beyond the coaching lines.  After some apparent heated moments between Rojas and the umpires, and a back-and-forth with Toronto's coaches in their dugout, Rojas resumed his place along the third base coaching lines.  The Yankees appeared to use the same complaint in the fourth inning to prevent Toronto third base coach Luis Rivera from straying beyond the lines.  By the fourth inning, both the first base coaches of the Yanks and Jays were standing at least 10 feet beyond the coaching line.  Hoye said MLB directed the crew to keep the coaches in their boxes.  ""(Rojas) was a couple steps off and so there seemed to be some disagreement about that,'' Hoye said. ""We made sure he was in,'' as they also did later with Rivera at the Yankees insistance.  “It’s just silliness. It’s ridiculous,’’ said Boone. “And I think everyone, I hope on both sides, realizes that.’’",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoamVyc2V5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvbWxiL3lhbmtlZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9kb21pbmdvLWdlcm1hbi1lamVjdGVkLXBpdGNoLXlhbmtlZXMtdnMtYmx1ZS1qYXlzLzcwMjI1ODc4MDA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Birds are now 12-2 in such games. The Angels 9-5 win was led by Shohei Ohtani, who gave up three home runs on the mound but hit a three-run homer at bat as part of a 4-for-5 game where he came up a double short of the cycle.  Adam Frazier and Anthony Santander hit two-run homers off Ohtani and Cedric Mullins added a solo shot. In two career starts against the Orioles, Ohtani has allowed nine runs in 12 innings and has given up six homers, including two each to Mullins and Santander. His five runs allowed last night tied his season high.  But the O’s starter, rookie right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, allowed nine hits and eight runs over 3 1/3 innings. That is the most runs allowed by a Baltimore starting pitcher this year. Coming into this series, O’s starters had a 1.74 ERA their previous eight games, allowing two earned runs or less seven times.  The Orioles bullpen allowed just a single run over 5 2/3 innings last night. The Baltimore bullpen has a 1.48 ERA (five ER/30.1 IP) over the last eight games.  Best bullpen ERAs in MLB in 2023  2.76 – Seattle  3.00 – Orioles  3.14 – Cleveland  3.18 – New York Yankees  3.21 – Houston  After allowing a career-high-tying three earned runs on Opening Day in Boston, Bryan Baker has allowed just one earned run over his last 19 appearances (19.1 IP). Among pitchers with at least 18 innings pitched since March 31, Baker's 0.47 ERA (one ER/19.1 IP) ranks second in MLB, behind only teammate Yennier Cano (0.00), and just ahead of fellow O's hurler Félix Bautista, whose 1.00 ERA (two ER/18.0 IP) in that span ranks fifth.  The Angels won for just the third time in nine games last night, improving to 22-20. They are 12-11 on the road and 4-7 versus American League East teams.  The Orioles (26-15) are now 4.5 games behind Tampa Bay for first in the AL East. Toronto is in third place, 6.5 back, with New York 7.5 out and Boston nine games back of the Rays.  Right-hander Dean Kremer (4-1, 4.97 ERA), who has thrown 11 straight scoreless innings, takes the mound for Baltimore tonight. On Wednesday versus Tampa Bay he pitched six scoreless on four hits, all singles, throwing 95 pitches. He walked two and fanned four, earning the win as the Orioles beat the Rays 2-1 to win that series.  In the start before that at Atlanta, Kremer allowed one run in the first inning, but then threw five scoreless to conclude his outing. So he’s put up 11 straight scoreless versus the Rays and Braves, who rank one and two in the majors in team OPS at .856 and .804, respectively.  Kremer, who has three quality starts, has a 1.464 WHIP this season, allowing 10.4 hits per nine with a 1.5 homer rate, 2.8 walk rate and 6.9 K rate.  Lefty batters have fared much better against him this season than right-handers. Lefties are batting .350 with an OPS of .927 versus Kremer while right-handers hit .238/.697. The Orioles are 5-3 in his outings this year.  Right-hander Chase Silseth (0-0, 3.24 ERA) will make his fifth appearance and first start of the year for the Angels. He has thrown just 8 1/3 innings in the majors this season, allowing five hits and six runs (three earned). He began this season ranked by Baseball America as the Angels’ No. 3 prospect.  The 22-year-old right-hander was drafted by Los Angeles in round 11 of 2021 and got an overslot $485,000 bonus. He then became the first player from the 2021 draft to make the majors.  He has made four Triple-A starts this year for Salt Lake City, going 2-0 with an 0.90 ERA. He was the Pacific Coast League Player of the Week for the period from April 3-9.  He has made one career start against the Orioles, going 0-1 with an ERA of 9.00. On July 7, 2022 he gave up six hits and four runs over four innings in a start at Camden Yards.

game,2023-05-14,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 13:55:11,"Doc Rivers won an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics back in 2008. The only active head coach who has won more games than him is Gregg Popovich. But at this point, when NBA fans think of Rivers, one of the first things that usually comes to mind is his not-so-storied history of blowing series leads.  Toward the end of their blowout Game 7 loss to the Boston Celtics (a series in which they once held a 3-2 series advantage), The Athletic’s Mike Prada tweeted out this eye-opening statistic:  Assuming Philly doesn't rally, Doc Rivers-coached teams will fall to 16-33 when they have three wins in a seven-game series. — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Rivers is 16-33 in playoff games where his team already has three wins. That’s a win percentage of roughly 32.7%, which is right around the same win percentage the lowly Charlotte Hornets mustered up during the regular season (32.9%).  Now, high-stakes playoff games are much more difficult to win than banal regular season matchups, so comparing Rivers to the Hornets isn’t 100 percent fair. But when you compare his record to that of other coaches in those situations, the disparity in his performance compared to theirs becomes far more pronounced.  Here is a look at some other win-loss records of coaches with three wins in a playoff series (all the data provided by Prada):  Now, it isn’t completely fair to compare Rivers to the likes of Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, and Erik Spoelstra. Those guys are some of the best to ever do it. Of course, they will have incredible win-loss records in these sorts of games.  However, what is very telling is that even George Karl – a coach with a similar reputation to Rivers in regards to his affinity for blowing series leads – has a 50% win percentage in these situations.  To put some even more context on the matter, here are some of the highlights (or rather lowlights) of that 16-33 record:  Doc Rivers teams have also now blown three 3-1 leads, four other 3-2 leads, one other 2-0 lead, and have lost Game 7 at home four times (five if you count the bubble).    He's now 6-10 in Game 7s. https://t.co/ha0spYfvUa — Mike Prada. (PRAY-duh) (@MikePradaNBA) May 14, 2023  Arguably the craziest of all those blown leads is the fact that he’s conceded three 3-1 leads. In the history of the NBA Playoffs, a team has come back from a 3-1 series deficit only 13 times. That means that about 23.1% of all 3-1 collapses in NBA history have happened under Rivers’ watch.  Now, this isn’t to say Rivers is a bad coach or anything or that his legacy is set in stone. He’s got an NBA title to his name, and he’s still only 61 years old, with another two years left on his contract.  All told, Rivers is still a good coach (you need to be to get a chance to blow that many series leads!), and he’ll hopefully get another shot to nip his lead-blowing demons in the bud.

The game was in development at Industrial Toys, a studio founded by Bungie veteran Alex Seropian and acquired by EA in 2018. Seropian told MobileGamer.biz that at the start of development on Battlefield Mobile, things were looking ""super good"" due to the shooter genre growing on mobile, the strength of the Battlefield franchise, and the caliber of the team.  However, the tepid reception to Battlefield 2042's launch in 2021 combined with Apple's changes to its ""identifier for advertisers"" (IDFA) system, and other factors, contributed to EA making the call to close up shop.  The community reaction to Battlefield 2042, which was not good, led to a ""bunch of introspection"" about the future of the Battlefield series, Seropian said. As for the IDFA changes, in essence, it made user acquisition ""a lot more expensive,"" Seropian explained.  ""So organics eroded away with 2042's release, and paid distribution got an order of magnitude more expensive because of the IDFA rules,"" he said.  EA also canceled Apex Legends Mobile, another title that many believed could be a big success and help expand the brand beyond console/PC in a way that Call of Duty Mobile did. Seropian said people can ""fill in the blanks"" and make some educated guesses as to why EA pulled back from Apex Legends Mobile, too.  ""I don't know if EA has talked about why they canceled it, whether it was economics or whatever, but without me saying, you could fill in the blanks, I guess,"" he said.  Battlefield Mobile's soft launch in a number of territories apparently performed well, but Seropian's team needed more time and money to get the game ready for a global rollout. Battlefield Mobile was also not planned to be a ""connected"" experience with other versions of Battlefield in a way that skins for a game like Fornite, for example, also move with players across devices. Battlefield Mobile was going to be a ""bespoke experience for mobile,"" with the gameplay tailored to a mobile experience.  The challenges of Battlefield 2042, Apple's IDFA rule changes, the team needing more time and money, and the bespoke nature of Battlefield Mobile all contributed to EA eventually calling it quits, Seropian said.  EA isn't abandoning the Battlefield series, though. Battlefield 2042 is in a much better state these days and the game continues to get new updates. Looking further out, EA has outlined a strategy for a Battlefield connected universe that includes multiple titles from multiple teams.

(0:54)  The Philadelphia 76ers dismissed coach Doc Rivers on Tuesday, the team announced.  The Sixers were eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals for a third straight season, losing 112-88 in Game 7 to the Boston Celtics on Sunday.  The search for a new coach is expected to include Mike Budenholzer, Sam Cassell, Mike D'Antoni, Nick Nurse, Frank Vogel and Monty Williams, sources told ESPN.  Most consecutive winning seasons as coach, NBA history Doc Rivers is one of five head coaches in NBA history to record a winning record in at least 16 consecutive seasons. He has won one title during that span, and it came in the first season of the streak (with the Celtics). Coach Streak Gregg Popovich (1997-2019) 22 Phil Jackson (1989-2011) 20 Pat Riley (1981-2001) 19 Doc Rivers (2007-pres.) 16 Jerry Sloan (1988-2004) 16 -- ESPN Stats & Information  Rivers delivered a 154-82 (.653) record in his three seasons, including 54 victories in 2022-23 -- the franchise's most since 2000-01. The Sixers were one of three teams in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.  ""Doc is one of the most successful coaches in NBA history, a future Hall of Famer, and someone I respect immensely,"" 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey said in a statement. ""We're grateful for all he did in his three seasons here and thank him for the important impact he made on our franchise. After having the chance to reflect upon our season, we decided that certain changes are necessary to further our goals of competing for a championship.""  Philadelphia joins the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns, Toronto Raptors and Detroit Pistons among teams with head-coach openings.  Rivers, who delivered his 16th straight winning season as a head coach, lost for the 10th time in a Game 7, including five in a row. The defeat to the Celtics also marked the ninth straight time that Rivers lost with a chance to reach the conference finals.  Now, Philadelphia heads into the offseason not only conducting a search to replace Rivers, but also needing to navigate James Harden's impending free agency.  After Sunday's Game 7 loss in Boston, Harden was asked about the state of his relationship with Rivers, and whether he believed the coach should return for a fourth season.  In response, Harden simply said, ""Our relationship is OK.""  Harden has a player option for next season worth $35.6 million, after taking a pay cut last summer to help facilitate Philadelphia signing former Rockets teammates P.J. Tucker and Danuel House.  If Harden opts out of his deal, he's eligible to sign a four-year, $202 million deal with another team, or a four-year, $210 deal to remain in Philadelphia, per ESPN's Bobby Marks. The 76ers are unable to sign Harden for a fifth season, despite having his Bird rights, because of the over-38 rule in the NBA's collective bargaining agreement.  Should Harden leave in free agency, Philadelphia still won't have cap space to replace him. Instead, the 76ers will have the full midlevel exception, worth a little over $12 million, to try to supplement its roster.  Harden came to Philadelphia in a blockbuster trade in February 2022 after a turbulent 13 months with the Brooklyn Nets, in a deal that sent Ben Simmons, Seth Curry and Andre Drummond to Brooklyn.  This season, Harden averaged 21 points and 10.7 assists, helping Joel Embiid to win the league's MVP award for the first time and joining Embiid as the first teammates to win both the scoring and assist titles for a season since George Gervin and Johnny Moore of the San Antonio Spurs in 1982.  Harden shot 37-for-61 (60.6%) in Philadelphia's three wins against Boston, including a 45-point game with Embiid sidelined in Game 1 and a 42-point outburst in Game 4, but was 12-for-55 (21.8%) in the four losses, including going 3-for-11 in Game 7.

game,2023-05-11,Not Discerned,"{""Boulder"", ""Colorado"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 05:16:01,"By VERNON ROBISON  The Progress  The Moapa Valley High School softball team ended its 2023 season with a 16-5 loss against the Boulder City Eagles in the semifinal game in the 3A Southern Region playoffs on Thursday, May 11.  The loss dropped the Pirates out of the tournament just a game short of qualifying for this week’s state tournament in Mesquite.  The game against Boulder City came immediately after the Pirates had fought their way through a huge win against Clark High School to advance to the semi-final. The Pirates began that game from behind as Clark had stepped out to a 2-1 lead in the first inning.  But the Pirates took the lead with three runs in a critical third inning. Tyelar Anderson brought one of those home with a ground out. Kyndall Longman hit a single that scored another run in the frame.  The Pirates kept the lead from there, scoring two more runs in the top of the final inning. The final score was 6-3.  The win advanced the Pirate girls to the big game which immediately followed against the Eagles. Though they were tired in this second game of the day, after a week of rigorous competition, the Moapa team gave their all. The Pirates ended up outhitting the Boulder City team 6-5. But they struggled to put runs on the board.  The fatigue showed specifically on defense where the Pirates gave up 16 runs in the game.  Moapa pulled ahead early in the game scoring 4 runs in the top of the first inning. Boulder City answered with 3 runs of their own in the bottom of the frame.  The Moapa team managed another run to start the second inning. But the Eagles answered with five runs in the bottom of the inning and six more in the third to take a commanding lead that they would not give up. This seemed to take the wind from the Pirate sails. The team didn’t score again and the game was called on the mercy rule in the fifth inning.  The Pirates had begun the tournament with a 3-2 loss to Clark on Monday afternoon in Las Vegas. They spent the rest of the week marching their way through the consolation bracket.  Moapa blanked Canyon Springs on Tuesday for a 15-0 victory. Then they battled with Pahrump Valley on Wednesday for a close 14-13 win. That brought them to the long Thursday double-game schedule with Clark and Boulder City.  The Pirate team ended as 3rd in the Southern Region, just short of the state championship running.  MVHS Head Coach John Stastny said that the season had been full of learning life lessons for both girls and coaches.  “During the tournament we realized that all of the little things really matter and m,ake the difference against good teams in intense situation,” Stastny said. “It takes a group of individuals, willing to work on those small things in their own positions, who come together and give 100 percent to their team in order to experience success.”  Stastny added that he loved working with the girls of this year’s team. “I loved our mix of 4 seniors, 5 juniors, a sophomore and a freshman,” he said. “I hope that the girls form a bond and enjoy working with each other, even if they aren’t best friends off of the softball diamond.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbXZwcm9ncmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNi9waXJhdGVzLWZhbGwtb25lLWdhbWUtc2hvcnQtYXQtcmVnaW9uYWxzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2018-10-05,Not Discerned,"{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 20:04:00,"It’s time we stopped thinking of cybersecurity as a problem. Instead, it’s a game, with each side trying to outthink and outmaneuver the other. Bad actors can choose when and how to exploit vulnerabilities, but defenders need to know all possible inroads and be prepared for a range of outcomes. Threat intelligence (TI) can give agencies a meaningful advantage by providing situational awareness in context.  Still, gathering knowledge is only part of how the game is played. Staying ahead of adversaries essentially comes down to three elements: visibility, capabilities, and governance, and all are tied to the impact of TI on your security posture.  Awareness delivers a decision advantage  TI is about predicting the future, not explaining the past. Its job is to give you greater awareness, helping you anticipate an adversary’s next move. By correlating internal data, open-source information and third-party inputs, TI helps you spot obscure connections and patterns. This is crucial to identifying threats early enough to do something about them; TI is vital for rationalizing strategies, placing bets, and dynamically rethinking countermeasures.  A smarter defense looks at all the angles  Some attackers are after a specific prize, but in some cases, you might actually be a target of chance, not a target of choice. This means intruders aren’t looking for something specific, and if blocked in one direction, they may simply try another.  That’s why generating intelligent responses to threats takes diversity of thought and perspectives. Angles are not just technical; they are informed by people with different functional, operational, and even life experience backgrounds. Responses today are less about suppressing a single alert and more about stringing alerts together to look through the eyes of the adversary, informing a broader community defense model.  Augmenting the human touch  AI-based automation can play a critical role across the three stages of TI: collection, analysis, and dissemination. AI empowers human decision makers to keep pace with, if not get ahead of, attackers.  AI can also lift long-standing burdens that many agencies face. First, there’s the issue of alert fatigue; if each alarm represents a top priority, how can analysts, who are already spread too thin, choose which fire to fight first? Next, the siloed or bespoke systems found throughout government require too many separate queries, which adds a complexity and time barrier to cyber defense. AI can enable higher confidence, faster, and better coordinated processes, so you can quickly identify the threat and mount an appropriate response.  Governance is everyone’s business  Zero Trust embodies the rules and principles that govern security across the agency. A Zero Trust approach also supports every player on the defensive team, making everyone across the agency essential to security.  Under Zero Trust principles, TI informs a common operational picture of your threat landscape, and surfaces threats that would most likely impact your agency’s operations. This enables you to focus on the bad actors and threat vectors most likely to impact your agency’s operations.  The best strategies are intelligence-led  We’ve all worked tirelessly dealing with threats, and while as an industry, we’re getting better, the challenge is getting harder faster than we are getting better. We need to start thinking differently: we need to find ways to get more defenders in the game, we need Zero Trust to protect people and data across government (and keep bad actors from looking like good ones), we need AI to grow the effectiveness of our cyber strategies, and we need threat intelligence to inform and drive our priorities. Going forward, this is how the game of cyber security will be played.  Read more about integrating security intelligence tools to defend against modern threats.

game,2023-05-20,15:00:00,Not Discerned,Tue 16 May 2023 08:15:47,"Quarto is so easy to learn that I was both introduced to it and taught the rules over the course of a single, brisk, Tiktok. It's a two-player board game that plays out on a 4x4 grid. Players take turns putting pieces on the grid. The objective is to get a line of four pieces, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, across the board.  This sounds like Connect 4, but rather than using pieces of different colours - I'm red and you're blue - Quarto's pieces are little towers that have a mix of four different characteristics. Pieces can be tall or sort, square or round, can be solid or hollow, and can be dark or light. Every piece is some of these things, so one will be dark, short, hollow, and round. Another will be solid, short, dark and square. The objective is to ensure that every piece in the line of four pieces you make shares at least one characteristic. You don't have to place all the pieces in the line, but you do have to complete it, at which point you shout ""Quarto!""  One final rule. Your opponent chooses the piece you play each turn, and you choose the piece they play.  To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings  Quarto is extremely good. God, it's quick, too. Our set arrived last night and my daughter went from bemusement as I tried to explain the rules to absolutely flattening me in the space of ten minutes. I love the simplicity of it, but also the fiendishness. That 4x4 grid? Not a lot of real estate there, so you're elbow to elbow from an early point in the game. I also love the ritual of politely handing your enemy the absolute most useless piece you can find, smiling at them sweetly, and wishing them well.  Deep down - maybe not so deep down, actually - I think Quarto's about zugzwang, a word I might be badly misusing, but which is so much fun to type I'm going to take the risk. From my understanding zugzwang comes from games like chess, the idea being that it's a state in which you have to make a move, but any move you make will damage you significantly, and you know this.  That's Quarto. There gets a point where you're going to have to hand your opponent a piece that will win them the game, or a point at which you've maneuvered your opponent into a position where they have to hand you a winning piece. So it's all about tempo. It's also all about your options disappearing. After about four turns each the board will often be in a state where nobody wants to play a light piece or a square piece anymore, say, as both are contributing to lines that are almost complete. You're trying to screw over your opponent, but in this weird world of total information.  I've been after a game like this for some time, a game which is simple, quick, and sort of self-contained, by which I mean it draws you and the person you're playing with so deeply into a shared world that you might as well both be sitting in the drum of a washing machine as you play. The rest of the world disappears. Strangers have no clue what you're doing. And then the game turns against you and your enemy shouts, ""Quarto!""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvcXVhcnRvLWlzLWEtYm9hcmQtZ2FtZS10aGF0LW1ha2VzLXp1Z3p3YW5nLXRoZS1zdGFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Now, as the Amerks return to Rochester in Round 3, they’re leading the series by two games. While the situations are in stark opposition, the focus is still the exact same.  Just win one game.  That’s been the message from the coaching staff — and from the leadership group in the locker room — for the last five games. As the Amerks faced elimination in three-straight games, the mindset stayed the same: just win one game. And the Amerks did.  They won one game.  And then they won one game, again.  And then they won one game to advance to the North Division finals.  Tomorrow, in front of the home crowd, the Amerks will try to win one game. And they’ll try to eliminate the Marlies from the Calder Cup Playoffs as they do so. It won’t be an easy task against the top-seeded Toronto team, even with a 2-0 series lead.  “Our guys know how hard it is to end someone’s season,” Amerks head coach Seth Appert said after practice on Tuesday. “We have a tremendous amount of respect for Toronto, but our focus is just preparing to just win a game.”  The preparation for the game comes in having good habits at practice, it comes in productive video sessions, and it comes with rest, too. “What can we do today, on a Tuesday, to get ready, to put ourselves mentally and physically in the best position to win one game,” Appert said.  There have been adjustments since the two games in Toronto, aimed at finding ways to exploit Toronto’s weak spots and take away their strengths. There have also been adjustments made to the Amerks’ game, and a focus on tweaking the penalty kill.  Before assessing the PK, though, Appert made sure to give credit to Toronto, who had the second-best power play in the league throughout the regular season. “At the end of the day, it’s really important you stay out of the box,” he explained. “You can kill off two or three, but if you’re giving them four, five, or six, usually a good power play like Toronto is going to get you.”  Rochester is also seeing a good power play during the playoffs so far. The Amerks’ unit ranks second in the league, converting on 34.6% of power plays in seven games. Rookie Jiri Kulich has scored four of his five postseason goals on the power play.  Jiri Kulich has scored a goal in every playoff game he’s played in…    The rookie is HOT 🔥 pic.twitter.com/anldTns8GR — x-Rochester Americans (@AmerksHockey) May 13, 2023  In fact, he has a goal in every playoff game he’s suited up for. Kulich’s 5-game goal streak matches the longest in an AHL postseason since Peter Holland for Toronto in 2014.  “We’re all extremely impressed with Jiri,” Appert said. “I think that it’s just a biproduct of the work he’s been putting in, especially in the second half of the season.""  ""His habits, the maturity to his game, competing for the puck, those things started to take off at a high level and his offensive numbers went with it.”  Kulich led the Rochester squad with 24 goals, and 17 of those came in the second-half of the season. His nine power play goals were also best on the team. “A player of his caliber, when you have the puck, good things can happen,” Appert said.  The Amerks are hoping for a few good things tomorrow night, but one thing is certain: the crowd is going to be electric. Wednesday night’s game is very quickly approaching a sellout, with over 9,500 tickets out.  The team is excited to play in front of the rowdy home crowd and to use the home ice to their advantage. “I thought in the Syracuse series, we did a great job of bringing the fans into the fight,” Appert said. Big hits, fights, and early goals: “Those are things that really get a crowd going. Let’s make sure we do those things early and often.”  And just win one game.  Only a handful of tickets remain for Game 3 at Blue Cross Arena on Wednesday night. The first 5,000 fans will receive a red Round 3 rally towel, and fans can enjoy Pregame Happy Hour, presented by the Genesee Brewery: get $2 beers until puck drop at the Genesee Brewhouse inside Blue Cross Arena.  Fans can also get the playoff party started early at the Genesee Brewhouse: Sabres Live will be broadcasting live from 12-1pm and then Marty & Duffer will be hanging out until 2pm!

Or in the words of its developers Irreverent Labs, entered ""indefinite hibernation"". The game would have starred 'mechabots': Robotic chickens that were being sold as NFTs to verify each chicken's uniqueness. It was intended as a so-called ""play-to-earn"" game where players would level the chickens and theoretically sell them on at a higher price. I'm not making this up.  This hype video shows (opens in new tab) the production values weren't too bad, though as soon as the fighting starts it's pretty clear this wouldn't have been a good game. But then the game's cancellation is probably the least bizarre thing about this whole story. The studio behind the game has one of the most irritating websites I've ever used (opens in new tab) and has pivoted away from NFTs onto a new area of focus: AI. That may seem like swapping one grift for another, but it's even more astonishing in the light of the fact it raised $40 million in private funding to make MechaFightClub (opens in new tab), disclosed in an SEC filing.  At least some of the cash still remains. The one silver lining for fans of MechaFightClub (presuming there are any) is that Irrereverent Labs announced the cancellation alongside a buyback program called, and again I'm not making this up, Sol 4 Cocks.  It’s time for Sol 4 Cocks: we’re repurchasing your Mechabots and putting MFC into indefinite hibernation. This was a tough decision. For more details, visit our official announcement here: https://t.co/TPfb1VP2C7 pic.twitter.com/6YnO4g50T4May 11, 2023 See more  Sol refers to the popular cryptocurrency Solana, which is currently trading at around $21 per unit. So the buyback offer values each robot chicken at $378. Look, I just work here.  Irreverent Labs' official statement on what's happened reads as equal parts misleading and delusional (opens in new tab). It also says absolutely everything about this corner of the industry that the first two pages (of four) are dedicated to the risk of scams around Sol 4 Cocks, before going on to moan about those pesky regulators and how they made the NFT cockfighting dream impossible.  ""The theme, culture, art, story and underpinning goals of MFC remain with us, but we can’t continue to develop it as a blockchain game,"" says Irreverent Labs. ""Unfortunately, the regulatory and operations environment around blockchain within the USA has drastically changed in the last two years.  ""We are an American company, and a lack of clarity is making it difficult for blockchain companies to operate here. In the current regulatory confusion, we simply couldn’t create an in-game economy without concern about the regulatory ramifications. We have no way to know how long this will continue, or when it will get better. We simply can’t ask you to wait any longer.""  It's not that the bottom is falling out of the crypto market or people have completely lost whatever confidence there ever was in NFTs, then. It's the government! It does make you wonder where that $40 million came from, and how much more money is sloshing around in lunatic projects like this: Probably more than one would like to imagine.

It's so inviting that even non-gamers should try it.  The new Ultrahand tool is leading to some unexpectedly weird player behavior.  Nintendo  Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (TotK) might not technically be the best game ever made—how would you even measure that anyway, between this and Tetris? But it is already becoming a cultural phenomenon.  The new Zelda (for Switch) came out last Friday, and many of us have been unable to stop playing it ever since. It's the latest in a long line of Zelda games, and a direct sequel to 2017's 'Breath of the Wild', sharing the same game map, control system, and overall art style. Breath of the Wild was already regarded as (another one of) Nintendo's masterpieces, and yet the consensus is that Tears of the Kingdome improves on the original in almost every way.  ""I personally think even this early on, it is by far the best Legend Of Zelda game by a long shot. Is it the best game ever made, however? Honestly, I can’t really say yet,"" Mark Cruz, proprietor of the retro-gaming YouTube channel The Retro Mark Cruz, told Lifewire via email.  Do Literally Anything in 'Tears of the Kingdom'  I grew up playing video games that you loaded into a computer from a tape, and I always dreamed of a game where you could wander the world and interact with pretty much anything. In Zelda, that's exactly what you can do. In fact, you could pretty much make up your own game within a game, building a house, keeping a horse, and foraging for dinner every day. But that's getting ahead of ourselves.  Everything in Tears of the Kingdom has been upgraded. The basic contours of the world are the same, but the world itself has grown and changed. New characters join existing ones, and of course, there are new missions to complete. The world has also expanded up into a shoal of Sky Islands and down into underground cave systems. The visuals are better, the character dialog improved, and the world feels more populated and real.  But the biggest change, and the one that takes this game over the edge, compared to any other game, and will turn Zelda from a game into a meme machine, is the Ultrahand.  TotK Ultrahand and Korok Torture  The Ultrahand is an update to BotW's Magnesis, a special power that lets you use a magnetic beam to lift and toss around metallic objects of any size. The Ultrahand extends this ability to pretty much everything around you. Use the beam to lift, turn, and otherwise manipulate fallen tree trunks, apples, swords, boats, and more. And here's the neat part. You can use the Ultrahand to glue things together.  Nintendo  The Ultrahand is essential to completing some puzzles, and you can use it to do practical things like sticking wheels to an old wooden board and attaching a fan to make a car or repairing broken machinery.  But the possibilities are endless. I built a wooden screen on wheels that I rolled past a huge creature sleeping on a bridge, so it wouldn't see me behind it. And other players have gotten a little darker with their creations. One created a giant phallus from a tree trunk and a pair of rocks and used it to beat a creature to death. Another popular pastime, apparently, is torturing Koroks.  Koroks are cute little woodland creatures, and in Tears of the Kingdom, one diversion has you reuniting separated Koroks. Usually, this involves the Ultrahand, which can grab Koroks because they are wearing backpacks. And players are torturing them, crucifying them, tying them up and dragging them behind horses, cooking them on automatic (player-built) rotisseries, and attaching them to rockets.  It's grim stuff, but it shows the creativity possible inside the game. You could literally build a hut by a lake, go fishing, and start obsessively counting things, like in Henry David Thoreau's Walden. In some ways, it's like a basic version of Minecraft, set inside an existing game world. Although given that one person has recreated 'Breath of the Wild' in Minecraft, it seems that Minecraft will still have the edge.  Nintendo  ""My daughter is mostly about taming all kinds of horses. She also finds out glitches to lead her horse into deep water and stuff,"" said Zelda player and parent Dr. K in a forum thread participated in by Lifewire.  Even if you're not into building things for the sake of building them, this single new dynamic totally changes how you inhabit the world in Tears of the Kingdom. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some shelves to put up.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmV3aXJlLmNvbS95ZXMtemVsZGEtdGVhcnMtb2YtdGhlLWtpbmdkb20tcHJvYmFibHktaXMtdGhlLWJlc3QtZ2FtZS1ldmVyLTc0OTg2NTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Universal has released the first teaser for the Blumhouse horror film, giving viewers their first look at how the popular survival horror video game’s terrifying animatronics will be brought to life.  “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is based on the video game franchise created by Scott Cawthon, which released its first entry in 2014 and quickly rocketed to massive popularity. Throughout the different games, players are tasked with surviving the onslaught of hostile animatronic characters inside the haunted Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza restaurant, using security cameras, lights and doors to survey the area.  The new teaser reveals how those game mechanics have been incorporated into the adaptation, with film starring Josh Hutcherson as a hapless security guard.  Cawthon first announced the film adaptation in 2015 to much excitement from fans. But from there, it was a rocky road. Warner Bros. acquired the rights, but, after two years of silence, Cawthon announced that the project was “back to square one.” After losing a series of directors, Jason Blum announced he would be adapting the project through his Blumhouse production company in 2017.  Earlier this year, Universal announced that “Five Nights at Freddy’s” would debut on the streaming service Peacock on the same day of its theatrical release, replicating the day-and-date release strategy by other high-profile Blumhouse productions such as “Halloween Kills” and “Halloween Ends”  Directed by Emma Tammi, “Five Nights at Freddy’s” also stars Elizabeth Lail, Piper Rubio, Kat Conner Sterling, Mary Stuart Masterson and Matthew Lillard, as well as animatronic designs and technology by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop.

That’s how it goes from game to game and season to season.  Whether they like it or not, that’s also been especially true for the Petoskey baseball team this season.  Splits have been a common occurrence for the Northmen throughout the year and it’s been reflected honestly in their 2023 record.  When they welcomed in Alpena for a Big North Conference doubleheader Tuesday at Turcott Field, another split came their way.  The Northmen dropped a 2-1 opener, then leaned on the pitching of senior Max Ferrin to collect a 3-0 victory in game two.  The split moved Petoskey to 11-11 overall and 4-4 within the Big North, with one matchup vs. TC West left on the schedule.  While they've collected 11 losses on the season, the margin for error has been razor thin for Petoskey. They've dropped eight of those 11 games by a single run, including three of their last four and three of their four BNC defeats have come by a lone run.  In the opener Tuesday, both sides found opportunities on the base paths, though runs were tougher to come by.  Grant Slater went seven innings with seven hits and no walks allowed, while striking out six batters.  Both teams plated a run in the sixth, before Alpena then put one on unanswered in the seventh.  Slater also singled twice and Peyton Harmon also added a single for the Northmen. Tyler Goeldel also had an RBI.  In game two, Petoskey spread runs across the first, third and sixth innings and that was plenty for what Ferrin was dealing to the dish.  The senior went all seven innings with one hit and no walks allowed, while also striking out six.  Ferrin allowed a first inning double to the Wildcats, then didn’t allow an Alpena base runner over the next six innings, as the Wildcats went three up, three down the rest of the way.  It dropped Ferrin’s season ERA to 2.10, with 41 strikeouts across 33 and a third.  Petoskey’s run production came behind just four hits, with Ferrin, Harmon, Haden Janes and Kam Horn all singling on.  The Northmen hit a busy stretch ahead to try to pull away from the .500 mark, as they head to Rudyard on Wednesday, May 17, then down to Bay City Western on Saturday, May 20.

(Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)  Todd Bowles admits he only looks at three things on Bucs schedule by Josh Hill  While listing each NFL team’s one must-watch game this upcoming season, The Athletic missed the mark on its pick for the Buccaneers.  Now that the NFL schedule has finally been released, we can fill the upcoming dead period on the football calendar with rampant speculation about how games four months out will go.  That’s not a knock, either. Despite what Todd Bowles says, part of what makes the schedule so much fun to look at is the blank slate of promise and hope it represents. Who looked at the Cincinnati Bengals 2022 schedule and had them in the Super Bowl? Did anyone outside of Philly look at the Eagles schedule and predict an 8-0 start?  Hitting a bit closer to home, so many folks had the Bucs as a 12-win team this time last year, only to watch the team finish under .500 and limp into the playoffs.  Breaking down the schedule is fun because there’s no way to actually be right. Is there a more Extremely Online thing than that?  While it’s impossible to be right about predicting a team’s schedule this time of year, it is possible to be wrong — or at least misguided — about how it’s interpreted.  The Athletic lists one must-watch game for Buccaneers in 2023  A recent piece in The Athletic picked one must-watch game for each team in the NFL, selecting the Week 3 game against the Eagles for Tampa Bay. While the game is one of the Buccaneers two primetime matchups this year — assuming they don’t get flexed later in the season — it’s not the one must-watch game on the schedule.  Dan Pompeii argues the intrigue revolves around what it will tell us about kind of team Tampa Bay will be this season.  Pompeii writes:  The Bucs’ first prime-time game in 2023 will tell us everything we need to know. After opening up at Minnesota and hosting Chicago, they play the defending NFC champions on a Monday night. If the Bucs can give the Eagles a game, it will be an indication that the obituaries were premature.  He’s not entirely wrong, but the Buccaneers will not be making or breaking their season three weeks in.  There’s a chance the Bucs get their doors blown off by a vastly superior team, which would tell us in the moment that they’re not contenders. Writing off a team in September is foolish, even a team with seemingly as little to look forward to as Tampa Bay.  How many times have teams encountered early season turbulence only to later turn it around. Last year Tom Brady navigated a season full of turbulence before crashing out in the playoffs, and we’ve seen teams find ways to turn it around after slow starts.  It’s fair to question whether the Bucs have the right pieces to pull that off, but to suggest a what could be an 0-3 start means the season is over is simply wrong. If that’s the case, why even play the remaining 14 games on the schedule and skip right to picking No. 1 overall in April?  Week 3 will border on a must-watch if the Buccaneers come into the game with one or more wins, but it’s certainly not the hinge on which the season will swing.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGV3dGVycGxhbmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvYnVjY2FuZWVycy1zY2hlZHVsZS0yMDIzLW11c3Qtd2F0Y2gtZ2FtZS_SAVNodHRwczovL3RoZXBld3RlcnBsYW5rLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2J1Y2NhbmVlcnMtc2NoZWR1bGUtMjAyMy1tdXN0LXdhdGNoLWdhbWUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Each generation many of the most popular games are multiplayer games. The problem with multiplayer games is when people lose interest, the cost of maintaining servers outweighs the money coming in. When this happens, the servers are promptly shut down, and in cases where the game requires an online connection and/or is strictly multiplayer, it becomes unplayable. And because of this, it ends up being removed from sale. This is the fate of many multiplayer games, including 2012's free-to-play first-person mech shooter Hawken That said, Hawken is coming back tomorrow as Hawken Reborn.  The news comes the way of 505 Games, the developer and publisher of the original game and the developer and publisher of this comeback. The game is set to debut in early access form via Steam Early Access and PC on May 17. When it will fully release, there's no word. There is also no word of it coming to console. What there is word of is that like its predecessor it will be free-to-play.  ""Welcome to the world of Illal, a planet once thought to be humanity's future utopia, turned into a grim dystopia driven by corporate corruption and greed,"" reads an official blurb about the game. ""Illicit terraforming poisoned the atmosphere and a terrible accident gave birth to the 'Giga,' a nanite plague that ravaged half the planet. Become a mercenary pilot, pitting your mech against the dangers of Illal, gaining fame, fortune, and resources to reach the truth behind its bodyguard of lies.""  Right now there's no word of what type of Steam Deck compatibility there will be when the game releases tomorrow in early access. It will presumably be playable on the handheld machines but it remains to be seen whether work has gone into making sure it's verified in time for release.  As always, feel free to leave a comment or two letting us know what you think.

game,1932-08-09,Not Discerned,"{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 03:01:34,"Tuesday’s Game Report: Brewers 3, Cardinals 2  By Rob Rains  Jordan Montgomery had the bad luck to be pitching for the Cardinals the night after they scored 18 runs. That meant, of course, that they likely were going to struggle to score.  That indeed was what happened on Tuesday night as the Cardinals were held to just two runs, one coming on another Nolan Arenado home run, and saw their four-game winning streak come to an end with the loss to the Brewers at Busch Stadium.  The loss extended a longer streak for Montgomery as he fell to 0-6 in his last seven starts, all of which the Cardinals have lost. Montgomery has not won since his second start of the season, on April 8 at Milwaukee.  In five of those losses, including Tuesday night, Montgomery did not allow more than three runs. The Cardinals have scored a combined 10 runs while Montgomery was in the game in his last seven starts.  Here is how Tuesday night’s game broke down:  At the plate: Arenado homered for the fifth consecutive game, one off the longest streak of his career, which he did for the Rockies in 2015 … The Cardinnals other run scored in the fourth on a two-out double by Tommy Edman and a single by Brendan Donovan … The Cardinals left at least one runner on base in every inning except the first inning, including two in both the eighth and ninth innings. They left 12 runners on base for the game and were just 1-of-9 with runners in scoring position … Nolan Gorman’s streaks of an extra-base hit and an RBI both ended at five games.  On the mound: Montgomey gave up a run on a pair of doubles in the first inning, then allowed solo homers in the fifth and sixth. He struck out seven and was able to get out of a bases-loaded jam in the fifth. He had allowed only two home runs against 96 batters faced at Busch this season prior to Tuesday night … Jordan Hicks, Andre Pallante and Drew VerHagen combined to allow just one hit over the final 3 1/3 innings.  Key stat: Despite falling back to nine games under .500 at 17-26, the Cardinals have a plus-six run differential for the year. They are just 2-9 in games decided by one run.  Worth noting: The alignment of Donovan in left, Lars Nootbaar in center and Edman in right was the 16th different combination of outfielders to start for the Cardinals in their first 43 games. They have not used any alignment in more than six games … Gorman made his first start against a lefthander but that lasted only one at-bat before Wade Miley had to come out of the game because of a lat strain. Gorman hit into a fielder’s choice in that at-bat and did get another at-bat against a lefthander later in the game and struck out, leaving him 0-of-9 this season against lefthanders … Dylan Carlson (sprained ankle) is still considered day to day. He was able to take swings righthanded in the batting cage on Tuesday and manager Oli Marmol said “we’re going to give it another day and see where he’s at. There was definite progress today.” … Further research after Monday night’s game found that the last time the Cardinals had three players each drive in at least four runs in the same game was on Aug. 9, 1932.

Please wager responsibly.  The two combatants in the NBA Eastern Confernce final have arrived at this destination in entirely different manners. The Boston Celtics displayed their resiliency, rebounding from a 3-2 series deficit to take out the Philadelphia 76ers in a seven-game second-round series.  For the Miami Heat, they’ve maintained control throughout their first two series. The Heat have never trailed in beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games and taking out the New York Knicks in six games.  All of that serves to make Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final perhaps a little bit bigger than an opening game might seem during a seven-game set. The Heat have opened both playoff rounds with road victories. What happens to Miami if Boston were to whip the Heat in Game 1?  Oddsmakers are expecting exactly that to happen. It’s the Celtics who are set as eight-point home favorites in Game 1 of the NBA Eastern Conference final on Wednesday at TD Garden (TNT, 8:30 pm ET).  Heat vs. Celtics betting trends  Miami is 2-0 both straight up and against the spread in Game 1 of playoff series this spring, winning both on the road. The Heat covered as 10-point road underdogs in Game 1 of their opening-round series at Milwaukee, beating the Bucks outright 130-117.  Boston is 1-1 both SU and ATS when playing Game 1 of a playoff series this year. The Celtics opened the postseason by winning outright at home over Atlanta as 10-point home favorites over the Hawks in successive games. However, since that time, Boston has been favored by 8+ points three times. The Celtics are 0-3 both SU and ATS in all three of those games. They dropped Game 1 of the second round at home to Philadelphia by a 119-115 count as the 10.5-point home chalk.  FanDuel Sportsbook MA $150 BONUS BETS! CLAIM OFFER 21+ and present in MA.

Miami is 7-2 both SU and ATS over the past nine games. Boston is 11-5 SU in the last 16 games and 12-5 ATS over the last 17 games. Head-to-head this season, there’s little to choose between the two teams. Both clubs are 2-2 SU and ATS overall and 1-1 SU and ATS at home. Boston is 2-1 SU and ATS as a betting favorite over Miami. The Heat are 1-0 SU and ATS as the betting pick over the Celtics.  The total for Game 1 is set at 201.5 points. The total has gone over in eight of the last 11 games for both the Heat and the Celtics. Eight of the last 10 Miami vs. Boston games at TD Garden have also gone over. In four meetings this season, Miami and Boston are 2-2 on the total. Both games in Boston went over, while each game at Miami went under.  Miami stealing Boston’s thunder?  At the outset of the playoffs, with the Bruins setting NHL regular-season marks for wins and points and the Celtics challenging for top spot in the NBA standings, there was talk of Boston sweeping the NHL and NBA titles. Caesars Sportsbook even put forth a prop bet on a Boston title double. No city has ever won both championships in the same season.  However, the Bruins blew a 3-1 series lead and were bounced in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Florida Panthers, who also call South Beach home. Now, with the Panthers in NHL final four, it is Miami which is poised to do this unique double.  DraftKings Massachusetts $150 Bonus Bets! CLAIM OFFER 21+. Physically present in MA.

To do their part, the Heat will have to overcome both history and the odds. As a No. 8 seed, Miami is seeking to emulate the 1999 New York Knicks, the only eight seed ever to reach the NBA Finals. The Knicks were quashed in five games by the San Antonio Spurs.  Boston is set as overwhelming -525 favorites to win the Eastern Conference title. Miami is a +400 long shot to beat the Celtics, and the +1400 fourth betting choice to win the NBA Finals. Boston is the +105 chalk to lift the Larry O’Brien Trophy.  Heat can’t match Celtics depth  As impressive as Miami’s run has been, the worrisome part is that it’s been mostly done on the broad shoulders of Jimmy Butler. Last season, when the Heat pushed the Celtics to seven games, Butler scored 41 and 47 points in two of Miami’s three victories.  With Tyler Herro (hand) out, can anyone consistently provide a second scoring option for Miami against Boston’s stifling defense? That’s the issue the Heat are facing.  Meanwhile, Boston can count on double dipping in elite scoring talent with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Tatum poured in 51 points in Game 7 against the 76ers. Brown is averaging 24.6 points per game in the playoffs.  Pick: Boston Celtics -8 (-110).  Heat vs. Celtics same-game parlay  After surviving the stern test provided by Philadelphia, there’s a sense that Boston is more ready for the next test than Miami, which had it easy against the relatively defenseless Knicks. A blowout Celtics win in Game 1 doesn’t seem to be an unreasonable outcome, so we’ll set out assembling a same-game parlay by going with Boston -8 in the point spread at odds of -110.  Let’s couple that with a Tatum prop. No, he’s not going to score 51 again, but will he go over his points prop for Game 1 of 28.5? He’s only done so twice in his last six games, but is averaging 30.8 ppg against the Heat this season.

game,2023-05-01,Not Discerned,"{""Chicago"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 04:18:45,"What's the saying? April showers bring May flowers?  The flowers are blooming and the bats are ringing for Luis Robert Jr. in May.  And in the past four games, Robert Jr. has rounded the bases and walked to the dugout to be donned with the notorious White Sox gangster jacket and top hat. We all know what that means.  4 HRs in 4-straight games for Luis ð£    He won't stop mashing! pic.twitter.com/FwGC53SW4V — White Sox Talk (@NBCSWhiteSox) May 17, 2023  Before the May flowers grew colorfully and festooned a string of Robert's at-bats, there were April showers. A lot of them, too. In fact, in 99 at-bats in April, Robert Jr. recorded 20 hits for a .202 batting average. He struck out 28 times and walked just four times in 105 plate appearances.  He went through one of the worst hitting slumps of his career. Mixed in with that, he was benched during a game against the Tampa Bay Rays for jogging to first base on a groundball he could've beat. He wasn't in the lineup the subsequent game either.  But all of that changed in May. What's the secret to his recent success?  He's somewhat adapted to the new hitting coaching staff's method of incorporating technology, specifically the iPitch machine, into the practice routine. But Robert is instinctually hesitant to delve into the numbers too far.  ""There is too much information that I don’t like to look at,"" Robert Jr. told James Fegan of The Athletic. ""To me, the simpler the better. Once you are at home plate, you can’t be thinking of all that stuff. You have to be thinking of the pitcher, what pitch and the speed of the pitch that he has, nothing more than that.""  Whatever he's doing, it's working. In the 14 games the Sox have played so far in May, Robert Jr. is hitting .408 from the plate with 20 hits, seven home runs, 15 RBIs and 17 runs scored. He has just as many walks as he had in the previous 26 games and just 10 strikeouts in 46 at-bats.  Let's not forget. Robert is arguably the best defensive center fielder in the game right now. He holds defensive runs saved (DFRS) value of 7, well above the rest of the competition. At this rate, he could be in the mix for a Gold Glove in the outfield, which would be the second of his career.  But right now, the rest of the White Sox are riding off Robert Jr.'s energy, taking it in as they watch from the dugout. If Robert Jr. homers on Wednesday, he will tie A.J. Pierzynski's franchise record for the longest streak with a home run.  ""It's incredible,"" Gavin Sheets told the media after Tuesday's win over the Cleveland Guardians. ""I've been hitting behind him most the games and what he's been doing, he's been locked in. It's been a lot of fun to watch. It doesn't surprise me one bit with the talent he's got but whenever a guy like him gets hot it's a lot of fun to watch.""

Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert’s solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland’s Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Manager Terry Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBIs, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan’s double, which ended Lynn’s night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated another run.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, manager Pedro Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.

Yesterday, Amazon Games announced that it's taking another stab at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, a little more than two years after its previous effort with Chinese tech giant Tencent was canceled. Now, the same team behind Amazon's New World is developing a new Lord of the Rings MMO in partnership with Embracer Group, which owns the IP rights to the franchise. The project is in early development, so details are light, but we did learn a bit about what to expect from its story and setting in an interview with GamesIndustry.  Amazon Games vice president Christoph Hartmann said there's already plenty of internal debate about how to approach adapting the iconic story of The Lord of the Rings to a modern MMO format.  ""We have some die-hard Lord of the Rings fans, and already [they're saying], 'We can't do that' or Middle-earth [Enterprises] is not going to allow it, and we're not going to be able to alter the story, and introduce new characters, or rewrite the books,"" Hartmann said.  ""But for me, it's still very important that it's first a game, and then a reflection of the books second. So while I need to stay true, I always, and I'm reminding the team already, 'I get it, but it's not about every person going and pointing out if that detail is 100% perfect.' Let's say the way [Tolkien] describes the world, maybe the landscape looks a little bit different because either we can't get it going or the art people feel it might look a little bit different than what people assume it is in the book.""  Of course, The Lord of the Rings Online is going on its 17th year and still receiving substantial updates, including last year's Before the Shadow expansion. Hartmann said he has ""a lot of respect"" for the developers at Standing Stone Games but clarified that, chiefly due to technological advancements, Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO will be ""worlds apart.""

For the third time this season, the Drillers gave up at least seven runs in a 7-3 game one loss at Whataburger Field.  Tuesday marked the first game for the Drillers in Corpus Christi since the 2019 season and was the opener of a six-game set with the Hooks.

Tulsa starting pitcher River Ryan also had a great start to his night as he kept the Hooks hitless through the first three innings but ran into trouble in the fourth. Following two walks, Quincy Hamilton tied the game with his three-run homer. A single from Chad Stevens gave Corpus Christi two more runs and a 5-3 lead.  In the fifth inning, the Hooks plated two more on Kenedy Corona’s two-RBI double to take a 7-3 lead.

Expanding the digital distribution of NFL content while maintaining wide reach for our games continues to be a key priority for the League, and bringing the excitement of an NFL playoff game exclusively to Peacock’s streaming platform is the next step in that strategy.”  For the 2023 NFL season, Peacock will once again stream all NBC “Sunday Night Football” games, including the playoffs, and the “Football Night in America” studio show. The exclusive Peacock “Sunday Night Football Final” will return with expanded postgame coverage following “SNF” each week.  NBCU claims Peacock offers the most live sports of any direct-to-consumer streaming service in the U.S. That includes “Sunday Night Football,” Olympic Games, Premier League soccer, Notre Dame football, NASCAR, the NTT IndyCar Series and Big Ten football (beginning in September 2023). Peacock also offers daily sports programming on the NBC Sports channel.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy9kaWdpdGFsL25ld3MvcGVhY29jay1uZmwtd2lsZC1jYXJkLXBsYXlvZmYtc3RyZWFtaW5nLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZS1nYW1lLTEyMzU2MTQ1MDcv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIzL2RpZ2l0YWwvbmV3cy9wZWFjb2NrLW5mbC13aWxkLWNhcmQtcGxheW9mZi1zdHJlYW1pbmctZXhjbHVzaXZlLWdhbWUtMTIzNTYxNDUwNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Regular ol' Xbox Game Pass subscribers, those subscribed to the standard tier, do not have a new game to play as of today as the game has been made available via EA Play, which is only available with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. For an extra $5 a month, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get EA Play access, an Xbox Live Gold subscription, and a variety of special perks. As a result of this, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now play FIFA 23. How long, remains to be seen, but the ultra popular 2022 release is now in the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate library, which means subscribers can now also buy it outright for 20 percent cheaper as is customary with every Xbox Game Pass game.  At this point, if you don't know the deal about FIFA then you're not interested in it, which means you're not going to be interested in this additon. One of the longest-running series in gaming, and one of the best-selling, FIFA 23 debuted on September 30, 2022, but has only now been added to EA Play. That said, the installment, in particular, is notable because it marks the end of the 29-year partnership between EA and FIFA. Going forward, EA's soccer games will be called EA Sports FC rather than FIFA.

Will FIFA 23 ever be added to standard Xbox Game Pass? No, probably not. For the most part, EA games are limited to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate because of EA Play and previous FIFA releases that were added did not come to the standard version of the subscription service.

game,2023-02-20,Not Discerned,"{""Paris"", ""IleDeFrance"", ""France""}",Tue 16 May 2023 21:06:00,"Victor Wembanyama shows off his full skill set as he leads the Boulogne-Levallois Metropolitans 92 to a win. (2:00)  PARIS -- Hours before finding out his likely destination in the NBA, Victor Wembanyama drew a star-studded crowd in his last regular-season game in France and delivered another game-winning performance in the fourth quarter.  Soccer star Kylian Mbappé and popular French actor Omar Sy were both on hand to watch Wembanyama put up 22 points as his Boulogne-Levallois side won 93-85 in a local derby against Paris Basketball. The French phenom -- and much of the basketball world -- then turned their attention to the NBA draft lottery in Chicago later Tuesday, when he watched the San Antonio Spurs win the No. 1 pick.  Wembanyama, 19, showed a glimpse of why as he scored 14 of his game-high 22 points in the fourth quarter, with the crowd of about 4,000 chanting ""Wemby, Wemby"" as he turned it on late after a slow start.  ""He seemed elsewhere early on, probably at the lottery,"" Metropolitans 92 coach Vincent Collet said. ""But he responded so well. ... He's 19 and his life is going to totally change. Can you understand that? Tonight is a massive moment in his career. It's totally understandable that things were going on in his head.""  Wembanyama treated the crowd to a late one-handed dunk, then tapped his own head repeatedly in appreciation.  One fan responded by bowing with his hands held out when another two-handed dunk with just six seconds left made the teenager the game's top scorer.  Wemby clenched his fist and let out a yell at the final buzzer and then hugged his teammates as the crowd rose to gave the French league's leading scorer a standing ovation at the Palais des Sports Marcel Cerdan.  The 7-foot-5 Wembanyama then did a lap of honor high-fiving fans -- or low-fiving, really, given his height -- and signing autographs.  Wembanyama still has the French league's playoffs to focus on -- starting this weekend -- before he can fully turn his eye to the NBA. But the French crowds are taking every chance to see him while they can, knowing that a similar talent is unlikely to come along soon.  ""I believe he's going to be a Hall of Famer,"" said Paris Basketball coach Will Weaver, a former assistant with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers. ""I coached Kevin Durant, Jarrett Allen. I've been around a lot of good, big men that have a lot of unique skills. I just see his professionalism and competitiveness.""  Mbappé, France's World Cup star, is a huge basketball fan and arrived just in time -- about 30 seconds before the start of the game -- to watch another prolific scorer in action.  Though it wasn't a vintage performance from Wemby early.  He got into foul trouble and looked a little tense at times, perhaps because of the occasion. He pointed to his forearm and said ""Mais non!"" (""Not at all!"") when a refereeing decision was not given his way. He bowed his head, then shook it when missing a 3-pointer late in the first quarter.  During one break early in the second quarter, a camera crew on the opposite side rushed to interview Mbappé, who sat on the same row as Wembanyama's parents and close to Sy. Mbappé was still posing for photos seconds before the start of the third quarter and threatening to steal the spotlight.  But then, Wemby, showed again who the main attraction was, taking over the fourth quarter.  Collet, who also coaches France, said he will stay up late to watch the lottery with Wembanyama.  ""Tonight he will know his destination,"" he said. ""I think the team that has the first choice isn't going to get it wrong.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2VzcG4vc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2NDI1MS92aWN0b3Itd2VtYmFueWFtYS1zaGluZXMtZmluYWwtZ2FtZS1uYmEtZHJhZnQtbG90dGVyedIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2VzcG4vc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2NDI1MS92aWN0b3Itd2VtYmFueWFtYS1zaGluZXMtZmluYWwtZ2FtZS1uYmEtZHJhZnQtbG90dGVyeT9wbGF0Zm9ybT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

North discussed several schedule-related topics during a recent interview on ""The Adam Schefter Podcast,"" including this year's inaugural Black Friday game when the Jets will host the Miami Dolphins on Amazon.  North told reporters last week that the Cincinnati Bengals lobbied to host the Black Friday game as an annual fixture. During his interview with Schefter, he mentioned the Jets as another team interested in being an annual host of the holiday game, similar to the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys traditionally hosting nationally televised games on Thanksgiving.  ""I hope I'm not speaking out of turn when I mentioned to people that the Bengals volunteered,"" said North, the NFL's vice president of broadcast planning. ""There were others that kind of raised their hands for Black Friday as well.""  The league announced last week that this year's Black Friday game would be hosted by the Jets, who will be featured in five additional prime-time games in 2023 with Aaron Rodgers as their quarterback.  ""The Jets, once they found out they were the host team, then started to think about, 'Hey, is this something we could make a permanent fixture as part of the NFL schedule?'"" North said. ""Maybe they didn't raise their hands in February, but now that they have been selected as the Black Friday host, I think they might be interested in it, too.""  Amazon, which will distribute the game on Prime Video, reached out to the league about having one of the NFL's New York teams involved in the inaugural Black Friday game. Amazon suggested that its positioning as a giant retailer and having a game in the top retail market in the country could be a ""fun way"" to introduce the concept. North said last week that the NFL also looked at a potential matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants before settling on Dolphins-Jets.  North told Schefter that the NFL also considered Black Friday rivalry matchups featuring the Bengals hosting either the Pittsburgh Steelers or Baltimore Ravens. He emphasized that he doesn't have the final word on whether the league will implement a permanent host for the Black Friday game, saying that decision will fall on ownership and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.  ""I don't think we were looking for this season to commit to a permanent home for Black Friday,"" North said. ""Let's play one first and let's see what we learn and let's see what makes sense and let's see if it works for our fans, I don't think we were looking on day one to deploy this with a permanent home.  ""But it's certainly something we should talk about. Let's see what happens this year, let's see what the fan reaction is to that day, and I'm sure we'll go back to ownership, we'll go back to membership and we'll talk about would we be interested in it. Is that a good idea for the NFL? I'm sure there's pros and cons to both.""  The Jets acquired Rodgers in a blockbuster trade with the Green Bay Packers last month, two weeks before the NFL released its full 2023 schedule. North said the protracted Rodgers trade talks did not have much impact on the league's scheduling plan for the Jets, who he referred to as a ""good football team"" with ""exciting skill position players.""  ""I think you would still see a lot of Jets games on national television,"" North said. ""That was a good football team. ... Those games had to be used in national TV windows somewhere.""",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL25mbC9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzM3NjYwOTU0L2pldHMtc2V2ZXJhbC10ZWFtcy1pbnRlcmVzdGVkLWhvc3RpbmctYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LWdhbWUtYW5udWFsbHnSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9uZmwvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zNzY2MDk1NC9qZXRzLXNldmVyYWwtdGVhbXMtaW50ZXJlc3RlZC1ob3N0aW5nLWJsYWNrLWZyaWRheS1nYW1lLWFubnVhbGx5P3BsYXRmb3JtPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The shift to $70 games for the “next-gen” consoles has been slow but steady, and another major publisher could soon be making the jump. Sega said in its latest earnings report that it’s currently reviewing its games to see where price increases make sense, moving in the direction of 2K Games, Square Enix, and other big companies that have already adopted $70 as the new standard price point for blockbuster video games.  “In the global marketplace, AAA game titles for console have been sold at $59.99 for many years, but titles sold at $69.99 have appeared in the last year,” Sega said in a newly translated transcript of the company’s April 28 earnings call (via VGC). “We would like to review the prices of titles that we believe are commensurate with price increases, while also keeping an eye on market conditions.”  Read more  Sega’s most recent blockbuster, a remake of the Yakuza spin-off Like a Dragon: Ishin!, was cross-gen and priced at $60. So was last year’s ambitious Sonic Frontiers, which came to every platform including the Nintendo Switch. It now sounds like the next Yakuza and Sonic games could be the first to tick up to $70. Like a Dragon 8 (as the Yakuza series is known in Japan) is slated to arrive sometime in 2024.  Read More: Sonic Maker Sega Is The Video Game Industry’s Next Union Battleground  After over a decade of prices for high-end games stagnating at $60, Take-Two was the first to race to make NBA 2K21 $70 when it came to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Other companies like Activision, Sony, Square Enix, and Ubisoft followed suit. Redfall was Microsoft’s first $70 game, while The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was Nintendo’s, though the Mario maker says some of its games will remain at $60 for now.  Interestingly, the price changes have mostly only been on consoles. With the exception of Forspoken, PC versions of recent blockbusters like the Dead Space remake and The Callisto Protocol remained $10 cheaper than their counterparts on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. AAA game budgets are out of control, though, so it’s unlikely to stay that way for long.  Story continues      More from Kotaku  Sign up for Kotaku's Newsletter.

With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with  Beloit, WI - Entering Tuesday evening in Beloit, the South Bend Cubs continued their 12-game road trip held exclusively in the state of Wisconsin. With their series closing win in Appleton on Sunday, the Cubs were 2.5 game back of first place held by the Beloit Sky Carp along with both Peoria and Cedar Rapids. With a 9-4 victory in Game 1 on Tuesday, the Cubs are in striking range in the West Division and started their most important series of the first half in a big way.  South Bend sent starter Connor Noland to the mound on Tuesday night, and Noland continued his strong work in his first pro season. Pitching his third career game already against Beloit, Noland worked a 1-2-3 1st inning, and set the Cubs up for success at the plate.  Kevin Alcántara was hit by a pitch on the first offering of the game by Holt Jones, and then stole second base. He was left in scoring position, but the Cubs didn’t miss out on their opportunities from then on.  In the 2nd, still facing Jones, who came into Tuesday with an ERA over 11.00, he was also facing the Cubs for a third time this year. His first start in the home opener at Four Winds Field went well with 4.2 shutout innings. That same series, he pitched in the finale and surrendered seven runs in 3.2 innings.  Tuesday in Beloit looked like the latter, as Jones ran into trouble first in the 2nd. South Bend received a double by Bryce Ball, Ethan Hearn walked, Scott McKeon got hit by a pitch, and Christian Franklin singled. Alcántara brought home his first two RBI of the night on a solid single, and that was followed by another RBI-hit from Ezequiel Pagan.  Jones continued on the mound into the 3rd, and that’s when the big blow was dealt. James Triantos was the third man that Jones hit on the night to start the frame, Yohendrick Pinango walked, and Fabian Pertuz took Jones deep on a three-run homer to give the Cubs a 6-1 lead. It was the third round tripper of the season for Pertuz.  The inning continued with RBI hits from Hearn and McKeon. In a short matter of time, it was an 8-1 Cubs lead.  That was all the pitching staff would need as Noland finished off his start with four innings pitched, no walks, and five strikeouts. It ended up being the third straight start that Noland did not walk a batter.  Out of the bullpen, Jarod Wright earned the win with three strong innings and only one run allowed. Beloit mounted a comeback effort late against Adam Laskey, singling in four consecutive at-bats. But Laskey got a double-play ball and a strikeout to end the threat. He locked down the final three outs and South Bend picked up the win.  With the victory, and the Cedar Rapids Kernels beating the Peoria Chiefs, the Cubs and Kernels will enter Wednesday both just 1.5 games back of Beloit for 1st place. It will be an afternoon matinee on Wednesday at ABC Supply Stadium, as the two clubs play again at 12:05 PM ET.

CHICAGO -- — Luis Robert Jr. homered for the fourth straight game, Gavin Sheets and Jake Burger went deep off Shane Bieber in Chicago’s six-run fifth inning, and the White Sox beat the Cleveland Guardians 8-3 on Tuesday night.  Lance Lynn (2-5) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out seven and walked none.  Robert's solo shot to deep left in the eighth was his AL-leading 12th homer of the season. He became the first White Sox player to homer in four consecutive games since Matt Davidson in 2017.  In 14 games in May, Robert is hitting .408 (20 for 49) with seven homers and 15 RBI.  “He got a good pitch up in the zone and he's not missing those right now,” Chicago manager Pedro Grifol said. “And they're going a long way. He's shrinking this ballpark, he's shrinking any ballpark right now.”  Sheets’ three-run shot and Burger’s two-run drive were among six straight hits by the White Sox with two outs in the fifth as Chicago jumped ahead 6-0.  “You've got a matchup like Lance and Bieber going at it and both guys were throwing the ball really well,” Sheets said. “So to have that inning was huge for us.”  Bieber (3-2) was charged with six runs, five earned, on 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings.  “It was a weird, weird game,” Cleveland manager Tony Francona said. ""The first four innings he scattered hits, but kept them off the scoreboard, kind of typical Bieber style. Bobbed and weaved a little bit, but made pitches.  “Then we got two quick outs (in the fifth) ... and it was like the roof caved in.""  Yoán Moncada and Andrew Vaughn each had two hits and an RBI for the White Sox.  Cleveland's Steven Kwan drove in runs with a sacrifice fly and a double.  The Guardians played without All-Star third baseman José Ramírez, who was placed on the bereavement list before the game. Francona said Ramírez isn’t expected to rejoin the Guardians until they begin a three-game series at the New York Mets on Friday.  Ramírez, batting .285 with four homers and 22 RBI, traveled to the Dominican Republic following the death of his grandmother.  Lynn retired the first 11 Cleveland batters before Josh Naylor singled to right with two outs in the fourth. Naylor, who took Ramírez’s No. 3 spot in the batting order, exited in the sixth inning with left leg tightness.  Myles Straw led off the eighth against Lynn and reached on a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. He scored on Kwan's double, which ended Lynn's night. Kenyan Middleton relieved and allowed two infield singles that plated the second unearned run charged to Lynn.  GUARDIANS MOVES  Cleveland recalled INF Brayan Rocchio from Triple-A Columbus to take Ramírez’s roster spot. Rocchio made his major league debut when he pinch-hit for Naylor in the sixth and reached on an infield single. He stayed in the game to play third as Gabriel Arias shifted to first.  HENDRIX WATCH  White Sox closer Liam Hendriks, recovering from stage-4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is expected to make another rehab appearance for Triple-A Charlotte on Thursday, Grifol said. There’s still no timetable for the 34-year-old Australian right-hander’s return to the majors.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Indians: Francona said he'd know more on Wednesday about the extent of Naylor's injury, sustained when he dived after a ball. ... RHP Aaron Civale (oblique strain) is expected to throw 50 pitches in a rehab assignment for Triple-A Columbus on Thursday. ...

It is absolutely nothing new for the Mustangs, who won an incredible 30th consecutive postseason contest dating back to the 2014 season and now have a chance to win a state championship for an eighth consecutive time after a 17-7 win over fourth-seeded Cherry Creek in a game twice delayed by lightning at Englewood High School.  “Pressure is such a privilege and I’m so grateful to carry the CA name because it means so much in the lacrosse community,” said junior midfield Charlotte Corkins, who was one of eight different players to score goals as Colorado Academy improved to 18-0.  “The best thing CA has is that everybody buys into our culture and our team,” she added. “I think it’s just great that we have this tradition and that people have such pride to play for the team.”  That culture and tradition helped the beat go on despite the arrival of a new coach, as Sonorah Hunter took over for former coach Laura Sandblom prior to the season.  Hunter put her own stamp on how the program is run, but she credited the mentality and coachable nature of the returning players as how the Mustangs have again reached the cusp of another title.  “I think it is really easy to get caught up with where the team has been in the past, but since the beginning of the season, we really have focused on the details and how we play together as a group,” Hunter said. “We have a lot of amazing, talented individuals on this team and to be able to shape that and watch them buy into that and get so much better since the beginning of the season has been great to see.”  To get back to the state championship game, Colorado Academy had to go through a Cherry Creek team it beat by a 16-2 count back on April 6.  As expected with both teams having a full regular season and playoff games under their belts, it was a different result, at least for the first 20 minutes.  The Bruins (14-4) — who were seeking their first trip to a state championship game since 2019 — were undaunted in the early going, as they took a lead at 2-1 and after trailing for a bit, forged a 5-5 tie with 8:47 left in the opening half.  Colorado Academy got three key goals in the final 3 minutes, 52 seconds, of the half — including back-to-back scores by Corkins — to take a three-goal edge into halftime. It was particularly meaningful to contribute in a key moment for Corkins, who was on the sidelines watching last season with a torn ACL.  “This is a real, cool full circle moment for me; a year ago I was on crutches and I can remember standing over there on the sideline,” said Corkins, who finished with four goals in the first half. “It feels really good to come back and make an impact for my team.”  The game broke for the first lightning delay with 17:24 remaining in the second half and by that time, Colorado Academy had added goals by juniors Zoe Martin, Skylar May, Alex May and Estella Gellar to up the advantage to 12-5. Another goal on the other side of the break by senior Anna Colpack made it a streak of eight straight scores for the Mustangs before Cherry Creek stopped the run with a goal by senior Becca Zerr just before the second delay.  The remaining time elapsed quickly as the Mustangs reached the 10-goal barrier to invoke the running clock and then could prepare for yet another trip to the state championship game.  The distribution of offense in the semifinal showed how dangerous Colorado Academy can be, as Martin — who came into the game with a staggering 73 goals — had to score just twice, while several others shouldered the scoring load.  “We have so many great goal scorers, so anybody can have their best game on any given day,” said Corkins, one of five players with 29 or more goals coming into the game. “I think that’s what makes us so good, there are so many offensive threats.”  By knocking out Cherry Creek, Colorado Academy has a chance to creep even closer to the Bruins’ lead in the all-time state championship category since the sport debuted in Colorado in 2000.  Cherry Creek has won 10 state championships (the last came in 2013), while the Mustangs now have a chance to win their ninth.  Colorado Academy will be playing a team in the final that has never won a title before and Hunter expects to get their best effort.  “All of these girls are going through so much this week with finals and everything,” Hunter said. “We beat them during the regular season, so we know we can win, but we know they are going to be super hungry. They are definitely going to be coming for us.”  (6) Regis Jesuit 11, (2) Valor Christian 7  ENGLEWOOD - In sharp contrast to its next opponent, the Regis Jesuit girls lacrosse team doesn’t know what it is like to play for a state championship.The Raiders will know that feeling for the first time on Friday when they take the field at the University of Denver to go against Colorado Academy, which will be after its eighth consecutive Class 5A state championship. Regis Jesuit, meanwhile, will have a chance to win its first thanks to an 11-7 semifinal victory over Valor Christian late Tuesday night at Englewood High School.Coach Crysti Foote’s sixth-seeded Regis Jesuit team continued its trend of fast starts and avoided the second half struggles it had in a few games this year to finally get over the hurdles of the semifinals, which had stopped it in both 2019 and 2021. In the process, the Raiders avenged a loss by the identical 11-7 score early in the season to the second-seeded Eagles, who were in search of their third straight trip to the state championship game.“Our goal this season was to get to the state championship, but I didn’t know we hadn’t been there before,” said Foote, who is in her second season as head coach. “It was just something we were working towards. I’m super proud of this team.”Senior Ava Rogala and sophomore Maddy Jokerst scored four goals apiece for Regis Jesuit (12-4), which also got two scores from junior Phoebe Rogala and another from senior Carly Kennedy as it set up a championship contest against top-seeded Colorado Academy, a 17-7 winner over No. 4 Cherry Creek in the previous semifinal.In a game delayed by a couple of hours because of two lightning delays in the previous game, the Raiders came out strong and built a lead of four goals at 5-1.Valor Christian answered with three straight goals to get within one when senior Kaley Kakac converted a free shot opportunity.Regis Jesuit got the momentum back with Ava Rogala’s third goal of the opening half followed by Phoebe Rogala’s first tally, which came with just nine seconds left on the clock.“As a team with a history of not coming out the strongest in the second half, we left that first half with passion, with energy and with hope,” Phoebe Rogala said.The Raiders never really wavered in the second half, although consecutive goals by speedy Valor Christian junior Eliza Osburn tightened the game up in the opening five minutes of the half.Phoebe and Ava Rogala again had consecutive goals to restore a four-goal edge and from there, freshman goalie Rayn Parker made a few key saves and the Regis Jesuit defense played aggressive and physical as it limited the chances for Valor Christian in the remainder of the half.A point-blank stop by Parker on Kakac inside the final four minutes essentially sealed the victory.Regis Jesuit will get another chance to play Colorado Academy, which it lost to 12-8 in the regular season finale May 6.The Raiders believe the Mustangs are “beatable” and look forward to the challenge of playing a team that will be heavily favored.“CA is an amazing team, but we’ve played a lot of great teams this year to prepare for this moment,” Foote said. “I think we’re going to go watch video, prepare and be ready to go again.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vY2hzYWFub3cuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzE2LzVhLWdpcmxzLWxhY3Jvc3NlLWNvbG9yYWRvLWFjYWRlbXktYWR2YW5jZXMtdG8tc3RhdGUtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLWdhbWUuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Register here.  Xbox announced the second wave of games coming to Game Pass in May, and the new update includes two launch-day titles and several others. It’s a slightly more release-heavy period than the beginning of May, which only saw a few additions including the ill-received Redfall. For the second half of May, Xbox is giving players more and varied releases.  The first addition, available today, is FIFA 23. It launches on EA Play for PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate Members. Electronic Arts said in its recent earnings report that the sports title, which launched last September, the most successful in the franchise’s history. Also releasing this week are Eastern Exorcist, a side-scrolling action RPG about battling demons; and Ghostlore, an “eastpunk” action-RPG with retro-style graphics in which players fight monsters inspired by Southeast-Asian folklore. Ghostlore is already available for PC users, but launches on console alongside Eastern Exorcist on May 18.  The final full week of May sees Game Pass’s next two launch-day titles: Planet of Lana and Railway Empire 2. Planet of Lana, which launches on May 23, is a sci-fi puzzle-adventure game with handpainted graphics following the titular Lana as she explores a machine-filled forest world with her companion, Mui. Railway Empire 2, which launches on May 25, is a sim title about building a train company fortune. The other releases for that week include strategy game Massive Chalice and the console release of Cassette Beasts (both May 25).  The final addition for May is Chicory: A Colorful Tale, a top-down adventure game where players color a blank coloring book-style world with a magical paintbrush. It launches on May 30. Our biweekly sacrifice of games leaving Game Pass includes Europa Universalis, Evil Genius 2: World Domination, FIFA 21, Floppy Knights and Lawn Mowing Simulator, all of which leave Game Pass on May 31.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL2dhbWVzL3hib3gtZ2FtZS1wYXNzcy1zZWNvbmQtbWF5LXdhdmUtaW5jbHVkZXMtcGxhbmV0LW9mLWxhbmEv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly92ZW50dXJlYmVhdC5jb20vZ2FtZXMveGJveC1nYW1lLXBhc3NzLXNlY29uZC1tYXktd2F2ZS1pbmNsdWRlcy1wbGFuZXQtb2YtbGFuYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2006-01-01,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Tue 16 May 2023 14:00:08,"Games Workshop’s Warhammer 40K is the most popular miniature wargame in the world, and its gothic science fiction setting – much more unique than Warhammer Fantasy’s – is greatly responsible for that. Unsurprisingly, it’s also nurtured tons of video games over the decades.  40K models are typically gorgeous, and its tabletop qualities are enticing for anyone willing to learn the ropes, but its universe gradually became attractive on its own as well. In the distant future, a dogmatic human civilization is under siege from all sides, fighting off armies of hostile aliens and terrifying supernatural forces. It’s grand and gritty in equal measure, and despite the many franchises it’s influenced over the years, there’s nothing quite like it.  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Many Warhammer fans are familiar with 40K’s large body of novels, but it was video games that truly started to advance on soon-to-be Warhammer diehards. The medium’s unparalleled interactive possibilities have allowed the IP to flourish in both traditional and unexpected ways. With Warhammer 40K: Boltgun (opens in new tab)'s imminent release, we thought now would be a good time to look back at the best Warhammer 40K games from across the years.  If you’re looking for other specific gaming picks, you might want to check out our list of the best space exploration games or maybe the all-spooky best space horror games list. And, if you want to get into Warhammer 40K but don’t know how to cut down costs, we’ve got you covered with some recommendations on how to save money on Warhammer 40K too. For the Emperor!  10. Warhammer 40K: Darktide  (Image credit: Fatshark)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Fatshark  Warhammer 40K really lends itself to first-person shooters filled with bullets and blood, and we’re surprised Games Workshop hasn’t explored that genre more often, but we’re getting there. Darktide launched only a few months ago, and it’s already caused a strong impression despite an overall lack of polish that’s being fixed as we speak.  The key here is that Fatshark’s natural talent for punchy and brutal combat is all there, brought over from the two Warhammer: Vermintide games they made before. Darktide follows the watertight four-player co-op FPS formula that was popularized by Valve’s Left 4 Dead back in the day, so you know what you’re getting into. Just make sure your PC is up to par or wait for the (delayed) current-gen Xbox release.  9. Space Hulk: Tactics  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One  PC, PS4, Xbox One Developer: Cyanide Studio  2018 brought us a pretty solid adaptation of the tabletop miniatures board game Space Hulk. This is a two-player versus game that distills Warhammer 40K into a cheaper, quicker, and tighter experience set in derelict spaceships and other pieces of space junk floating adrift and run over by Tyranids.  The game features two single-player campaigns, competitive multiplayer, and a skirmish mode. Moreover, it packs an impressive map builder that allows players to cook up and share their own maps. Just be aware that this one is very punishing.  8. Warhammer 40K: Battlesector  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S  PC, PS4, Xbox One/Series X/S Developer: Black Lab Games  Battlesector is another recent 40K game release that flew under the radar. However, both veteran gamers and fans have praised its take on turn-based tactics on a larger scale than usual, which results in a slower-paced and more meditative approach too.  The mission design can often be monotonous, but the moment-to-moment gameplay and the systems gluing everything together work well enough to achieve one of the best digital representations of the miniature wargame around. We’d love to see a bigger and better sequel of this one.  7. Warhammer 40K: Gladius – Relics of War  (Image credit: Slitherine Ltd.)  Platforms: PC, Linux  PC, Linux Developer: Proxy Studios  Gladius – Relics of War mixes Warhammer 40K and 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) systems. On paper this sounds like a match made in heaven and it largely succeeds at doing Sid Meier’s Civilization but 40K. If that sounds attractive, give it a fair shake.  While its older 4X brothers are far more addicting, Gladius’ more fast-paced nature and strong commitment to the 40K universe (diplomacy ain’t an option) make it an oddly relaxing – and unsurprisingly darker – take on a well-trodden formula.  6. Battlefleet Gothic: Armada 2  (Image credit: Focus Entertainment)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Tindalos Interactive  If you like spaceships (which is likely if you’re an avid reader of our site) and real-time tactics in your games, then Battlefield Gothic: Armada 2 is a safe bet. It adapts the 40K miniature wargame of the same name, and it does so with style.  This one features three narrative campaigns and 12 playable factions, with the option of doing co-op multiplayer as well. Even if you’re not well-versed in the Warhammer 40K universe, anyone into space strategy games should check this one out.  5. Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus  (Image credit: Kasedo Games)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch  PC, macOS, Linux, Android, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch Developer: Bulwark Studios  Mechanicus is yet another turn-based video game that follows a very specific faction of the human Imperium. This time around it’s all about the Adeptus Mechanicus, a group of cybernetically enhanced warrior priests. That sounds rad, and we promise that the game is rad too.  It’s also one of the few turn-based 40K titles that stick more closely to the obvious XCOM inspiration, so it might be an easier recommendation for players who are looking for that specific take on tactical battles. On top of the solid gameplay, the flexible customization and notable worldbuilding are highlights.  4. Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters  (Image credit: Frontier Foundry)  Platforms: PC  PC Developer: Complex Games  Warhammer 40K: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters was released in 2022, but it’s already become a favorite among fans thanks to its strong focus on the Grey Knights, a chapter of Space Marines composed of psychics whose purpose is the combat and eradication of the daemonic forces of Chaos.  Daemonhunters is a single-player, turn-based strategy game that does way more than just replicating XCOM with Space Marines; it’s largely unforgiving and deceptively deep. The audiovisual presentation is also top notch, making the (at times) seemingly impossible battles a blast to watch play out.  3. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War II  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, macOS, Linux  PC, macOS, Linux Developers: Relic Entertainment  Dawn of War diehards never fully embraced Dawn of War II, but it’s still one of the franchise’s finest gaming efforts and deserves its own spot in the list. It can’t be denied that it cemented itself as a sequel that can stand on its own thanks to a heavier focus on RPG elements.  Dawn of War II received two major expansion packs plus a fair amount of DLC that rounded out the experience, eventually nullifying complaints about the removal of the base-building element and the repetition found in some missions of the campaign. If you’ve exhausted the first Dawn of War’s options, give its first sequel a chance. We don’t talk about the third one though.  2. Warhammer 40K: Space Marine  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC, PS3, Xbox 360  PC, PS3, Xbox 360 Developer: Relic Entertainment  With Space Marine 2 (opens in new tab) slated to release later this year, there’s never been a better time to play (or replay) the 2011 original, especially after the free anniversary upgrade (opens in new tab) it got on PC in 2021.  Even before the announcement of a sequel, Space Marine has always had many fans. This was with good reason as it perfectly represents the brutality of the Space Marines up close and personal through a third-person view and visceral melee and ranged combat. Some of the Imperium’s biggest enemies are featured heavily in this one, and the plot is easy to follow, so it’s a nice entry point for newcomers too.  1. Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War  (Image credit: SEGA)  Platforms: PC  PC Developers: Relic Entertainment  40K fans and real-time strategy veterans alike agree that the original Dawn of War is one of the best PC games ever, period. Relic Entertainment once cracked the code and delivered an all-timer which is both accessible and unique. It perfectly adapts many of the miniature game and its universe’s nuances into a modern classic that nailed both the base-building aspect and the relentless combat across desolate scenarios.  Furthermore, Dawn of War packed spectacular story campaigns, a solid roster of units for all factions, and the option to customize the armies’ colors plus basic aesthetics. And, since it was a massive commercial hit, it received three chunky expansion packs which we 100% recommend. More specifically, the second expansions, Dark Crusade, which still to this day feels like a high point for the RTS genre.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9iZXN0LXdhcmhhbW1lci00MGstZ2FtZXMtb2YtYWxsLXRpbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The Dynamo played with 10 men for 57 minutes against the Sounders following a video review of a challenge by forward Amine Bassi. The Dynamo played the final 12 minutes with nine players after midfielder Héctor Herrera received his second yellow card of the match. Seattle scored the game-winning goal in the 87th minute, and Houston closed a three-game home stand with a 1-1-1 record in league and Open Cup play.  Both Bassi and Herrera will miss Wednesday’s game due to a one-game suspension following Saturday’s game. This is the second red card suspension for Herrera, who missed Houston’s last road trip, a 1-1 draw with the New York Red Bulls on April 15. This is the first suspension for Bassi and the first game he will miss since the season opener on Feb. 25. The 25-year-old missed the match against Cincinnati due to injury.  Houston looks to snap a five-game losing streak against the Loons. Minnesota won both matches in 2022 and swept the series in 2021.

game,2023-09-26,19:05:00,"{""Baltimore"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 22:05:00,"The Orioles continue to have a pretty darn good record. This is not enough to stop people from getting grumpy after losses like last night’s. I get it. The Grayson Rodriguez outing was a real downer, and added to that, it feels like quite a waste to have scored five runs off of Shohei Ohtani and still lost the game by a grand slam. I hope they can halt the losing before dropping a third straight game.  As is true of every game, the starting pitcher will have a lot to do with the chances of the Orioles winning. That’s Dean Kremer tonight. His last two games have been pretty good, with just one run allowed combined across 12 innings pitched against the Braves and Rays. Those are two great offenses so far this season. Kremer has had some rocky outings this year but we can hope, not unreasonably, that the last couple are a sign he’s heading in a more positive direction.  For another game in a row, the Orioles have made a move to summon fresh bullpen reinforcements. After Rodriguez didn’t go deep into the game last night and a number of relievers needed to be used, they wanted some long relief insurance. That’s turned out to be Cole Irvin, erstwhile starting rotation member, who’s done better with his control after a demotion to Norfolk. I hope he’s not needed, like they didn’t end up needing Drew Rom over the weekend, but it’s good they brought him in case.  Orioles lineup  Cedric Mullins - CF Adley Rutschman - C Anthony Santander - 1B Austin Hays - LF Gunnar Henderson - 3B Adam Frazier - 2B Terrin Vavra - RF Jorge Mateo - SS Ryan O’Hearn - DH  A lot of days I’ve looked at the Orioles lineup this season, I’ve thought to myself, “Is this really the best they can do?” They’ve won a number of those games, so it’s been working out. Still, here’s that reaction again. Vavra in right field, really? If this is going to happen - and this is now the second straight game it has - it is a lot tougher to defend, say, Colton Cowser remaining in Norfolk with his 1.044 OPS.  Also, O’Hearn had a nice spring training but that’s not carrying over into the regular season in the slightest, so, you know. It would be nice to do something different there. Ryan Mountcastle getting a game off is part of why the lineup looks like this, of course.  Angels lineup  Mickey Moniak - RF Mike Trout - CF Shohei Ohtani - DH Taylor Ward - LF Matt Thaiss - C Brandon Drury - 1B Gio Urshela - 3B Luis Rengifo - 2B Zach Neto - SS  The Angels starting pitcher is Chase Silseth, who has pitched in four games this year but yet to make a start. Though Trout and Ohtani are fearsome presences in this lineup, it feels like the Orioles lineup ought to be better than these guys. They weren’t last night, so, you know, hopefully they can change that today.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWRlbmNoYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvNS8xNi8yMzcyNTg4NC9vcmlvbGVzLWFuZ2Vscy1nYW1lLXRocmVhZNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbWRlbmNoYXQuY29tL3BsYXRmb3JtL2FtcC8yMDIzLzUvMTYvMjM3MjU4ODQvb3Jpb2xlcy1hbmdlbHMtZ2FtZS10aHJlYWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

ECU History  TAMPA (May 16, 2023) – The Stetson Hatters (31-21) scored nine unanswered runs on Tuesday night before the University of South Florida (19-34) got on the scoreboard and outlasted the Bulls for an 11-5 road victory at USF Baseball Stadium. The start of the game was delayed 44 minutes due to lightning in the area.  Jackson Mayo (St. Johns) went 3-for-4 with a home run in the loss for South Florida.  Stetson broke the scoring seal and took a 1-0 lead with a solo homer in the top of the third inning. The Hatters added two to their lead with a handful of seeing-eye singles in the top of the fourth for a 3-0 advantage.  The Hatters plated four more runs in the top of the fifth inning to pad their lead to 7-0 and made it a 9-0 affair with two more in the sixth frame.  After being limited to just two hits through the first five innings, USF finally put together a rally to scratch the plate in the bottom of the sixth. Drew Brutcher (Lakeland) walked with one out, and two batters later with two outs, Rafael Betancourt (Deltona) extended the inning with a base hit. John Montes (Toa Alto, Puerto Rico) then drove in Brutcher with an RBI-single.  Travis Sankovich (Uniontown, Pa.) added a run-scoring double by the Bulls in the bottom of the seventh inning.  The Hatters hit back-to-back solo homers in the top of the ninth inning before the Bulls tacked on three runs in the bottom half of the frame.  Mayo tagged a solo home run, Bobby Boser (Wesley Chapel) drilled an RBI-triple to the gap in right-center field, just missing his 16th homer of the year, and Brutcher added a sac fly to chase home Boser and account for the final score.  Notable  Boser extended his hitting streak (11) and on-base streak (15) on Tuesday night.  Ethan Brown (Winter Garden), who has made only one appearance since suffering a shoulder injury on April 14th, face three batters in the sixth inning and recorded one strikeout.  (Winter Garden), who has made only one appearance since suffering a shoulder injury on April 14th, face three batters in the sixth inning and recorded one strikeout. Austin Grause (Tampa) produced USF's only 1-2-3 inning of work on the mound in the seventh frame.  Up Next  The Bulls wrap up the regular season with a three-game series against No. 15 ECU on May 18-20 at USF Baseball Stadium in Tampa.  About USF Baseball  The USF Baseball program played its first season in 1966 and is entering its 58th season in 2023 under head coach Billy Mohl (sixth season). The Bulls have made 14 NCAA Tournament appearances, including four since 2015, and earned their first-ever Super Regional berth in 2021. USF was ranked in the Top 25 by five different publications in the final 2021 polls, checking in as high as No. 16. The Bulls have won five conference tournament titles (3 Sun Belt, 1 Metro and 1 American) and six regular season championships (3 Sun Belt, 2 Metro and 1 C-USA). USF baseball players have been recognized with All-America honors 12 times, most recently with third baseman David Villar in 2018, and 18 have earned Freshman All-America accolades, most recently Drew Brutcher and Carmine Lane in 2021. Four Bulls were selected in the 2022 MLB Draft.

game,2019-02-26,15:00:00,"{""Auburn"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 19:00:00,"Credit: Adrianna Nine  Steam users who have recently navigated to the Dead Space page might have noticed something new. The game distributor appears to be mulling the idea of a free 90-minute trial, beginning with this popular new remake.  Just below the thumbnail carousel and the “Add to Wishlist” button sits a narrow box titled “Try Dead Space - Free Trial.” From there, it’s clear this is an experimental feature for Steam: The box says you can “Play this title for up to 1 hours” but also that you have “1 hour 30 minutes remaining.” Clicking the “Play Now” button kicks off a full-game download, but once your 90 minutes are up, you must either purchase the game or get out.  Many Steam games offer demos—the Steam Store has an entire section for them. But demos typically contain in-game restrictions rather than time restrictions. You might only get to complete a couple of objectives or explore a small section of the game’s world before being invited to purchase the game. Although this is still a brilliant way to ensure you want a title before committing (an invaluable opportunity, given game prices nowadays), it doesn’t always offer a full picture of what a playthrough experience will look like.  Credit: Adrianna Nine  Steam has toyed with several free trial formulas, offering entire weekends where users could play games like Crusader Kings III for free. Models like this only work for games you’d conceivably play over and over, though; story-driven games like Dead Space aren’t a great fit, as players could complete a full playthrough within that free weekend. From Steam’s perspective, 90 minutes is enough to offer curious users an enticing taste without giving away the whole story.  As of writing, it appears that Dead Space is the only game offering a timed free trial; other major titles lack the box entirely. It could be that Steam is testing the feature before conducting a wider rollout, or Dead Space publisher Electronic Arts just wants people to get into this title. (EA also announced that Dead Space would be 20% off through May 29.)",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJlbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9nYW1pbmcvc3RlYW0tdG95aW5nLXdpdGgtZnJlZS05MC1taW51dGUtZ2FtZS10cmlhbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

The game - currently a PlayStation console exclusive - has now received a new Xbox rating by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB).  Watch on YouTube Eurogamer's spoiler-free Stray video review.  As spotted by Twitter user @MACOS380, Stray has been rated as E for Everyone 10+, with the ESRB noting the game features animated blood and fantasy violence. ""Players sometimes encounter parasitic blobs/mice-like bots that can attack and kill the cat. Players can access a UV light to defeat the mice-like bots, causing them to explode and emit splashes of coloured liquid,"" the rating summary explains.  Other than that, this new Stray rating tells us little else, and no release date or window was included. Perhaps Playstation had a year's console exclusivity? The game initially released on 19th July 2022, so July this year seems a likely paw-sibility for its Xbox debut.  Stray's ESRB Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S rating. Image via MACOS380.  Eurogamer's Stray review was full of praise, with our Lottie complimenting the game's ""fantastic cat exploration"".  ""Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world,"" she wrote.  ""The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat's eternal desire to knock items off shelves.""  We will update you when we know more about Stray's Xbox release.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9nYW1lci5uZXQvbG9va3MtbGlrZS1jYXQtZ2FtZS1zdHJheS1pcy1maW5hbGx5LWNvbWluZy10by14Ym940gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-12-13,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Tue 16 May 2023 12:05:15,"We Played and Ranked EVERY SINGLE N64 Game  The reign of the Nintendo 64 is emblematic of the mid to late ‘90s, an era remembered for what it produced while it was preoccupied with looking ahead. Most video games of the time were unapologetic about pushing 3D graphics forward, even if it wasn’t a fully realized concept yet. Meanwhile, as a society, we were worried sick about what Y2K might do to our computers while so obsessed with the upcoming millennium that roughly half of all media produced in 1999 had a ‘2000’ at the end of the title. They even gave the guy that made The X-Files some other show based entirely on how fucked up it was that the millennium was approaching. With the notable exception of one child screaming about the Nintendo 64 he’d received as a Christmas gift, we were too focused on the future to enjoy the present.  The irony here is that many of the things society was obsessing over later became a blip on the radar. Y2K was a bust, and as of this writing, none of the three dozen prominent streaming services currently feature Chris Carter’s Millenium (67 episodes across three seasons). Yet we all know GoldenEye, Mario 64, and Knife Edge: Nose Gunner!  Okay, maybe not Knife Edge: Nose Gunner.  The Nintendo 64 is many things to many people, probably more so than other consoles. To some, it was the gateway to a new, fully realized world of possibilities, in-depth adventures, and precision controls. To others, it’s overrated nostalgia, home to lifeless worlds the player often struggled to navigate thanks to that wonky controller and frequent camera issues. As always, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. With 296 games released in North America, its library is somewhat scarce compared to other similarly beloved consoles. Yet despite this, a half dozen titles routinely mentioned among the finest in gaming are found in its catalog. Rightfully, these and a handful of others have been discussed throughout the years as variations of “The Best 25 Nintendo 64 Games of All Time” lists permeate the internet.  We here at Hard Drive have never seen a party we didn’t want to invite ourselves to, but we also wanted to shine a light on the games that haven’t been endlessly ranked and re-ranked over the subsequent 25 years. We wanted to pay homage to both the stone-cold classics of the era (meaning the wrestling games with Steve Austin on the cover) and the outliers, the dubious games given as well-intentioned gifts by aunts and stepparents. These ghastly licensed titles and inexplicable originals often shaped our collective gaming experiences as much as anything else. And even if we say some pretty mean things, we just really love video games, man. It beats talking about anything else.  So here you go; all 296 North American Nintendo 64 games ranked and reviewed, as well as way too many references to our fathers, video stores, and 9/11. We hope you enjoy reading it — it’s the biggest thing we’ve ever done (not that it will impress our dads).  — Mark Roebuck  List by: Chris Colman, Patrick Crooks, John Danek, Chandler Dean, Kyle Duggan, Seth Finkelstein, Luca Fisher, Ryan Fleishman, Jeremy Kaplowitz, Michael Katz, James Knapp, Naomi Krause, Walker MacDonald, Ashley Oh, Kevin Podas, Gabe Porter, William Quant, Mark Roebuck, Matt Saincome, Joe Tilleli, Brad Waters, Thomas Wilde, and a guy who is stuck in a hole.  Art by Matt Harding  # 296. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker    December 13, 2000  Kemco  Ubisoft  $65.99 on Amazon  A devastatingly bad brawler that’s as devoid of redeeming qualities as Bruce Wayne is parents. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker suffers from lightning quick animations that make it seem like Terry Batman is moving faster than the camera can keep up with, which is frustrating but also kind of hilarious. Batman’s move set mostly consists of kicking and punching, and several strikes can be strung together to form “combos” in the way that eating a bowl of barbecue sauce at 6:30 PM could loosely be considered “eating supper.” The game consists of five levels, and the score consists of five notes. The cinematics in between levels literally go by too fast to keep up with, which is probably a good thing, as I’m assuming this game’s story is as insulting as every other aspect of it. One of my favorite examples is that level two, Wayne Enterprises Building, is the exact same as level one, The Gotham Air & Space Museum, except the hallways have potted plants in them now. On the bright side, it’s all over in about an hour. It’s fucked up that this is the only Batman game they made for the Nintendo 64, because it really sucks. — Mark Roebuck  #295. Carmageddon 64  July 26, 2000  Stainless Games/Software Creations  Titus Interactive  $124.99 on Amazon  Somewhere, someone is going through an actual car crash, doomed to have to go through physical therapy for the next two years as a result of their injuries to have some semblance of their full range of motion back, on top of an unholy amount of medical debt. And that person would still be having more fun than me playing this abomination of a racing game. I was hoping that this game’s infamy was some kind of hyperbole; that perhaps people were harsher on it in its time and that modern days may have actually vindicated it like some of these other old games we played. But no. This one is just as dreadful as everyone says it is.  Besides creeping to the framerate of a slideshow on basically every turn, nothing works the way it’s supposed to and it all just feels like ass. The worst part is there’s no point to any of it! The game presents itself as some kind of apocalyptic race where you must ‘race or die’ as the opening narration spells out, but your only objective is to complete the race. No other racer is competing against you and yet you’re prompted to kill all other drivers you see. Also, there’s zombies everywhere as some sort of alternate win condition that is impossible to complete. And if I don’t want to destroy or maim anything in your apocalyptic demolition derby race, then what’s the point of it all? — William Quant  #294. Superman: The New Superman Adventures  May 31, 1999  Titus Interactive  $25.49 on Amazon  Look, you don’t need me to tell you this game sucks. We all know it sucks. It’s not even the developer’s fault that it sucks (the licensing team at WB hated the devs and tried to make them turn this into a SimCity clone). The controls suck. The gameplay sucks. The graphics suck. You don’t really do Superman things, you just do minigames all day with extremely strict time limits. Did you know you get to fight Darkseid in this game? He’s in a hallway. They’re all in hallways in this game! You know what? That’s enough. I’m going to spend the rest of this review begging someone, anyone, to make a Superman game. I don’t want to hear anything about how he’s too powerful and no one can hurt him. Figure it out! Have him fight Titano, the giant robot ape. Hey, and while we’re at it, let’s make another Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. You can make car boxing gloves in that. Man, what a fun game that was. — Seth Finkelstein  #293: B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S.    May 19, 1998  Midway  B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. is a travesty. This fighting game is set in Neo Amerika, where escalating tech overlords have caused the nation to break down in the Techno-Industrial Civil War (great naming convention, really nailed it). Every character is a variant of unholy cyborg abomination named something like KillFucker because of how much they like Killing and Fucking. Honestly, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. would be a The Room­, ­so-bad-it’s-good type game if the name of the flagship character on the cover wasn’t a racial slur used as a play on words (he has an actual zipper on his head, so funny). This checks out since the game as a whole feels targeted towards your dipshit cousin that still says the f-slur.  In terms of actual gameplay, B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. characters control like a Walmart mobility scooter. The game is comically unbalanced, mainly due to a shield mechanic that makes characters invulnerable by removing all the textures on their already-ugly polygons. The game also blatantly cheats by reading your inputs so the computer enemies can easily beat all your attacks, which is why you can find multiple videos of content creators hopelessly trying to beat the BS final boss of Arcade Mode. The next time you want to complain about modern fighting games, pop in B.I.O.F.R.E.A.K.S. and thank god you’re getting another Street Fighter sequel instead of this roadkill. — Ryan Fleishman  #292. Monster Truck Madness 64  August 31, 1996  Terminal Reality  Microsoft  $37.99 on Amazon  Monster Truck Madness 64, Rockstar’s third release, long before they created Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, opens with a caffeine-addled announcer screaming “ARE YOU READY?!” followed by a dick-crushing industrial metal track, so it’s clearly among the best games ever conceived. But alas, no amount of personality and testosterone can compensate for messy gameplay.  MTM 64 is both slippery and heavy, like trying to deadlift a sea lion. Or, in this case, like trying to push a monster truck with tires made of butter across a track made of soap. One must imagine their opponents laughing as their truck keels over into the mud on its side, a metaphor for life’s inevitable cruelty.  There is also a distinct lack of car-crushing — a crushing disappointment in its own right. Battering fences and tombstones is fun, but it doesn’t compare to the raw, primal thrill of man-hicular vehicle-slaughter that monster trucks bring to mind. And unlike the game’s trucks and corny announcer, the environments are almost entirely devoid of personality and largely identical to one another. Even the stage called DEATH TRAP was pretty nonlethal. I was expecting both DEATH and a host of booby TRAPs, or perhaps wild bears for flavor, but found neither.  Like Sisyphus making sweet love to the boulder that binds him in eternal punishment, I mindlessly chased an ever-returning ball (or puck) in the identical Soccer and Hockey minigames. Through all of it, the emcee’s commentary helped me to stay strong — he was there for me in each of these miserable game modes, even as I slipped all over the place and ate the dirt. My fondest memory of this game will be the exact moment I hurtled into an enemy vehicle in Summit Rumble, prompting the emcee, my only friend in this wasteland, to shout “Hell hath no fury like a monster truck scorned!” — Luca Fisher  #291. Rugrats in Paris: The Movie    November 8, 2000  Avalanche Software  THQ  $21.24 on Amazon  Rugrats in Paris is a beautiful kids movie that made me confront the grief of what it’s like to have lost a parent and learn how to welcome new familial love into your life. The video game adaptation of the film explores different thesis surrounding how I wish everyone around me was dead. It opens with selecting your favorite baby and then lets you explore its theme park overworld in a manner not unlike pushing a stroller without wheels. They seriously gave these babies tank controls. They cannot turn. The babies can only move forward, leaning slightly toward one direction or the other, and require stopping to turn and walk backwards at a crawl. If the dev’s goal was for me to re-experience learning to walk for the first time, well then I guess they succeeded.  The gameplay is structured as a series of carnival minigames so you can win enough tickets to buy the helmet that controls Reptar—then fight his arch-nemesis, RoboSnail. I never got to RoboSnail. These minigames range from a clunky ‘hit the targets with a baseball’ game where the hitboxes are incomprehensible to an almost-serviceable minigolf course that would maybe work if you didn’t have to run your baby from your previous stroke to the next with the same overworld tank controls that make me feel glad the vibrant orange and greens of Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, have been painted over beige and its presence erased from the earth. — Joe Tilleli  #290. Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.    December 9, 1999  Acclaim Studios London  Acclaim  $26.99 on Amazon  When I began Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M., I was greeted with a cheesy B-movie style plot of alien invaders. I thought it would be good for a few laughs. Unfortunately, the game ended up laughing at me. I couldn’t move for the first few minutes of gameplay, only to learn that you move with the C-buttons, which is just as confusing and difficult as you’d imagine. Also, you cannot see anything in this game. You just keep barreling headfirst into darkness, hoping that the horrible bug enemies that you are unable to aim at for more than a second aren’t about to kill you. The worst part, however, is when you finish a level, only to be told you didn’t do one of the obtuse missions, leading to an instant game over and you needing to redo everything. And I still am completely lost as to what the fuck an Armorine is. — Gabe Porter  #289. NBA In The Zone ‘98    February 16, 1998  Konami  $22.49 on Amazon  This is one of those games where the graphics aren’t so much ‘weird but forgivable demonstration of growing pains in three dimensional graphics’ as they are ‘vaguely humanoid creatures made up of uneven shoulders and blurry textures who’s every movement and action invoke unease and terror.’ Nothing about this game looks, sounds, or feels good. Factor that in with weird features like the ability to trade players in the pre-game setup menu (I think these guys are dressed for the game already, fellas) and omissions like the ability to call plays, you have the worst basketball game on the Nintendo 64. Anyone that’s played Fox Sports College Hoops ‘99 knows I’m talking mad shit right now. — M. Roebuck  #288: South Park Rally    January 5, 2000  Tantalus Interactive  Acclaim Entertainment  $99.99 on Amazon  I wanted to go to bat for this game. I consistently saw it toward the top of every ‘Worst N64 Games’ list—and that puzzled me. I thought, “Shouldn’t even a middling kart racer be worth playing if it means I get to enjoy some irreverent South Park vibes in the process? Shouldn’t the fun of PLAYABLE CHEF alone be enough to get this thing to a 6/10!?”  And sure enough, when I started navigating the menu—with fart noises accompanying my every click—I had reason to hope. Between a full 3D rendition of the iconic theme song (complete with obligatory Kenny death) and a surprisingly wide array of playable characters, I dared to ask myself: for Acclaim Entertainment’s South Park games, could the third time have been the charm?  Then I started playing it. And I came to realize that in other racing games, we often fail to appreciate how wonderful it is to know where you are supposed to be going and how you are supposed to get there. Instead of simply circling around a set path, South Park Rally is one of very few racing games to embrace FromSoftware-style open world hostility; you’re free to go wherever you want, but you’re fucked if you don’t take one highly specific route. Other things we’ve taken for granted? Controls that work, sound that’s audible, AI that’s beatable, and most of all: a game that’s playable. South Park Rally succeeds only as an exercise in cynicism. Acclaim took this beloved franchise, chopped it up, fed it to us, and licked up our tears. Jesus Christ, dude. — Chandler Dean  #287. Deadly Arts    September 29, 1998  Konami  $64.99 on Amazon  Deadly Arts may be the most authentic fighting game ever created, given how its shit show mechanics force it to so closely match the pace of most fights that occur in real life.  I started working on this review by inviting over my unemployed friend Tad, and we drank fourteen Michelob Ultras each to prepare. As the first round of martial combat began, we were amped and ready to have at it. We smack-talked and boasted about how badly we were going to beat one another. At one point we just straight up started spitting at each other. Then, some time later, the first awkward punch finally landed thanks to the absolutely appalling frame rate in the game. It was at this time that Tad threw down his controller and quit, no longer wanting to be a part of this painful and pointless exercise. I’d rather go watch the fights outside of Shady McGrady’s at 2 AM on a Sunday. — James Knapp  #286. ECW Hardcore Revolution    February 17, 2000  Acclaim  $40 on Amazon  Since some Hard Drive readers might not be wrestling fans, let me spin you a yarn. In the same year this game came out, ECW – which stood for Extreme Championship Wrestling and was famed for their no holds barred, car crash style of wrestling – put on a Pay-Pew-View show called Living Dangerously that was also sponsored by Acclaim and this very game. At this event, a wrestler named New Jack, famous for being an absolute legitimate psychopath, dragged another wrestler to the top of a scaffolding to perform an unplanned stunt that resulted in them both crashing 20 feet unprotected onto a concrete arena floor. They both survived, but not without injuries and for New Jack, not without losing a fuckton of vision in one eye. Watching this horrific accident unfold was still a more enjoyable experience than playing ECW Hardcore Revolution. — W. Quant",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaGFyZC1kcml2ZS5uZXQvaGQvdmlkZW8tZ2FtZXMvd2UtcGxheWVkLWFuZC1yYW5rZWQtZXZlcnktc2luZ2xlLW42NC1nYW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-03-01,Not Discerned,"{""Tokyo"", ""Tokyo"", ""Japan""}",Tue 16 May 2023 11:05:00,"Humanity was inspired by a throng of bodies. Specifically, the mass of people queueing for Comiket, the longstanding comic and pop culture convention in Tokyo. As its director Yugo Nakamura explains over a video call from the city, he was intrigued by the “orderly manner” in which these people were milling about. “We have our soul and mind,” he says, “but it was almost like they were moving without thinking.” The challenge the designer set himself and his colleagues at the award-winning Japanese studio tha ltd. was to simulate this gently surging crowd, the ebb and flow of the collective.  Yugo Nakamura  The resulting puzzle game does something unusual for the genre. Yes, it stretches your grey matter in ways that will make you feel like an idiot and then a genius, but its hundreds, sometimes thousands of people moving in unison are capable of stirring up surprising emotions: delight, awe, even fear. The setup is simple: direct an endlessly spawning mass of people towards the light in a series of self-contained levels. The execution is anything but: a luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader, scampering about brutalist architecture suspended high in the clouds. You are given the ability to manipulate the group in different ways with commands such as turn, jump, and branch, which siphons the roving mob into two. When it goes right, Humanity is the stuff of dreams; one wrong instruction, however, and the game turns into a Freudian nightmare, its mass of figures tumbling into an infinite abyss.  This strange, compulsive game is the product of a collaboration between tha and Enhance, the video game studio founded by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, celebrated designer of 2001’s Rez (another game inspired by heaving bodies) and 2019’s Tetris Effect. Mizuguchi, who simply goes by “Miz” to most people who know him, first saw Humanity in 2017 while sitting on a judging panel at a Unity showcase in Tokyo, back when it was still just a tech demo. It grabbed of his attention and then wouldn’t let it go, inspiring a series of searching questions. “Where is this going? What is this trying to get to?” he recalls asking himself, over a video call from his Tokyo office. Six years on, the game elements of Humanity have been fleshed out, but its confusing emotional impact hasn’t changed. “Even today, when I see what we’ve come up with, it’s quite shocking visually,” he says.  A luminous shiba inu dog is the pack’s leader … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Six years is a long time to spend making any kind of video game, let alone a puzzle game (for comparison, that’s how long the new open-world behemoth Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom took to produce). Nakamura admits sculpting the crystalline idea into a meaningful interactive experience was a fraught process. There was a loss in direction, a stutter in development: “To be quite honest … I didn’t even want to show up to work,” Nakamura says. Then Enhance stepped in to offer direction – how to make Humanity “interesting, fun, and entertaining to play”.  Tetsuya Mizuguchi  Mizuguchi is modest about his studio’s input, casually describing it as “helping out with level design”. Like some of the very best puzzle games in recent memory, Humanity gradually ratchets up its complexity. You navigate levels filled with inky blocks that can be pushed around, fans that suspend your minions in mid-air and then, later in the game, grey-skinned figures dressed in black called “the others”. A boldly metaphorical narrative unfolds alongside this symbolic gameplay. During one set of levels collectively titled Fate, there’s no way to alter the path of your followers once they’ve started moving, forcing you to think 10, 15, sometimes even 20 moves ahead. During these puzzles, humankind’s course is preordained.  That said, Humanity is more often than not a game of improvisation and creativity, not least for players who choose to take advantage of the game’s in-built level creator. As producer Mark Macdonald explains, this also contributed to the protracted development, a feature requiring not only the development of easy-to-use tools but an entire network within which fan-made levels could be hosted, shared, and rated. “It’s kind of like creating Netflix and Twitter at the same time,” says Macdonald. During the game’s demo period in March, inventive players made levels based on the recent hit Vampire Survivors, stealth classic Metal Gear Solid, and even baseball, ideas the development team would never have conceived – in other words, “exactly what you’re hoping to see”, he says.  Creating levels is as much of a puzzle as those found in the actual game. Both tickle parts of the brain that enjoy tinkering and experimentation – seeing computer software come alive thanks to human input. As such, Nakamura sees Humanity as an extension of the web design work that made his name in the late 1990s – then cutting-edge sites like MONO*craft, which took advantage of the era’s nascent Flash software. He speaks of the user coming into “touch” with a site, a “reaction”, and this generating an “aha moment”. Of course, websites tend to occupy their users’ attention for only a few minutes; video games have to sustain a player’s attention for many hours. This proved to be one of the biggest challenges for Nakamura. “I would feel that maybe [we had] enough to satisfy the user,” he says. “But I didn’t know what the upper limit was.”  Ebb and flow of the collective … Humanity. Illustration: THA/ Enhance  Nakamura has used the medium’s length to produce a game that is both playful and profound, evoking two works that could scarcely be more different. On the one hand, Lemmings, the seminal 1991 puzzle game that sees you leading strange tiny humanoid figures through underground environments; on the other, Godfrey Reggio’s 1982 masterpiece Koyaanisqatsi, a cinematic tone poem that casts a panoramic, God-like gaze over humanity and its increasingly fractious relationship with Earth. Reggio’s film eludes a single straightforward interpretation, and Humanity will likely inspire similar existential musings.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Pushing Buttons Free weekly newsletter Keza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gaming Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He recalls watching US coverage of the accompanying public unrest and demonstrations while working in Japan, “unlike anything I’ve ever seen in my lifetime”, he says. “Then I’m seeing these giant crowds of people [in the game] flowing, interacting, sometimes competing and fighting, and it’s surreal.”  Nakamura, meanwhile, speaks philosophically of social media and the ways in which it has distorted our perspective before zeroing in on a single question: “Why do things happen when suddenly we’re part of a crowd, part of a larger society, or part of a larger community?” In the surreal, visual story he has crafted – one that only a video game could tell – a dog leads a pack of humans who have “lost their sense of direction, and maybe even hope”.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2FtZXMvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTYvbGVtbWluZ3MtbWVldHMta295YWFuaXNxYXRzaS1odW1hbml0eS10aGUtZHJlYW0tbGlrZS1wdXp6bGUtZ2FtZS10aGF0LWluc3BpcmVzLWRlbGlnaHQtYW5kLXVuZWFzZdIBjwFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZ2FtZXMvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTYvbGVtbWluZ3MtbWVldHMta295YWFuaXNxYXRzaS1odW1hbml0eS10aGUtZHJlYW0tbGlrZS1wdXp6bGUtZ2FtZS10aGF0LWluc3BpcmVzLWRlbGlnaHQtYW5kLXVuZWFzZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2019-10-05,15:00:00,"{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}",Tue 16 May 2023 20:21:48,"Overwatch 2’s long-awaited hero missions PvE mode is no more. In a developer livestream, game director Aaron Keller said that the team is canceling the game’s PvE-based hero missions in favor of continuing on with seasonal, story-focused events.  When Blizzard first announced Overwatch 2, the developers teased that the game would have two PvE campaign modes adjacent to its traditional competitive modes.  In the presentation announcing Overwatch 2 during Blizzcon 2019, former game director Jeff Kaplan spoke of hero missions and story missions that encompassed the game’s PvE elements and drove the game’s narrative. Story missions would be like the story-focused events the original Overwatch already had. Players would group up and fight against AI-controlled enemies instead of teams of other players. These kinds of missions would either cover Overwatch 2’s overall story the way Uprising, Retribution, and Storm Rising dug into events in original Overwatch or be fantastical side stories outside Overwatch canon like the Halloween event Junkenstein’s Revenge. These story missions would also be seasonal, rotating out every few months.  Hero missions, however, were presented as this always-available, always-replayable mode that featured talent trees that would grant different buffs to heroes, giving this part of the game more RPG-like qualities.  But as Overwatch 2 suffered from delays and development issues, Blizzard announced that hero mode (known then as simply PvE mode) would not launch with the game and come at a later date. In today’s developer livestream, it seems that the hero mode version of Overwatch 2 PvE is being shuttered due to development constraints and shifted priorities.  “With everything we’ve learned about what it takes to operate this game,” said executive producer Jared Neuss. “It’s clear that we can’t deliver on that original vision for PvE that was shown in 2019.”  After Overwatch 2 was announced, the game entered a kind of “dead zone” where no new content was being released save skins and rehashed holiday events. Even though a new game was forthcoming, players started disengaging from original Overwatch. Ahead of the game’s release in 2022, Keller put out a video promising a steady cadence of releases and new content so players would never again have to wait years between new heroes or events.  In an interview with GameSpot, Neuss and Keller went into detail about the reasons for hero modes’ cancellation, talking about how it would’ve taken pulling developers off the live game in order to create hero mission PvE as it was originally conceived and how that wouldn’t square with the team’s commitment to keeping the game fresh and exciting.  In reality, what we were looking at was running two separate games at the same time with a set of heroes as the piece that is shared between two of them. And as we started to get further and further into it — obviously our players could realize that we were pulling focus away from the live game — but it just didn’t look like there was a definitive end date in sight where we would finally be able to put that stamp on [it], or that end date was years away and it no longer felt like we could be doing that to our players, or we could be doing that to the live game that we were running. And that’s when we took the moment to shift strategy and put everything into the live game.  Losing hero missions is a big bummer, but Overwatch 2 PvE isn’t totally gone. Story missions have been traditional events within both games, and the developers shared that Overwatch 2’s first big story event is coming in season 6.

game,2017-10-13,22:00:00,Not Discerned,Tue 16 May 2023 11:00:00,"The pitch sounds like an echo from the distant crypto past, when the blockchain was not only going to fight climate change but also cure cancer. Log on to Minecraft clone OPCraft and—through the magic of decentralized cryptography—experience true gaming freedom.  The pixelated world closely resembles its role model both in aesthetics and gameplay. As in Minecraft, the environment that OPCraft players explore is made up of blocks, which players can move, destroy, and combine to produce new materials.  OPCraft was built by crypto devotees who disdain the format of the most popular crypto games, which generally take conventional game designs and add a cryptocurrency element on top, often centered on making money exchanged as digital currency or NFTs.  The creators of OPCraft are trying to establish a new genre of games shaped more fundamentally by blockchains. Their rules and core mechanisms are encoded into smart contracts—software applications that encode an agreement—linked to the Ethereum blockchain. The game, which debuted in October for a two-week test period, is meant to demonstrate a vision its developers call an autonomous world—a digital space owned and controlled not by a single, centralized entity but by a decentralized network of people interacting with a blockchain.  OPCraft is not the first on-chain game, and dozens more are in the works, setting out to build gaming worlds their creators describe as “sovereign” or “eternal.” At a time when the games industry is more lucrative and corporate than ever, these projects are trying to show that it’s possible to rethink some long-established patterns—like the fact that a game’s code typically lives on a privately owned server and can be changed or removed on a whim by its owners.  The challenge now for these crypto idealists is to build games that demonstrate and prove out those ideals. If they can do that, they might change the conventional wisdom about what blockchains can do, too, by showing that they’re useful for more than just cryptocurrency and NFTs.  In-game screenshot of OPCraft. Courtesy of Lattice Labs Ltd.  On-Chain Game Theory  Justin Glibert, cofounder of the blockchain research nonprofit 0xPARC, is quick to acknowledge that the idea of online games offering a new canvas for self-expression might not sound very new. But he argues that the freedom offered by conventional games is partly an illusion.  Players of the 20-year-old space-themed game Eve Online, like devotees of other online multiplayer games, invest huge amounts of time and energy into their play, creating and running sophisticated organizations and maintaining genuine relationships. Players feel like they’re free to shape their own destiny inside the game. But Glibert says that freedom can in fact be yanked away at any moment by CCP Games, Eve’s owner.  “They believe that CCP is not running the game world,” when in fact it retains total control, says Glibert, who runs a division of 0xPARC called Lattice that builds on-chain games. He says that games built on blockchains can be designed to prevent any one entity from controlling a world’s fate, while also offering new freedom for users to customize and expand on a game’s design.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9hdXRvbm9tb3VzLXdvcmxkcy1haW0tdG8tZnJlZS1vbmxpbmUtZ2FtZXMtZnJvbS1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-16,Not Discerned,"{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}",Wed 17 May 2023 06:59:56,"DENVER — A collective sigh of relief wafted through Ball Arena, as fans flooded the exit stairways celebrating the Nuggets’ survival of Tuesday’s 132-126 thriller over the Lakers in Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals.  “We are up 1-0, so that beats the alternative,” said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. “We protected our home court, and wins are hard to come by this time of the season.”  Nikola Jokic certainly eased the burden in logging his third consecutive triple-double of the playoffs — 34 points, 21 rebounds, 14 assists — and sixth of the club’s current run. In doing so, Jokic ties Magic Johnson (1982) and Draymond Green (2019) for the second-most triple-doubles in a single postseason. The Nuggets’ center now ranks as the only player in NBA history to tally multiple 30-point, 20-rebound triple-doubles (Hall of Famers such as Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar accomplished that only once).  Jokic did it through relentless aggression from the onset, pouring in 19 points with 16 rebounds, seven assists and two blocks during a first half in which Denver stacked an 18-point lead. The big man now ranks as just the second NBA player to produce 15-plus points and 15-plus rebounds in the first half of a playoff game (Tim Duncan scored 22 points with 16 rebounds against the Lakers in the 2002 West semis).  “It’s a playoff, we need to be aggressive,” Jokic said. “We need to win the game, especially in front of our home crowd because [the Lakers] won two Game 1s [on the road]. Being aggressive, it’s normal right now.”  It also proved crucial toward building a little cushion for a fourth-quarter drought during which Jokic didn’t make a single field goal, as the Lakers closed to 124-121 on an Austin Reaves 3-pointer with 3:23 left to play. Los Angeles’ lone lead of the night (2-0) came on a LeBron James drive to the bucket to start the game, but the Lakers climbed uphill the rest of the way, closing strong with 72 points over the third and fourth quarters.  Here are five quick takeaways from Tuesday’s Game 2:  1. Battle of the bigs  Jokic receives the nod here for his Game 1 performance in arguably the most compelling, and likely decisive, matchup of this entire series. Anthony Davis scored a game-high 40 points (his third career 40-point postseason showing), but the Nuggets’ big man asserted most of the force early in gobbling up 12 rebounds to the visiting team’s total of four in the opening frame, as Denver stormed to a 16-point lead on the strength of a combined 16 points from the two-time Kia MVP and Aaron Gordon. Denver outscored the visiting Lakers 18-12 in the paint in the first quarter, connecting on 50% (9-for-18) from that area, as Jokic set an early tone of physicality that the visitors wouldn’t match until late in the contest.  Keep in mind, the Nuggets entered Game 1 having taken 53% of their shots up to that point from the paint, which ranked as the highest rate for any team in the playoffs, and they connected on 57.2%. It’s also worth noting Los Angeles marched into the conference finals limiting teams to 50.9% shooting from the paint (second lowest in the NBA), and that mark fell to 47.9% with Davis on the court.  Apparently, Jokic wasn’t aware or didn’t care about the latter in the first half because the 28-year-old made it a point to aggressively attack his Lakers counterpart. Jokic smashed the gas on multiple powerful drives resulting in two dunks in the first half, even surprising Davis on a couple by taking him off the bounce.  “On his first post-up, they double-teamed,” Malone said. “They were sending an extra body at him early on. We had a great example we showed at halftime where they double-teamed him, [Kentavious Caldwell-Pope] cut to the basket and got a layup. Then, they started guarding him 1-on-1. When he felt there was 1-on-1 coverage, [he was] facing up, getting to the basket, and using that understated athleticism to finish in traffic. That was great to see.”  The diversity of Jokic’s attack in the first half left Davis guessing in trying to anticipate the Denver center’s next move, and that likely played a role in the 28-year old running up a near triple-double over the first two quarters.  That’s a win for the home team.  “I don’t think you can shut any one aspect of his game down and expect to be OK,” said Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “You just have to come in and have a great initial defender on him and the other four guys being ready to pitch in and just do their job, and again, being early to your spots, because if you have to play catch-up they’ll kill you every time.”  Despite Denver’s fast start, Malone pointed out the team’s lapses in the second half. The Nuggets outscored the visitors 30-24 in the paint in the first half and 16-8 in second-chance points over that span, while outrebounding the Lakers 36-13. The second half told a different story with the Lakers authoring leads in rebounding (17-11), points in the paint (24-20) and second-chance points (5-2).  “We were kind of imposing our will on the glass [in the first half], but that’s got to be for four quarters,” Malone said. “It just can’t be for a half.”  2. Key 2nd-half adjustment  Los Angeles threw multiple looks at Jokic throughout the first half with little success as the Nuggets center carved up the Lakers over the first two quarters, before finishing the night with 34 points on 12-for-17 shooting with 21 rebounds, 14 assists and two blocks. But Ham tossed out an adjustment late in Game 1 that Jokic and the Nuggets should count on seeing again throughout this series.  After Jokic poured in 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting with five assists in the third quarter, Ham deployed Rui Hachimura as a primary defender on the Nuggets center, while letting Davis roam the paint freely to help on Jokic drives.  “Something that we just went to, a little adjustment,” Davis said. “We did end up liking it.”  In a fourth quarter in which Los Angeles pulled to within three points, the Lakers limited Jokic to 0-for-2 from the field as Jamal Murray closed out the game. Murray scored eight points in the fourth quarter, finishing with 31 (on 12-for-20 shooting).  “They definitely had us on our heels,” Malone said. “They became the aggressor and turned the tide in this game with how aggressive they were playing. Late in the game, they put Rui on Nikola and they were just [using] Anthony Davis [like a free safety] letting him man the paint and make it look really crowded. Our execution can be better. But we made enough big plays down the stretch on both ends of the floor to win the game.”  3. Fast road start foiled  The Lakers stole victories in their first road game of the previous two playoff series, averaging 122.5 points in those outings before dropping the other four games averaging 99.5 points. Denver prevented Los Angeles from snatching Game 1 in large part due to aggressive starts from Jokic and Murray, who shot 7-for-11 in the first half (17 points), as the Nuggets build an 18-point halftime lead.  Denver won its seventh straight at Ball Arena in the playoffs, the team’s longest home win streak to start a postseason.  “We have not lost a home game in the playoffs,” Malone said. “They haven’t lost a home game in the playoffs. We told our team that they went to Memphis, went to Golden State and won Game 1 [in] both of those series and wrestled home-court advantage from both of those teams. But for us, it’s maintaining the same course that we’re on, the same mindset and going out there and doing our jobs to the best of our ability.”  4. Denver hits most of main targets  Phoenix ran roughshod over Denver in transition for a couple games in the Western Conference semifinals, and Los Angeles features one of the league’s most devastating bigs in Davis, who leads a Lakers squad that practically lived on the free-throw line in the regular season (26.6 attempts per game). So, naturally, Malone emphasized holding down the Lakers in transition, keeping them off the line, and controlling the paint in the team’s prep work heading into the conference finals.  Denver delivered on a few its objectives to start this series. The Nuggets outscored Los Angeles 19-13 in transition (17 of those points came in the first half), and pounded the Lakers 47-30 on the glass, but finished with a plus-two edge in paint scoring (50-48) while failing to keep the visitors off the free-throw line. Los Angeles averaged 29 attempts from the free-throw line in the Western Conference semifinals and finished that series with a plus-66 advantage in free throws made. The Lakers ended Game 1 with a plus-four edge in free-throw attempts (26-22) and drained 88.5%.  5. Top O vs. Top D  Something’s got to give here, and in Game 1, Denver struck first in flexing the power of its electric offense against Los Angeles’ stingy defense. The Nuggets scored 118.7 points per 100 possessions through the first two rounds of the playoffs, which ranked No. 1 in the NBA going into the West Finals. The Lakers surrendered just 106.5 points per 100 possessions over that same span, good for the NBA’s best defensive efficiency in the playoffs, as they held Memphis and Golden State to 42.2% shooting over 12 contests.  Denver’s 132 points in Game 1 registered as the most it has scored this postseason, and the club’s 106 points through the first three frames set a franchise record for the most points through three quarters. The Nuggets top three scorers in Jokic, Murray and Caldwell-Pope combined for 86 points, while the Lakers’ high-scoring trio of James, Davis and Reaves came together for 89 points. In all, Denver featured six double-figures scorers, compared to four for Los Angeles.  Game 1 marked just the 12th time in Denver franchise history that two Nuggets scored 30 points or more in the same contest.  * * *",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vbmV3cy81LXRha2Vhd2F5cy1mcm9tLW51Z2dldHMtZ2FtZS0xLXZpY3Rvcnktb3Zlci1sYWtlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-04-01,Not Discerned,"{""Banff"", ""Alberta"", ""Canada""}",Tue 16 May 2023 10:48:16,"In the past month, developers of three major video games have announced special modes designed to help people with specific phobias play their games.  Why it matters: It’s an expansion of an industrywide push to make games more accessible, offering the audience options that wouldn’t be as feasible in other forms of entertainment.  Details: The new settings address fear of spiders or being underwater.  In April, Sony PlayStation hit Horizon Forbidden West was updated to include a thalassophobia mode for players with fears tied to deep water. Turning on that option keeps the protagonist from running out of air while swimming below the surface and adds pulsing and glowing effects to the game’s underwater environment.  Near the end of April, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, from Electronic Arts, launched with an “arachnophobia safe mode” that changes the look of one monstrous creature, hiding its stingers and altering other details to make it look less spider-like.  In early May, Warner Bros. Games’ Hogwarts Legacy (the year’s best-selling console game so far) also added an arachnophobia mode.  Be smart: Developers behind these modes consider them a necessary matter of accessibility, no different from letting players who are colorblind select an option to change how colors appear in the game.  Options around phobias first prominently appeared in 2020, when Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian Entertainment introduced an arachnophobia mode for Grounded, their survival game about shrunken teens trapped in a backyard.  What they’re saying: “We realized that our game features spiders very prominently, and they're very large,” Brian MacIntosh, a programmer at Obsidian, tells Axios. “That could definitely be an issue for some people, so it seemed like something we had to do something about.”  Developers at the studio had also taken note of 2019 indie game Satisfactory, which had a fear option that switched out its spiders for cats.  As they made Grounded, the studio worked with a Microsoft research team to understand how to alleviate phobic player’s fears. They created a “safe mode” slider that alters the game’s spiders gradually, first by removing arms and fangs, all the way to “what we call the danger dumpling,” MacIntosh says. “It's a couple of blobs with eyes on it.”  The goal “was not to just make the spiders not scary.” Rather, “the goal was to provide a mode where someone who's phobic, who has this sort of irrational, very heightened fear of spiders, to bring their fear level down to what someone who's not phobic might experience.”  Between the lines: The phobia options that made Grounded an outlier three years ago have become a trend as accessibility efforts gain more support from project to project.  EA’s Star Wars team at Respawn Entertainment started making their arachnophobia mode about a year ago, members of the team tell Axios, after a developer on Star Wars Jedi: Survivor became unable to work on a key level because of the spider-like design of one creature.  Less polished versions of the creature earlier in development hadn’t triggered the developer’s phobia.  It was too late to change the creature’s design, so, instead, an accessibility working group cooked up a solution: an optional, alternate look for the beast using a trick to obscure its stingers.  At PlayStation studio Guerilla Games, developers had heard from players who viewed the 2020 debut trailer for then-upcoming Horizon Forbidden West.  “Our community team received messages from fans who expressed that they were worried they would not be able to enjoy these sections because of severe fear of deep water,” Joshua van Gageldonk, the game’s project QA lead, tells Axios.  Implementing an alternate thalassophobia setting involved “a ton of different people from all kinds of disciplines on the development side,” to ensure the optional mode didn’t break the game. For example, the audio team had to ensure that the game never triggered choking sounds or drowning animations for its hero as she swam underwater.  State of play: Developers working on these modes say they’re comfortable letting players tweak the content to overcome a phobia.  “That’s something that people value across the team, across all disciplines, to be able to create that accessible game for players [who] otherwise wouldn't have been able to complete the story and experience the journey,” Respawn development director Jonas Lundqvist tells Axios.  “I think it’s incredible that games are opening up more and more to different people,” PlayStation’s van Gageldonk says. “We’re all different, and it’s great if we can customize games to just how we like them.”  What’s next: With each new phobia mode introduced into a game, more are likely to follow, according to Respawn technical designer Michel Wong, who worked on Jedi: Survivor’s arachnophobia mode.  “Having a greater body of work to draw from is beneficial for everyone.”  Among other things, Michel says, they serve as proof, for peers and for their bosses, “to sort of make the case for why it's important and how it would work.”  Sign up for the Axios Gaming newsletter here.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE1L3ZpZGVvLWdhbWVzLXBob2JpYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

WASHINGTON -- — Joey Meneses drove in four runs as part of a four-hit day, CJ Abrams homered and the Washington Nationals defeated the New York Mets 10-3 on Monday to split a four-game series.  New York has lost nine of its last 13 and dropped 15 of 21 since its 14-7 start. The Mets are 0-5-2 in their last seven series and have not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from April 19-21. Big-spending New York fell to fourth in the NL East, 1 1/2 games ahead of last-place Washington.  “A lot of times you know what the problem is and you’re just trying to figure out ways to fix it,” Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. “That’s what makes this sport difficult. I don’t really know. There’s probably a number of things you can point at.”  Patrick Corbin (2-5) earned his first home victory since last Aug. 28, surrendering two runs and eight hits over six innings.  The rebuilding Nationals, who scored in each inning they batted except the second, improved to 17-17 since losing five of their first six games.  “Let’s forget about the first week of the season,"" Washington manager Dave Martinez said. ""We’ve been playing really well. I want them to take that into consideration. Not just playing one team, but understanding where we’re at and what we’re doing. It’s been fun. They’re playing with a lot of energy. They come to the ballpark ready. They’re engaged. They’re going out there and they’re doing the simple things right.”  Meneses doubled in Lane Thomas with one out in the first to put New York in another early hole. The Mets have been outscored 37-9 in the first inning this season.  Meneses added another RBI double in the third off New York starter David Peterson (1-6). Keibert Ruiz followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.  The Nationals scored two more runs in the fourth and another in the fifth against Peterson, who allowed six runs and nine hits in five innings. Peterson has yielded at least four runs in six consecutive starts, and his ERA ballooned to a season-high 8.08.  “He knows he's capable of pitching well up here and he feels good physically,” manager Buck Showalter said. “That's what's been really frustrating for everybody. Some of the breaking balls have been inconsistent. I thought he had a little better one today, but he just never could get any footing where they had to guard against something.”  Abrams hit a solo shot off Tommy Hunter in the sixth. It was the second day in a row Abrams went deep, and three of his four homers this season have come against the Mets.  Meneses added a run-scoring infield single later in the inning and an RBI double in the eighth. He is hitting .452 (19 of 42) with 20 RBI with runners in scoring position.  The Mets managed three hits in two different innings against Corbin, but pushed across just one run in both of them — Jeff McNeil's RBI single in the second and Tommy Pham's sacrifice fly in the sixth.  New York has not homered since Pete Alonso's second-inning homer Wednesday at Cincinnati, a span of 52 innings. The Mets had two doubles among their 11 hits Monday, while seven of Washington's 15 hits went for extra bases.  “We know what we’re doing right now is not producing wins, but we also know this team is very capable of that,” Nimmo said. “Look to what you’ve done in the past, look at things that have helped in the past and be open to new information on how we can get better. Then when you get up to the plate, it’s compete time. It’s time to grind it out.”  TRAINER'S ROOM  Mets: Showalter said RHP Carlos Carrasco (elbow inflammation) could return from the injured list Friday or Saturday if his between-starts work day goes well. Carrasco pitched four shutout innings Sunday in a rehabilitation start for Double-A Binghamton.

With the score 6-6, Ryan McMahon singled off Ben Lively (1-1) leading off the seventh. Luke Sims, who hadn't allowed a run in 11 appearances this season, relieved with one out and walked Randal Grichuk with two outs.  Castro doubled off the base of the right-field wall, giving him three hits and three RBI, and putting the Rockies ahead 8-6.  “He gets hits,"" Rockies manager Bud Black said. ""He’s a little bit of a slasher, a little bit of a low on-base compared to the batting average. There’s not a big gap between average and on-base, but the guy puts the bat on the ball. He’s a steady performer in a lot of ways. It was a good night for him.”  Wil Myers' sacrifice fly in the eighth cut the gap, and Doyle homered off Buck Farmer in the bottom half. Doyle, a 25-year-old who debuted on April 24, has four homers in 17 games. He went deep Sunday on his birthday in a 4-0 win over Philadelphia.  “With your mindset, there’s a huge shift,"" Doyle said.

Greene averaged 98.2 mph with his fastball, down 0.6 mph from his season average, and reached 100 mph just once.  “I pitched really well tonight,"" Greene said. ""There were pitches that I doubled up on that I shouldn’t have.

game,2022-07-16,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Mon 15 May 2023 21:51:00,"The potential effects of video games on mental health has been a long-drawn-out debate. Some people argue that relaxing with a video game has positive impacts on an individual, while others fear that video games can be addictive and promote negative mood changes.  A new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Sociological Focus, has sort out to answer this heated debate.  How did the researchers find the answer?  The research team analyzed members of an online football simulation gaming site.  In the simulation, players play as a head coach of a football team. The players compete against one another to have the most successful team. The game also allows for communication between competing players.  The players were surveyed at the beginning and end of each game's season for a period of 10 months.  37 players responded before playing the game, 40 responded after playing the game and 30 responded both before and after.  (credit: INGIMAGE)  The surveys included questions on depressive symptoms and abilities to communicate personal issues. The players were also asked to list how many people in real life and online they spoke to about things impacting them.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Dr. Tyler Prochnow from the Department of Health Behavior at Texas A&M University’s School of Public Health said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support, and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  What did the research find?  The researchers found that the size and quality of a social network directly impacted depressive episodes. Online social networks enabled people to find support in coping with their problems.  Players without a strong real-life social network were also more likely to use the online network for support. Players in this situation were also more likely to spend a long time online.  Additionally, the researchers found that a sense of community, and the presence of depressive episodes, could alter the social structure of the group over time.  It is worth noting that the study was based on one type of non-violent video game, and thus the findings cannot be applied as a general rule.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgtYW5kLXdlbGxuZXNzL21pbmQtYW5kLXNwaXJpdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzE0M9IBSmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vaGVhbHRoLWFuZC13ZWxsbmVzcy9taW5kLWFuZC1zcGlyaXQvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMxNDMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-13,Not Discerned,"{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}",Mon 15 May 2023 10:01:38,"Jayson Tatum gave Boston a long-overdue fast start and followed it up with a finish the NBA had never seen before.  After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. ""It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” said Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, who is in his first year as an NBA head coach after being promoted on the eve of training camp after Ime Udoka was suspended. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for Philadelphia. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year, and the fifth time in six seasons; they have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. ... I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,"" Brown said. ""He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  Banged-Up Brown  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  What's Up, Doc?  Rivers is 6-10 in seventh games. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL's Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: ""Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,"" Embiid said. ""We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  Tip-Ins  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNS9ib3N0b24tY2VsdGljcy1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnMtNzZlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

With the win, the Hogs secured their seventh SEC series victory of the season and improved to 30-4 at home this year.  Hollan struck out a career-high 10 batters, limiting the Gamecocks to just one run on five hits and one walk. The left-hander threw a season-high 113 pitches in his nine-inning complete game and recorded 19 consecutive outs until a two-out single in the top half of the ninth inning.  The performance marks the Razorbacks’ first complete game of at least nine innings against an SEC team since Dominic Taccolini’s 10-inning complete game shutout against Kentucky in 2016. Hollan is the second Arkansas pitcher to throw a complete game this season after Will McEntire twirled a nine-inning complete game against Louisiana Tech on April 11.  South Carolina’s lone run of the game came via a leadoff home run in the top of the third. Hollan was untouchable from that point forward, however, allowing the Arkansas offense to hit its groove and take control of the ballgame.  John Bolton’s one-out RBI double to right center in the bottom half of the third tied things at one apiece before Parker Rowland’s go-ahead two-run single to center in the fifth. Rowland’s clutch piece of hitting put the Hogs ahead, 3-1.  Arkansas tacked on two more runs with a two-out RBI single by Caleb Cali in the sixth followed by a two-out solo home run by Ben McLaughlin in the eighth, extending the lead to 5-1. Cali and Peyton Holt both finished with a team-leading three hits, and Rowland collected the Razorbacks’ lone multi-RBI performance of the game.  The Hogs’ four-run lead was more than enough for Hollan to protect as he finished off his complete game with a scoreless ninth inning, securing the Razorbacks’ series-clinching win and put the Hogs in the driver’s seat of the SEC.  Arkansas now owns a one-and-a-half-game lead over LSU in the SEC Western Division and a one-game lead over Florida in the overall SEC standings with three games left to play in the regular season.  Up next, the Hogs will travel to Nashville, Tenn., to close out the regular season at Vanderbilt.

game,2023-05-14,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Sun 14 May 2023 23:46:00,"Doc Rivers extended one of the more dubious streaks in coaching on Sunday. Despite entering each of the past four seasons with championship expectations, he has managed to lose in the second round four years in a row. His teams led three of the four series after five games, and his team had the higher seed in two of those collapses. Sunday was perhaps the worst of them all. Despite leading for most of the first half, the 76ers fell apart against the Boston Celtics, Rivers' former team, in a 33-10 third-quarter debacle. That gave Rivers his NBA record 10th Game 7 loss. No other head coach has more than five Game 7 losses.  As such, questions have immediately arisen surrounding Rivers' job security. While he initially signed a five-year deal to take over the 76ers in 2020, each playoff defeat has been more devastating than the last and the 76ers will now have to consider whether or not they want to give Rivers the chance to lead them for a fourth season. Rivers addressed the rumors at his post-game press conference Sunday, and while he wouldn't deny the inherent insecurity of his profession, he did suggest that he plans to be back next season. ""Yeah. I think I got two years left,"" Rivers said. ""No one is safe in our business and I get that.""  Rivers isn't the only notable 76er whose future is in question. James Harden can be a free agent after re-signing in Philadelphia on a one-year deal with a player option for a second. Rumors have linked him to his old team, the Houston Rockets, all season. He claimed that he has not thought about free agency yet, but that he thinks his current team still has room to grow. ""It's only Year 1 for us together,"" Harden said.  Looming over every decision Philadelphia makes this offseason is Joel Embiid's future. While the MVP winner is under contract for at least three more seasons, superstars are rarely satisfied with humiliating playoff defeats on a seemingly annual basis. All it will take to upend this franchise is one trade request. Embiid has given no indication yet that he plans to leave Philadelphia, but NBA history tells us that he won't be satisfied with second-round exits forever. Embiid did comment on Rivers' future in Philly after Game 7, saying the coach has done a ""fantastic job.""  That is going to inform whatever the 76ers do with Rivers, Harden and the rest of their team this offseason. The clock was already ticking. After what happened on Sunday, Philadelphia will have to make major moves to keep their best player happy. The logical place to start that process would be with a new coach.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL25iYS9uZXdzL2RvYy1yaXZlcnMtY29tbWVudHMtb24tam9iLXNlY3VyaXR5LXdpdGgtNzZlcnMtYWZ0ZXItbGF0ZXN0LWdhbWUtNy1sb3NzLW5vdGVzLWhlLWhhcy10d28teWVhcnMtbGVmdC1pbi1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en
game,2023-05-14,Not Discerned,"{""Boston"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}",Mon 15 May 2023 02:15:49,"BOSTON — In the Sixers’ final loss of the 2021-22 season, James Harden scored zero second-half points. He was 0 for 2 from the field after intermission in the Sixers’ Round 2, Game 6 defeat to the Heat.  On Sunday afternoon at TD Garden, he scored three second-half points. The Celtics then immediately piled up 18 in a row as the Sixers crumbled on their way to another second-round playoff exit, losing Game 7 in a blowout.  Harden had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, seven assists, six rebounds and five turnovers. Across the Sixers’ four losses in the series, he made a mere 12 of 55 field goals (21.8 percent). While Harden was brilliant in Games 1 and 4 and very solid in Game 5, he and the Sixers were not nearly good enough with the season at stake.  Head coach Doc Rivers gave a generous spin on the 10-time All-Star’s outing.  “I thought James came to play,” Rivers said. “I really did. I thought he was trying to see the game. I thought he played downhill a lot. Where he passed the ball was the right decisions tonight, and we didn’t get anything out of it. I get it. James, (Joel Embiid), me ... I know we’ve got to point somewhere, right? But I thought James, in particular, he was trying to do the right things tonight. I really did.”  Harden, who will turn 34 years old in August, missed 24 games this season, including four in March with left Achilles soreness that he said had been bothering him “for some months.” When healthy, he regularly created excellent shots for everyone around him with inch-perfect hit-ahead feeds, smooth pick-and-roll passes, and well-timed kick-outs. After starting 12-12, the Sixers went an NBA-best 42-16 and were second in offensive rating. Harden led the league in assists for a second time with 10.7 per game.  For next season, he has a player option of $35.6 million.  “James has a decision to make this summer, and he’ll make it,” Rivers said. “I think he overall enjoyed being here. It’s tough for him. We asked him to play a little differently than he’s always been accustomed to. I think it made us a better team. And unfortunately, I thought for James at times, it wasn’t always best for him. But he still did it. You appreciate that as a coach.”  Speaking minutes later in the visiting locker room, Harden didn’t provide much to supplement his coach’s comments on that subject.  “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said of his player option.  What is he looking for next?  “I just want to have a chance to compete,” Harden said. “Compete.”  Harden also offered little when asked about Rivers, whom he’d called “one of the best coaches to ever coach the game of basketball” at his introductory Sixers press conference last February.  “Our relationship is OK,” he said.  Harden did agree with the notion that he and Embiid can further grow their partnership.  “Definitely,” he said. “I feel like we had a pretty solid team. Obviously, you always look to get better, whether it’s the personnel you have now or adding pieces. We’ll see how it goes.”  By next postseason, Embiid will be 30 years old.  “We’ve got an unfinished job,” the MVP big man said. “We haven’t won anything, and I think we’ve got a chance to win. Obviously, going to seven games and having a chance to close it out at home, which we didn’t do. I still believe we’ve got the chance to win. We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I know (Harden) has a player option or they can extend him, but that’s on those guys to figure it out. I’m going to stay out of it, but I still believe that me and him, we’ve got the chance to win.  “It’s going to take more than us. We’ve all got to look at ourselves. I’ve got to be better and I will be better. That’s what I’m focused on. All of us, we’ve got to come back and find ways to just keep improving and help the team. You can’t win alone. I can’t win alone. Me and James, we just can’t win alone. That’s why basketball, it’s played 5-on-5. We just need everybody to keep trying to find ways to get better, and we’ll be fine.”",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNzcG9ydHMuY29tL3BoaWxhZGVscGhpYS9zaXhlcnMvc2l4ZXJzLWphbWVzLWhhcmRlbi1zaXhlcnMtY2VsdGljcy1nYW1lLTctZG9jLXJpdmVycy1qYW1lcy1oYXJkZW4tY29udHJhY3QtbmJhLXBsYXlvZmZz0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhL3NpeGVycy9zaXhlcnMtamFtZXMtaGFyZGVuLXNpeGVycy1jZWx0aWNzLWdhbWUtNy1kb2Mtcml2ZXJzLWphbWVzLWhhcmRlbi1jb250cmFjdC1uYmEtcGxheW9mZnM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

Paul DeJong added a solo shot and Arenado drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who won for the sixth time in seven games since an eight-game losing streak. Their previous two wins came on ninth-inning rallies against closer Kenley Jansen at Fenway Park.  Lars Nootbaar had three hits and scored three times for St. Louis, and Paul Goldschmidt added two hits and an RBI. Miles Mikolas (2-1) pitched six innings of one-run ball, allowing four hits with two walks.  “We are a playoff team despite our bad start,” Mikolas said. “The talent is there. We're a very good baseball team.”  Rafael Devers had an RBI single for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games.  It was the first series sweep this season for St. Louis (16-25), which owns the NL’s worst record. Arenado homered over the Green Monster once in each game of the series.  The Cardinals finished a six-game road trip to Wrigley Field and Fenway Park at 5-1.  “It's a good road trip,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “To get back on track and the way we've done it, against two good teams, to be able to go out there with the style of play that has been really good. I know I've said it several times, but that clubhouse has trust in one another.”  Red Sox starter Corey Kluber (2-5) gave up four runs and seven hits — two homers — in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.  “I put us in a hole early,” he said. “I think it just boils down to poor fastball command.”  DeJong’s shot into the center-field seats broke a 1-all tie in the second. Knizner’s drive came in the fourth, also going out to center.  Boston’s Enmanuel Valdez had a two-run homer overturned by review in the seventh on a drive that replays showed hooked foul just short of Pesky's Pole.  Génesis Cabrera escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, getting Masataka Yoshida to fly out to end the inning.  “Played two good games and we lost in the ninth and today they kicked our butt,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.  DAD KNOWS  Standing on the field about two hours before the game, Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale asked how the Boston Celtics were doing in Game 7 of their NBA playoff series against Philadelphia. When informed All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had 25 points at halftime, the lefty said: “He’s my oldest son’s favorite athlete. He says it’s me, but I think that’s just to make me feel good. He has two of his jerseys and only one of mine.”  BACK INTO IT  Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras was stretching and squatting with a catcher’s mitt in the clubhouse before the game. After a break from catching, Contreras is slated to be back behind the plate Monday against Milwaukee. He was moved to DH on May 5.

All of the children will hit off a tee and circle the bases for a home run and there is no defense or outs.  “Our game really is the best day of the year. If you haven’t been to one of our games, you are missing out,” Bianco said.

Drury, the sixth seed in the tournament, ends the year with a 30-24 record. Quincy will go to the NCAA-II Tournament with an automatic berth at 44-9.  The Hawks started the game with three runs in the top of first and opened up the lead by posting six runs in the third inning.  Drury got on the board with two runs in the fifth, scoring on a Carson Shaver RBI double, then on a sacrifice fly from Tyler Bastunas.  Quincy, the top scoring offense in the GLVC that averaged more than nine runs per game, kept scoring and added two more in the sixth as well as a single run in the seventh and eighth to lead 13-2.  The Panthers put up four runs in the eighth, highlighted by Shaver’s bases-clearing double that drove in three, but the deficit was too much.  “If you want to beat Quincy, you have to out-pitch them and out-hit them and we weren’t able to do either of those things today,” said Drury head coach Scott Nasby. “We had a long night but a great night last night, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to carry that over to today.”  Jay Hammel (6-2) got the win for the Hawks while Drury starter Cade Waits (5-6) took the loss.  Shaver finished the game going 2 for 4 with two doubles and 4 RBI’s. Graydon Miller went 2 for 3 with two runs and a double.  Hawks DH Austin Simpson went 4 for 5 with 5 RBI’s and he hit his 17th home run of the year.  Drury entered the GLVC Tournament on a seven-game losing streak and was one out away from a loss in Thursday’s opening round as they trailed Maryville 3-1 when Brooks Sunny’s two-RBI single tied the game. The Panthers beat the Saints in 11 innings 6-3, then picked up a 12-4 win over William Jewell on Friday.  Drury had a late start to their game on Saturday as the first pitch was not until 9:40 pm, and in a game that lasted until 1:08 am on Sunday, the Panthers downed Indianapolis 11-4 avenging a loss earlier in the season to UIndy starter Brady Ware, who no-hit Drury while hitting for the cycle at the plate in the same game on April 7.  “I thought we brought some great energy into the tournament,” said Nasby. “We had some great performances offensively and on the mound and had a lot of positivity through the weekend.  “It was good to see some people step up like Graydon Miller, who hadn’t really played at all this year, but came through with some big hits when we needed them this weekend. Brooks Sunny continued to be a clutch player like he was all season, and it was good to see a senior, Carson Shaver, go out playing as well as he did today.”  Sunday’s championship marks the sixth time in program history the Panthers have reached the GLVC title game.",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm96YXJrc3Nwb3J0c3pvbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTQvZHJ1cnktZmFsbHMtdG8tZmlmdGgtcmFua2VkLXF1aW5jeS1pbi1nbHZjLXRpdGxlLWdhbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en

game,2023-05-14,Not Discerned,Not Discerned,Sun 14 May 2023 09:37:00,"The Blue Jays top the Braves thanks to Danny Jansen's 2-run single in the ninth inning.  TORONTO -- — Danny Jansen hit a two-run single in the ninth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays rallied to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.  George Springer hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, who are 12-3 at home this season.  “This team’s resilient,” Jansen said. “We’re looking to win every game, and we believe that we can with the bats and the staff we have.”  With Toronto trailing 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero thought he tied the game to begin the ninth, pumping his fist as he watched his deep drive to right, but Guerrero was held to a single when the ball hit the wall.  The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two outs before Jansen singled to left field off Raisel Iglesias (1-1), driving in Guerrero and Matt Chapman.  “We had an opportunity to win the game and we couldn’t close the deal,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “It’s frustrating, but this game is frustrating.”  The Braves have lost four straight and five of eight.  “Tough one to swallow,” Atlanta’s Austin Riley said.  Nate Pearson (1-0) worked one inning for the win.  Ozzie Albies hit a two-run home run, and Ronald Acuña Jr. and Kevin Pillar each added solo blasts for Atlanta, which has lost nine straight against Toronto.  “Winning against a team like that three games in a row is really hard,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said.  The Braves made three errors and the Blue Jays had two defensive miscues, both by Gold Glove third baseman Chapman. Toronto pitchers also made a pair of wild pitches.  Snitker said he didn’t realize how windy it was on the field with the roof at Rogers Centre open until he came out to replace right-hander Collin McHugh in the second.  Pillar, who played with Toronto from 2013 until 2019, agreed that the conditions were “difficult” Sunday.  “You don’t feel a lot of the wind at ground level, it’s kind of up higher when those balls get up there,” Pillar said. “The ball was moving all over the place.”  Acuña homered on left-hander Yusei Kikuchi’s third pitch of the game, the 28th leadoff homer of his career, and Michael Harris II made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.  Toronto responded with three runs in the bottom of the second. Brandon Belt hit an RBI single and Guerrero’s base hit drove in a pair of runs.  Albies connected in the third, his 10th homer of the season.  Pillar made it 5-3 in the fourth when he homered against his former team, his fourth of the season, but Springer cut the Blue Jays’ deficit to one when he answered in the bottom half with a solo drive to left, his fifth.  McHugh made his first start of the season for Atlanta. He gave up three runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings.  Kikuchi allowed five runs, four earned, and nine hits in 4-plus innings.  WELCOME BACK  Pillar got a standing ovation before he batted in the second, his first at bat of the series and first appearance in Toronto since April 24, 2019, with San Francisco.  “It’s definitely really special to come back that many years later and to be remembered and to be appreciated,” Pillar said. “It was overwhelming.”  TABLE SETTER  Acuña reached base four times and scored twice. He leads the NL in hits (54), total bases (90), runs scored (36), stolen bases (17).  UP NEXT  Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (4-3, 3.32) starts Monday when Atlanta begins a three-game series at Texas. The Rangers have not named a starter.  Blue Jays: RHP Alek Manoah (1-3, 4.83) starts Monday when Toronto hosts the New York Yankees for a four-game series.

Mother’s Day was on the minds of many adaptive sports participants at this month’s adaptive sports game that was held on Saturday.  Volleyball was the game of choice for the month.  The church has been hosting sports games for kids, and older people with disabilities and challenges, to give them a chance to learn a sport and play among their peers.  Participants were also able to create a special gift of flowers for the mom in their life.  As the program wraps up for the Spring, volunteers say they need more people to come out and help with their upcoming summer camp.  “Just like we do here, we assign every child a buddy. The buddy just hangs out with them during the course of the event, so they can direct them, like we may be coming back for snack, or they may need help with a skill, and things like that so that’s really what we need volunteers for,” says Volunteer Buddy Coordinator Vikki Hutchinson.  The adaptive program’s summer camp starts June 7 and ends June 9, and volunteers are needed to help kids that are on a waitlist. If you want to participate, contact the church at (706) 324-5220.
