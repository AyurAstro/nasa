Nancy Mace, R-Charleston.  The case involves state Republican lawmakers challenging a lower court decision, which found that the state’s 1st Congressional District was an unlawful racial gerrymander.  A three-judge panel in January found that South Carolina’s reapportionment mapmaker tried to keep the African American population below a certain target in the district, treating Charleston County “in a fundamentally different way than the rest of the state,” according to The Washington Post.  The lower court panel wrote in a Jan. 6 ruling: “The strategies he employed ultimately exiled over 30,000 African American citizens from their previous district and created a stark racial gerrymander of Charleston County and the City of Charleston.”  The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision could determine whether a different congressional map will be put in place in 2024 for voters in Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston, Colleton, Dorchester and Jasper counties.

Again, they are left with nothing and this time their pets have also been lost.  On Mother's Day, a fire broke out at the home of Geraldine Taranto. Taranto lived there with her family and 4 dogs on 500 block of South Magnolia Street.  Rose Horseman who is the niece to Geraldine Taranto, says she is heartbroken over her family's beloved dogs that perished in the house fire.  ""Everyone humanwise was out the house but it still saddens me that it happened like this and they passed away. The animals were loved and I love every one of them,"" said Horseman.  According to the Lafayette Fire Department, the home's water heater was to blame for the fire, but they are still unsure what caused it to ignite.  Fire investigator Alton Trahan advises homeowners to monitor their water heaters in order to prevent incidents like this.  ""Make sure you don't store any combustibles nearby. You wanna give it 4 inches of space around the whole water heater and the closet should not be used for extra storage whatsoever,"" Trahan says. ""Also if you are smelling any gas, make sure you report it to your gas company or get a licensed plumber to come and check and make sure there are no gas leaks.""  Horseman says supporting her family's GoFundMe can help them move forward from this tragedy.  ""It will help out with clothing, food, sheltering, hopefully, to get back on their feet and moving forward that type of thing. Lift them up, pray,"" Horseman says.

The Liberty High baseball team used its four nonleague dates this spring to play opponents such as Hazleton and Wilson Lawn and those two teams beat the Hurricanes.  But facing perennial state powers and their high-octane pitching helps when it comes to the playoffs.  So far in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference tournament, those nonleague losses have provided big gains for the Hurricanes as they have scored 12 runs in each of their two games.  The second 12-run barrage came Monday in the EPC semifinals resulted in a 12-2, 5-inning rout of Nazareth at DeSales University’s Weiland Park.  The second-seeded Hurricanes (16-4) easily secured a return trip to Center Valley on Thursday night when they will play in the league title game at 7 p.m. against Parkland. The Trojans beat Emmaus 11-5 in the second game of Monday’s semifinal doubleheader.  If Liberty wins it would be the program’s first league championship since a Lehigh Valley Conference crown.  Nazareth, which fell to 16-5, will be off until it begins play in the District 11 6A tournament next week.  Ayden Zabala went 3-for-3, scored three runs and drove in two with a first-inning double. Jacob Rivera and Caden Brozino added two hits apiece and Franklin Pichardo had a two-run double and three RBIs overall.  All of the offense benefitted junior Noah Gyauch-Quirk, the hard-throwing right-hander who is starting to look a lot like he did in 2022 when he was almost unhittable in the Hurricanes’ run to the PIAA title game.  Gyauch-Quirk allowed four hits, walked three and struck out seven in the 5-inning outing. He didn’t flinch after giving up a walk to Aidan Butz and a two-run home run to EPC MVP Jake Dally in the top of the first.  “I felt more confident as the game went on with all of my pitches,” the Lehigh University commit said. “I’ve had more ups and downs this season, but that’s baseball. It’s still fun.”  Part of the reason for a slower start by Gyauch-Quirk was that his season with boys basketball went longer than normal and baseball began earlier than ever this season with reduced practice time built into the schedule.  “It was a really quick transition,” he said. “I think I only had five practices between basketball and baseball. But I feel like as the season has gone on, I have gotten stronger. I was just a relief pitcher earlier, but now I’ve had three starts.”  Liberty’s offense is revving up as as well and looking like it did in going 26-3 last season and two of the three losses en route to the state finals were administered by Nazareth, including a 1-0 defeat in the EPC semifinals.  The Blue Eagles beat the Hurricanes again to start this season on March 21 before Liberty got some revenge with an 18-1 rout on April 25.  But the real payback came Monday when Liberty shook off the Dally blast to send 11 to the plate and score six times in the bottom half of the inning and then tacked on three in the second to take all of the suspense out of the first game of the semifinal twin bill at DeSales.  The Hurricanes easily secured a return trip to Center Valley on Thursday night when they will play in the league title game at 7 p.m. against either Emmaus or Parkland. If Liberty wins it would be the program’s first league championship since a Lehigh Valley Conference crown in 2003.  “We’ve been hitting the ball in the playoffs,” Hurricanes coach Andy Pitsilos said. “The kids stayed discipled and didn’t swing at bad pitches and when they got their pitch they ripped it. So it was a good game for us and I’m sure we’re going to see another good opponent and Thursday. We just have to try to come out and do it again.”  In addition to the 12 hits, which included three doubles, Liberty benefited from nine walks.  The Hurricanes have won seven in a row since a 4-0 loss to Hazleton on April 24.  “We’ve faced a lot of good pitching this year,” Pitsilos said. “We’ve seen of No. 1s from different teams and that just makes you more seasoned at the end. We just take it one-pitch-at-a-time, one-at-bat-a -time and one-inning-at-a-time and the rest will take care of itself. That’s what we drill into the heads of our players.”  Nazareth, which fell to 16-5, will be off until it begins play in the District 11 6A tournament next week. The Blue Eagles took a big blow before the tournament began when it lost standout pitcher Jack Bacolo. Dally, its other ace, pitched in the team’s quarterfinal win over Northampton on Thursday.  “It’s tough to lose a Jack Bacolo, but we play with a next-man-up philosophy,” Nazareth coach Bryan Wolf said. “We get the home run from Jake in the first inning and go up 2-0 and we have the momentum and we’re feeling pretty good. But then we walk the bases loaded in the bottom of the first.  “I told the kids before this game that we needed to play our cleanest game of the season. We had to minimize the walks and make no errors because Liberty was a state runner-up last season for a reason and they have pretty much that whole team back. They don’t make easy outs. They take advantage of your errors and don’t make any and they don’t leave any runners on base.”  Colonial League semis  It will be a Saucon Valley-Bangor battle at 3:30 p.m. Thursday for the Colonial League title at DeSales after the Panthers eliminated defending champ Southern Lehigh 8-3 and Bangor scored three runs in the bottom of the severnth in getting 7-6 walk-off win over Northwestern Lehigh.  Jake Klotz and Cole Hubert combined on a six-hitter for third-seeded Saucon Valley (19-2). Jake Albert had three hits and Rocky Viscito had two hits, scored a run and knocked in one. Ray Matey had a two-run single for the Panthers who are looking for their first league title since 2015. Avery Koser had two hits for Southern Lehigh, which fell to 17-4.  In the Bangor win, the Slaters (19-2) were outhit 12-4, but benefitted from five Tigers errors and six walks. Just one Bangor run was earned.  Joshua Lichman homered and Eli Zimmerman had three hits, including two doubles for Northwestern Lehigh (14-8).  Tommy Aulisi, Hunter Rydell and MJ Siu knocked in runs for Bangor and Siu scored three times. The Slaters are going for their first league title since 2016."

Lone eaglet E22 has been holding down the fort after sibling E-21 fledged and dad M-15 moved out, now spending its days playing in the pond and tidying up the nest that once held all four members of the eagle family.  Hamming it up for the cameras, millions have been watching as E22 enjoyed their remaining days at the North Fort Myers farm before their upcoming journey north for the summer.  Longtime fans of the livestream have eagerly tuned in over the course of eight months, sticking with the nest as through a historic hurricane, the disappearance of an animal icon, and the triumphs of a single dad raising two tiny eaglets.

Wildlife photographer shares insights on 5 stunning wading bird images  Need to catch up on your Southwest Florida Eagle Cam lore? Here are some Fort Myers News-Press pieces to get you caught up on the action before the season ends:  What is the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam?  The Pritchett McSpadden family cofounded the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam in 2012. The livestream, made available by Dick Pritchett Real Estate in North Fort Myers, provides a sneak peek into the eagles' lives.  Bringing in 150 million viewers regularly to watch the daily activities of the two adult eagles as they repair their nest, fly in to feed two hungry youngsters, and keep a watchful eye on what's happening.  Where is the SWFL Eagle Cam?  The nest is located at 6601 Bayshore Road in North Fort Myers. Operators advise those who visit to not interfere or intervene with any natural events in the nest.  How many eagle seasons are there?  They are currently on their 11th season since first livestreaming the eagles in 2012.  What technology do they use to film the eagles?  Four different cameras were used to provide views from all around the nest and pastures on the property. However, their 360 camera and Cam 2 were damaged during Hurricane Ian and were unrecoverable during the season.  Operators use primarily Axis PTZs. They also have an AXIS 360 that enhanced their 360-degree view. All cameras are powered using Power over Ethernet technology.  Who was Harriet the Eagle?  Harriet was a beloved Southwest Florida eagle who rose to fame through the SFEC Livestream. Viewers quickly latched onto the matriarch as they witnessed her triumphs and challenges each season, making her a fixture in both the local community and the animal world.  Brush up on your history in one goHarriet's History: Timeline of beloved eagle and her family's life in North Fort Myers  Harriet first landed on the Pritchett McSpadden property back in the 1990s with former mate Ozzie. After hatching a dozen of eaglets and even moving on to another partner, the female eagle secured her status as an adored animal icon.  What happened to Harriet?  Everything changed on Feb. 2 when Harriet did not return to the nest after she was last seen flying northwest to chase off intruders, alerting both SFCE officials and viewers.  ""Harriet, our dedicated and loyal matriarch, has not been seen in the nest area since yesterday late afternoon. While M defends & protects the nest solo, all we can do is watch and wait for a hopeful return of Harriet soon,"" SFEC officials posted the following morning, later explaining it was unusual for Harriet to be away from the nest so long.  Clinic for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife (CROW) and Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officials jumped in to search for the animal icon. Locals also conducted their own search parties, sending in tips and photos to officials and Facebook groups.  Did she ever return?  Harriet never returned to the nest. To this day, SFEC officials have said they have not found any trace of her and do not have any concrete theories on what happened.  Many online assumed that Harriet was hurt and/or died. She was at least 25 years old, and according to the National Wildlife Federation, adding that eagles in the wild live between 20 and 30 years.  Can a male eagle solely take care of a nest?  In the wake of Harriet's disappearance, M-15 has stepped up to solely care for the nest. A feat that many viewers celebrated yet were nervous to watch playout.  Insight from a retired eagle expertIs she gone? Long-lived Harriet the bald eagle still missing, was at least 25 years old  However, according to retired eagle biologist Jim Beever, raising the eaglets would be difficult but not impossible for M15 due to his age and experience.  ""It’s going to be tough for the male to raise two chicks, but it’s possible,"" Beever said. ""And we’ll just have to see what happens. He has been covering them when it’s been cold and rainy, and he has been feeding them. If Harriet never comes back and we never find out what happened to her, he’s likely to come back to the same territory with a new mate.""  How have E21 and E22 fared this season?  E21 and E22 have thrived under M-15's care, officially confirming since early February that the eaglets have been healthy and happy.  Over the past few months, cameras caught the eaglets as grew larger each day, escaped the clutches of predators, learned new skills from dad, and took their first leaps out of the nest.  Will any of the eagles return back next fall?  Officials are not 100% certain whether the eagles will return to the same nest but there is always a chance that M-15 will come back."

Rambo is reunited with Jalen Hurts, with whom he played at Oklahoma before transferring to Miami.  Rambo was not drafted after his record-shattering 2021 season, signing with the Carolina Panthers as an undrafted free agent. He was released at the end of the preseason and ended up with the Orlando Guardians of the XFL, where he caught 35 passes for 430 yards and 3 touchdowns.  Rambo was invited as a veteran tryout to the Eagles’ rookie minicamp last week, and he impressed enough to stick around and continue to get a look.  Conversely, Williams, who was signed to a reserve/futures deal by the Eagles back in January, will now be looking to catch on with another team. He signed with the Eagles last year after failing to get drafted, but was released right before training camp. He spent time on the Eagles’ and Lions’ practice squads.

Photo / Getty Images  Four coaching candidates, including one All Blacks assistant and another discarded last year, have emerged as the latest contenders as New Zealand’s three soon-to-be-vacant Super Rugby roles inch closer to being filled in the coming weeks.  Scott Robertson’s appointment as All Blacks head coach following this year’s World Cup set the wheels in motion for major changes at three of New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams. From next year Robertson’s All Blacks team will include Blues head coach Leon MacDonald, Hurricanes head coach Jason Holland, Crusaders assistant Scott Hansen and established national forwards mentor Jason Ryan.  As the Blues, Crusaders and Hurricanes have quickly discovered in their quest for replacements, such a cleanout leaves a limited pool to fill the looming coaching voids.  In the latest developments to the fast-moving scenario, the Herald understands All Blacks defence coach Scott McLeod, former All Blacks attack coach Brad Mooar and long-serving New Zealand sevens coach Clark Laidlaw are the leading contenders to succeed Holland at the Hurricanes next year.  The Hurricanes are now on the hunt for two coaches following the surprise, internal news that respected forwards mentor Chris Gibbes, who was considered a strong option to replace Holland next year, will leave the franchise to take a break from the game.  The Blues are thought to be considering former New Zealand Māori captain Jono Gibbes after missing out on Dave Rennie and with their next target, All Blacks assistant Joe Schmidt, not interested in assuming another head coaching role after the World Cup.  The Herald can reveal further, significant developments place the Crusaders in the throes of promoting former All Blacks openside Matt Todd to join their coaching team.  Former Crusaders flanker Matt Todd (right). Photo / Getty Images  While Robertson’s replacement remains unresolved at this point, Todd’s return to the Crusaders, where he played 140 matches, is expected to complete the six-time defending champion’s assistants alongside Dan Perrin, Tamati Ellison and James Marshall for next year.  Since finishing his playing career in Japan, Todd worked under Marty Bourke as one of four Canterbury NPC coaches last year and now is expected to assume Hansen’s defensive brief at the Crusaders.  In terms of the Hurricanes head coaching contenders McLeod, the All Blacks defence coach since 2017, is on the hunt for a new role after being forced out by Robertson’s incoming team next year.  Four months out from the World Cup, All Blacks scrum coach Greg Feek is in the same situation.  Former All Blacks midfielder McLeod boasts limited head coaching experience, having largely worked as an assistant with Waikato and the Highlanders prior to his elevation to replace Wayne Smith in the All Blacks. Guiding the Highlanders to victory over the British and Irish Lions in 2017 is McLeod’s notable head coaching achievement.  Mooar has rebounded after being let go by the All Blacks, alongside forwards coach John Plumtree, last year by joining Scotland as an attacking consultant for this year’s Six Nations. He will also link with Steve Hansen to coach the World XV against the Barbarians at Twickenham on May 29.  Former All Blacks assistant coaches Brad Mooar (left) and John Plumtree. Photo / Photosport  Mooar assisted Robertson at the Crusaders from 2016-2019 before that relationship soured and he left to lead Welsh club Scarlets. New Zealand Rugby then paid a hefty six-figure sum to buy Mooar out of his Scarlets contract in order for him to join Ian Foster’s All Blacks coaching staff in 2020, only to remove him two years later following the home series defeat to Ireland last year.  Despite his previous affiliation, the Crusaders aren’t believed to be interested in recruiting Mooar.  Laidlaw has been contemplating a full-time shift back to the XVs game for some time. The successful men’s sevens coach, who guided New Zealand to Commonwealth Games gold and Olympic silver medals during his seven-year tenure, previously worked as assistant at the Hurricanes and London Irish. The Scotsman is highly regarded by New Zealand Rugby and will assume charge of the national under-20s team for their World Cup campaign in South Africa in June.  Jono Gibbes has returned home after a six-year head coaching stint in the French Top 14 with La Rochelle and Clermont. He was abruptly sacked by Clermont in January as results deteriorated. Prior to that exit he led Irish club Ulster and Waikato but it’s his time as forwards coach with Leinster under Joe Schmidt that could prove enticing for the Blues.  While Schmidt has knocked back several head coaching inquiries due to his family commitments, and strained relationship with NZ Rugby, the vastly-experienced All Blacks assistant is believed to be open to a consultancy role next year. Attempting to revive Schmidt’s ties with Gibbes could, therefore, be the Blues’ next best option once MacDonald departs.  Vern Cotter also remains in the mix after stepping aside from leading Fiji earlier this year.  The final potentially complicating factor in the mix is the Reds targeting New Zealand coaches in their search to replace Brad Thorn for next season."

The initiative, to be launched next year, will include seven DOE laboratories. It will mimic catastrophes such as a cyberattack aimed at causing shock and chaos in a critical area or a blackout caused by a hurricane or large Western wildfire that topples power lines.  Some of the groundwork has already been created, including previous SuperLabs and a recent research platform that can share information by technical staff from the seven far-flung labs as if they were one.  One goal is to determine how to move the right mix of available clean electricity and stored power from batteries, hydrogen and hydroelectric systems to the right places.  An equivalent effort in the Pentagon would likely be called a war game. The goal of the energy exercise, as one DOE official described it, is to ensure “everyone brings their best game and we all work together.”  That hasn’t always happened. In 2017, according to a recent DOE report, the first SuperLab was too slow and suffered from “varying latency.” For another one held in 2021, the ambition was small: It focused on rapidly fixing the power problems of a small Alaskan city.  One held in January involved only two DOE labs, used a lot of simulation and lasted only an hour.  The SuperLab planned for late 2024 will be much larger.  “We’ll unlock the full potential of our national laboratories,” said Rob Hovsapian, an engineer and research lead at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  The exercise is designed to help scientists explore the capabilities and the gaps in the emerging clean energy systems, including the potential danger from natural and human-made threats. It will deal with “a large problem of national interest that no one lab could handle by themselves,” Hovsapian explained in an interview.  Hovsapian, mechanical engineer who spent the first 20 years of his career working for defense-related companies and later for the Office of Naval Research, said experts in the military and industry had begun to realize that dealing with climate change will create some new vulnerabilities.  Pulling away from gasoline and diesel fuel, for example, could eventually lead to cities with large fleets of electric vehicles that may have no place to recharge in a lengthy blackout.  “This is an international problem,” Hovsapian said, adding that the availability of wind and solar power is often far from where it's needed in crowded cities, raising the prospect that increasingly larger storms could knock out newly built distribution lines.  Hovsapian noted that U.S. cities can currently withstand long winter storms by generating heat and electricity from large fossil fuel power plants, but there will be a need to replace them with utility-scale storage facilities that are able to hold renewable energy and nuclear power.  As Hovsapian put it, the new power systems will require protections, including from cyberattacks.  “Every day, you’re coming into work knowing you are anticipating new problems that are going to happen in the future, even though it’s sometimes difficult to articulate,"" he said. ""But it’s important to create new tools and the next generation of scientists.”  Reprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC. Copyright 2023.

Ian’s 150 mph winds and heavy rains knocked out power for 2.6 million residents and caused $12.6 billion in insured losses, although the total damage it wrought was much more than a simple number value can demonstrate. From a weather perspective, the storm also brought widespread flooding across the state, and with that water, a strange visitor!  The floodwaters of Ian carried some unexpected visitors across the state of Florida: animals that were displaced from their natural habitats by the storm surge. One of them was a shark that was trapped in someone’s backyard!

Take Our Brand New A-Z-Animals Sharks Quiz  A viral video (check it out below) shows the shocking moment when a news anchor covers a clip from Florida in the wake of Hurricane Ian. The clip shows a shark swimming around in a pool that used to be a lawn, clearly out of place and confused. The shark is estimated to be a juvenile but still large enough to cause alarm. Nobody wants to see a shark in their yard, especially if they don’t even live on the coast!  The news anchor narrates the scene with disbelief as the camera zooms in on the shark’s fin as it flips around in the shallow water, clearly confused as to where it is or how it ended up there. Unfortunately, the clip ends before we see what happens to the shark.  The video has sparked a lot of reactions online, with some people expressing sympathy for the shark and others wondering how they would react if they found a shark in their backyard.  How Animals Are Impacted by Natural Disasters  Experts say that sharks can sometimes end up in flooded areas after hurricanes as they follow fish that are swept inland by the storm surge. They also say that sharks are unlikely to attack humans unless provoked or threatened. That being said, it’s important to be aware of the current conditions, for example, don’t go swimming in storm surge after a storm (for a lot of reasons).  However, they advise people to stay away from flooded areas and avoid contact with any wildlife that may have been displaced by the storm. They also urge people to report any sightings of sharks or other animals to local authorities, who can help relocate them safely.  Check Out the Clip Below!  Up Next:"

The station, at First Street and Madison Avenue, was among the many area buildings damaged by the storm's heavy rain and floods.  Mayor Ray Grabowski said the station's reopening is particularly welcomed by the nearby residents of the city's Dutch Hill section, which it serves.  ""It should mean faster response times,"" he said.  City Manager Nick Villano said the work included replacing damaged walls and raising heating and air conditioning units above the flood line. Villano said the foot-high water that passed through the station was enough to shut the building for almost two years.  The station's kitchen, bathrooms, roof and offices were upgraded, Villano said. When asked how much was spent, he deferred to the deputy fire chief, who was not available for comment.  Councilman Tony Latona said the time it took to complete the repairs was unconscionably long.  ""This is long overdue,"" he said. ""We should have gotten this open, because it is a life-safety issue.""  The city maintains a budget surplus for emergencies such as these and should have used it to get the station reopened immediately, instead of waiting for insurance money and/or FEMA funding, said Latona, a retired city firefighter. He said the city rebuilt the station in a piecemeal fashion.  A number of factors contributed to the time it took to get the station reopened. City officials said there was a wait for insurance funds, repair plans to be drawn up and the relocation of utilities, including the water heater, from the basement to a higher level where future floods won't touch them.  There was a need for a second round of bids in 2022. In the first round, the city rejected the sole bid of almost $700,000 for the work. A second bid came in last summer at $400,000, which the city accepted. Officials said the process slowed the progress.  Before the station's reopening, its engine was temporarily housed at Station 3, which is several blocks away across Main Avenue, or stored at Station 6 on Broad Street when temperatures fell below freezing.  More:Feeling healthy? It could be because a study says NJ is 10th-healthiest state  Work on the project is not yet complete. The city is in the midst of replacing the concrete apron in front of the station.  Fire Chief Frank Prezioso said that in the coming days, a new apron reinforced with rebar will be poured and will be 10 inches thick to accommodate the weight of the firetrucks. The work is expected to take three weeks to cure.  Currently, the engine is parked on the street or in a nearby lot owned by a neighbor who has agreed to let the truck park there.  Ultimately the city hopes to close both Stations 1 and 3 and replace them with a new station. In the past, the city has looked at building a new fire station on Getty Avenue that can respond to both sections in a timely manner.  Negotiations for a site have fallen through, and the city is trying to work out a deal for another site."

There are currently 140 facilities that provide reclaimed water throughout the District. As of 2021, those facilities produced 391 million gallons per day of reclaimed water flow, of which 223 million gallons per day was used for beneficial purposes throughout the region.  Water reuse is the process of taking what was once wastewater, treating and disinfecting it, then using the resulting high-quality reclaimed water for a beneficial purpose, such as golf course and landscape irrigation, groundwater recharge and industrial uses. Extensive treatment and disinfection ensure that public health and environmental quality are protected.

The couple reopened Peter’s German Ice Cream & Coffee Shop in a new downtown Fort Myers location on Monday, May 15.  “It already is like home to us,” Marika said of their charming spot on Dean Street, which was once home to Green Cup Cafe. “We did a lot of remodeling work. It flooded after the hurricane. We repainted and made minor changes. It’s cute.”  On Pine Island:New restaurant: Owner of hurricane-closed Olde Fish House is back with new venture  The Weisses originally opened their popular shop on Hendry Street in August 2021 but had to vacate in January after other plans for the space were made.  They found the Dean Street location in early February.  “I couldn’t have imagined being closed for five months,” said Marika. “It took a lot of time for everything.”  The couple came to the United States from Germany in April 2021 with one goal in mind.  “We came to work,” Marika said. “Stefan always wanted to have an ice cream shop in Florida. He loves warm weather and ice cream. He told me when we met (in 2013) that he wanted to move to Florida one day. After COVID we said, ‘Let’s go. If we don’t do it now, we never will.’”  All-natural ice cream for you and your pup  Ice cream in the U.S. is different than what they were used to.  “For us, American ice cream is very sweet,” she said. “We wanted to bring our love of food to Americans. We only use natural ingredients in everything we do. There are no artificial ingredients.”  Stefan makes 15 flavors of ice cream, with hazelnut, After Eight (mint chocolate) and mango, “Made from real mangoes,” the most popular.  There’s also an extra special flavor.  Restaurant news:Fort Myers Beach restaurant swept away by Hurricane Ian reopens in new location  “We have dog ice cream,” Marika said. “It’s liverwurst and honey. You can eat it if you really want but it’s not really good for our taste. Dogs love it. They can eat in the courtyard.”  The outdoor area is something their last location didn’t have.  “The courtyard is beautiful,” Marika said. “It is very cozy. We love it.”  Best-selling bakery, breakfast, lunch items  Returning customers will notice the familiar too.  “It’s a little smaller space but customers won’t see it,” Marika said. “It looks like before inside. The furniture is pretty much in the same place. And we didn’t change the menu so everything is the same.”  Besides Stefan’s ice cream, you’ll find breakfast, lunch and bakery items and coffee on that menu.  Apple cake, plum cake and cheesecake are best sellers ― all made with traditional German recipes.  “We had a lot of regulars come every day,” Marika said. “Offices ordered breakfast and lunch. The butter croissant with cheddar, bacon, tomato and egg is popular. The German roll, too, with liverwurst and cheese. At the moment, our bread comes directly from Germany. We plan to make it in the future.”  'Local and very good' coffee  Peter’s originally opened in the spot occupied by Java House.  “We kept their coffee,” Marika said. “We tried it and it tasted wonderful. It’s local and very good.”  She singled out the German ice coffee ― vanilla ice cream, coffee and whipped cream ― as another of the shop’s best sellers.  If you hadn’t tried Peter’s before, now’s your chance.  And Marika hopes you do.  “I would love to see all my customers and regulars,” she said. “And I would love to meet new ones in the new shop. There are such friendly people here. Everyone speaks to you. That’s not common in Germany. I think this is a better location with more people walking by. We will be happy here. That is the best wish I have.”  Note: The ice cream maker was not working when they opened Monday, May 15, so no ice cream was available. They hope to have it fixed in the next few days.

This was the promise made by Senior Meteorologist Semelka Jackman, during a BMS’ Media and Communications Workshop for media practitioners, at their Charnocks, Christ Church main offices on Monday.  Along with better communication, providing transparency will also be high on the agenda for the BMS.  Jackman told Barbados TODAY that in spite of some select cases of misleading weather information being circulated around social media by some citizens, the Barbadian public has been extremely supportive and receptive of the work being conducted by service.  She said the BMS is committed to delivering timely and relevant information through the Government Information Services and other media partners. The office hopes that this transparency helps to stamp out the circulation of fake news.  “What we realised is that if we don’t speak to the public, they don’t have anyone to listen to, so then they will just listen to anyone. If we continue to be in their faces, share what is happening, give them updates when something is coming,  “then the public receives it well… They do trust the brand that the BMS has, but we just have to make sure that we are out there.”  Monday’s workshop was used to update media houses on Impact-based forecasting – weather forecasting that includes examining the vulnerability of people and property to weather conditions and warnings of the associated impacts.  Jackman noted that given the experiences of the BMS with past whether systems, including the ‘freak storm’ which hit the island in June of 2021 and Hurricane Elsa in July of 2021, the first hurricane to hit Barbados since 1955, the service understood fully the importance of keeping communication channels open at all times in order to keep Barbadians well informed about heightened weather conditions.  The official noted that a number of redundant systems are in place between BMS and the Department of Emergency Management (DEM).  “We have a lot of backups when it comes to communicating, so in a case where something is developing, we want to make sure we can communicate with DEM if nobody else, which is why there are different avenues to communicate.  “In a worst case scenario where Barbados cannot communicate outside of the island, as it relates to meteorological aspects, then there are different countries that take over monitoring. So there are regional backup plans.”  Meanwhile, Jackman said Barbados should be on the lookout for any storm-like systems that develop off the African coast, given the level of climate change that has been seen for some time.  “Because of climate change, you see more and more of those spikes of more extreme weather. Yes, there will always be tropical storms and hurricanes, but then you might start to see the increase in those Irma’s and Maria’s {hurricanes]. That does not mean that Barbados will get hit by Irma, but it means that generally you would see more droughts happening, more peaks in those cases of extreme rainfall and high rainfall totals.”  (SB)  Read our ePaper.

William Upton, Sarasota  Don’t cut down Australian pines  Australian pines were widely planted as barriers and screens in the late 1800s in Florida. It has now been learned that their shallow root systems and heavy leaf debris overwhelm native plants. They are deemed invasive.  But keep in mind some salient points:  Hurricane Ian, in September 2022, destroyed many, many trees and understory plants.  The Gulf Coast is in a big drought now with the storm season fast approaching.  Heavy rains on barren or nearly barren land spell big erosion.  A tree, even a supposedly “invasive” one, is still a tree and better than nothing.  In other words, leave well enough alone. Don’t clear-cut!

"hurricane","2017-09-20","Not Discerned","{""SanJuan"", ""SanJuan"", ""PuertoRico""}","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvcHVlcnRvLXJpY28tYmlsbGlvbnMtZW5lcmd5LWRvbGxhcnMtMDAwOTcwMjXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en","Tue 16 May 2023 14:40:19","Environmental and community groups sued FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security last month over two grid projects, accusing them of violating the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to consider environmental harms that resulted in the rebuilding of “outdated, inefficient, and centralized fossil fuel-based electricity infrastructure.”  Congress allocated about $14 billion to federal agencies including FEMA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for Puerto Rico to address the unprecedented destruction caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017 when it roared ashore, killing almost 3,000 people and triggering blackouts that lasted nearly a year. Last September, Hurricane Fiona left thousands of residents without power for 12 days and caused intermittent outages for many others.  Climate advocates want FEMA to spend those billions on rooftop solar, storage and other forms of distributed renewable energy for communities at risk of losing power — rather than the centralized power system that was largely wiped out in 2017.  Augusta Wilson, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations involved in the lawsuit, said FEMA is on the cusp of spending billions of dollars on permanent work to rebuild Puerto Rico’s “highly unreliable” electricity grid, rather than investing in resilient projects as a viable alternative, which it “just hasn’t considered as part of its NEPA analysis.”  “FEMA’s current plans really fly in the face of the will of the people of Puerto Rico,” Wilson said.  A FEMA spokesperson declined to comment, citing a policy against speaking about active litigation. But the agency has allocated $11.4 billion to Puerto Rico’s government-owned utility, including the largest single allocation in FEMA’s history of about $9.4 billion in emergency spending after Maria to restore damaged substations, buildings, distribution lines and transmission system. As of April 20, FEMA has approved about 120 projects under the program, representing about $1.5 billion.  Jenniffer González-Colón, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress, acknowledged the complexity of dealing with multi-agency processes, coordinating participants and responsibly handling such a large pot of money. “But the reality is the people do not see it is happening fast enough,” she said.  But she also said the reconstruction of Puerto Rico’s transmission and distribution system should be a priority to stabilize the network in the near term before long-term plans can be implemented.  “Forcing agencies to go to court before work can continue only delays these processes even further, and does not provide electricity to any home or any industrial plant and puts a risk to the funding,” González-Colón said.  Development of renewable energy projects has ramped up since Fiona, but Puerto Rico is well off the pace to reach its legally binding target of 100 percent by renewables by 2050, as well as its near-term target of 40 percent by 2025, with clean energy generation still in single digits.  “What’s not making [hitting the renewable target] possible is the political will,” said Federico Cintrón Moscoso, director of El Puente Puerto Rico, another of the organizations suing FEMA.  DOE also has $1 billion available under a separate pot of funding Congress allocated for Puerto Rico in the omnibus bill last year. Six Democrats urged Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in an April letter shared with POLITICO to ensure DOE spends the money specifically on solar and storage. The DOE closed a request for information on potential projects on April 21 and expects the first awards to be announced this fall. It also plans to issue a request for proposals on deploying solar and storage for single-family homes.  Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.), one of the letter signees, said the group wants to make sure the money gets out the door in the right way and feels the DOE is “moving at a steady clip.”  One of the main reasons the Energy Department was tagged to implement the $1 billion program was because lawmakers and people in Puerto Rico wanted to avoid working with agencies associated with years-long delays in distributing funding under recovery and modernization efforts, according to the letter.  But one Congressional aide noted the letter was sent partly because of concerns from people in Puerto Rico about how Gov. Pierluisi was positioning his agencies to control the money flow — and whether they could effectively distribute the funds that are intended to provide solar power and battery storage to households with individuals with disabilities and low-income households.  “It would be hard to underestimate how problematic it would be if any of that [$1 billion] money was used to prop up fossil fuels,” the aide said.  FEMA has the ultimate decision over which projects should be supported, Wilson said. But climate advocates say the agency’s rebuilding mindset has yet to implement the Biden administration’s efforts to address the pollution that takes a disproportionate toll on communities of color, low-income areas and rural residents.  With Biden’s Earth Day order on environmental justice and his administration’s Justice40 initiative, which aims to steer 40 percent of federal benefits to communities that face the heaviest burdens from pollution, there is “a lot of public policy coming out that you would think there would be a reversal of how things are managed in FEMA, but that doesn’t seem to be the case in Puerto Rico,” said Laura Beatriz Arroyo, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, which is also involved in the FEMA litigation.  FEMA does have at least one big fan: Gov. Pierluisi. In an interview with POLITICO in March, he praised the agency’s response to Fiona and “the breathing room” FEMA has provided in helping protect the territory from future hurricanes by providing additional generation to supplement Puerto Rico’s power plants. Thanks in part to FEMA’s efforts, he said, “our grid has become more resilient.”  But he’s drawn pushback from solar energy advocates for his administration’s plan to spend $100 million in federal funds for a program that would finance up to 30 percent of the costs for middle-class homeowners to install solar and battery systems.  That effort, the governor’s office said, is “intended to ensure that all sectors have access to solar systems.” And more than $400 million, the vast majority of HUD’s Community Development Block Grant funding available for these incentives, will go to low-income families, which will also be prioritized in the DOE program, according to the statement.  Another $800 million in HUD money will fund development of community microgrids serving low- and moderate-income households throughout the territory, it said.  Solar industry players warn the proposal is having a “chilling effect” on installations because people who can afford the systems are canceling orders and waiting for the incentives for those with higher incomes to kick in. This echoes complaints often levied at these types of incentive programs on the mainland that they end up benefiting more affluent households than those most in need of government support.  One solar company executive called it a “reverse Robin Hood,” taking money that should be funding systems for the poorest residents in a territory where the median household income is just shy of $22,000. The new income threshold would make “everyone except for Bad Bunny” — the popular Puerto Rican singer and activist — eligible for the incentive, said the executive, speaking anonymously because of competitive and sensitive relationships with government officials.  A National Renewable Energy Laboratory study last year identified 203,000 “solar suitable” households in Puerto Rico in the very low-income category. In non-metro areas such as the municipality of Salinas, which was devastated when Hurricane Fiona dropped 32 inches of rain, a very low-income household is tagged as a family of four that makes about $12,300.  “There’s not enough money to go around for that [lower] income category so there’s very little sense for going off that bracket,” said Javier Rúa-Jovet, chief policy officer of the Solar + Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico.  Charles Venator-Santiago, associate professor in the University of Connecticut’s Department of Political Science and El Instituto: Institute for Latina/o, Caribbean and Latin American Studies, noted Pierluisi is running for reelection next year — and said it “wouldn’t surprise me if some middle-income residents are selected to receive these funds” for political reasons.  Cintrón Moscoso said the governor and local agencies are obstacles to the territory’s renewable energy transition, controlling the flow of the money with limited transparency and public participation.  “Right now, I don’t see anyone in the government that is fighting for renewable energy in a very serious way … and that is very worrisome.”"

Proximity to the beach, ocean vibes, sunsets that seem filtered and a less pressure-cooked atmosphere contribute to the allure. But this flocking to the shore comes with risk and potential costs.  As Americans concentrate homes and businesses along the coasts, we concentrate the insurance risk in those areas vulnerable to sea-level rise, flooding and super storms. In no state is this more apparent right now than Florida, where more than a dozen insurance companies have cut their losses and moved out of the state, concentrating the already concentrated risk on even fewer companies.  The storms are expensive to the insurance companies, but it’s homeowners who pay the ultimate cost.  Massive payouts due to natural disasters like Hurricane Ian have left Floridians paying on average $4,200 per year for homeowners insurance. This is compared to the $1,500 average for the rest of the country. Floridians are left with fewer options, more expensive premiums and gut-wrenchingly small payouts that don’t begin to cover the cost of damages wrought by Hurricane Ian, the costliest storm to hit the state and second-most costly to hit the U.S. after Hurricane Katrina.  Many Floridians have had to switch to the state-run company, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., an entity created in 2002 as an insurer of last resort for those who couldn’t find coverage in the private market. Their policies have more than doubled in the last two years and now account for 13% of the state market.  Just in case the reader doubts the connection between insurance premiums and climate change, note that insurance companies are pricing in the risk. Their actuaries apparently all agree that climate change poses significant risk.  If they didn’t, perhaps a climate-change-disputing insurance company could cut their premiums and thereby pick up a whole lot of business in Florida. No company is pursuing that strategy. It’s pretty solid proof that the insurance industry is convinced that climate change is real.  The numbers make the case. Privately insured losses in Florida due to Hurricane Ian are estimated at $46-67 billion. Federal flood insurance claims have mounted to $10 billion. Of course, these insurance payouts have come only after homeowners have fulfilled their deductibles. And a new hurricane season is about to start.  It’s easy to highlight the problem, less easy to solve it. We can harden infrastructure and prepare for storms. Most logically, we should also reduce the risk of future sea level by innovating away from the fuels that cause warming. After all, rises in sea level are compounding the hurricane losses.  Another nearer-term solution: Make some sites uninsurable. Build a McMansion on a barrier island if you like, but don’t expect it to be insurable. If you lose it; you lose it. This would make insurance more affordable for people building more modest homes in less disaster-prone locations.  We’ve taken out “insurance policies” on environmental risks in the past, and those policies have paid off. In 1985, a junior scientist noticed something peculiar. Jonathan Shanklin was a researcher at British Antarctic Survey when he found what he first thought was an anomaly; inputting a backlog of data, he discovered that the ozone layer, which he presumed would be the same year after year, had started thinning. He shared his findings with the scientific community, who raised the alarms. Something urgent and effective needed to be done globally about ozone-depleting substances.  That’s when two conservative leaders shined. U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan decided to act. Prime Minister Thatcher was a research chemist. President Reagan had been persuaded by his secretary of state, the late George Shultz, that it made sense to “buy an insurance policy” against the risk posed by the ozone hole.  Shultz told Reagan that it wasn’t 100% certain, but that there was clearly a risk. That risk, Shultz said, need an insurance policy. The result was the Montreal Protocol, the popular and effective international treaty, ratified in 1987, that continues to this day to repair the ozone hole.  It’s too late to buy fire insurance when your house is on fire or when a hurricane is bearing down. It’s not too late, though, to address climate change and to tame the forces that are creating the more expensive storms. That’s an environmental policy that would ultimately have an impact on Floridian’s insurance policies.  Former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis (R-South Carolina, 1993-1999 and 2005-2011) is the executive director of republicEn.org, a community of conservatives who care about climate change. Inglis will be speaking May 17 to the Rotary Club of Hialeah-Miami Springs and May 18 to the Rotary Club of Coral Gables. This opinion piece was originally published by The Invading Sea."

Tkachuk has played 359 games with the Ottawa Senators since they took him with the No. 4 pick and he has 125-150-275 totals to lead all players from that year’s draft in both goals and points. The rugged, 6-foot-4, 211-pound left-winger also leads all players from that draft in penalty minutes with 493 and is now captain of the Senators.  The 23-year-old Tkachuk would have been a perfect linemate for Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki, 23, and Cole Caufield, 22, for the foreseeable future.  Meanwhile, life in Carolina has been pretty good for Kotkaniemi since the Hurricanes acquired him from the Canadiens with an offer sheet during the summer of 2021. As compensation, the Canadiens received a first-round pick at the 2022 NHL Draft, which they then traded to the Arizona Coyotes along with a second-round pick in 2024 in exchange for Christian Dvorak.  While the Canadiens and Senators both missed the playoffs this season, Kotkaniemi and the Hurricanes are in the Eastern Conference final with Game 1 against the Florida Panthers slated for Thursday in Carolina (8 p.m., CBC, SN, TVA Sports).  Kotkaniemi, 22, played all 82 games with the Hurricanes this season, posting 18-25-43 totals and a plus-10 differential while averaging 14:44 of ice time and winning 51.4 per cent of his faceoffs. In the last 22 regular-season games, he had 7-11-18 totals. In 11 playoff games, Kotkaniemi has 3-3-6 totals and it was his shot on a power play that teammate Jesper Fast deflected in for a 3-2 OT win over the New Jersey Devils in Game 5 for the Hurricanes to clinch their second-round series.  The Hurricanes paid a big price to get Kotkaniemi, offering him a one-year offer sheet worth US$6.1 million after he had scored only five goals and added 15 assists in 56 games the previous season with the Canadiens. After being made a healthy scratch for Game 5 of the 2021 Stanley Cup final — which the Lightning won 1-0 to clinch the championship — Kotkaniemi was probably looking for a road out of Montreal and the Hurricanes were willing to pave one for him.  The $20 signing bonus that came with the Hurricanes’ offer sheet to Kotkaniemi was an obvious shot at former Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin for the five-year, US$42.27-million offer sheet he gave Hurricanes centre Sebastian Aho — who wears No. 20 — during the summer of 2019. Hurricanes billionaire owner Tom Dundon was willing to match the offer that had US$38.62 million in signing-bonus money, including US$20 million in the first 12 months.  Aho, 25, had 36-31-67 totals in 75 games this season and has 5-5-10 totals in 11 playoff games.  Hurricanes GM Don Waddell insists the offer sheet for Kotkaniemi wasn’t payback for Aho, noting he had tried unsuccessfully to make a trade with the Canadiens to get Kotkaniemi before making the offer sheet. The Hurricanes now have the No. 2 (Andrei Svechnikov) and No. 3 picks from the 2018 draft and they also have former Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty after acquiring him from the Vegas Golden Knights last summer.  The Hurricanes have advanced to the conference final without having Svechnikov or Pacioretty in the lineup. Svechnikov tore the ACL in his right knee during a game in March and Pacioretty tore the Achilles tendon on his right leg for the second time in January. Pacioretty suffered the same injury during training last summer and after returning to the lineup he scored three goals in five games before tearing his Achilles again.  “It certainly was not revenge,” Waddell said about acquiring Kotkaniemi. “We talked about this player, we know this player. We had an opportunity to use the CBA as other teams have in the past to try to acquire a 21-year-old player. To us it was all about the player. We looked around the league and thought this made the most sense from where we are as a team. As you know, we have a couple of other good Finnish players on our team and thought this would be a great fit.”  Kotkaniemi is now looking like a very good fit with the Hurricanes, who have him locked up through the 2029-30 season with an eight-year, US$38.560-million contract that has an annual salary-cap hit of $4.82 million. Hurricanes head coach Rod Brind’Amour said Kotkaniemi has impressed him with his two-way play, adding he still has room to grow and that he is just “scratching the surface.”  One has to wonder if things might have been different for Kotkaniemi’s development in Montreal if he had Martin St. Louis as head coach instead of Claude Julien and Dominique Ducharme.  After Kotkaniemi scored the winning goal in a 4-3 shootout victory over the Canadiens at the Bell Centre on March 7 , I asked him if he ever wonders what it might have been like to play for St. Louis.  “Not for a second,” he said. “I’m happy where I am right now. I really love my life in Raleigh. I love this group. We have a great group of guys and everything is working out really well so far.”  [email protected]  twitter.com/StuCowan1  Related  Copyright Postmedia Network Inc., 2023"

While they’re important and necessary, there may come a day in the not-too-distant future when they stop working because the ocean will keep rising and eventually, it becomes too expensive to keep adapting over and over.  That brings us to a very complicated and controversial climate change solution, but one that most climate scientists feel is inevitable: managed retreat.  We know that chaotic retreat happens after big disasters like Hurricane Irma, but managed retreat is trying to get out ahead of the problem.  ""We are going to lose land to climate change impacts, whether its sea level rise where the land just goes underwater, to flood plains that expand as a result of rain bombs dropping so much water at once,"" said Alice Hill, who worked in the Obama administration and is an expert on managed retreat.  Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.  A.R. Siders, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware, has been researching managed retreat for years.  “The general principles behind a managed retreat, what would make it different from chaotic retreat, are really having agency over the choice, so making it feel like people who are retreating making it feel like this is a choice for them,"" Siders said.  Retreat may seem like something in the distant future, but as University of Miami professor Katharine Mach told NBC6, it’s already happening.  “We look to the Netherlands as one of the greatest examples of feats of engineering to manage water and river systems from rainfall, low-lying agricultural areas, but in these processes, where there's been a lot of engineering, there also has been a real emphasis on making room for the river,"" Mach said. ""So restoring the banks of a river, such that when it floods, natural flood plains can help absorb that water.""  New Orleans is one of the most vulnerable cities on the planet when it comes to sea level rise, but it's actually the unprotected bayous south of the Crescent City that are disappearing at a shocking rate. Isle De Jean Charles, once home to 300 families, has shrunk by 98% since 1995 because of the rising Gulf Of Mexico.  In 2016, the Louisiana Office of Community Development won a $48 million grant to relocate the residents 40 miles north to a brand new town with brand new homes and brand new infrastructure, appropriately called The New Isle.  Building 100 new homes is certainly a good start, but what about the thousands of other people living in Louisiana right now that will be underwater in the coming years?  Managed retreat is happening much closer to home in the Florida Keys. In parts 4 and 5 of our 5-part series, we’ll take a look at why the Keys are so vulnerable to sea-level rise, show how adaptations and retreat are both happening right now and ultimately ask the question: Is it too late to save the Florida Keys?"

Tremors and aftershocks were felt in Syria and the region. Just two weeks later, another earthquake struck southern Türkiye. These earthquakes have claimed nearly 60,000 lives and caused untold destruction to homes and infrastructure.  One hundred days later, the full scale of the devastation from the earthquakes is still being uncovered. Many people living in the earthquake zones who had previously lost their homes because of the Syrian conflict must now rebuild completely, a process which could take years.  In the immediate aftermath of the earthquakes, Airbnb.org (a US-based nonprofit) stepped up to offer assistance and financial support to UNHCR teams in Türkiye to help book short-term accommodation for refugees displaced by the disaster.  To talk about this partnership — and more broadly about the work Airbnb.org is doing to help those displaced find temporary housing — we spoke with Moli Dow, the Response and Partnerships Manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Airbnb.org.  USA for UNHCR: Moli, could you tell us how Airbnb first became involved in providing temporary housing for people that have been forced to flee their homes?  Moli Dow: Sure. It all started in 2012 after New York was hit by Hurricane Sandy. An Airbnb Host in Brooklyn named Shell contacted Airbnb and asked if she could offer her place for free to people who had to evacuate. The Airbnb team thought it was an amazing idea and worked long hours to make it an option for other Hosts as well. After that, over 1,000 Hosts made their homes free for evacuees. Since then, Airbnb founded Airbnb.org, an independent nonprofit organization that responds to humanitarian crises as well as other natural disasters. We've provided support for wildfire evacuees in Australia, hurricane evacuees in the Americas, asylum seekers across Latin America, frontline workers during the pandemic, more than 20,000 refugees from Afghanistan in 2021, and nearly 130,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine since the start of the conflict. So far, we have helped well over 250,000 people find temporary housing through these programs.  USA for UNHCR: When and why did you start working with USA for UNHCR?  Moli Dow: UNHCR has been a longtime collaborator with Airbnb and now Airbnb.org. In 2016, Airbnb launched a donation campaign to raise funds for UNHCR, matching contributions from the Airbnb community and helping to raise over $1.6 million to support refugees globally. We have always valued UNHCR teams’ willingness to share key intelligence and guidance about housing needs on the ground, as well as your expertise in providing disaster relief and temporary housing. Our partnership is rooted in collaboration and information sharing.  Over the past couple of years, our teams have been discussing how our organizations can further optimize our work together, including exploring how USA for UNHCR could utilize Airbnb.org to expand housing support. This meant we were already set up to respond when the earthquakes in Türkiye struck.  USA for UNHCR: Great segue! Could you talk a bit about your response to the crisis in Türkiye and Syria?  Moli Dow: As I mentioned, both sides were prepped and ready to discuss how we could work together to respond to this crisis so we could mobilize quickly, which was great. I think one of the main reasons Airbnb.org wanted to support USA for UNHCR, particularly for this crisis, was because your work aligned so well with our diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility commitments. Following the earthquakes, we've been supporting both local and refugee populations with many coming from vulnerable, marginalized backgrounds. We wanted to make sure we partnered with international, national and local organizations that share our commitment to equity and are proactively focusing on these populations to supplement the government’s efforts. This is a key reason Airbnb.org provided a grant to USA for UNHCR to fund short term accommodation for refugees.  USA for UNHCR: What’s next for Airbnb.org?  Moli Dow: Right now, we’re working to improve accessibility alongside diversity, equity, and inclusion in all that we do, embedding equity centered-design methods into our work and our organization. This includes partnering with more community-based organizations and nonprofits that share our commitment to equity, like USA for UNHCR, as well as working with leading diversity and equity experts to help assess and improve our work.  We’re really excited to continue to learn and grow from our partnerships, particularly our partnership with you. The earthquake response in Türkiye is the first time our teams will be directly working together to support housing for refugees, and we anticipate many opportunities to expand this collaboration, including our work focused on supporting asylum seekers in other parts of the world.  USA for UNHCR: What advice would you have for other organizations that are considering supporting refugees, whether it’s working directly with USA for UNHCR or other partner organizations?  Moli Dow: Internationally, refugee resettlement schemes are at a really important inflection point. In this climate, Airbnb.org is prioritizing finding and working with organizations – like UNHCR – who are embracing new models, programs and innovations to meet rising needs. Equally, we think it's paramount that organizations work with partners who put the safety and critical wrap-around support of refugees first.  For years, I have watched how tirelessly USA for UNHCR has advocated for refugees around the world. You expertly navigate ever changing and challenging political climates, and it's a complicated world out there!  USA for UNHCR: Finally, how can people get involved in supporting Airbnb.org's mission?  Moli Dow: People can get involved by signing up to be an Airbnb.org Host and offering their space for free or at a discount during times of crisis. They can also donate directly to Airbnb.org to support our work.  Interested in helping refugees build a better future?  Email partnerships@usaforunhcr.org to learn more about how your company, organization or foundation can partner with USA for UNHCR."

The San Jose Sharks traded Burns in the summer to the Carolina Hurricanes. Carolina provides Burns with another chance to experience playoff hockey. But for Carolina and Burns, the benefits are a two-way street.  Brent Burns Providing a Boost to the Carolina Hurricanes in the Playoffs  Carolina was in need of a top-pairing offensive defenceman after failing to reach an agreement for an extension with Anthony DeAngelo this past offseason. This came after top pairing defenceman Dougie Hamilton left the year before in free agency to sign with the New Jersey Devils. Instead of signing a free agent like John Klingberg, the Hurricanes made a trade for veteran defenceman Brent Burns. And the Hurricanes got what they were looking for and more. Both in the regular season and the playoffs.  The Trip to Carolina  Almost as soon as Burns found out he was traded to Carolina, he made his way across the country to start working out with head coach Rod Brind’Amour. While it was bittersweet to leave the Sharks, Burns was excited to join the Hurricanes and had that nervous energy again playing with a new team.  Drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the first round of the 2003 NHL Draft, Burns is a six-foot five inch, two hundred and thirty pounds offensive defenceman. Over his career, he has scored 245 goals and 593 assists and won the Norris Trophy as the league’s best defenceman in the 2016-17 season. He is known for his versatility as he started out playing both forward and defence. However, at 38 years old, his ironman ability also stands out. While he may be slightly past his prime playing ability, his relentless work ethic and top physical shape makes him a force on the ice and a top pairing defenceman.  Burns Settling in on the Top Pair  This season in Carolina, Burns stepped right in beside defensive defenceman Jaccob Slavin on the team’s top defensive pair. With Slavin’s elite defensive ability, Burns utilized his skating and offensive ability more freely. In doing so, he broke a Hurricanes record for points by a defenceman after getting 18 goals and 43 assists for 61 points in 82 games.  After Shayne Gotisbehere, Burns was second on the team in expected goals and goals scored above expected. Likewise, he was second in Corsi and Fenwick while having 2.73 expected goals against. Where Burns really stood head and shoulders above the rest though was his on-ice goal differential at 34 and on-ice expected goals differential at 43.9. He averaged 23.2 minutes per game of ice time and played in all situations. This included quarterbacking the first power play unit and killing penalties. While Hamilton was extremely productive offensively for New Jersey, Burns provided the Hurricanes with both the offence and all-around play they needed during the regular season.  Production in the Playoffs  This postseason, the Hurricanes are largely finding their strength in their team game. Jordan Martinook had an outstanding round two but no one player has consistently been carrying the team all playoffs. With that said, Brent Burns’ playoffs production has been a huge boost to the Hurricanes. Carrying over from the regular season, Burns leads all Hurricanes defencemen in points and assists and is tied for the lead in goals. His goal differential is second only to Slavin. He also leads in expected goals with 1.2, expected goals percentage, expected goal differential and Fenwick. Burns’ high Fenwick score is notable as it shows his unique ability to find a way to get shots through and on the net.  For all defencemen in the playoffs, Burns is in the top ten for goals, assists and points. He is fourth in expected goals and expected goal differential and top ten in Fenwick and expected goals percentage. Essentially, when it comes to defencemen generating offense in the playoffs, Burns is at the top. While Burns’ offensive numbers paint one side of the picture, even his expected goals against has him in the top 20 while his goal differential puts him at fifth.  The advanced metrics show the same for the Burns Slavin pairing through 11 playoff games as they rank near the top for goals percentage, Fenwick, and xGoals % amongst defensive pairs playing at least 100 minutes this postseason. Much has been said about the impressive play of Slavin, but the addition of Burns has bumped the top pairing’s production from last postseason to this. In all of these categories mentioned above, the pairing of Slavin-Burns in 11 games has exceeded last year’s top pairing of Slavin-DeAngelo in 14 games. As much as Slavin allows Burns to play a more freewheeling game, the metrics show Burns’ playoff production has benefited Slavin as well.  Burns’ Off-Ice Intangibles Providing an X Factor in the Playoffs  The statistics are important to quantify most of the conclusions regarding Burns’ playoff play. But to look beyond the production, Burns brings the Hurricanes a certain element that is hard to replicate. Burns is a colorful character. He is a giant defenceman with a large beard, tatoos and some missing teeth. His backpack is always ready to go with an assortment of random items. But more notably he always has a smile on his face. He seems to love life and that shows in his game play.  At 38 years old, he is a mentor to not only the younger players, but most of the team. Leading by example by being a workhorse in the gym and on the ice, age is just a number to Burns. He also consistently has teammates over for barbeques and has acclimated to life in Raleigh as his kid plays youth hockey with Brind’Amour’s and ex-Hurricane Justin Williams‘ kids.  These intangibles are character traits that you cannot quantify in a trade value. But they are just as, if not more, important than how many goals he can score. For a team with high playoff expectations but significant injuries, it takes more than a stat sheet to overcome that adversity. The Hurricanes team game has shined in the playoffs so far but that does not happen without players like Burns providing some glue. Brind’Amour has repeatedly stated how fantastic Burns has been this year. Not only as a player but as a person.  Burns on the Ice is Exciting as Off the Ice  Meanwhile, watching Burns on the ice is also a treat. To start with his skating, he is deceptively good to be so large. Defensively he uses his big frame and large reach to break players off the puck. He is not afraid to use his size to push players around and throw some hits. Many times, he is skating backwards with a forward quickly approaching. It looks the forward is about to beat him, but he somehow turns around to break up the play.  Then take a look at Burns running the point in the offensive zone. He walks the blueline as well as almost any defenceman right now not named Cale Makar. He then finds an opening to boom his monster shot through, either finding the back of the net or getting a tip or rebound. But let’s say not much is happening from the point. Then you see Burns turn on the jets and put his hands in motion. The six foot five defenceman dangles his way to the net and drives in to slide the puck into the net or make a play. Burns creates significant challenges for other teams to analyze how to handle him.  Brent Burns Versatility a Game Changer for Carolina  As the stats and narrative show, Burns is not simply a one-dimensional player. While he is more offensive in nature, he is good in all three zones. Burns can produce on the power play and kill penalties. He can break up a play and move the puck quickly in transition. He can score from the point and deke his way past the goalie. The Hurricanes only gave up forward Steven Lorentz, goalie prospect Eetu Makiniemi, and a third-round pick in the 2023 NHL Draft to receive Burns. San Jose also retained part of his salary in that trade. This has been a home run acquisition for Carolina. The Hurricanes are a team looking to bind together and keep pushing for the Stanely Cup. Burns provides an electric, multi-dimensional player to Carolina that could be a significant piece to the puzzle missing last year.  Main Photo: James Guillory-USA TODAY Sports"

Enjoy this free story!  A popular snack shop in Aiea shut down Monday after 20 years of serving the community with yummy treats. Read more  A popular snack shop in Aiea shut down Monday after 20 years of serving the community with yummy treats.  Samurai Snacks Aiea LLC, at the Aiea Shopping Center, initially planned to close next week, but once the store Friday announced on Instagram its plans to close May 24, customers flocked to the store throughout the weekend and Monday for its soft-serve ice cream, freshly popped popcorn and other goodies.  A steady stream of customers lined up in front of the store at lunchtime Monday waiting to enter Samurai Snacks to purchase treats.  Walls once covered with an assortment of snacks were bare, with only a few racks left of colored puff rice, shoyu peanuts and other goodies.  The store’s display freezer was nearly empty at 12:30 p.m., with only a dozen yuzu-flavored Hawaiian Frost frozen dairy cups left. Other flavors such as chocolate haupia, lychee, honeydew melon, chocolate banana, Kona coffee and mango had sold out.  Many customers, such as 21-year-old Justin Deuz of Salt Lake, left the store carrying a cup of soft serve in their hands.  Deuz, who has been a loyal customer since he was a child, stopped by the store one last time Monday for Samurai Snacks’ vanilla and strawberry swirl soft serve, a customer favorite. The store has been here for so long, and now it’s going to be gone, Deuz said.  Once all of the store’s products sold out, Samurai Snacks Aiea permanently closed at 2 p.m. Monday.  Running a small business has been tough in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Mari Kimoto, daughter of owners Chris and Marlo Kimoto.  “My mom and dad has worked really hard behind the scenes,” Mari Kimoto said.  Staff shortages, inflation, supply chain issues and minimum wage and rent increases were among the reasons that led the store owners to make the tough decision to close.  Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii, said small mom-and-pop businesses can’t compete with large stores and hotels that are able to pay their employees more.  “They don’t have national backing,” Yamaki said. “So the single mom-and-pop stores, they really suffer.”  The Kimotos acquired the snack shop 20 years ago from previous owner Glenn Yamamoto.  “My parents bought this when I was 1 year old,” Kimoto said. “I’ve just grown up with this business.” The Kimoto family said they are grateful for all of their customers’ and vendors’ support. “Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the support and aloha that we’ve had for the past 20 years,” Kimoto said Monday.  Samurai Snacks Aiea was the sole franchise store of Samurai Inc., a Kalihi factory on Umi Street that manufactures snack products sold at supermarkets and stores in Hawaii.  While the factory has a small walk-up window where it primarily sells soft serve and popcorn, the Aiea snack shop carried a large variety of snacks that included snacks from other vendors.  Roz Funakoshi, vice president of Samurai Inc., said, “Samurai Kalihi would like to say mahalo nui loa for 20 years of partnership. The people of Hawaii have lost another precious treasure.”  “There are no words to express how saddened we are of their closing, but we understand it well,” Funakoshi said. “We wish the Kimoto ohana the very best in their future endeavors.”"

Now it has set its sights on space.  The company recently launched Tomorrow-R1, what it claims is the world's first commercially built weather-radar satellite, via SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. There are very few atmospheric radars orbiting the earth currently, and all were built by government agencies. The U.S. has one, operated by NASA.  Tomorrow.io used proprietary software not just to predict but also to help companies plan for severe weather. The information it used came from government radar, data satellites, weather stations, cellular signal attenuation, and even connected vehicles with wiper and temperature sensors — what its CEO and co-founder, Shimon Elkabetz, called the ""weather of things.""  The new radar satellite, however, will offer a much broader scope of data.  ""We're going to create a significant revolution when it comes to weather forecasting and climate modeling and be able to help the National Hurricane Center hopefully have better hurricane forecasting and help insurance companies insure farmers in India and Brazil, and help airlines fly from JFK to London in a much safer route and by wasting less fuel,"" said Elkabetz.  The NASA radar satellite has a lag time of three days or more for its information, simply due to distance and how often it passes over the U.S. Local ground radar, which is what Americans usually see on the local news, is not available in all locations. In fact, most of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, India, and many other places lack radar coverage. Moreover, land-based radar doesn't cover specific mountainous regions in the U.S., nor does it extend over the ocean. That makes it harder for coastal regions to get accurate storm predictions.  Satellites could provide coverage to billions more people.  Elkabetz said the company intends to launch more than two dozen of its own satellites over the next two years. In combination with sensor microwave technology, he says this will create a 'constellation' of weather monitoring systems that will be able to sample every point on earth, nearly every hour.  ""We're putting our own designed and manufactured radar on a dedicated satellite, and we're putting many of these out there in a combination with another sensor microwave sounder that is going to put be put on another satellite,"" he explained. ""The combination of the two together will create a global real-time precipitation map that will basically cover every point on Earth in close to real time.""  Major clients now include several airlines, such as Delta , United , and JetBlue . In a case study done in 2021, JetBlue found that Tomorrow.io let it understand when a storm would stop, helping it limit unnecessary delays and cancellations, saving its operations team as much as $50,000 per month per hub.  Other clients include Fox Sports, Uber , Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft , and the U.S. Air Force.  Tomorrow.io has been awarded more than $20 million in U.S. Defense Department contracts and is executing a collaborative research and development agreement with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, according to a press release."

Ever since he came into the series against the Boston Bruins in relief in Game 3, he’s been a saving grace for the Panthers, backing them to a comeback series win against the Bruins, and then looking tough to beat against the Toronto Maple Leafs’ superstars. He’s rocking a solid .918 save percentage in the postseason, but more impressive is his 8.62 5v5 goals saved above expected, which leads all remaining goaltenders by more than three goals.  Florida Panthers writer George Richards joined Tyler Yaremchuk and Frank Seravalli on Daily Faceoff Live to talk about how important Bobrovsky has been to this Panthers team on their surprising run, and whether or not this will continue.  George Richards: We’re going to find that out! This is the first time he’s ever been in a Conference Final as a starting goaltender. The furthest he ever got was the year that Columbus surprisingly swept Tampa Bay back in 2019, so this is as far has he’s ever come, so we’re going to find out.  Florida’s obviously playing some pretty good defense in front of him, clearing out some pucks, something that they haven’t always done, so he’s getting a little more defensive support than what he’s been used to in the past.  And he seems just like a guy that’s just in the moment. We haven’t really seen this side of Sergei Bobrovsky, it just feels a little different with him. He’s given all the praise to his teammates and talked about what a privilege it is just to be here and all that stuff, and then he goes out and he makes 45 saves, so he’s been terrific for them.  I don’t know what we can say. His 10 goals saved above expected, he’s just been great, especially in the Toronto series, and he came up clutch for Florida in the Boston series winning Game 5 with 44 saves in an elimination game for the Panthers. So, if not for Bob, the Panthers wouldn’t be here.  You can watch the full episode here…"

Originally from Brazil, Camargo studied physics at the University of São Paulo before venturing to Germany to earn her PhD from the Technical University of Munich and conduct research at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics. After several years studying plasma physics, Camargo made the bold decision to move to New York City and join Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society in 1999. Camargo began her work with a project on hurricanesーa project she thought might last a year or so. The rest is history, she says. More than 20 years later, Camargo’s main research focus is still hurricanes.  Suzana Camargo currently teaches “Sustainability in the Face of Natural Disasters” in the M.S. in Sustainability Science program, offered by the School of Professional Studies in partnership with the Columbia Climate School.  Did you always know you were interested in atmospheric sciences? How have your past experiences shaped your research interests?  Growing up, I always loved mathematics. Then, as a teenager I got interested in programming, which was quite novel at the time. In a family with many engineers, engineering seemed the natural pathway, but it didn’t seem a good fit for me, so I ended up studying physics. All my degrees (BSc, MSc, PhD) are in physics, which gave me a great foundation to explore many different areas. All my research starting as an undergraduate, throughout my PhD and postdoc, and until a position as an early career professor in Brazil, was in plasma physics — in particular, turbulence in plasma physics. Thanks to that, I had expertise in fluid dynamics, programming, modeling, and turbulence. This skill set made it possible to transition to research in atmospheric sciences and climate when I started at Columbia University.  What made you transition from researching plasma physics to atmospheric sciences?  I started working at Columbia University in 1999. At that time, the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) was just starting and they gave me an opportunity to work there and start doing climate research. The transition between fields was not easy, as I had a lot to learn, whereas I was already an established scientist in plasma physics. But, it was the optimal choice for my family, given that we decided to move to the US and at the time, there were significant cuts in plasma physics, which made it impossible for me to find a position in my original field. After a year at IRI, I started working on a project on hurricanes, thinking that would be my focus for a year or so. The rest is history, as they say. More than 20 years later, my main research focus is still hurricanes. It’s a fascinating topic and I have enjoyed researching topics that are directly relevant for society.  You joined Columbia in 1999. How has your research focus changed over the years?  The first project that I led in this field was to develop a seasonal forecast for tropical cyclones (hurricanes, typhoons) using climate models. With time, I expanded my focus to work on the influence of climate on tropical cyclones on different time-scales, from subseasonal (2-4 weeks) to longer-term climate change, including even paleoclimatology. I have also been involved in studying other extreme events (e.g. precipitation), various climate phenomena, such as monsoons, and even the influence of volcanoes on climate. In the last few years, our group has been focusing on climate risk, including not only the hazards, but also taking into account social vulnerability and economic impacts.  You are an academic ambassador of the American Meteorological Society Committee for Hispanic and Latinx Advancement (CHALA) committee since 2021. Could you share a bit more about this group’s mission and your involvement?  As I am originally from Brazil, it’s important to me to be sure that Hispanic and Latinx scientists are represented and supported in the US. I also like to keep up my connections with Brazilian scientists and make sure to interact with them in conferences. Therefore, it was a natural fit to participate in the CHALA Board on Representation, Accessibility, Inclusion, and Diversity as an academic ambassador. This committee has been doing amazing work, such as helping create Spanish weather translation resources, so that the US Weather Service can issue weather advisories in English and Spanish languages easily, which is very important given the large US Spanish-speaking population. I am a co-author with some other members of the CHALA committee on the first paper analyzing the statistics on the current population of Latinx students in US academic institutions that offer programs in atmospheric sciences. There is a lot of work to be done to attract more Latinx studies to this field!  Why should students take your course? What will they take away from the course?  “Sustainability in the Face of Natural Disasters” provides students with the foundation of many aspects of disasters, giving special focus to understanding the hazards that cause them, but also discussing other important aspects, such as disaster preparedness and response. I hope that the students will feel ready to analyze the level of risk due to different hazards that could affect them, in particular if questions arise on their job. I hope they will also feel prepared to make important decisions regarding risk in their own lives, from where they decide to live to whether they should evacuate due to the occurrence of a hurricane."

West End, once home to a number of famous waterfront restaurants and bars, had most of its commercial space wiped out by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  The city has hoped to redevelop the site on the water just west of West End Park where the restaurants once sat. But public officials are sorting through a myriad of ownership issues and persistent problems slowing West End redevelopment plans.  Three years ago, officials from Jefferson and Orleans parishes formed a working group to try to move plans forward, but redevelopment remains stalled.  New Orleans City Councilman Joe Giarrusso is putting forward an amendment to change the zoning of a portion of West End, currently zoned as S-LM. The area includes the boathouses encircling West End Park and surrounding the New Orleans Yacht Harbor and New Orleans Marina, as well as the chunk of land where the restaurants once stood.  “Residents have expressed concern for a long time about whether or not there’s something separate going on, like some huge housing development,” Giarrusso. “This meeting tonight is to tell residents that this is not the focus of the project, to eliminate all of the housing that would be here except for the boathouses, and just get feedback primarily about that.”  Giarrusso’s amendment would have to be sent to the City Planning Commission (CPC), which would then make a recommendation and send it back to the council.  If approved, it would disallow all condos, apartments and townhomes, only allowing boathouses going forward.  “I don’t wake up in the morning thinking about how I can build a condo high-rise, that isn’t the reason for doing that,” he said. “This has been a place where people recreate in the past, where we had restaurants, where they really communed. I just want to make sure we’re returning that sense of New Orleans to something that’s been fallow since Katrina.”  During a meeting Tuesday night at the New Orleans Yacht Club, Giarrusso fielded questions from a number of residents about what is planned for the site.  He said, at the moment, redevelopment is stalled until the outcome of the November elections in Jefferson Parish.  Part of the land is owned by Jefferson Parish, a small sliver just north and west of the 17th Street Pumping Station.  “We saw that people really do want a place to come in, enjoy a walk, be a bit more quiet,” said nearby resident Charles Marsala. “This idea that it’s going to be housing, no housing, is not really long-term. Whereas if we go back to park, we can do what you do in parks: Have pickleball, have a bike path.”  See a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.

Coleman announced his decision on his birthday. The Seminoles beat out Ole Miss for Coleman's services.  He is ranked as the No. 23 overall transfer and No. 4 wide receiver in the transfer portal. He was among the top available transfers at the time of his commitment. FSU now has five commitments from transfers ranked among the 25 best available in this cycle by 247Sports.com.  Prior to making his decision, Coleman took an official visit to both the Seminoles and the Rebels. He was at FSU during the weekend of May 5th. Later that week, he made his way to Oxford to check out Ole Miss.  After his visit to FSU, he spoke exclusively with Noles247 and shared why FSU was his first stop.  ""Because I wanted to see what they was about,"" Coleman said back on May 8th. ""I wanted to give them the chance for sure because they were a place I was really looking into out of high school. Great coaches. They had a great year. And you know, they have a system with a great quarterback in Jordan Travis, and another receiver in Johnny Wilson and a lot of other key pieces. They have 88-89% of the team coming back as a whole, not just offense, but that is defense, too. So they are a complete team. I feel and they feel like they are one piece away.""  After spending 48 hours around the program, Coleman was impressed.  ""Great visit,"" Coleman said. ""Straight-forward coaching . Seeing the campus. Seeing what they have to offer. Learning about the playbook, what they have offense, how they scheme things up to give me the ball and the next level to winning. They want me to help them take the program to the next level which they feel is a national championship.""  FSU head coach Mike Norvell was heavily involved in the visit for Coleman.  ""Just straight up guy,"" Coleman said of Norvell. ""He let me know it's bigger than just football here, you know, it's about the community, it's about all of the things that matter, but on the field he is going to push you as hard as he can. Every single day you're going to get his best because he's trying to get the best out of you. And, you know, he also played receiver and he be with those guys, just pushing you to elevate and be great every day.""  Ron Dugans, his future position coach, was also heavily involved.  ""Same thing,"" Coleman said relating Dugans approach to Norvell's. ""I mean, I gotta give him credit, he knows things on film. He watched the tape and he's done his breakdown. We had some great conversations in there.""  Coleman added that they broke down his Michigan State film, as well as a 'lot of other film' including going over FSU's offense and how he could fit in.  ""He was just picking my brain, bringing up defenses, seeing what you know,"" Coleman added.  Alex Atkins, FSU's offensive line coach and offensive coordinator, also had a one-on-one meeting with Coleman.  ""Had a meeting with him too, mostly on the offense,"" Coleman said. ""How he schemes things, his play-calling, and what he is trying to accomplish in calling those plays. Just that really.""  Coleman was hosted by Johnny Wilson, a breakout wide receiver for the Seminoles who, like Coleman, was a transfer.  ""I mean really just chopping it up about mostly life. Everybody knows football, so we didn't have to do too much talking about football. We know what's there to offer but he's like, we would love to have you on that other side. You are just going to make the offense unstoppable, so lets get you here.""  He also communicated with FSU quarterback Jordan Travis during the visit, though the quarterback was not in town over the weekend.  ""Just pretty much trying to get me here,"" Coleman said of Travis. ""Understand that you are another big target, a guy who can do everything they ask you to do. So what quarterback wouldn't love to have that.""  FSU's offense was a top-tier unit nationally during the 2022 season. Explosive plays and the ability to post points was regularly on display. It is part of the reason why Coleman was interested in the Seminoles. Why was FSU interested in adding Coleman to their offensive roster?  ""We provide another mismatch on the outside, because Johnny is a big guy, so Johnny might be to the boundary but when you have another big guy you don't have to, when you are going with tempo, you don't have to always get him there. You can just put us wherever and we're gonna make a play,"" Coleman said. ""So it's just you would have two guys beside that you don't have to worry about putting them in certain spots because they can do everything. So that's creating mismatches all over the field. We have the speed and size.""  Coleman shared what stood out the most to him as he reflected on the visit.  ""How transparent they were, and how intentional they were on being real and getting their point across and not trying to you know, sell the dream,"" Coleman said. ""You are going to come here, develop, and be a better person than when you walked in here and you are also going to win.""  With the addition of Coleman, the Seminoles add another top-notch wide receiver to a loaded offense. The 6-foot-4, 215-pound wide receiver, who is originally from Opelousas, La., had a breakout season as a sophomore with the Spartans. He led Michigan State in receptions (58), receiving yards (798) and touchdown catches (seven).  According to Pro Football Focus, he ranked tied for second in the Big Ten and 16th in the FBS with 12 receptions caught downfield for 20-plus yards. He also ranked second in the conference and tied for 13th in the FBS with five touchdown grabs caught downfield for 20-plus yards.  He was named a third-team All-Big Ten selection by the media and honorable mention by the coaches for his play during the 2022 season.  As a freshman in 2021, he played in 10 games and had seven receptions for 50 yards and a touchdown.  Coleman is added to a wide receiver room led by returning top receiver Johnny Wilson. Other veterans in the room include Winston Wright Jr., who will make his debut this season after missing last year due to injuries suffered in a car accident, alongside Kentron Poitier, Ja'Khi Douglas, Darion Williamson, and more. The Seminoles also have newcomers such as Destyn Hill, Vandrevius Jacobs, and Hykeem Williams."

For Chrishelle Palay, the last year has been monumental.  As a recent graduate of the Executive Master of Urban Planning (EMUP) online program, the degree has already propelled her career path — even if urban planning was a slight departure from her previous positions.  Palay’s educational journey began when she attended Prairie View A&M University, an HBCU in Texas, where she pursued her bachelor’s degree in architecture. She spent the next two decades in the field, working as a designer for high-rise residential projects throughout the U.S. before she decided to pursue a different, related passion: housing policy advocacy.  “I transitioned from architecture because I realized it wasn’t something I wanted to do anymore. Actually, Hurricane Ike kind of led to that realization, as I saw that there are so many communities that didn’t have the skill sets to understand and navigate how to recover from disaster,” Palay explained.  Palay began working with members from low-income communities to advocate on their behalf for better housing and living conditions, and she is now the director for Houston Organizing Movement for Equity (HOME), a Texan coalition of community-based organizations focused on repairing the state in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  While Palay was passionate about her new career focus and its emphasis on creating a more equitable, resilient city — and felt her background in architecture helped her successfully navigate the systems involved — she wanted to deepen her knowledge in urban planning.  “I was always touching the periphery of urban planning, but I never had a chance to really dive into it. The thought of pursuing a master’s in urban planning was on my mind because I thought if I was even better equipped, I could do deeper work that really helps my community members,” she explained.  Then, Palay met a Trojan graduate who had just completed the EMUP online program at USC Price School of Policy. After they raved to Palay about the executive master’s program, she realized it was time to pursue urban planning — specifically at USC.  “Everyone knows that USC has a very prestigious reputation, so I was a bit intimidated initially. I thought that because I’m in community work and not at this high-profile architecture firm, I don’t know if I’ll really cut the mustard,” Palay mused. “And so, I was pleasantly surprised when I actually was accepted. Just to be part of the USC family is something that I never thought was within reach.”  As Palay navigated her way through the program, she realized how well the curriculum melded not only with her future career goals, but also with her current position at the HOME Coalition — especially involving her work with local policymakers and community leaders.  “Many of the courses that I took and the conversations I had with professors and the assignments I did definitely [blended] with my lived experience,” she explained. “I gained so much value from the coursework and being in the program.”  Tailored to working professionals who want to make their cities more equitable, sustainable and just, the EMUP online trains graduates to become leaders in the public, nonprofit or private sectors. It also emphasizes collaboration and community, immersing students in projects with their peers and professors to address real-world issues.  Palay was particularly fond of her diverse cohort members. Although her colleagues came from different backgrounds and held varying perspectives on the field, each of their professional work “had a link to urban planning in some way, shape or form.”  “My background is architecture and housing policy advocacy, but now I got to understand through the perspective of someone who’s been working in development, from the perspective of someone that works within finance, someone else who works through the lens of leading homelessness issues or efforts within their community,” she said.  The faculty and staff were also immensely supportive, fostering a virtual classroom environment in which all students felt compelled to share their points of view and “show up” for one another.  “Regardless of our personal or professional responsibilities, everyone in the cohort always showed up in class. It was almost like a responsibility that we had for each other, even though it was unspoken,” she said. “Of course, the program was online, so it made it even more special to form that connection. It had that feel of family despite being behind screens.”  Following her graduation this year, Palay feels even more invigorated by her career, and she is currently looking to deepen her experience in the advocacy sector and broaden her scope to focus on connecting local-based issues with federal policy changes.  “[I want] to use the skill sets that I’ve learned and also utilize the connections I’ve made,” she said.  When asked where she visualizes her career in the future, Palay described working on a global level to enact more serious change when it comes to disaster relief and recovery, boosting her impact to an international scale.  “I want to be doing all I can to be a policy advocate and a bridge builder for equitable disaster recovery so that low-income communities — the most vulnerable communities that are impacted by disaster — are able to have the tools to recover. [I want to ensure] we also have equitable policy that allows folks to really recover and not be set back,” she said.  It’s a noble goal, and one Palay seems well-suited to accomplish, especially with her master’s degree from USC Price in hand. After taking a moment to look forward, she also reflected on what she would tell other people considering the EMUP program. She was unwavering in her enthusiasm: If you’re passionate about urban planning, go for it.  “Lay aside any reservations that you may have. It will be a rigorous program, but a transformative experience … You will have a community of support both from the faculty and the students,” she said.

Monday's images show significant damage to buildings and infrastructure caused by the powerful storm.  5 DIFFERENT NAMES FOR HURRICANES AROUND THE WORLD  Cyclone Mocha was packing winds of 175 mph as it spun toward the coast of Myanmar on Sunday. Those wind speeds are the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  More than 100,000 people in Myanmar’s Rakhine state were told to flee ahead of the monster storm, with many seeking shelter in monasteries, schools and religious sites, as others were told to get to higher ground to escape the onslaught of water rushing inland in addition to the torrential rainfall, according to an update from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  Those who didn't leave were forced to the higher floors of buildings and onto roofs to escape the water rushing inland due to the storm surge.  The image above shows the scope of devastation from Cyclone Mocha's winds and flooding.  The before image shows buildings and religious sites surrounded by blue water and white beaches. After Cyclone Mocha, the buildings appeared to be destroyed. The white sand is littered with debris, and the water is no longer clear.  Another set of before and after satellite images shows the bright blue roofs of buildings and trees lining streets in the surrounding community. Most of the roofs were blown away, and only the foundations of many buildings remained after the storm.  The cataclysmic winds from Cyclone Mocha also crumpled cell phone towers and destroyed electrical transformers, effectively cutting off communications to a large swath of the country.  At least six deaths have been reported, but fears are growing that the death toll could rise significantly as communication is slowly restored and more information is received."

The Carolina Hurricanes forward has shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice Monday ahead of the Eastern Conference Final against Florida. Teravainen hasn’t played since he suffered a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders.  It’s unclear exactly when he might be ready to play, though his return would be a lift for a team that has kept advancing despite injuries to top-line forwards.  “I think I’m pretty much ready to go,” Teravainen said after Monday’s practice. “So whenever coach puts me out there, I’ll be good.”  Rod Brind’Amour wouldn’t say definitively when that would be, though he noted the extra rest from the series schedule — still unset as of Monday’s practice — could help.  “He’s healthy enough,” Brind’Amour said. “It’s just whether or not he can play. ... I’m not going to throw him in if he can’t shoot.”  Teravainen was hurt when New York’s Jean-Gabriel Pageau struck the forward’s hands in an uncalled slashing penalty, with an angry Brind’Amour saying afterward that Pageau “absolutely tomahawk chops him, absolutely.”  At the time, Brind’Amour had said Teravainen had a broken hand that would require surgery. More specifically, the injury turned out to be Teravainen’s left thumb, evidenced by the thick pinkish-brown scar running through the center and along the length of his thumb that was visible as he spoke to reporters in the locker room.  He had recently returned to skating with a few teammates and had been building up his on-ice work. On Monday, that meant rotating in on the penalty kill and other stretches of practice.  Wednesday marks four weeks since the April 19 injury, with surgery following the next day.  “It’s kind of crazy, I thought for sure I was done (for the playoffs),” Teravainen said. “But the doctors made a really good job and it looks like I’m getting back pretty soon. ... The boys have done a really good job playing really good hockey. It’s tough to watch games from the outside. You always want to be helping, but they’ve done a really good job.”  The Hurricanes entered the playoffs with concerns about the offense after losing forwards Max Pacioretty and Andrei Svechnikov to season-ending injuries. Carolina had acquired Pacioretty in an offseason trade from Vegas to improve its scoring depth among the top six forwards, while Svechnikov is a physical presence who has been a core piece in the team’s current five-year run of playoff appearances.  Teravainen’s injury only compounded those worries as a top-line forward and strong passer who is also valuable on the penalty kill. But the Hurricanes have rolled along regardless in returning to the semifinals of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time since 2019.  Carolina’s penalty kill is ranked No. 1 among all playoff teams (90%), with the Hurricanes tallying more shorthanded goals (four) than power-play goals allowed (three).  As for the offense, Carolina has seen an uptick in its offensive production for the playoffs (3.64) from the regular season (3.20) behind a collective approach. That produced a dozen different goal scorers, including four players with three each, in the five-game series against the New Jersey Devils in Round 2.  Teravainen can only help both areas once Brind’Amour and team medical staff are certain he’s ready.  “I saw he switched jerseys today so obviously a good sign,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said. “And just in general, him skating around, he looks great. I’m sure he’s feeling good and starting to move towards getting in the lineup. ... He’s been a big part of our group for a long time and he’s a heck of a player, so we’ll take him when we can.”"

Nothing as strange as what some Carolina fans have to be feeling right now.  The former Carolina captain will be back in Raleigh this week trying to get his team to the Stanley Cup Final — only he will not be leading the Hurricanes but battling them.  “This is huge, a great opportunity for us and we’re not satisfied with where we are at,” Staal told FHN on Monday afternoon.  “We feel really good about our game and are confident in our ability but we know this is going to be a huge challenge. They are a great team, they have had a great season thus far. They play a committed game and we feel we do as well. It’s going to be tight, fighting for every inch.”  Jump on the Bandwagon!  Everything You Need to Impress Your Friends Is Here  Get a Subscription to Florida Hockey Now, Today!  Staal, 38, spent his first 12 seasons with the Hurricanes and remains the franchise’s post-Hartford leader in games played, goals, assists and points.  Ron Francis remains the combined franchise leader with 1,175 points — 821 of them coming with the Whalers.  Although Staal has been away from the Hurricanes for a while, it is still a place near and dear to his heart.  It is where he got his start, it is where he enjoyed his greatest moment as an NHL player and it is where he helped grow the game into a truly Carolina thing these days.  When he first started in Raleigh, games were sparsely attended but today the Hurricanes play in a madhouse on Edwards Mill Road.  Staal says he is looking forward to returning to Raleigh with the Panthers on Wednesday — but it will not be for a reunion.  “It’s over already,’’ Staal said. “At this point, I am here with all my brothers right here in this room, in this group and we are committed to winning a series and moving on to the next round and a chance for something else.  “I obviously have a lot of respect for them, a lot of friendships over there. But they’re probably saying the same thing: Put it all aside for the time being. I am one of the pieces here in trying to make this team successful. We just want to get the job done.”  Staal won the Stanley Cup with the Hurricanes in 2006 after being the second-overall pick of Carolina in 2003. Florida had the first overall pick in that draft but traded it to Pittsburgh and dropped to third.  The Penguins took goalie Marc-Andre Fleury and Carolina jumped at the chance to take Staal. Florida was set on taking Horton, hence the trade with the Penguins.  He stayed there until 2016 when Carolina traded him at the deadline to the Rangers so he could chase the Cup with New York — and younger brother Marc.  Now both are with the Panthers and will be squaring off on the second Staal to wear the ‘C’ in Raleigh as Jordan Staal is the current captain of the Hurricanes.  This will be a reunion — or revenge — series on many fronts as Florida coach Paul Maurice was the last coach of the Whalers and the first coach of the Hurricanes.  He spent parts of 11 seasons with the franchise in two different stints and not only coached current Carolina bench boss Rod Brind’Amour but all of his assistants as well.  Florida also has former Carolina players Eetu Luostarinen and Gus Forsling as well as assistant coach Tuomo Ruutu (2008-14).  “We have a few connections, right? But I am quite removed. It has been a decade for me,” Maurice said Monday afternoon. “Eric has played for a bunch of other teams since then, went to the Finals with Montreal. … There are probably five or six important people in my life who still live there and I will get to see them.  “The thing that always gets me when we go back is the height of the trees (around the arena). They were just planting them when we got there and now you can’t see the building for the trees. That’s what I notice, how much has changed. … But it’s not nearly as nostalgic as you might think. I’m not driving by the old house.”  While Maurice will not be cruising around his old neighborhood when he gets back into town, Staal figures he will check out some former haunts.  While the Panthers plan to have a team dinner upon arrival Wednesday, there will be down time during the series and players will be free to check things out as they are wont to do.  If anyone needs a suggestion on where to go, well, they know exactly who to ask.  “I will probably find a dinner spot for the guys when we are there,” Staal said. “We’ll enjoy our time together as teammates. We’ll find something. There are a lot of great places in Raleigh. I know a few of them. Hopefully it is with the wins in the column.”  FLORIDA PANTHERS ON DECK  STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS  EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS  PANTHERS (WC2) AT CAROLINA HURRICANES (MET1)  GAME 1"

Questions concerning the health of the ACC dominated three days of meetings at the conference's annual spring summit at the Ritz-Carlton tucked in the northeast corner of Florida. The worst-kept secret among members finally went public as athletic directors entered their first meeting Monday afternoon: seven of the 14 full-time members had partnered together to examine the conference's grant of rights and whether it was possible to form their own union or seek membership in the expanding SEC and Big Ten.  In public, it appeared a battle line was drawn between the 14 schools, but when the smoke settled following a four-hour meeting behind closed doors Monday among athletic directors, commissioner Jim Phillips exited confident, if not exactly assured, his conference's membership would remain unchanged in the coming years.  ""What I what I've been told is, we're all in this together — emphatically,"" Phillips said. ""We believe in the ACC, we believe in where we're going and we want to continue to work together.""  Still, there was nowhere to hide from reality Wednesday. This was no place to hide behind anonymously-sourced reports or discount whispers of discontent as nothing more than conjecture on social media. Seven schools — Clemson, Florida State, Miami, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia and Virginia Tech — had, in fact, partnered together to explore the possibility of leaving the ACC.  ""That's not a warning sign to me that something bad may happen,"" Phillips said. ""These are schools that are under a lot of stress and a lot of pressures, and I understand that, I really do. The reality is our conference is third in the country in (revenue) distribution. As we look at the projections, at least in this decade, we're going to continue to be there. We want to close the gap — we need to close the gap — between the top two conferences that have started to run away from us.""  Several schools among the seven will keep their eyes on other possibilities, even as they work within the ACC to improve the health of the conference.  ""The landscape is changing significantly,"" Clemson athletics director Graham Neff told 247Sports. ""My role is to be connected and well-read in the industry and with all of our universities, and that starts in the ACC.""  Clemson and Florida State led those seven schools as they embarked on exploratory trips to the ACC's headquarters to study the league's grant of rights and the voluminous language in a separate document authored by ESPN. What they discovered was the contract through 2036 is difficult to break without facing significant financial penalties estimated to carry a price tag between $120 million and $500 million, industry sources tell 247Sports.  “I absolutely feel for my colleagues (Monday) that were blindsided, and if the commissioner was, him as well,"" Virginia Tech athletics director Whit Babcock told The Richmond Times-Dispatch. ""These jobs are hard enough without something knocking you upside the head. ... There was probably a number of things said [Monday] that needed to be said. I think the commissioner did a great job with it. You’ve got 15 schools and 15 different approaches. After the initial shock of some of the news reported, I think it was productive after that. I think it was less than ideal that it came out, but it’s been a catalyst for some real conversation and maybe getting to things a little faster that we’ve been working on as the ACC.”  Florida State athletics director Michael Alford has been the most vocal opponent of the current revenue distribution within the conference. He entertained questions about leaving the ACC during a board of trustees meeting at FSU in February and also issued a warning to conference leadership demanding more money from the ACC's coffers.  In the wake of progress on an unequal revenue distribution system he supported, Alford said Tuesday FSU is ""very thrilled to be in this league and we want to stay."" He termed exploration as ""due diligence"" in the wake of the massive realignment waves in the Pac-12, Big Ten, SEC and Big 12, adding that reports of the ACC's potential demise were ""overblown."" Nearly every program in the ACC has studied the league's grant of rights at the ACC's headquarters over the last two years, sources tell 247Sports.  ""We're going to continue to do what's best for Clemson,"" Neff said. ""That means strengthening and supporting the ACC and being a proud member, but also just making sure that we're very connected (in the industry) in doing what's best for Clemson.""  The ACC paid an average of $36.1 million to each team in the 2021 fiscal year. The baseline share for programs would not drop year to year in a new model, which will reward programs for their success with bonus payouts for their success in the postseason, most notably in the College Football Playoff and men's and women's basketball tournaments. Ambitious estimates project bonuses could range from $10 million to $20 million for the top-earning university. The ACC's board of directors is ""excited"" about the model, Phillips said, but more details need to be finalized before a vote is conducted. The new revenue-sharing model should be adopted later this summer, a source told 247Sports.  Florida State pushed for television revenue to also be included in the merit-based system but it did not gain traction. ""One bridge at a time,"" Alford said.  Conference realignment has often coincided with the expiration of media rights contracts. That could mean trouble, again, for the ACC when the Big Ten's massive $7 billion deal announced in 2022 expires in 2030, and the SEC's exclusive deal with ESPN expires in 2034. The ACC's deal spans through 2036.  ""At the end of the day, we are better off together than a smaller subset,"" Phillips said. ""It's been proven that national championships are great when you have multiple leagues competing for it, not just a couple,"" Phillips said. ""I feel really good about the future of the ACC. I do. And I'm not just saying that."""

Packs of dogs chasing cars, bicycles and golf carts are no longer a laughing matter. This coupled with constant howling at wee hours of the night is often times unbearable.  Most would agree stray dogs and wild donkeys are an issue, but there will always be a fierce debate over how best to respond.  It places focus on an issue that long divided opinions. The question that remains is, what to do with TCI’s vast number of stray animals?  Like many others, I’m a dog owner and some years ago, adopted two of my own. Quite frankly, I do have a sensitive side to animals. The donkeys are unique in a sense, charming, and because of their friendly nature, most tourists treat them as an open petting zoo.  Nevertheless, as pet owners we should have some kind of responsibility when it comes to properly caring for and the protection of these beautiful animals.  I realize like many Caribbean countries, it’s an island culture to allow your animals to roam freely. Nevertheless, the mere exponential growth of these two animals, particularly on the island of Grand Turk, is out of control.  We must come to the realization that we are no longer living in the 70s and 80’s with a limited number of vehicles on the streets.  Over the years, there have been reports of serious vehicle accidents as a result of these loose animals roaming the streets. In addition, these out of control animals are rummaging through residential garbage bins and contributing to issue the island is having with littering.  With the increasing number of stray dogs that are traveling in packs, it could also present a danger to citizens and tourists alike. Prior to the pandemic, an island-wide charitable spay and neuter program which was spearheaded by the TCSPCA, was underway. Despite the great success, it appears the program is not garnering the support it deserves.  A lack of continued neutering and spaying, will lead to the uncontrolled breeding of pets and wild animals. Unfortunately, with the high cost of animal care, many residents cannot afford the vet’s bills for injured or malnourished animals.  A few years ago, there was a new approach by the government with proposed laws that would have helped to deal with the situation, to include possible quarantine of the donkeys. I’m not a veterinarian, therefore, I cannot speak to what impact this would have on donkeys who have been introduced to the wild for such a long period of time.  Nonetheless, let’s consider the alternative, the laws still need to be tightened up and enforced, this will prevent accidental harm to humans and to the animals themselves.  Many citizens have raised concerns that cruelty and animal neglect complaints are not being treated as seriously or investigated as robustly as they should be. With the growth in human population over the years and changes in society, it should no longer be acceptable to own pets without having a properly fenced yard, and or a requirement to have them on a leash.  This long-standing issue is a very sensitive one, especially in Grand Turk, where the donkeys have become a part of the character of this beautiful by nature island.  I believe the solution lies in educating the public and possibly the need for a slight shift in cultural norms. Better yet, maybe it’s time for the government to incentivize owners to get their dogs spayed and neutered and fund direct investment in such clinics.  The recent announcement of a prison initiative to assist with caring for injured donkeys is an exceptionally good idea. Hopefully the department of agriculture can capitalize on this project.  According to Dr Brent, the local quarantine officer, his department has been tasked with developing a strategy to present to cabinet for consideration and approval. One of the immediate needs is a proper animal transport vehicle.  Here are a few other ideas to ponder.  -Can some of the donkeys be relocated to one of our deserted cays where they can roam freely?  -Can we export some of the animals to our neighboring country like Haiti, where they can be put to good use?  -Can we set up a sanctuary for these donkeys at north wells and create a real petting zoo, with an entry fee and all funds are reinvested for their care?  -Can the government commit to working in concert with TCSPCA to increase the number of spayed and neutered clinics across these islands?  At the end of the day, we can still live in harmony with these beautiful animals. Henceforth, the issue must be addressed and given more attention. If we fail to do so, it will only continue to create an endless cycle of need, animal abuse and neglect.  Ed Forbes  Concerned citizen of Grand Turk"

They all had one coach in common.  Paul Maurice coached Brind’Amour and Daniels in his first stint here, and Gleason in his second, and it’s hard to imagine many coaches can say the same of their playoff opponents.  Twelve years have passed since Maurice was fired here, not for the first time, and so much has changed. The owner. The longtime general manager. A decade-long playoff drought came and went. Eric Staal left, and Sebastian Aho arrived, and Brind’Amour went from assistant coach to head coach.  Maurice, meanwhile, coached the Toronto Maple Leafs between his two tenures and 381 wins with the Hurricanes, went to Russia after his second and spent nine seasons with the Winnipeg Jets before walking away last winter, only to resurface this season with the Florida Panthers — a team of which big things was expected in the regular season that has finally delivered in the playoffs.  Just about everything comes full circle if you wait long enough, and now the coach who brought Brind’Amour into coaching has taken a fourth team to the conference finals, and for the first time the Hurricanes stand in his way.  “I just remember watching him do it, saying I’ll never be a coach,” Brind’Amour said this week. ”He’s up here, the way he thinks. I was like, oh man, if it has to be like that, I’m probably not going to be able to do it. Obviously, I found a different way to kind of do it.”  That cerebral side of Maurice often goes overlooked, his deep understanding of the game buried under the quips for the media, the f-bombs for officials. But even without having ever played in the league, he always found a way to get the most out his players, whether they were grizzled veterans (in 2002, when the Hurricanes could afford character but not talent) or the last proud remnants of a championship team (in 2009).  Story continues  It’s almost impossible now to fathom the difficulty of the task Maurice faced when the Hartford Whalers moved to Raleigh in 1997, their 30-year-old head coach being asked to shepherd the team through two interim years in Greensboro with a minuscule payroll before trying to put down hockey roots in a basketball market.  Somehow, he and the Hurricanes both made it to the other side.  “It also seems quite removed to me,” Maurice told reporters in Florida on Monday. “It’s been a decade.”  Deep ties to Carolina  There are so many familiar ex-Hurricanes playing key roles for the Panthers in this playoff series: Eric Staal, Zac Dalpe, Gustav Forsling, Tuomo Ruutu, Eetu Luostarinen — and, in the front office, Paul Krepelka, the assistant general manager who helped build the Hurricanes into a playoff team before moving to Florida and doing the same for the Panthers, and whose fingerprints are on the roster in a way Ron Francis’ are not, no matter what you might hear on national TV.  But even Staal’s ties to the Hurricanes don’t run as deep as Maurice’s, even if both will inevitably someday join Brind’Amour, Francis, Glen Wesley and Cam Ward in the Hurricanes Hall of Fame.  From the moment Maurice sat in the back of a press conference discussing the possibility of the team moving to Raleigh paging through a Triangle real-estate guide, the 30-year-old head coach of the soon-to-be-no-longer Hartford Whalers, his existence, his future, was inseparable from the Hurricanes’ early days here.  “The franchise in Hartford-slash-Carolina was in, I would say, disarray,” Maurice said earlier this postseason, and it’s hard to argue the point.  He was the one told by a linesman to quit swearing in the Greensboro Coliseum, because kids could hear him in the empty arena. He was the one who maneuvered a moderately talented but extremely disciplined team to within three wins of the Stanley Cup, losing only to a roster overflowing with Hall of Famers. He was the target of a banner reading “Mo Must Go” that PNC Arena security removed from the 300 level in November 2003, putting in print a popular chant among the disgruntled.  He was finally fired many years after he was supposed to be — perennially in those early years, he was the top name on every pundit’s “first coach to be fired” lists, and never was — then made a triumphant return by guiding the Hurricanes back to the playoffs and to a long postseason run in 2009, before getting fired again.  Still, Maurice was around for all of the franchise’s early moments in North Carolina and some of its more important later ones, if not the most important of all. His first departure opened the door for Peter Laviolette, who in his first full season guided the Hurricanes to the Stanley Cup in 2006. When Laviolette faltered in the fall of 2008, Maurice stepped back in.  “I helped get him fired, because I was part of the team that got him fired, and part of getting him hired, the second time around,” Brind’Amour said. “He’s got a long history here, but he doesn’t care about that, and I don’t either.”  ‘Always willing’  Maurice was a polarizing figure at times, a lightning rod for frustration with a franchise that couldn’t spend like other teams in the pre-cap era, but he also deserves tremendous credit for getting the most out of the roster in 2002, switching goalies on the fly and taking on Scotty Bowman head-to-head. That improbable run cemented the franchise’s future here, removing doubt from what had been a tenuous existence to that point.  Someone had to get the Hurricanes through the two years in Greensboro, to build some kind of momentum on the ice, to find some kind of postseason success. It just happened to be a coach who was, at the time, younger than a number of his players.  “The thing about Paul, with the maturity he had, he accepted whatever the situation was,” former Hurricanes general manager Jim Rutherford said. “We had very challenging situations in the early years in Raleigh and Paul never complained about it. He was always willing to take on the challenge.”  Maurice was also more closely linked to his general manager (Rutherford) and owner (Peter Karmanos) than most coaches ever are. His playing career ended with an eye injury in junior hockey, playing for Karmanos’ team. Karmanos and Rutherford brought him along, from junior coach to NHL assistant to precocious head coach, all of which made Maurice an easy target for fans dissatisfied with the team’s overall direction.  When you start that young, it leaves a lot of runway. He won his 1,000th game when he was 43, before many coaches blow their first whistle. Only Bowman, Barry Trotz and Joel Quenneville have coached more games in the NHL; Maurice has won more games than peers like Peter Laviolette, Mike Babcock and the late Pat Quinn. His spotless Game 7 record includes two wins with the Hurricanes.  The first time he came back to Raleigh as an opposing coach, in December 2006 with the Leafs, he noticed something few others would: The trees around PNC Arena had grown up and filled in, blocking the view from the team bus. He mentioned the trees again this week, now an additional 16 years older and bigger, as he comes back for the first time as a playoff opponent, this fragile sapling of a franchise he once nurtured having become a mighty oak in these many years without him.  “It’s not nearly as nostalgic as you might think,” Maurice said. “All three of my kids were born there. But I’m not driving past the house.”  Never miss a Luke DeCock column. Sign up at tinyurl.com/lukeslatest to have them delivered directly to your email inbox as soon as they post.

Not so much.  “I remember some of the veteran guys on the 2019 team, and (coach) Rod (Brind’Amour) saying you don’t know when or even if you’ll get back to the conference finals,” Canes defenseman Brett Pesce said Tuesday. “We kind of learned that the hard way, so I think just appreciating where you are not taking a day for granted will be the key. We owe this to Raleigh and North Carolina.”  They “owe it to Raleigh”? It’s no shock that Pesce feels that way. He’s a New York native and played college hockey in New Hampshire, but all of Pesce’s professional hockey has been played in North Carolina. He had a brief stay in Charlotte with the Checkers in the AHL before a quick promotion to the Hurricanes, for whom he’s been a mainstay since 2015.  “It makes me just appreciate just everything this team has been through,” Pesce said. “I’ve kind of started from the bottom and here we are now. It’s cool. Raleigh has a special place in my heart and to be here (in the conference final) again is super cool.”  Another of the Canes’ American-born defenders, Jaccob Slavin has followed a nearly identical path to Pesce, playing first at the NCAA Division I level before a brief stint in Charlotte and then a quick promotion to the Hurricanes, in the same season as Pesce.  “Anything to help continue to build that momentum is good,” Slavin said. “And then you get to something like the Eastern Conference final, (the fans) are going nuts already, everyone’s excited about it. People I talk to outside the rink are excited about it … continuing to build the community we have here in Raleigh. Hopefully we have a better showing than the last time we were in the Eastern Conference final.”  Story continues  As Slavin was also quick to point out, reaching a conference final is great, but it’s also not the ultimate goal.  “We’re close, but we’re also only halfway,” Slavin said. “We have eight wins, but we still have eight more to go, so it’s a long path and it’s definitely not going to get any easier. It’s exciting to be where we’re at, but there’s a lot of work to do still.”  A new tradition?  There’s something unique about this year’s collection of NHL final four teams: None of them has an average daily high temperature below 70 degrees. Indeed, Raleigh is the coldest of the bunch, at about 71 degrees. Dallas follows at 78, Las Vegas at 80 and Miami/Sunrise at a balmy 84.  Some observers in “traditional” hockey markets have found that quirk a bit unsettling.  Not the Canes.  The Carolina Hurricanes Jaccob Slavin (74) and Jordan Staal (11) take turns shooting from the kneeling position during practice on Monday, May 15, 2023 at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C. Robert Willett/rwillett@newsobserver.com  “It speaks a lot to what those markets have done,” Slavin said. “Look at Tampa, the last three years going to the Stanley Cup (final) every year and building their market down there. All the teams that are the last ones standing right now, speaks to what they’re trying to do, and how they’re engaged with the game. It’s cool to see, it’s great for the game, building the game across all different demographics.”  Brind’Amour agreed, tracing the national growth to a specific event in 1988.  “It says a lot about how the game has grown, number one, that we brought it to places and fans that never would have thought 20 or 30 years ago, you wouldn’t have envisioned this,” Brind’Amour said. “You can trace it back to, in my opinion, in the late ’80s when (Wayne) Gretzky got traded to L.A. I think it spawned a whole new awareness for people in the States and hockey, and now here we are. It’s not surprising these teams are good, the whole league is good. It’s just where they’ve put these teams. Hockey’s a great game, people love it, as we know.”  While a veteran hockey market compared with Las Vegas, Raleigh is still the second-newest of the bunch at 25 years. The Minnesota North Stars relocated to Dallas in 1993, while Florida was awarded an expansion franchise to start playing that same season. Vegas’ first season in the NHL was in 2017.  “There’s no doubt things have changed for the better,” Brind’Amour said. “We’ve grown as a team, a community, as everything. I think it’s been a real positive growth.”  The Carolina Hurricanes Brett Pesce (22) works on his shooting form during their practice on Monday, May 15, 2023 at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C. Robert Willett/rwillett@newsobserver.com  Staying cool  While staying cool in any of the remaining cities among the NHL’s final four may be a challenge in the physical, sun-on-their-neck sense, the ability to remain cool and calm under pressure — and while being agitated — on the ice will be paramount for any team’s success.  With Florida Panthers players like Matthew Tkachuk and Radko Gudas — whose considerable talents include among them “Grade-A pest” — coming to town for the Eastern Conference final, it will be important for the Hurricanes to follow the lead of a player like Slavin, whose ability to remain calm and play tough without retaliation rubs off on the rest of the team.  “It helps, I mean, Slavin against anybody is going to help,” Brind’Amour said.  Asked specifically about Tkachuk, Brind’Amour added: “I’m sure he gets under your skin a little, but if there’s a guy that’s pretty calm and cool about that, I mean, Jaccob doesn’t get rattled. We’re going to have to be dialed in on that and play the game the way we need to play, whistle to whistle and not get caught up in that stuff, because that’s obviously not to our advantage.”  Slavin wasn’t worried about the potential for post-whistle activity, either, with Tkachuk or anyone else.  At least, not for himself.  “He’s going to be the type of player he is,” Slavin said. “He’s a really good player, you just try not to get dragged into any of it. I know for myself, that’s fairly easy, but yeah, it’s going to be fun. He’s a fun player to play against and he’s effective at what he does. We have to make sure we stay disciplined against it.”  As for the rest of the group?  “This whole group, we’ve seen it in other series, it didn’t, that stuff doesn’t rattle us,” Brind’Amour said, “and I think because of the people we have in there — Jaccob’s one of them, Skjei’s one of them, Pesce — none of these guys, they have a job to do and you know they’re going to try and do it.”"

Full episodes at Citytv.com and on Citytv+.  It didn't take long for things to get messy on Bachelor in Paradise Canada, hosted by Sharleen Joynt (Mondays 8 p.m. ET/PT on Citytv, catch up on Citytv.com and on Citytv+).  The latest episodes started off with the return of ""Hurricane Demi,"" Bachelor alumni Demi Burnett, who made the singles ""get real"" with a series of questions to reveal their true feelings about each other.  Samantha ""Sam"" Picco from St. John's took the first shot, saying that The Bachelor Canada Season 3 star, Lisa Mancini from St. Catharines, Ont., is the person in paradise putting out ""toxic vibes."" This came after Lisa kissed Quartney Mixon and Connor Brennan, both from The Bachelorette Season 17.  Céline Paquette from Winnipeg said if she could get rid of someone in paradise it would be Sam, to eliminate her competition for Cole Medders.  Last but not least, we found out that the Canadian cowboy, Joey Kirchner from Redcliff, Alta., had previous flings with both Nithisha Ketheeswaran from Stouffville, Ont., and Maria Garcia-Sanchez.  Quartney confronted Lisa about her kiss with Connor. But Lisa was adamant that she wants to get the full paradise experience, getting to know as many people as possible.  ""I want a girl who knows what she wants,"" Quartney said. ""It makes me want to step back a little bit.”  Cole Medders on Bachelor in Paradise Canada on Season 2, on Citytv  First Rose Ceremony  In the season's first Rose Ceremony, the men had the decisions to make, with many of them already unsure about the most rose-worthy singles.  The most complex was Cole, who found himself stuck between choosing Rianna Hockaday from The Bachelor Season 26, or Sam. Rianna continued to say throughout the episode that Cole was the only person she was attracted to in paradise.  Quartney still had some mixed feeling about Lisa, so he pursued a possibly connection with Maria from the first season of Bachelor in Paradise Canada, but he was shut down. Of course, Connor also spent some time with Maria.  Story continues  Joey and Shazeeda ""Shaz"" Gafoor from Toronto kept their relationship alive after last week's date, but he ended up kissing Céline in the same night, giving him a hard choice to make.  Ultimately, here is how the Rose Ceremony turned out:  Austin Tinsley and Chelsea Vaughn  Matia Marcantuoni and Meagan Morris  Garrett Aida and Nithisha Ketheeswaran  Quartney Mixon and Lisa Mancini  Connor Brennan and Maria Garcia-Sanchez  Cole Medders and Sam Picco  Joey Kirchner and Céline Paquette  Austin Tinsley and Chelsea Vaughn on Bachelor in Paradise Canada Season 2, on Citytv  Seemingly, the most secure relationship so far is between U.S. singles Austin Tinsley from The Bachelorette Season 17 and Chelsea Vaughn from The Bachelor Season 25.  The same can't be said for Lisa and Quartney, and Nithisha and Garrett.  Something new is always coming to paradise and this week, Godfrey Mangwiza from Big Brother Season 3 and Edward Naranjo from The Bachelorette Season 18 arrived on the beach to shake things up.  Godfrey ended up asking Lisa for a date and Edward asked Nithisha. It ended up being an ASMR-inspired double date, where the singles made sounds to each other.  The double date didn't sit well with both Quartney and Garrett. Things got particularly heated after Nithisha and Edward shared a kiss.  Lisa Mancini on Bachelor in Paradise Canada Season 2, on Citytv  Next week on 'Bachelor in Paradise Canada'  According to the teaser for next week's episode, Lisa continues to explore all her options in paradise, but there will be ""serious consequences.""

Prior to joining the team, Derek was the Weekday Morning Meteorologist at KMID ABC Big 2 News/Fox 24 News in Odessa, Texas from April 2019 to May 2021. During his time in West Texas, Derek experienced and forecasted a handful of severe weather and winter weather. While with KMID, Derek was also a storm chaser for their Storm Interceptor vehicle and chased multiple severe thunderstorms and winter storms in West Texas. Before his time at KMID, Derek was a meteorologist for WeatherWorks in Hackettstown, New Jersey during the 2018-2019 winter season. During his time at WeatherWorks, Derek issued daily weather forecasts and weather alerts to many different clients across the east, northeast, and midwestern U.S. Derek is a graduate from the University of South Alabama where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Meteorology and a minor in Mathematics. He graduated in May of 2018. Before attending school, Derek interned at the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida. Here he gained knowledge from experienced meteorologists and hurricane specialists. During his time with the National Weather Service, Derek collected weather data on frontal boundary passages through South Florida and shadowed the meteorologists. At the National Hurricane Center, he archived tropical cyclone information. Growing up in South Florida, Derek experienced a lot of meteorological phenomena. From sea breeze thunderstorms, to low pressure systems, to tropical weather, and even the occasional squall line from a cold front. However, it was the tropical storms and hurricanes that significantly elevated his interest into meteorology. During the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons, Florida was a hurricane landfall target. During that span, the state took a hit from 6 landfalls. While growing up in South Florida, Derek experienced 2 of those hurricanes that were a direct hit to his home. Hurricane Katrina was the first direct hit as a category 1 with winds of 75 mph on August 25, 2005. Hurricane Wilma was the second direct hit as a category 2 on October 24, 2005. After experiencing 2 record breaking hurricane seasons back-to-back, Derek fell in love with tropical meteorology and developed a passion for it. A passion so strong that he enjoys chasing hurricanes. Since then, Derek has chased some of nature’s most incredible hurricanes, including Matthew, Florence, Irma, and Michael, just to name a few. Hurricane Michael was Derek’s first category 5 hurricane which was in broad daylight, and a storm that he will never forget. You can check out Derek’s playlist of hurricane chasing via his YouTube channel. Derek also runs hurricaneconnect.com which is a website that is dedicated to the Atlantic Hurricane Season. Derek also enjoys chasing severe weather including tornadoes during the spring season. He’s chased in the central U.S. during the spring of 2012, 2016, and 2017. It was May 16, 2016, when Derek filmed his first tornado near Felt, Oklahoma. You can check out his severe weather footage on his YouTube channel. Aside from his life of weather and storm chasing, Derek enjoys going for long walks, swimming, playing video games, hanging out with friends, dining at restaurants, and of course, watching his Miami Dolphins. You can catch Derek weekday mornings on News 8 Now This Morning Monday-Friday from 5am-7am and from 12pm-12:30pm.

Temperatures are warm, and the air is sticky. Some fog formation is possible for a few hours ahead of sunrise this morning.  KATC Water Vapor Imagery May 16  A ridge of high pressure is currently centered over the Florida panhandle, extending westward into southeast Louisiana. A trough is digging across the Midwest and will continue drifting southeast. A front is draped across the ArkLaTex, and this front will slowly move southward across the area, eventually reaching the Gulf waters by Wednesday night. All of this will keep our area generally unsettled, with the chances for scattered showers and storms remaining in the 40-50% range for the next two days.  KATC Forecast Map for Tuesday Afternoon  Expect temperatures to climb to near 90 degrees this afternoon with heat index values around 95. Higher rain chances will be over central Louisiana, and eastern sections. Wednesday, we'll see the higher rain chances at the coast, while northern sections will start drying out. Highs Wednesday will hold in the upper 80s. Once the front moves offshore and washes out, some slightly cooler and drier air will be with us for Thursday and Friday with highs in the upper 80s and lows in the upper 60s.  KATC Rain Coverage for Tuesday selected cities.  Another front is expected to push in on Saturday with another chance for showers and storms. Saturday's front will have a better cool air mass behind it, so Sunday, and next week is looking great with sunshine and temperatures in the mid 80s.  KATC Ten Day Forecast  Even though we're still just over two weeks out from the start of hurricane season, there might be something to watch off the east coast late this week. Models are suggesting a surface low may spin along the cold front and push into the Atlantic waters off the Carolina coast. This wouldn't be unusual, as many of our ""pre-season"" systems have developed in this part of the world.  In case you missed it, the National Hurricane Center published last week that a system in January that developed off the northeast coast was indeed a ""subtropical storm"". Although this storm will remain unnamed, it will be considered the first ""system"" of the 2023 Hurricane Season. Therefore, if we get any development along the east coast, it will be designated ""Tropical Depression #2"", but if it gets a name, it'll still be Arlene.  National Hurricane Center Hurricane Names for the Atlantic Basin 2023-2028  If any of the names sound familiar, remember name lists are reused every sixth year, with some names retired, usually if they're major catastrophes. 2023's list is the same from the record setting 2005 hurricane season. The names Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma were all retired from 2005.  "

The Hurricanes have talked about taking the next step in the Stanley Cup Playoffs since being swept by the Boston Bruins in the 2019 conference final but could not win more than one series each of the past four postseasons. So what's been different this season?  ""I think the biggest thing is we're getting contributions from everybody on our roster,"" general manager Don Waddell told NHL.com on Tuesday. ""Everybody talks about the goal-scoring, and we lost some key guys, but we're finding a way to put the puck in the back of the net, and I think that's probably surprised a lot of people where the scoring is coming from.""  Carolina is scoring 3.64 goals per game in the playoffs, which is up nearly half a goal from its regular-season average of 3.20, despite missing forwards Andrei Svechnikov (torn ACL), Max Pacioretty (torn Achilles tendon) and Teuvo Teravainen (broken hand). Those are three of Carolina's top six forwards.  [RELATED: Complete Hurricanes vs. Panthers series coverage]  Teravainen might return this round after being injured in Game 2 for the first round against the New York Islanders, but Svechnikov and Pacioretty haven't played in the playoffs and won't return until next season. So the Hurricanes will need more of what they've been getting from depth forwards such as Jordan Martinook, who had 10 points (three goals, seven assists) in five games in the second round against the New Jersey Devils, and Jesper Fast, who has eight points (five goals, three assists) in 11 playoff games, including two overtime goals.  ""You can't rely on one, two, three guys to do it,"" Waddell said. ""Our best players in our league play a third of the game. The other two thirds, you've got to find other people to be able to contribute. That's definitely been the reason.""  In a Q&A with NHL.com, Waddell discussed Tervainen's potential return, moves he did and didn't make last offseason and before the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline, connections between the Hurricanes and Panthers and more.  Teravainen was cleared to practice with contact Monday. Could he be an option for Game 1 or some point later in the conference final?  ""For sure. We're going to see how it goes in the next couple days and then make a decision on Thursday on how he's doing and if he's ready to go or needs a little more time. He's close, though. … When he had the surgery (April 20), they said it was going to be four weeks or so, which is now.""  What does it say about coach Rod Brind'Amour and his staff to get complete buy-in from the players the way they have, considering the players you lost to injury?  ""Since Rod took over, we built that culture in the locker room where, I think we were feeling sorry for ourselves for a couple of days when we lost Svechnikov, but then it's a proud locker room. There are 20 guys who want to go out and do the best they can every night and try to put us in position to win and that's what they've been doing.""  Martinook said he was even surprised by his production after he had no points in the first round. Have you been surprised you got that kind of contribution from him and others throughout the first two rounds?  ""You're happy for those guys because all these guys work so hard and maybe they're not natural scorers. So when the puck goes in for them, you feel good for them because you know what they put into it from effort and their work habits. So it's nice to see those kind of guys get rewarded.""  The Hurricanes and the Panthers were not among the many teams in the Eastern Conference that made the big, splashy moves before the 2023 NHL Trade Deadline. You made depth moves by adding defenseman Shayne Gostisbehere from the Arizona Coyotes and forward Jesse Puljujarvi from the Edmonton Oilers. Was that by design?  ""Every organization has different needs and different thoughts of how they're going to approach the trade deadline. Ours has always been that we try to build our team in the summers, so they can play together all year. There's no secret that we did try to do a few things that didn't work out. That's just the way things happen.  ""We liked our team. We ended up with the second-best record in the NHL for a reason because we had pretty good depth and were consistent through the year. So we felt at the deadline, if we got one of the players that we wanted, great, but otherwise we were happy where we were.""  Did not being able to pull off some of the trades you tried to make maybe turn out to be a good thing? Is there something to be said for not messing with chemistry so late in the season?  ""That's the way Roddy is, too. He liked our team. We didn't want to give up anybody off our team, that's for sure, and that was probably one of the things that went against us in getting certain players. But you just never know how things are going to work out, and I've said all along, sometime the best trades you make are the ones that never happen.""  Your big moves last offseason were to acquire defenseman Brent Burns in a trade with the San Jose Sharks and Pacioretty in a trade with the Vegas Golden Knights. Unfortunately, Pacioretty was injured, but has Burns given you what you hoped for?  ""Yeah, [Burns] has done more than what any of us could ever expect him to do at 38. When we traded for him, he was here three days later buying a house, moved his family here and lived out of a motor home for six weeks while his house was getting ready. He was in the gym every day. When we did our testing, he was our second-best conditioned athlete at 37 years of age. So you knew he was all-in and committed and certainly he's done more than any of us could have expected on the ice and [been] a big part of our success for sure.""  It was reported that the Hurricanes were in on Matthew Tkachuk before the Calgary Flames traded him to the Panthers last summer. How close did you get to making that trade?  ""I don't like to name names, but we were involved in a couple of big trades last summer. I always tell people as much as you want to trade for players, you've got the other side that is going to do what they think is in the best interest of their franchise, which happened. That was a little bit more high profile, but every summer we probably try to make 10 trades that never happen, and you don't hear about those. My job as the general manager is always to try to make our team better and we try to do that in the summertime.""  Frederik Andersen missed the playoffs last season with an injury, but is this how you envisioned your goalie tandem would work when signed Andersen and Antti Raanta in 2021?  ""For sure. Freddie wasn't ready (in the first round because of illness and a minor injury) and Raanta grabbed it and won three of the first five games before Freddie came in in Game 6. Now, Freddie is running with it, but it doesn't matter. Whatever guy we have to go to or make the decision to play, we're very comfortable that the two we have can lead us where we want to get.""  There are a lot of connections between the Hurricanes and Panthers, with former players in Florida (Eric Staal, Eetu Luostarinen, Gustav Forsling, Zac Dalpe), coach Paul Maurice and assistant Tuomo Ruutu, some members of management (assistant GM Paul Krepelka, senior adviser to GM Rick Dudley). Does that make the series interesting for you?  ""I've got lots of good friends there, starting with (general manager) Billy Zito, but once the puck drops, we all know what our goals are.

It’s not a conference-championship field many of us saw coming. In fact, none of the 41 members of The Athletic’s staff who voted in our second-round predictions correctly picked all four winners — and only six had more than half.  Advertisement  Will the next round go a bit closer to expectations?  Here are our picks, with analysis, critique and some trolling from senior national writer Sean Gentille, national writer Hailey Salvian, analytics guru Shayna Goldman and NHL betting expert Jesse Granger.  Conference final predictions  Eastern Conference: Panthers vs. Hurricanes  Percent of vote Panthers Hurricanes 4 games 0.0% 0.0% 5 games 0.0% 4.9% 6 games 14.6% 39.0% 7 games 14.6% 26.8% Total 29.3% 70.7%  Gentille: More than 40 percent of the voters think this one is going seven games? I can’t tell if that’s a little or a lot.  Goldman: To me, that says we’re all projecting this to be a close series, which … can it please be after whatever we just saw in Round 2?  Granger: The Hurricanes are now the betting favorites to win it all at 2-to-1. That sound you hear is me running to catch back up to the bandwagon after falling off in March. I picked Carolina to win the Cup in the preseason and was on board all the way up until the injury to Andrei Svechnikov. The Canes have proven to be talented and deep enough to overcome that, and more.  Salvian: We all made so much about the injuries in Carolina that we forgot about (1) Rod Brind’Amour and (2) how well this roster is built. That said, we all keep picking against Florida, and the Panthers just keep winning. It should be a fun one.  Western Conference: Stars vs. Golden Knights  Percent of vote Stars Golden Knights 4 games 0.0% 0.0% 5 games 2.4% 0.0% 6 games 31.7% 17.1% 7 games 34.1% 14.6% Total 68.3% 31.7%  Gentille: The overall number for the Stars feels right to me. I know they just had a seven-game series, but they’re really, really hard to pick against, especially if you think (as I do) that the Jason Robertson breakout is imminent.  Goldman: The Stars were one of the quietest contenders entering the postseason, so they absolutely deserve their moment here. But it is a bit wild that there isn’t a little more support behind a Vegas team that took a serious contender in the Oilers — our staff’s top pick to win the Stanley Cup ahead of the first and second rounds. (Says, of course, someone who also picked the Stars here.)  Advertisement  Granger: I think it’s more than a bit wild that Dallas would get nearly 70 percent of the vote, especially considering Vegas is the betting favorite in this series (-140). Dallas did win all three regular-season matchups, but two came via shootout. After these teams were involved in plenty of high-scoring games in their previous series, I expect this one to be much more of a defensive chess match between coaches Bruce Cassidy and Pete DeBoer.  Salvian: I picked Dallas in seven, but Vegas looks like it’ll be a really tough out. They’re a good five-on-five team with a mix of depth and star power. Adin Hill stepped in nicely after Laurent Brossoit was injured, but I do worry about their goalie luck a bit.  Beyond the third round  Stanley Cup champion  Gentille: With the benefit of hindsight, it seems that we, as a staff, were a little too far in on the Oilers.  Salvian: So … 65 percent of our staff chose the Leafs or Oilers to win the Cup before the second round began?  Goldman: Apparently it took two rounds of the Hurricanes crushing it, despite all of their injuries, for us to back them. The Panthers can’t seem to get that same respect, even after taking out Boston and Toronto.  Granger: The Panthers have the best two-round resume of any of these four teams and a red-hot goalie, but it’s still not enough to get more than a handful of votes.  Conn Smythe winner  Goldman: Pretty much every current Conn Smyth candidate besides Jake Oettinger wasn’t someone we expected to be here before the playoffs started. Among the players left, Matthew Tkachuk is still pretty low, but he (and the Panthers) don’t seem to have a problem with being underestimated.  Gentille: Someone else here predicted that Hintz would win the Conn Smythe way back at the start of this. I will not say whom.  Salvian: It was me. #HintzHive!  Advertisement  Granger: Take a look at what Jack Eichel’s doing in the first playoffs of his career. He leads Vegas with 14 points and is third of all players remaining, behind only Hintz (19) and Tkachuk (16). His play away from the puck has been even more impressive. The Golden Knights have outscored teams 10-4 with Eichel on the ice at even strength. If Vegas keeps winning, he’s the current favorite on the squad.  How have we done so far?  First-round series predictions  Here’s how our first-round predictions held up, with the actual result of the series, the percent of voters who picked the right team and the percent who picked the right team and number of games:  And second round:  (Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic; photos: Ethan Miller, Maddie Meyer and Jaylynn Nash / Getty Images)"

You want to visit the Caribbean, but you’re concerned about hurricanes. This fear is understandable, considering the terrifying strength of some hurricanes that have impacted the region.    No Caribbean hurricane has brought as much death and destruction as The Great Hurricane of 1780. According to History, since the storm predated modern storm-tracking technology, “specifics about its exact point of origin and strength are unknown.” However, the death toll is believed to have exceeded 20,000 people across several islands.    In 2017, Hurricane Irma brought howling winds, destroyed power lines, and caused flooding across Antigua, Barbuda, St. Barts, and St. Martin. Not long after was Hurricane Maria, which pummeled Puerto Rico and Dominica, among other islands.    Scientists believe climate change is largely at fault for these monster storms. NPR reported that climate change can intensify hurricanes and increase the chance of two or even three happening in rapid succession.    To be clear, there’s no such thing as a hurricane-free Caribbean island. However, if you visit any of these, you’ll likely be safe.    Barbados    According to Forbes, “Barbados isn’t completely immune to hurricanes, but far fewer storms have hit this southern Caribbean nation than other islands.”    The island that used to be called Little England has pulled away to an extent. It became a republic in 2021 but remains part of the British Commonwealth.    As for tourism, Barbados exceeds expectations, with its glorious beaches, five-star resorts, and great golf opportunities. You can also take a tour of a rum distillery or enjoy the Crop Over Festival between May and August.    As for dining experiences, you’ll be happy whether you opt for street food or a five-star, sit-down meal.    Aruba    The Dutch island of Aruba is less than 20 miles from the Venezuelan coast. This is relevant since, according to Trips To Discover, “the more south you go in the Caribbean, the less the odds are for a hurricane.”    Aruba is part of the ABC islands, alongside Bonaire and Curaçao. It is home to San Nicolas, the art capital of the Caribbean. Here, you’ll find gorgeous, colorful murals that really bring life to the area.    Enjoy long walks on the beach and book accommodations at resorts such as the Aruba Marriott Resort and Casino, or Bucati and Tara Beach Resort, which is for adults only.    Trinidad and Tobago    Soca and calypso music were created in this dual island nation, and there’s plenty of both during carnival. Many Caribbean islands host carnival events, but it originated in Trinidad back in the 18th century.    Some of Trinidad’s best beaches include Maracas Bay, Las Cuevas Bay, and Macqueripe Bay, which is secluded.    There are options for adventure-seekers, too. You can do rock climbing at Pointe Gourde, explore Cumaca Cave, or go bike riding in Chaguaramas.    If you want to avoid the crowds, hop over to Tobago, where you can snorkel or swim in Nylon Pool. This natural, crystal-clear pool is in the middle of the ocean.    St. Lucia    If you haven’t been to St. Lucia, now is the time. Every inch of this magical island, from Soufrière all the way up to Gros Islet, looks like a painting.    Unwind at sulphur springs, also called the Caribbean’s “drive-in volcano.” Hike the Pitons with a guide or go zip-lining in Castries or Dennery. If you’re in Gros Islet on a Friday, don’t miss the street party. It’s a vibe!    As far as hurricanes, the Anse Chastanet Hotel gives some perspective.  “Historically, only 14 hurricanes have moved within 60 miles of Saint Lucia since 1850. Of those, only one has been Category 4 and one has been Category 3. In the past 37 years, only one hurricane affected Saint Lucia directly, in 2010. In 2017, hurricane Maria as a category 2 storm, passed north of Saint Lucia with minimal impact. The risk of a hurricane hitting St. Lucia is the same as the risk in New York.”    Grenada    This southern-Caribbean island is at low risk for hurricanes. Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Emily in 2005 were the major exceptions in recent years, according to Islands.    Grenada, also called The Spice Isle, is known for cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and more. On Friday nights, set aside time for Fish Friday in Gouyave. This is a big draw for Grenadians and tourists. Not only is fish available, but many other kinds of seafood.    One afternoon, take in views of the boats at Prickly Bay Marina. There’s also Black Bay Beach, with its silky, dark sands. This is a great spot for swimming, walking, and, of course, flexing for the ‘Gram.      "

Nesting success was particularly notable in Southwest Florida last year, when least terns raised 320 chicks including 19 at Big Marco Pass — a first since 2019. Wilson’s plovers raised 41 chicks, black skimmers had 234 fledges, and a half-dozen snowy plover chicks made it through hatching and rearing until they had grown feathers and were capable of flight.  Gerald Herbert/ASSOCIATED PRESS / AP An American Oystercatcher is seen on the shore of the Chandeleur Islands, home of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge, is seen off the Southeastern coast of Louisiana Tuesday, April 27, 2010. A member of the species nested at Cayo Costa State Park in 2022, just narrowly missing the effects of Hurricane Ian.  Audubon Florida also helped create nesting habitat at Cayo Costa State Park that was the site of Lee County’s only successful American oystercatcher nest in years – the spot was where Hurricane Ian made landfall four weeks after nesting season.  The report is the result of Audubon staff and volunteers keeping track of more than 300 shoreline nesting sites along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Nearly 600 volunteers spent at least 4,700 hours combined stewarding beach sites, monitoring bird colonies, and cleaning up fishing line and litter.  Hurricane Ian proved to be one of the most destructive storms in Florida’s history, devastating both coastal and inland communities along the southwest coast. A few short weeks later, Hurricane Nicole hit northeastern Florida — a sure reminder that climate change will continue to bring stronger storms to our shores.  — Audubon Florida’s 2022 Coastal Report  Hurricane, climate change fears  The avian-centered environmental group has fears that stronger hurricanes and worsening global warming will soon lead to far less successful nesting season for shoreline animals.  Hurricane Ian’s effects on Southwest Florida’s coastline may very well affect the current shorebird nesting season.  2022 Coastal Report /  Concerns revolve around altered beachlines, different water levels, changes in interior lakes and ponds on barrier islands, and red tide outbreaks that were a constant fixture in the region into the early weeks of this years nesting season.  Climate change-induced trends in seasonal rainfall patterns, including stronger and more frequent storms, will continue to negatively impact wading bird nesting, the report stated.  “We will be paying special attention to hurricane-caused habitat changes in the 2023 nesting season,” DeRose-Wilson said. “As we start another nesting season here on the coasts of Florida, the sea, shore, and wading birds that depend on our coastal areas are threatened by red tide, erosion, human disturbance, and more.”  Protecting the birds  Sea and shorebirds lay their eggs right on the sand, often in small divots creating nests that can’t be seen unless right over it.  The adult birds will flee when people or dogs get too close. And if constantly frightened away, the parents often abandon the colony and leave their nesting chicks to fend for themselves, which rarely ends well.  2022 Coastal Report /  Because of that, Florida Audubon and its volunteers rope off and often monitor important nesting areas, especially where threatened species are bunched up.  In Collier County, the Second Chance Critical Wildlife Area is now off-limits to boaters and will remain so through August 31. The shell island is at the south end of Cape Romano, south of Marco Island.  Second Chance won’t be the only one.  “Postings will be put up on Collier’s historically important nesting beaches, like Big Marco Critical Wildlife Area, Morgan Beach, and Dickman’s Point, in the coming weeks,” said Rochelle Streker, Audubon’s Southwest Florida shorebird program manager.

The 122nd running of the 1 1/8-mile Dinner Party for 3-year-olds and up on the grass will be the eighth of 10 stakes, six graded, worth $2.6 million in purses on a blockbuster 14-race program headlined by the 148th Preakness Stakes (G1), Middle Jewel of the Triple Crown.  Pimlico's oldest stakes race and the eighth-oldest in the country, the Dinner Party was contested at two miles for its 1870 debut, won by Hall of Famer Preakness. The distance has changed nine times over its history, returning this year to the current 1 1/8 miles for the first time since 2013 after being held the previous nine years at 1 1/16 miles.

He's the kind of horse, he's always thereabouts (among the top finishers). But he's never won a big one.”  Campaigned in France throughout the early part of his career, Hurricane Dream took part in 10 group stakes, finishing second four times with one third. He made his U.S. debut in January in the Pegasus World Cup Turf Invitational (G1) at Gulfstream Park, finishing 10th, beaten four lengths.  “He didn't run badly,” Irwin said. “But he never really got on track. So we sent him to Fair Hill (Training Center), backed off him and got him happy.”  The gelding followed that effort with his Keeneland win, which resulted in one of the highest Equibase speed figures (119) for any horse this year in a two-turn turf event.  “The timing of this race is good, the distance is good, and he's sharp as a tack,” Irwin said.  One of the top contenders that Hurricane Dream will have to get past is Three Diamonds Farm's Atone, who was third after setting the pace in last year's Dinner Party and opened his 2023 campaign with a ¾-length win in the $1 million Pegasus World Cup Turf Invitational. Atone is trained by Michael Maker.  Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners' Speaking Scout, who was third to Atone in the Pegasus, is also entered in the Dinner Party for Motion, who will saddle three horses in the race.  WinStar Farm LLC and Siena Farm LLC's Emmanuel, who won the Canadian Turf Handicap (G3) at Gulfstream in March, is also expected to contest the Dinner Party. Todd Pletcher trains.  The other members of the projected 7-horse field include Courtlandt Farm's Never Explain (trainer Shug McGaughey), Russell Welch and Ran Leonard's Rising Empire (trainer Brandan Walsh) and Madaket Stables' Easter (Motion)."

Miami Marine Stadium was declared unsafe in 1993 following the Category 5 storm and has sat abandoned ever since.  5 Miami Marine Stadium can be found looking out over Virginia Key Credit: AP  5 It was deemed unsafe for spectators after being battered by Hurricane Andrew in 1993 Credit: AP  5 The abandoned structure still stands and is a haven for animals and graffiti artists Credit: AP  Now, a $60million project is looking to breathe new life into the Magic City's forgotten powerboat racing arena.  Built in 1963, the 6,566-seat stadium can be found on Virginia Key, just off the Rickenbacker Trail out toward Key Biscayne.  Its steep single-deck stand looks out over the water and was the first purpose-built powerboat racing stadium ever constructed in the US.  Named Ralph Munroe Marine Stadium upon opening, it was designed by Cuban architect Hilario Candela and cost $2million.  With scenic views of Downtown Miami in the background, the stadium quickly became a fan favorite.  Watersports, boxing matches, music concerts, and even political rallies were held at the picturesque venue.  Eight huge concrete pillars support the huge canopy, allowing spectators an uninterrupted view of the bay from every seat.  But since Andrew made landfall in August 1992, the Miami Marine Stadium has laid dormant.  Since closing to the public, both the interior and exterior have proven to be a haven for graffiti artists and curious kids, with street art adorning the concrete walls at every turn.  Daring tourists often try to get a look inside the unsafe structure, which is guarded 24 hours a day by security.  After years of legal wrangling, the Miami Marine Stadium restoration project finally appears to be off the ground.  Expected to take at least two years, it will look to restore the stadium to its former glory.  Assistant communications director for the City of Miami Kenia Fallat explained: ""To renovate the entire stadium, there would be much more work to do, structurally and otherwise.""  The renovations are part of a huge upgrade to the whole Virginia Key area.  Work began in February, starting with partial pile repairs which could cost around $2.4million.  In 2012, the stadium was named a National Treasure by the National Trust.  And architect Richard Heisenbottle believes everything should be done to preserve and resurrect one of the country's forgotten jewels.  He said in 2021: ""We can list all the reasons why we must support the Marine Stadium.  ""The building is as much of our heritage as the freedom tower, Olympia Theatre, Vizcaya, and the Biltmore Hotel are.  ""Yes, it is a different architectural style, but when we talk about saving a building like this, we talk about saving our heritage for future generations.  ""What it takes is to have the political will to understand the importance of these things and to work toward making them financially viable.  ""It is important and goes well beyond the financial aspects … but for the importance of the community.""  5 A restoration project is hoping to restore the venue to its former glory Credit: Getty"

Cost Field.  In the first inning, No. 11 Miami (34-17, 16-11 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)) started off strong, as it cashed in on a run in the first inning with the bases loaded. Pitt (22-27, 10-15 ACC) was quick to answer with two runs in the bottom of the first to give the home team the advantage early on.  Panthers pitcher Kyle Mosely was dominant, recording seven strikeouts through 4.1 innings. He was unable to silence third baseman Yohandy Morales, who batted speedy center fielder Jacoby Long in for a run to tie the game. Miami native Matthew Fernandez got a call from Pitt’s bullpen to try to rescue the inning as Morales and Kayfus occupied second and third with one out in the top of the fifth.  The top of the fifth did not end there, as outfielder Zach Levenson loaded the bases on a walk and second baseman Blake Cyr followed up with a powerful ground-rule double to give the ‘Canes a short-lived 4-2 lead.  Pitt counter-punched Miami’s three-run inning in the bottom of the sixth. Outfielder Kyle Hess put the Panthers in a great position to score by connecting on a triple to get the Pitt offense started. The Panthers scored two runs to tie the game, but almost as if it were a boxing match, Miami struck back.  Cyr and shortstop Dominic Pitelli recorded back-to-back singles. On the next at-bat, catcher Carlos Perez got hit by a pitch, loading the bases for the fourth time in the game. Pinch hitter Dorian Gonzalez hit a sac fly, which gave the Hurricanes a 5-4 lead in the top of the seventh.  The Hurricanes’ infield had a remarkable offensive performance, with Cyr, Morales and Kayfus all getting on base at least three times.  Pitcher Andrew Walters also starred with a dominant pitching performance. The MLB prospect pitched 2.2 innings and struck out four batters while only allowing one hit.

What audiences will not know is that Shadowland was a real place founded by Dickerson-Despenza’s great-grand uncle. As the playwright shares, “Uncle Tony, who was actually my second cousin-once-removed, would tell me all these stories about it,” she says. “There was this one postcard that guests would receive that was on sale on eBay for hundreds of dollars. He had a screenshot of it and every time he would talk, I would say, ‘Can you show me any pictures?’ And he would say, ‘Lost them in the floods.’” It was Tony’s grandfather who founded the real-life Shadowland at 1921 Washington Avenue—a detail revealed in the play, currently playing an extended run at Off-Broadway’s The Public Theater through May 28.  Shadow/land is the first in a decalogy of works (not all of which are plays) that Dickerson-Despenza is writing about Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. The play follows mother and daughter Magalee and Ruth, two adult Black women living in New Orleans who have inherited Shadowland, a jazz dance hall and hotel. (And like the real-life Shadowland, there is also a real-life Ruth and Magalee.) On their way to the Superdome where they plan to take shelter as Hurricane Katrina’s landfall looms, they stop by the bar to grab Magalee’s bag—only to become trapped by the storm. Over six days, mother and daughter try to survive as the flood waters rise around them and the streets become body-filled rivers. Shadow/land stars Lizan Mitchell as Magalee, Joniece Abbott-Pratt as Ruth, and Christine Shepard as Grand Marshal.  Though Chicago-born and raised, Dickerson-Despenza has deep roots in New Orleans through her father’s side—roots that can be traced as far back as the late 1700s. Compelled to keep digging into the real Shadowland, Dickerson-Despenza turned to social media, in particular a Facebook group called “Old New Orleans – ‘Black’ In the Day.” There’s a lot of community elders and people with roots in New Orleans, including people who witnessed Katrina firsthand, in the private group. “Uncle Tony was telling me how the Despenzas were something and they were a name. I was like, ‘Oh, he just wants you to feel good about our family line.’ I decided to just write in this group. I was like, ‘Let me see if people remember this place called Shadowland.’ And there were so many comments from people,” she reveals.  People began replying, remembering growing up across the streets from Shadowland, popping in to see singers and musicians, wondering who owns the property since the music hall burned down in the 1980s. Heartened by the outpouring of response, Dickerson-Despenza thought maybe she’d get to see photos of the place. But it wasn’t to be. “When I asked for pictures, everyone said, ‘Lost in the flood.’”    While there have been many times New Orleans has flooded, there’s one storm that continues to leave a mark on the Crescent City and its communities: Hurricane Katrina. “It was my desire to excavate this last cultural institution and the people who lived it. I don't want it to be lost. We’re still in the afterlife of Katrina,” tells Dickerson-Despenza. She dedicates the play to Ruth, Magalee, and Victor Despenza (an ancestor mentioned in the play). She also dedicates it to the almost 2,000 people who died during Katrina and in the floods, and the 25,000 refugees who were displaced to Houston’s Astrodome. The names of the victims cover the entrance to the theatre at The Public and parts of the set.  “There was so much talk about the loss of homes, which was great and important to talk about.” But there’s another conversation that the playwright wants people to discuss: What it means for Black communities to lose cultural institutions, and historical artifacts, like the photos of Shadowland. “I have an elder cousin who holds the deed to that land. So the land, as far as I know, is still in the family. I'm still very proud of that,” Dickerson-Despenza explains. “But, I am sad that the institution no longer exists, that very few people know about it.” In writing the play, Dickerson-Despenza is “trying to recover this piece of history.”  Before Katrina, Black Americans comprised about two-thirds of New Orleans’ population, and like in all Black communities, the importance of having and keeping cultural institutions is paramount. But in the play, Ruth wants to sell Shadowland to a developer. Meanwhile, Magalee believes Ruth should care more about protecting her inherited legacy. She reminds Ruth of how Ruth’s great-great-great-great-grandmother was taken from Saint-Dominigue and sold as a slave in New Orleans. She worked to someday “buy her own self” and be free from slavery; and then she bought the land and founded Shadowland, which has been passed down since.  What to do with Shadowland is only one of the tensions between Ruth and Magalee. They reflect on how they’ve faced racism differently, argue over Ruth’s sexuality, and disagree over exactly how to handle Magalee’s failing memory. Dickerson-Despenza's play and its characters have a political bent to them because it is intensely personal. She writes “people in place,” and politics inherently come with the lived experiences of her characters “in their bodies and in geographical space. Their lived experiences help them to develop and sustain politics around that experience,” she explains. “I think the best political creative writing is that which centers the people.”    In her work to center people and their lived experiences, Dickerson-Despenza honors her ancestors. “Writing is a spiritual practice for me,” she shares. “I have all kinds of family buried in New Orleans, some very close to my home. I am in steady conversation with my ancestors. There are things that I asked about like, ‘What do you all need?’ And that's a part of the creation.” Remember that great-great-great-great-grandmother Rosaline who Magalee says founded Shadowland? There’s a real Rosaline in Dickerson-Despenza’s family tree.  Quoting 20th century philosopher Walter Benjamin who said, “To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was.’ It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up in a moment of danger,” Dickerson-Despenza blends the facts of her family’s stories, and so many other stories, with fiction to try and capture the truth of the past.  Before shadow/land began its world premiere, The Public presented the world premiere of Dickerson-Despenza’s cullud wattah in fall 2021. The Afro-surrealist play follows five Black women from across three generations of a family all living through the Flint, Michigan water crisis. The play ends by reminding the audience that many homes in Flint still do not have clean water. Says Dickerson-Despenza, “The media moves so fast onto the next tragedy or next headline that we forget. I’ve had people literally say to me about Flint and about Katrina, ‘I didn’t know it was that bad.’”  The two plays, similar in the themes explored and the playwright’s experimentations across genre and medium, form the foundation which Dickerson-Despenza intends to expand upon in the Katrina decalogy. Originally billed as 10 plays, the series will now be 10 works, including museum work. One of the plays will explore what happened when emergency calls were re-routed to Baton Rouge after the Orleans Parish call center flooded—and the emotional labor involved in being on the other end of the line as people plead for help first, and to not die alone second. Another follows characters that are talked about, but never seen, in shadow/land three months after the play as the traumas from Katrina continue to haunt them.  Across all of it, Dickerson-Despenza’s guiding hope for herself as an artist is to be a “delicate sculptor of horror,” a moniker given to Harlem Renaissance Black female sculptor Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller. “Not for sensationalism’s sake,” she clarifies, “but to really bring certain things to the forefront of our cultural memory so that we remember ourselves and each other in that process.” It’s fitting, then, that on the back wall of the shadow/land set is a photo of the real Ruth and Magalee in formal attire, taken in the ballroom of Shadowland. “We added a picture of my Uncle Tony that I took as the last photo I took of him before he passed,” Dickerson-Despenza shares. It’s a tribute to the ancestors of shadow/land, to make sure they are not forgotten.  Check out photos from shadow/land at The Public below."

The Florida Panthers are a star-studded team with a hard-nosed style built for the postseason — and one of the best offensive teams in the league.  Advertisement  It’s a battle between two former Southeast Division rivals, two teams with similar stylistic tendencies but dueling ideologies towards roster construction. One is built on depth and defensive structure. One is built on stars and offensive chaos.  The Hurricanes and Panthers are twin flames ready to ignite — the end result should be an epic and explosive clash of a series. Carolina and Florida were built for this moment: a date with the Stanley Cup earned by a series that could truly go in either direction.  The Odds  The difference in this series? Home-ice advantage and Teuvo Teravainen. That’s how close these two teams are. Without Teravainen Carolina’s chances of beating Florida at home are 55 percent and Florida’s chances of beating Carolina at home are 55 percent. Teravainen’s return adds one percentage point per game adding to Carolina’s slight edge from having one extra home game.  Whether you actually want to believe that in these playoffs where home teams have won only 43 percent of the time is up to you, but historically home-ice advantage in the playoffs is actually larger. It’s especially interesting between these two teams given what they’ve each managed during this postseason. The Hurricanes are 5-1 at home, but the Panthers are 6-1 on the road. Immovable object — meet unstoppable force.  Some may be surprised the Panthers have made it this far and are now in a coin-flip series to make the Cup Final, but as we’ve warned all postseason the Panthers are not your average wild-card team. They came into the playoffs with the fifth-highest Net Rating and were only underdogs because they had to face the two teams that ranked first and second.  Florida has survived an extremely tough path, but the road ahead doesn’t get much easier against a defensive equal. Carolina has the lower Net Rating, but the two teams end up with a near equal expected win percentage due to Carolina’s defensive superiority.  Advertisement  Which team comes through? That all depends on which team’s strengths shine brightest — and which team’s weaknesses are exposed less.  The Numbers  The series is a matchup of a team with one of the best offensive ratings (plus-62) against one of the best defensive teams (plus-35).  At five-on-five, these were two of the top offensive generators in the league, separated by just .03 expected goals for per 60. Neither team capitalized on their chances to match their scoring chances, though Florida had a clear edge in actual goal scoring with stronger priors.  Defense is where these two really split in the regular season, as the Canes were the stoutest team in their own end while the Panthers were in the bottom third of the league. Florida didn’t have as consistent goaltending to match, either.  Through two playoff rounds, Carolina’s maintained their edge as one of the best five-on-five teams in the league with a high rate of scoring chances, and a lot of scoring despite some key injuries. While they had a slight advantage in limiting scoring chances against, Florida conceded fewer goals to this point.  Special teams make for an intriguing matchup here. Neither team had the most dangerous power play in the regular season. Florida created chances, but couldn’t convert. Carolina generated less, with even fewer goals to show for it. The story has been the same for the Canes in the playoffs. Florida, on the other hand, improved — and a change in formation, going to four forwards and one defenseman instead of having two blueliners on the top unit, helped that. Their power play still wasn’t the most prolific, but actually matched what they created on the scoresheet.  The challenge, of course, is managing to generate anything on the power play against the Hurricanes. Their power kill has been a part of their identity as a disruptive short-handed unit. The Islanders and Devils, who both had regular-season issues on the advantage as well, struggled to score on the power play against Carolina’s aggressive play which neutralized their opponents through two rounds with three goals for, and only three against.  Advertisement  Florida’s penalty kill has allowed a higher rate of quality looks and goals against this postseason. If that continues, maybe it opens the door to power-play success for the Canes.  The Big Question  Can Sergei Bobrovsky keep being the $10 million man?  Here’s a highly unscientific prediction: If you were to ask 10 different hockey fans what “Playoff Bob” means to them, you’d get five people saying, “yep, I’d take that guy” and five vigorous head shakes. There certainly wouldn’t be a consensus.  Nor should there be, really. Bobrovsky, even compared to general volatility at the goaltender position, has one of the more bizarre careers on record. He couldn’t establish himself as a starter early in his career with the Flyers, then made five All-Star teams in seven years and won two Vezinas with the Blue Jackets. The capstone for him in Columbus was a .925 save percentage postseason run in 2019 that featured a stunning sweep of the top-seeded Tampa Bay Lightning. Until that year, he’d put up an .891 save percentage and five wins in 24 playoff games.  That series against the Lightning, featuring the emergence of good “Playoff Bob,” combined with his generally strong play over the previous seven seasons earned him the third-biggest goalie contract of all time ($70 million for seven years) and some dialed-up expectations with the Panthers. In the four ensuing seasons, he’s been uneven. Not many goalies are capable of living up to the price tag — it’s not an economically wise spot to spend that much cap space — but Bobrovsky hasn’t been a full-fledged disaster, either. Year-by-year, his save percentages are .900, .906, .913 and .901. That’s passable, but not what $10 million goaltending looks like.  Part of the weirdness for Bobrovsky thus far in Florida has been the presence of a series of backups who’ve seemed capable, if not destined, to take his job. Chris Driedger (.938 save percentage, 7.36 GSAx in 2019-20) wound up as a priority for the Kraken in the expansion draft. Spencer Knight was an elite prospect and, though he entered the player assistance program in February, is still just 22. Alex Lyon took over for an ill Bobrovsky at the end of the regular season and only gave the net back after dragging the Panthers into the playoffs. It was the right call; Lyon was hot, and Bobrovsky had gone .899 in 17 playoff games with the Panthers, winning just six of them. That’s bad “Playoff Bob.”  Paul Maurice, though, made the switch back to Bobrovsky relatively early in their first-round series against the Bruins — at the end of a Game 3 loss that put Boston up 2-1 — and he’s been outstanding. Since allowing five goals to the Bruins in Game 4, Bobrovsky has put up a .928 save percentage, just one game with a save percentage under .917, and a playoff-best 8.81 goals saved above expected. Second place in GSAx in that span? Carolina’s Freddie Andersen with a 3.6. That’s what $10 million goaltending looks like.  Advertisement  Now, whether he can keep it up is anyone’s guess. In February and early March, he had a .930 run in 12 starts. From March 8, on, he went .871 in eight games. That split says it all. Plus, this is “Playoff Bob” we’re talking about. Anything is possible.  The X-Factor  How much more oomph does Jordan Martinook have left in him?  Turns out that the pop Carolina needed in its lineup was on the roster all along, in the form of a 30-year-old who was made available on waivers in October. The Hurricanes gambled that Martinook’s $1.8 million AAV would be too steep for contenders and too pricey for budget teams, and they were correct.  First, Martinook put up the best regular season of his career, setting a career-high with 34 points, scoring 11 five-on-five goals on nearly 17 expected and playing a major part on a difference-making third line with Jordan Staal and Jesper Fast. Carolina’s five-on-five dominance, in plenty of ways, starts with them.  Martinook has leveled up in the postseason, leading Carolina in their Round 2 series against New Jersey in five-on-five individual scoring chances (14), individual high-danger chances (eight), shots (10), points (seven) and assists (five). He’s also carrying a five-game point streak.  Would it be smart to predict that Martinook himself keeps shooting better than 27 percent, as he did against the Devils? Probably not. He was at 7.33 for the regular season. What about Carolina’s overall on-ice shooting percentage of 21.2? That’s likely to drop, too. If it does, though, Martinook has already done his part. Now, it’ll likely be up to one of Carolina’s other pace-controlling forwards to heat up at the right time. Someone needs to turn those chances into goals, whether it’s Martinook or someone else.  The Rosters  Offensive and Defensive Rating explainer  Advertisement  The same storyline that’s surrounded the Hurricanes through the first two rounds continues into the Eastern Conference finals. Carolina’s without a lot of star power and finishing talent. Up front, they have just one healthy star in Sebastian Aho who has a plus-11 rating. Compare that to Florida, who has three forwards with matching or higher offensive ratings — Carter Verhaeghe (plus-11), Aleksander Barkov (plus-15), and Matthew Tkachuk (plus-27).  Aho’s coming into the third round with five goals and five assists through 11 games. Carolina’s generated the majority of the shots and chances in his five-on-five minutes, and outscored opponents 9-3. Matching up against Nico Hischier in Round 2 proved to be a bit more of a challenge, though. In 30 minutes head-to-head, the Devils had the edge in shot attempts (32-21) and scoring chances (13-8) without the goals to show for it.  Now, Aho will likely see a lot of Barkov and Verhaeghe across the way. That’s a challenge to contain because by the numbers, Aho with Stefan Noesen and Seth Jarvis doesn’t match up to the Panthers’ top line that has Anthony Duclair rounding out the trio. The return of Teravainen should help, but there’s still a wide disparity.  Barkov has netted two goals and nine points through 12 games this postseason, and has fallen below break-even in expected goals at five-on-five. That’s more so from the first half of the postseason, in his matchup with Brad Marchand which was a challenge. Against Toronto, Barkov saw a lot of Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews and managed to maintain the edge in quality chances and keep the Maple Leafs scoreless in that time.  His linemate, Verhaeghe, has been scoring at a point-per-game pace and comes up clutch in big moments for his team. He thrives in transition, and always comes to play this time of year. No one in Florida has had a better influence on the Panthers’ goal-scoring than Verhaeghe, who has increased it by 1.65 goals per 60.  Duclair, the third member of that line, took a few games to get back on the scoresheet this postseason. But to this point in their almost 113 minutes of play, they’re only generating 43 percent of the expected goals share. They did, however, have the clear edge in scoring in that time.  The second line is where the two teams really depart and much of that has to do with Tkachuk, who had an MVP-caliber season that’s carried into the playoffs. Even when the winger wasn’t on the scoresheet last series, he was physical and kept the ice tilted in his minutes. Few players had as strong of an impact on their team’s five-on-five expected and actual goal-scoring in the regular season, and he continues to be among the best this postseason for the Panthers.  Alongside Sam Bennett and Nick Cousins, that line has combined for a 58 percent expected goals rate.  Carolina’s second line is composed of three players with defensive strengths, but less offensive upside between Martinook, Jesperi Kotkaniemi, and Fast. But in Round 2, these players were coming up big on the scoresheet. The big question is whether that can continue since it’s not a part of any of their identities — and if it can keep pace with Florida’s trio across the way.  It’ll probably be Staal’s job to contain Tkachuk and his line, after taking on a lot of Mathew Barzal and Jack Hughes to this point. In his most recent series against Hughes, Staal earned more than 60 percent of the shot and expected goals share at five-on-five, and helped the Canes outscore New Jersey 3-0. Martin Necas can add some scoring to that line, but the task is for Jack Drury to keep up if they match up to Florida’s top offensive line.  While Florida has the clear edge in forward strength at plus-31 to Carolina’s plus-nine, Carolina’s rating is almost double Florida’s on defense.  Jaccob Slavin and Brent Burns lead the way for the Canes, who have rocked a 60.5 percent expected goals rate through two rounds. They’ve dominated their opponents on the scoresheet, outscoring them 13-3 at five-on-five so far. That duo’s offensive rating is actually matched by Aaron Ekblad’s and Gustav Forsling’s across the way — they just aren’t nearly as stout in their own zone.  Carolina’s second pair has a more balanced approach between Brady Skjei and Brett Pesce, but after a strong regular season, they’ve slowed down so far this postseason. This is the duo that shares the workload of going up against top competition with Slavin and Burns, and it likely won’t be any easier this series since Florida has their two best offensive threats split out between their top six.  Florida has the best offensively-rated defenseman on their second pair in Brandon Montour. But it’s an imbalanced duo with Marc Staal at his side.  The third pair is a bit more closely matched, but the Canes once again had the edge here on paper. For Florida, Josh Mahura and Radko Gudas have elevated their game this postseason with good two-way play and the results to match.  Back in goal, Florida has the hotter goalie now that Bobrovsky’s saved 9.32 goals above expected through five games. Whether he can keep that up remains to be seen, or if Lyon can step back up if needed. If he can, that may be key against a team without as much finishing talent as a contender could want.  Carolina, on the other hand, has three options to choose from between Andersen, Antti Raanta, and Pyotr Kochetkov. All three have appeared in a playoff game so far, but right now the starting net belongs to Andersen who has saved 5.48 goals above expected through six games after slotting in for Game 6 against the Islanders. These netminders have a lot of support between the Canes’ aggressive forecheck and strong defense that trickles down the entire lineup. That gives them a bit more security in net even though their opponent has the goaltender coming in hot.  The Key Matchup  Sebastian Aho vs. Aleksander Barkov  It’s not just the pride of the former Southeast Division at stake — it’s also the pride of Finland. Barkov and Aho are two of the best Finnish players in the game and will likely see a lot of each other head-to-head with Staal in charge of the Tkachuk assignment. A true power vs. power matchup.  Going into the playoffs that matchup would lean in Barkov’s favor. The former Selke Trophy winner offers a bit more defensive upside and has the obvious offensive oomph advantage too. The two players score a similar amount, but Barkov’s playmaking is on another level. Aho is great, but it’s hard to imagine many people choosing him over Barkov.  During the playoffs, it’s been the opposite story. Aho has one more point in one fewer game with eight of his 10 coming at five-on-five. Barkov, in contrast, has just three at even strength and on a per-60 basis it’s not close at all: 3.41 for Aho and 0.99 for Barkov. That also extends to each player’s ability to drive play with Carolina earning 58 percent of the expected goals while outscoring opponents 9-3. With Barkov on the ice, Florida has been out-chanced with 47 percent of the expected goals with an even scoreline.  It’s been an unusually rough playoffs for Barkov and if that continues, that tilts the scales further towards Carolina in what should be a close series. Florida’s captain needs to show up and win this matchup — something that’ll be very tough with the way Aho is playing.  The Bottom Line  Series this tight often come down to a single storyline. Maybe Carolina’s depth forwards continue contributing enough goals to keep things on track. Maybe Bobrovsky is the eraser in another four Florida wins. Maybe, maybe, maybe.  Those tiny margins, combined with all those ideological differences we just discussed, give this matchup serious potential. Don’t sleep on the entertainment value. After all, nothing makes for better TV than a Game 7 — and that seems like our potential destination here. Either way, the winner will deserve it.

Last week, Bahamas Department of Meteorology Acting Director Jeffrey Simmons advised Bahamians to prepare for the hurricane season, noting forecasters predicted 13 named storms for the year.    “This year for 2023, the prediction is now out for 13 named storms, six of them to become hurricanes and two of them to become major hurricanes, category 3 and above,” Mr Simmons said at an Office of the Prime Minister press conference.    North Abaco Chief Councillor D’Angelo Edgecombe told The Tribune work had already started on one of the island’s hurricane shelters.    “Last week I had a mechanic come to Coopers Town’s hurricane shelter,” he said. “He would have looked at the generator there and he would have put together a service list for the generator.”  Mr Edgecombe said preparations are “well underway” at this moment. He noted officials do not want to wait until the last minute to ensure emergency supplies, shelters, and operations are in place.    Abaco was ravaged when Hurricane Dorian struck the island on September 1, 2019.  Mr Edgecombe said the trauma of Dorian is still challenging for many residents.  Some Abaconians have decided to leave the island temporally if a major Hurricane was forecast to hit Abaco.    “I’ve spoken with a few people and in the event after monitoring the hurricane if it was to come, they probably will make the decision to leave the island rather than stay this time,” he said.    The chief councillor said homeowners have started putting up their hurricane shutters while others have stocked up on food, gas, and other items.    Another resident, Drexel Bootle, said his house was destroyed by the massive surges of Dorian, with water rising to the ceiling.  “We had to get the house and start from scratch only the frame was here. Thank God I had a little 50 percent insurance,” he said.  Mr Bootle has been able to rebuild the majority of his home.  During the reconstruction of his house, he made hurricane safety adjustments.  “When we started the repairs, everything I did. I was doing well, if a hurricane happens again this is what I’m going to do,” he said.    Meanwhile, Crystal Williams said the high cost of living has made it difficult for residents to adequately prepare for hurricane season.    Ms Williams said: “Persons are strained by the uncontrollable high prices of food, gas, and everyday essential items. The government isn’t even prepared, the promised shelter is not even out of the ground. So, I’m sure that persons will take needed measures to protect their estates and well being.”"

He's a Vietnam veteran, and we’re hurting right now.”  Hurricane Ian ripped through the McBride’s neighborhood in Port Charlotte, leaving their three-bedroom retirement home uninhabitable.  The storm separated the back wall from the home, ripped up the roof in several places, and drenched everything inside.  “It blew in with such a powerful suction that everything got wet… anything that was in here was damaged. They had to totally gut it,” McBride showed ABC Action News.  WFTS  McBrides  McBrides  Nearly eight months later, the couple said they’ve only received enough money from their insurance company, American Integrity, to replace the roof and a temporary back wall.  Even after hiring a public adjuster for help with their claim, they said they’re still pleading with their insurance to help make their home livable.  “We went to these contractors and they gave us estimates — all in the same ballpark of what it's going to take to rebuild our house and when we had our mediation with our carrier, they wanted to pay pennies on the dollar,” McBride expressed. “We could never; we're not rich; we could never rebuild our house like it was before.”  McBride said most estimates are around $220,000, and the cost of supplies is only going up the longer they wait.  According to the McBride’s claims documents, the insurance adjuster estimated about $40,000 in damages.  With their $5,500 deductible, the couple and their public adjuster received a check for $35,000 in November.  The McBrides have also been paying rent to live elsewhere for the last seven months. According to their policy, their insurance covers “loss of use” up to $27,000, which would include having to pay rent, but the company marked the loss of use value at zero.  In contrast, the couple’s public adjuster’s estimate calculates replacement costs at $224,000, with at least $36,000 for loss of use.  “We're defeated and it's just like, what are we going to do?” McBride said emotionally, “We're gonna have to take our claim to court because they leave us no choice.”  The Insurance Information Institute estimates insurance companies will pay $10-$20 billion to Ian-related litigation, in turn contributing to more financial burden and higher premiums for homeowners across the state.  “You can't settle it for literally 20 cents on the dollar… that’s not fair,” explained the McBride’s public adjuster Jerry Daniels with Corbitt Public Adjusting.  Daniels said their company currently has hundreds of Ian victims, with only less than 10% of claims closed. He said many clients came to them in December and January when the 90-day state requirement for insurance companies to pay claims ended, and people received checks far below what they needed.  “The path that we have to take is completely contingent upon the decisions they make. If they were willing to come to the table and be reasonable, we could settle these,” Daniels explained.  We reached out to American Integrity asking about the McBride’s claim. A spokesperson said they can’t “comment on a claim with attorney and/or public adjuster representation.”  “I want my home back. I want to get up and make coffee in my own coffee pot, and I want to bring groceries back here and cook it and put on the table for my husband,” McBride expressed. “Things I always enjoyed doing. It's all taken away from me, and how much longer?”  WFTS  According to the state’s reporting data, the McBride’s claim is one of nearly 110,000 Ian claims still open as of March.  We reached out to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) to ask about the concerns of insurance companies underpaying policies.  A spokesperson for OIR said they are aware of “accusations claiming insurance companies are not fulfilling their obligations to pay out claims.” They confirm they are investigating company claims-handling for Hurricane Ian and are “committed to protecting Floridians in this recovery process.”  We also followed up with the American Policyholder Association (APA). In December, APA Executive Director Doug Quinn said they were already fielding complaints regarding insurance companies. Now he confirms they are specifically recording complaints from those working within the industry.  ""Since the APA focuses on criminal fraud perpetrated by the insurance industry against consumers, we’re not keeping stats on complaints from consumers related to insurer bad faith, but we have received quite a few,"" Quinn responded.  ""The complaints we have been focusing on are related to insurance industry insiders who have come forward with complaints of potential fraud perpetrated to underpay Florida policyholders on their claims. To date, over 30 insurance insiders have reached out, although most wish to remain behind the scenes due to fear of retaliation by the insurance industry,"" he said.  One thing to keep in mind regarding any legal action as a result of Hurricane Ian is that new laws stopping fee multipliers do not apply.  Last year’s second legislative special session addressing Florida’s property insurance crisis took place two months after Hurricane Ian hit. This means that insurance companies still have to pay their policyholder's attorney fees if they’re taken to court and found liable for more damages; this can be up a rate up to $800 an hour.  Insurance companies that have gone insolvent or pulled out of the state in recent years have claimed financial burden from this type of ""runaway litigation.""  According to the Office Of Insurance Regulation, 79,220 lawsuits were filed against insurance companies in 2020, with underwriting losses of more than a billion dollars.  Going forward, carriers won’t have to pay these fees, but public adjusters say this is also worrisome because many homeowners won’t be able to afford help if their claims are denied or underpaid by insurance companies in instances like a hurricane.  American Integrity is one of the largest domestic property insurers in Florida. The company's CEO, Bob Ritchie, spoke to ABC Action News In-Depth Reporter Stassy Olmos about the property insurance crisis one year ago this month.  In an interview, he told Olmos that it had been a seven-year battle to sort through the roof storm damage claims coming in by more than two-dozen daily.  “We have 250 employees; our largest department by staffing and payroll is our legal department,” Ritchie explained. “Of course, there are valid claims. We do our discovery, our adjudication, and some, in fact, are covered,” he said regarding roofing scams.  Here is the full statement from OIR regarding their actions post Hurricane Ian:  “OIR is aware of the accusations claiming insurance companies are not fulfilling their obligations to pay out claims to policyholders. Below is some additional information regarding OIR’s role in the claims-handling process, which may be helpful to your viewers.  OIR encourages consumers who having issues with a claim to report it. OIR works closely with the Dept. of Financial Services (DFS) Division of Consumer Services and Insurance Consumer Advocate to receive claims data and review consumer issues. OIR continues to review claims and complaint data from all stakeholders to evaluate insurers and remains committed to protecting Floridians in this recovery process. OIR is conducting investigations into company claims handling for Hurricane Ian. These investigations are confidential and exempt from public records until the investigation is completed or ceases to be active, per s. 624.319(3)(a)2., F.S.  Following Hurricane Ian, OIR issued numerous data calls to track market impacts and initiated more than 50 market conduction investigations to evaluate aspects of the claims handling process. Based on the findings of an examination or investigation, OIR’s market regulation units may take administrative action, impose administrative penalties, and require corrective action in order to protect insurance consumers from unlawful or harmful business practices.  It’s important to note, that while OIR is conducting investigations into company claims handling for Hurricane Ian, OIR’s market regulation units monitor and enforce insurer and insurance-related entity compliance with the Florida Insurance Code. When conducting an examination or investigation, OIR’s market regulation units take a comprehensive review of all business practices to identify issues such as form compliance, claims handling, insurer communication, proper claims investigation, interest paid on overdue claims, adequate monitoring of third-party administrators and managing general agents, and claims settlements. During these examinations or investigations, OIR’s market regulation units review all applicable information and documentation to identify and resolve alleged violations of Florida law.  I would also note, Governor DeSantis and the Florida Legislature have passed a number of consumer protections as part of the recent insurance reforms, including expediting the claims and communication process and providing OIR with explicit market conduct authority. As a result, OIR will not only be reviewing how insurers are responding to claims subject to previous prompt payment timeframes, but how they plan to update their processes to accommodate shortened timeframes.”  Click here to read about the Hurricane Ian insurance crisis specifically for homeowners with United Property & Casualty."

At the Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Leadership Summit, hundreds of leaders and concerned citizens from across our region met to share ideas about what comes next.  Making Florida more resilient is something ABC Action News has covered extensively in previous reports.  ""There's a lot to do. I guess that's the main message,"" said Rob Young, Director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University.  Young flew into Tampa for the summit and was part of a panel of experts warning communities about best practices and what not to do.  ""From my perspective, long-term sea level rise is potentially a greater problem for most coastal communities than the next storm is. We can rebuild after the next storm. But with long-term sea level rise, we're going to see changes to flooding that are not reversible, that will be unidirectional,"" Young said. ""We're going to have areas flooding that have never flooded before. And this isn't just at the immediate coast; it can also be inland because one of the hidden things that sea level rise does is raise the water table under the land. So if you bring up the level of the Gulf, it takes the water table inland and raises it as well. So when it rains, there isn't as much room for that rain to go into the ground.""  Price of Paradise Hurricane Ian victims sue insurance company for underpaying damage claim Stassy Olmos  Central Florida experienced that during Hurricane Ian. The jarring and heartbreaking images of boats stacked on top of each other on land are seared into our collective memories. But, communities far from the coast will be impacted just as much or worse by future events.  Rebecca Blackwell/AP FILE - Shrimp boats lie grounded atop what was a mobile home park, following the passage of Hurricane Ian, on San Carlos Island in Fort Myers Beach, Fla., Friday, Oct. 7, 2022. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell)  ""The oceanfront is going to be fine. You know, those folks typically have the money to rebuild. And we view those areas as being such strong economic engines that a lot of funding is going to flow into the oceanfront communities to rebuild,"" Young said. ""The people I worry about are people who are inland of the coast, people who didn't even realize they were in a flood zone, or that a hurricane might wipe out their house. Those are the parts of our communities that don't get enough attention. And those are the parts that often get changed the most dramatically by a big storm.""  Young said we can't rebuild the same way following a destructive storm.  ""People seem to think that we can protect the entire map. Well, we can't. And if we try to, we're going to waste money that we could be spending in places that are more sustainable. And so this is what good decision-making is all about. It's like being honest about the places that are really vulnerable and hazardous, making sure we're not spending a ton of public money, just throwing it into the Gulf and spending that money in the places that can sustain the community and the economy over the long run,"" Young said.  Young also had some thoughts when it came to bulldozing homes or letting go of places that aren't sustainable.  ""I don't think anybody ever likes the idea of bulldozing homes. But, for example, every storm is an opportunity, right? Ian bulldozed homes; the government didn't. How we rebuild following Hurricane Ian will say a lot about how we view the future. If we just put absolutely everything back exactly where it was, then we missed an opportunity to take a baby step back, save money and spend money in places where it's a lot more sustainable."""

In Texas, areas near the Gulf Coast often get hit during hurricane season. Businesses and homeowners should adequately prepare against storms to prevent loss of life and property damage.  Annually, about 100 tropical storms and disturbances build up in the Atlantic Ocean, affecting the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. On average, two phenomena become hurricanes and make landfall in the United States. Between 1851 and 2016, 63 out of 289 hurricanes hitting the U.S. made landfall in Texas.  Learning from history will go a long way in ensuring we avoid past mistakes. Hurricanes can cause devastating losses to humans, animals, and property.  Currently, technological advancement helps in early detection and information distribution. Likewise, engineers have developed structural designs that can counter hurricane winds and floods. As an individual, you are responsible for safeguarding your loved ones and valuable properties against a hurricane and its aftermath.  When is Hurricane Season in Texas?  Different regions have different storm seasons during which they experience hurricanes and tropical storms. Hurricane season in Texas occurs during early summer and late fall and peaks in August. However, the season for tropical cyclones in Texas may extend to September and October.  Hurricane season in Texas occurs from early summer to late fall. ©MISHELLA/Shutterstock.com  Texas has 17 recorded hurricane landfalls in August, and only three in October. So, Lone Star State residents should prepare for hurricanes from June until November. According to past data, it is safe to say hurricane peak season is in August and September.  Hurricanes Routes Through Texas  Tropical storms hit Texas through two tracks. Most come in from the southeast and curve north and northeast, crushing the state’s eastern and central parts. Conversely, hurricanes that hit the lower coastline mostly favor the westward track. Examples are:  Corpus Christi’s (1919)  Celia (1970)  Allen (1980)  Charley (1998)  Bret (1999)  Dolly (2008)  Hurricanes hitting early and late in the season (June and October) enter from the south or southwest. The hurricanes head north and northeast across the state with minimal landfall. The reason is that tropical storms from the Eastern Pacific transverse through the Sierra Madre Occidental, the mountain range in Mexico.  Where Do Hurricanes Normally Hit In Texas?  The Texas coast is vulnerable to hurricanes affecting cities from the border, like Brownsville, up to further north in Port Arthur. Galveston and Houston have experienced the most severe storm damage in the last century.  Records between 1527 and 2009 show the following leading areas where hurricanes usually hit in Texas:  Area No. of Hurricanes in the Period Brownsville 20 Galveston 17 Matagorda Bay 10 Corpus Christi 8 Lower TX Coast 5 Sabine 5 Indianola 4 Beaumont 4 High Island 4 Port O’Connor 3 Port Lavaca 2 Entire Coast 2 South Texas 1 Velasco 1  How Often Do Hurricanes Hit Texas?  Texas residents living within the 300 miles along Gulf Coast can expect at least one landfall hurricane every six years. The annual average occurrence of hurricanes or tropical storms per annum is 0.8, or three strikes every four years.  The probability of a strike along a 50-mile segment is between 31% at Sabine Pass to 41% in Matagorda Bay.  Hurricane Cycles in Texas  A 1950s study of hurricane incidences show a pattern in hurricane cycles. According to data dating back to 1829, there are periods during which Texas experiences higher numbers of storms and stronger hurricanes than others. These periods are “hurricane rich.” Conversely, there are also periods of time which are “hurricane poor.”  Hurricane rich periods span 11 years with an average of 8 landfalls per year. Hurricane-poor periods span 14 years with an average of two landfalls per year.  Currently, Texas is entering a hurricane-rich era beginning 2023 up to 2034. In this period, there is a higher probability of experiencing hurricanes. However, a single hurricane’s landfall is enough to make life miserable for Texans living along the coast.  Are There Any Benefits of Hurricanes in Texas?  Victims of a hurricane are always left counting losses. Hurricane winds can reach over 90 mph, accompanied by heavy rainfall and flash flooding, which can be destructive. Although the impacts of hurricanes can be dire, the phenomenon has some benefits to the environment.  In the Lone Star State, there are 11 storms credited with lightening drought conditions. Hurricanes and tropical storms compensate for the shortage of summer rainfall. Without this precipitation, growing corn, rice, and cotton can be challenging because the crops are highly dependent on the extra rain.  Earlier Hurricanes on Record in Texas  The well-documented hurricanes in Texas go back to 1829. Earlier records are limited due to sparse population at the time and few surviving documents. Many ships wrecked in such storms sunk to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico.  However, hurricane data from the 1850s through 2000 shows 120 tropical cyclone strikes, of which 64 were hurricanes. According to the data, the decades with the most hurricane landings are the 1880s and 1940s.  Texas is prone to hurricanes, and many have hit the state. Some storms are particularly notable in history because of the death toll, damages, and magnitude.  Here are some notable hurricanes in Texas history:  Racer’s Storm – October 2-6, 1837  It reigns as the first recorded hurricane to hit the Texas coast. The name originates from a British sloop war that suffered significantly under the hurricane on September 28th. It is regarded as the most destructive hurricane of the 19th century. The Storm covered 2,000 miles and left extreme destruction in its path.  Racer’s Storm made a landfall briefly south of Brownsville near Matamoros. It lashed the coast for three days, from October 2nd through the 4th, before halting. Along the bay, houses suffered heavy destruction, with 105 deaths.  The 1837 hurricane wrecked ships along the Brazos Santiago and Matagorda Bay coast. In Velasco, vessels were driven ashore. The aftermath of the storm affected shipping in Brazos and Velasco immensely.  From October 3rd to October 5th, the hurricane ravished Galveston with a storm surge 6 to 7 feet higher than the normal spring tides.  Major Impacts of Racer’s Storm  Tremont Hotel blew apart  Destruction of two churches  Shifting of the harbor entrance  Ships shoved inland as far as three miles  The Great Galveston Hurricane – September 7 – 9, 1900  This was the last and most devastating hurricane of the 19th century. The 1900 Galveston Hurricane towers alone in United States history regarding deaths. The most common estimate is 8,000 deaths.  In 1900, Galveston’s population was close to 30,000. Memories of past hurricane destruction were still fresh for Texans. These included Santiago in 1844, Clarksville in 1876, and Indianola in 1875 and 1886. Many people died and lost their properties.  A warning on October 6 from a hurricane post along the Gulf Coast caused about 20,000 residents to evacuate, saving many lives. Yet some residents ignored the alarm, while the adventurous wanted to observe the incoming storm. On the 8th, beaches were crowded with observers, who retreated when a wooden pagoda and its boardwalk were torn to pieces by the raging storm. For many, it was too late.  The winds of 100 mph blew off the anemometer at the weather station. Additionally, winds over 125 mph sent violent waters 15 feet high, covering Galveston. Wooden shelters were torn off their pilings and floated on flood water while smashing into one another. The destruction of houses led to more deaths as unfortunate occupants drowned in the raging waters.  Major Impacts of the Galveston Hurricane:  Destruction of the state’s old first capitol building at West Columbia  Partial abandonment of Quintana due to severe damage from the previous year’s hurricane and the current one  Infestation of Flour Bluff Harbor by millions of mullet and trout in their avoidance of the catastrophe  Over 8 inches of rainfall in Alvin  Galveston as a port was lost  Due to the hurricane, a project to raise Galveston’s elevation began. This public works project sought to build a concrete seawall three miles long and 17 feet high. Fortunately, the wall has successfully prevented hurricane tragedies with such dire consequences. With the increase in population, people are settling beyond seawall protection.  Corpus Christi’s – September 14-16th, 1919  Corpus Christi’s devastating hurricane of 1919 originated east of the Virgin Islands on September 1st. And on the 11th, Texas authorities sounded the alarm. Galveston residents took no chances and prepared for the incoming hurricane.  Major Impacts of Corpus Christi’s Hurricane:  4.75 inches of rainfall in Brownsville  Padre and Brazos Islands submerged  10-foot storm surge along the Matagorda peninsula, causing damage to agriculture  1,500 cattle perished  284 deaths  S.A.U. & G. railroad west of Odem washed out  Destruction of cotton crop and summer houses in Victoria  Steamship Media lifted onto the docks at Port Aransas  Estimated damages amounting to $20 million  Hurricane Harvey – August 2017  This category four hurricane is the most recent powerful storm to make landfall in Texas and Louisiana in August 2017. As a result, there were catastrophic floods, and over 100 people died. In fact, it is ranked as the costliest hurricane in the U.S., with an estimated $125 billion in damages.  Harvey is the first significant hurricane to land after a break of 12 years since Katrina in 2005. Within the four days of the storm, rainfall rose to more than 40 inches as the hurricane meandered over Eastern Texas.  The resulting floods destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes, displacing more than 30,000 residents. Rescue operations helped more than 17,000 people.  Major Impacts of Hurricane Harvey:  300,0000 structures destroyed  500,000 vehicles damaged  Spawned 53 tornadoes across six states  Total deaths 107 (103 in Texas, two in Arkansas, one in Kentucky, and one in Tennessee)  68 direct deaths in Texas, the highest number in the state since 1919  Hurricane Harvey caused massive property damage. © – License  What Part of Texas is the Safest from Hurricanes?  In the U.S., hurricanes are common, with the Lone Star State getting the most hurricanes annually. So, what part of Texas is safest during hurricane season?  It’s difficult to say any single part of Texas is safe from hurricanes because hundreds of storms have hit the state between 1950 and 2021. However, by following the available data, you can pinpoint cities with a lower risk.  These are areas of Texas least likely to be hit by a hurricane:  Amarillo College Station El Paso Huntsville Laredo Midlands Nacogdoches Rockwall Schertz Victoria  In conclusion, Texas is an excellent state, but residents should be aware of hurricane season. For example, you should heed warnings and evacuate according to procedures. Remember to pack necessities and stow away valuables that floods can destroy. And never leave your pets behind!  Up Next:"

Having a hurricane-tracking app can ensure you stay safe and informed.  While many weather apps provide general storm alerts, most of them aren’t quite geared toward providing information specific to hurricanes. And many iOS users have found themselves a bit lost after Apple shut down its highly popular weather app Dark Sky on Jan. 1.  Here are some of the best hurricane trackers you can download on iOS and Android to stay up-to-date with the latest weather alerts, storm predictions and more this hurricane season.

Here's the latest predictions and how to prepare:  First storm in 2023 hurricane season:First subtropical storm of 2023 Atlantic hurricane season happened in January, says NHC  My Hurricane Tracker  My Hurricane Tracker is a simple app that provides comprehensive tools for tracking cyclones, tornadoes, tropical storms and weather warnings. The simple interface makes the app a breeze and doesn’t overwhelm users with too much information.  Opening the app up, you’ll be prompted to give it access to your location and to send push notifications — both of which are used to provide push alerts for warnings relevant to users from the National Weather Service.  The interactive tracking maps use the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s forecast map and satellite imagery where available, plus a five-day outlook.  Free features  Perhaps the app’s most convenient part of the app is the fact that all of its features are available to users absolutely free. There is a small, nonintrusive banner ad at the bottom of the app, but it remains otherwise clutter-free.

Unlike the other two apps, Emergency is best used to supplement other weather apps. It does provide maps for upcoming storms and shelter locations, but you won’t be using the app to see if you need to grab your umbrella on your way to work.  Once you go through the app’s quick onboarding process, scroll down to “Live Location” under “Locations” and enable live monitoring. If you haven’t already, it will prompt you to grant the app access to your phone’s location. Click on your location and then the bell icon to take a look at all of the alerts you can customize, including high alerts, hurricanes, tropical cyclones, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, high winds and more.  Advanced options will allow you to customize these further. For instance, tapping on “Hurricanes” will allow you to change how you want alerts for hurricane warnings or watches delivered to you. You can even set these to override “Do Not Disturb.”  Free features  The app is completely free and has no ads.

Where Clime shines is its robust hurricane, precipitation, storm, wildfire and lightning trackers. As soon as you jump into the app, you’re prompted to customize the alerts you want to receive and you’ll be prompted to share your location.  From there, you’re dropped directly into a radar map based on your location. Clicking on various locations on the map will bring up advanced weather forecasts, including precipitation outlooks that will tell you how soon rain will start and estimate how much rainfall the area might receive.  Going back to the radar, you can swap between different maps, similar to Google Maps, to change your view from radar to precipitation, temperature and snow depth forecasts (you never know with Florida). The best part is the app’s ability to allow you to stack these overlays over the hurricane tracker to provide a gratuitous amount of information about impending storms.

Wood said, late August through mid-September has been the most likely time for a hurricane to make landfall on the Texas coast, but there have been tropical storms in May and hurricanes can come as late as November.  In the last six years, the southeast United States and Gulf Coast has seen six hurricanes make landfall, Wood said, four Category 4 storms with windspeeds of 130 to 156 miles per hour and two Category 5’s with windspeeds more than 156 mph. Wind isn’t the only danger when it comes to hurricanes; extreme rainfall can extend many miles beyond the high wind speeds, resulting in catastrophic flooding which may make evacuation nearly impossible.  According to Rea, understanding and preparing for hurricane risks helps USACE employees prepare themselves and their families for emergencies, as well as expedite assisting communities outside Galveston.  ENGLink Pro is an important program for Emergency Management, Rea said. Everyone should keep their EngLink Pro account up to date.  The Galveston District now has its own Emergency Management Planning and Response Team, Rea said, and those interested in volunteering during an emergency should keep their emergency profiles up to date and ask EM for more information.  “We are emergency support function number three, critical public facilities,” Rea said. “After Hurricane Harvey rained over east Texas for days, many important public buildings were flooded and unsafe. SWG teams set up a temporary mayor’s office and temporary schools for Orangefield Independent School District and Mauriceville ISD in Texas.”  Accountability is a commander’s top priority in an emergency, Rea said, so USACE employees should check their Alert! Client Account Dashboard today and update any changes, using their primary phone number and email address to facilitate accountability and receive the unit’s emergency messaging.  According to Teri Conley, SWG Emergency Management Specialist, Another tool for accountability is ADPAAS, the Army Disaster Personnel Accountability and Assessment System, and it should be updated along with Alert! and EngLink. Updating ADPAAS shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.  Links & Resources:  Visit the Houston/Galveston National Weather Service at: https://www.weather.gov/hgx/"

In September 2020 Hurricane Sally made landfall in Gulf Shores as a category 2.  It would cause mostly flooding and beach erosion issues across northwest, Florida and much of the Wiregrass.  In Andalusia last week, the Alabama Emergency Management Agency held a simulated hurricane drill for some 18 southern counties in the state. Coffee County E.M.A. Director, James Brown, took part.  Brown says with limited storm shelters, Florida and Alabama authorities say they will work on getting storm evacuees moving north to Montgomery, Birmingham, and even Huntsville.  “It’s not just Florida but Mississippi and then if the storm is bad enough we can get people from the coast of Georgia coming all the way over here to be evacuated. We need to practice these things between the states and make sure everybody knows how to do this,” says Brown.  Brown says E.M.A. Directors will do their best in helping move Florida storm evacuees to points further north of the Wiregrass.  But, they must also make sure residents in sub-standard housing have a safe place to go in the event of a hurricane making its way into southeast Alabama."

Active disturbances or waves have always been given “invest” numbers, but these were never included in the text forecast in the past.  However, beginning this year, the National Hurricane Center will include these numbers in their text summary when one is issued for a disturbance.  For Atlantic systems, invests will be identified by the two letters “AL” followed by a two-digit number starting with 9 (i.e. AL 90).

They are among the storm names you could hear when the six-month-long Atlantic hurricane season kicks off.  The season officially begins June 1, and forecasters, in general, predict a near- to slightly below-average year. This is in part because of the influence of an expected El Niño, which tends to reduce Atlantic hurricane activity.  A typical year averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.  A tropical storm gets a name when its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane when its winds reach 74 mph.  The World Meteorological Organization, based in Geneva, chooses hurricane names several years in advance, based on a strict criteria. If a hurricane is particularly deadly or costly, its name is ""retired"" by the WMO and replaced by another one.  Here comes El Niño:Scientists warn an El Niño is likely coming that could bring scorching heat to Earth  Here is the list of names for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season:  Arlene  Bret  Cindy  Don  Emily  Franklin  Gert  Harold  Idalia  Jose  Katia  Lee  Margot  Nigel  Ophelia  Philippe  Rina  Sean  Tammy  Vince  Whitney  If all 21 names are used this year, there is a supplemental list of 21 names that will be used after Whitney. Here is that list, from the WMO:  Adria  Braylen  Caridad  Deshawn  Emery  Foster  Gemma  Heath  Isla  Jacobus  Kenzie  Lucio  Makayla  Nolan  Orlanda  Pax  Ronin  Sophie  Tayshaun  Viviana  Will  Before 2021, the Greek alphabet was used if the primary list was exhausted, using such names as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and beyond. But that naming system has been discontinued, partly because of confusion over the Greek alphabet.  Hurricane forecast:How bad will the 2023 hurricane season be? Why this year's forecast comes with 'large uncertainty'  Why – and how – do hurricanes get names?  Before they started naming storms, hurricane forecasters had to refer to storms by saying something like ""the storm 500 miles east-southeast of Miami."" But six hours later, the storm's position would change.  Also, when more than one storm was going on at the same time, making it clear which storm was being described made the job even harder.  In 1953, the U.S. began using female names for hurricanes. By 1979, male and female names were being used. The names alternate between male and female.  Here's how to pronounce all of the 2023 hurricane names.  The names are in alphabetical order, and each new storm gets the next name on the list.  There are no Q, U, X, Y or Z names because of the lack of usable names that begin with those letters.  Retired hurricane names:Ian, Fiona retired from list of hurricane names because of 2022 death and destruction  Eastern Pacific hurricane names  There is a separate list for tropical storms and hurricanes that form in the eastern Pacific Ocean:  Adrian  Beatriz  Calvin  Dora  Eugene  Fernanda  Greg  Hilary  Irwin  Jova  Kenneth  Lidia  Max  Norma  Otis  Pilar  Ramon  Selma  Todd  Veronica  Wiley  Xina  York  Zelda  Eastern Pacific hurricanes seldom have any direct impact on the U.S., though they can batter the west coast of Mexico. The eastern Pacific season began on May 15, more than two weeks earlier than the Atlantic season.  There is a separate list of names for Central Pacific hurricanes, which can occasionally hit Hawaii. In addition, there are separate lists for typhoons in the western Pacific and tropical cyclones in Australia and the Indian Ocean."

Related: FBI investigation into Trump-Russia collusion relied on shaky intelligence, says John Durham report – live updates  The Durham report was sharply critical of how the FBI decided to open the counterintelligence investigation into Trump, known as “Crossfire Hurricane”, accusing top officials at the bureau of relying on raw and uncorroborated information to continue the inquiry.  Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified.  The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on “raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence” in a “departure from how it approached” the Clinton campaign.  But Durham’s inquiry failed to uncover any blockbuster revelations suggesting the bureau targeted Trump out of political motivations, and the report at times came across as a defense of his lengthy investigation.  Also contained in the report:  Durham said the FBI was more cautious of allegations of foreign influence when it came to the Clinton campaign, and did not pursue evidence in two cases of foreign governments trying to gain influence with Clinton while providing defensive briefings, unlike with the Trump campaign;  Durham said the FBI was overly reliant on investigative tips from Trump’s political opponents and did not rigorously analyze the information it received, which extended the investigation and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump;  Durham said the FBI decided to move ahead with Crossfire Hurricane despite a lack of information from the intelligence community that corroborated the hypothesis on which it was predicated and FBI agents ignored information that exonerated key people in the case;  Durham suggested that Crossfire Hurricane was “triggered” by the so-called Steele dossier, when it was in fact based on a tip from an Australian diplomat in London that a Trump campaign aide appeared to have advance knowledge about Russia releasing damaging information on Clinton.  The top FBI officials who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and left the bureau years ago have long maintained that they had a duty to investigate allegations that Russia, a strategic US adversary, was seeking to garner influence with Trump, who had no experience in government.  The delivery of the report to the attorney general Merrick Garland and to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees several hours before it was made public, largely marks the end of the nearly four-year investigation led by Durham.  Durham’s appointment as special counsel by former attorney general William Barr was unusual in that he was essentially tasked with investigating a different special counsel – Mueller.  The investigation was beset by controversy, including when Barr pressed Durham to draft an interim report just before the 2020 election, a directive that gave rise to allegations of improper political interference.  In September 2020, according to the New York Times, one of the prosecutors on Durham’s team and former acting US attorney Nora Dannehy discovered that other members of the team had written a draft report that she had not been told about.  Dannehy was reportedly furious and told Durham that no report should be issued before the investigation had been completed and especially not relying on disputed information that could impact the election. Dannehy sent her colleagues a memo about her concerns and resigned.  While Trump once predicted that Durham would uncover the “crime of the century”, the investigation proved to be defective in court. Two people he charged were acquitted in court, and only the former FBI lawyer who altered an email to help prepare a wiretap application pleaded guilty.  After the second acquittal – Igor Danchenko, a researcher who was a primary source for the 2016 dossier alleging Trump’s ties to Russia was found not guilty about lying to the FBI about where he got his information – Democrats called for Durham’s team to be shut down as a waste of taxpayer money.  The Durham report ended without recommending any wholesale changes at the FBI, but suggested the creation of a position at the bureau to provide oversight of politically sensitive investigations with the power to challenge every step of investigations, including for wiretaps.  Durham’s investigation was recorded as costing about $6.5m as of last December. Durham, a longtime federal prosecutor who was the US attorney in Connecticut during the Trump administration, was allowed to stay in his role by the current attorney general until the completion of his work.  Two cases that Durham took to court ended in failure. Last year, a jury found cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussman not guilty of lying to the FBI. A jury also found Danchenko not guilty of making false statements to the FBI in October, in a case argued personally by Durham.  Durham extracted a guilty plea from Clinesmith, who was sentenced to one year of probation after admitting in a 2020 plea agreement that he had altered a government email that a colleague then used to justify to a secret surveillance court the wiretap of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page."

Four-star 2024 cornerback Dakoda Fields told Greg Biggins of 247 Sports that he is planning on visiting the Miami football visit after naming the Hurricanes in his top seven. It has been a big recruiting weekend for Miami.  After Pittsburgh rallied from a 4-2 deficit the Miami Hurricanes baseball team scored a run in the top of the seventh and held on for a 5-4 win to clinch the series. Andrew Walter recorded the last seven outs allowing one hit and registering four strikeouts for his ninth save. Miami plays at FIU on Tuesday night.  Fields spoke with Biggins after announcing his top seven this weekend. Miami, Oregon and USC are currently scheduled to receive an official visit from Fields in June. Secondary coach Jahmile Addae is leading the recruitment for Fields. Fields spoke about a prior visit with Miami and his relationship with Addae.  The additions of defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and wide receiver Ty Harrell over the weekend moved the Miami 2023 transfer class to ninth nationally. Miami also added junior college transfer WR Shemar Kirk on Saturday who does not count towards the 2023 Miami transfer class.  Miami addressed some key positions in this second transfer window with additions at defensive tackle, cornerback, wide receiver, and running back. Most importantly, I think they got quality at those spots and not just bodies to fill a hole. Eager to see these guys in action. — Gaby Urrutia (@GabyUrrutia247) May 13, 2023  The Miami football program hosted five-star prospects, cornerback Ellis Robinson, linebacker Jadon Perlotte and wide receiver Mylan Graham and four-stars, tight ends Caleb Odom and Brock Schott, athlete Brauntae Johnson, safety Jaylen Heyward and LB Nathaniel Owusu-Boateng in Coral Gables this weekend.  USA Today’s College Sports Wire wrote about “One must-see game in each week of the 2023 season.” Texas A&M at Miami week three was named honorable mention. Miami at Florida State was named the game to watch in week 11. Florida State was also named the game of week four when the Seminoles play at Clemson.  Kamren Kinchens is the top returning Power Five safety for 2023 as tweeted by Pro Football Focus on Sunday. Kinchens received a 90.0 grade from PFF during the 2022 season. Aubrey Banks of West Virginia was second with an 84.9 grade. Only two other ACC safeties are ranked in the PFF top 10."

Dallas moves on to play first-year Stars coach Pete DeBoer’s former team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Game 1 of the West final is Friday night in Las Vegas.  DeBoer improved to 7-0 in Game 7s, this being the fourth team he led to a win in the finale of a best-of-seven series that went the distance.  Darryl Sutter and Scott Bowman are the only other coaches to do that.  It was the fourth time in five seasons the Stars got a Game 7 — the others were all away from home. They hadn’t won a Game 7 at home since 2000, when they made the Stanley Cup Final. In the only other Game 7 they hosted at American Airlines Center, the Stars lost 6-1 to St. Louis in a second-round series in 2016.  Johnston made it 2-0 with 7:12 left, when he gathered a puck that ricocheted off the back boards to the left of the Seattle net. He then sent a shot that went off the shoulder and mask of goalie Phillip Grubauer before going into the net.  Advertisement  Grubauer stopped 26 shots, two weeks after making 32 saves when Seattle won at Colorado 2-1 in another Game 7 to knock out last year’s Stanley Cup champion.  Hintz’s ninth goal of the playoffs was credited as an unassisted tally and came with 4:01 left in the second period, the deepest in this series any game got before a score.  Oliver Bjorkstrand scored with 17.6 seconds left, preventing the shutout for 24-year-old Stars goalie Jake Oettinger, who finished with 21 saves.  It was exactly one year after Oettinger’s 64-save performance in another Game 7 — a 3-2 loss at Calgary after Johnny Gaudreau’s OT goal ended the first-round series.  The 24-year-old Oettinger improved to 5-0 after losses this postseason. He allowed four goals on 18 shots during Game 6 in Seattle on Saturday, when he was pulled 4 1/2 minutes into the second period.  Dallas and Las Vegas will meet in the Western Conference Final for the second time in four seasons. The Stars beat the DeBoer-coached Golden Knights in five games in 2020, the postseason that was played in the NHL’s bubble in Toronto and Edmonton during the pandemic.  Advertisement  NOTES  HURRICANES: Teuvo Teravainen’s roughly monthlong injury absence appears to be near an end.  The Carolina Hurricanes’ forward has shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice Monday ahead of the Eastern Conference Final against Florida. Teravainen hasn’t played since he suffered a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders.  It’s unclear exactly when he might be ready to play, though his return would be a lift for a team that has kept advancing despite injuries to top-line forwards.  “I think I’m pretty much ready to go,” Teravainen said after Monday’s practice. “So whenever coach puts me out there, I’ll be good.”  Rod Brind’Amour wouldn’t say definitively when that would be, though he noted the extra rest from the series schedule — still unset as of Monday’s practice — could help.  Advertisement  “He’s healthy enough,” Brind’Amour said. “It’s just whether or not he can play. … I’m not going to throw him in if he can’t shoot.”  Teravainen was hurt when New York’s Jean-Gabriel Pageau struck the forward’s hands in an uncalled slashing penalty, with an angry Brind’Amour saying afterward that Pageau “absolutely tomahawk chops him, absolutely.”  At the time, Brind’Amour had said Teravainen had a broken hand that would require surgery. More specifically, the injury turned out to be Teravainen’s left thumb, evidenced by the thick pinkish-brown scar running through the center and along the length of his thumb that was visible as he spoke to reporters in the locker room.  He had recently returned to skating with a few teammates and had been building up his on-ice work. On Monday, that meant rotating in on the penalty kill and other stretches of practice.  Wednesday marks four weeks since the April 19 injury, with surgery following the next day.  SUNDAY’S LATE GAME  Advertisement  GOLDEN KNIGHTS 5, OILERS 2: Jonathan Marchessault scored three goals for his second career postseason hat trick as visiting Vegas beat Edmonton in Game 6 of their second-round series to advance to the Western Conference final.  Reilly Smith and William Karlsson also scored for the Golden Knights, and Ivan Barbashev had two assists. Adin Hill finished with 39 saves.  Connor McDavid and Warren Foegele scored early in the first period for Edmonton, which led 2-1 less than three minutes into the game. Stuart Skinner gave up four goals on 17 shots through two periods, and Jack Campbell stopped all four shots he faced in the third.  Vegas is back in the NHL semifinals for the fourth time in the franchise’s six-year history, and will next face the winner of the series between Dallas and Seattle, which heads to a Game 7 on Monday night.  « Previous  Next »"

Louisiana-Monroe defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and junior college wide receiver Shemar Kirk committed to Miami on Saturday. The Miami baseball team dropped the second of a three-game series in a 7-4 loss at Pittsburgh on Saturday.  Campbell provides the Miami Hurricanes football program with needed size on the DL at 6’7 and 283 pounds. Campbell spent two seasons at Louisiana-Monroe and was at Independence Kansas Junior College for a pair of seasons prior to that. Campbell had 13 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack at Louisiana Monroe.  Kirk comes to Miami from Reedley California Community College. Miami gains an explosive and speedy receiver that had 76 receptions for 1,446 yards a 19.0 yards per catch average and 15 touchdowns per Gaby Urruita of Inside the U. At 6’1 and 190 pounds Kirk will provide Miami with size as well as speed on the outside.  The Miami Hurricanes baseball team took a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. Pittsburgh answered with a grand slam by Kyle Hess and never looked back. Zach Levenson had three hits in five at-bats with a home run and two RBIs on Saturday for Miami. Miami Hurricanes pitchers issued 10 walks on Saturday.  Kirk is the second transfer WR Miami has added in as many days. Former Alabama and Louisville WR Tyler Harrell committed to Miami on Friday. Mario Cristobal finally was able to add the WRs he said were priorities during his Early National Signing Day press conference in December. Miami has added critical speed offensively.  Miami also had a key weekend hosting recruits. Five-star prospects, DL David Stone and WR Mylan Graham visited Miami this weekend. Ohio State is the prohibitive favorite to receive a commitment from Graham. Oklahoma is a big favorite for a commitment from Stone who is the second-ranked 2024 DL."
