Weldy, 90, was a native of Michigan and a longtime resident of Findlay.  He was born on November 12th, 1932 and passed away on May 13th.  Weldy is a member of the Hancock Sports Hall of Fame and left quite a legacy.  Findlay celebrated Weldy Olson night on November 2nd, 2018.  Cliff Browne and Rich Fowler joined WFIN’s Chris Oaks to talk about that and other memories of Weldy.  Rich said Weldy was always helping out others.  “Whether it was his kids, whether it was for the Findlay Area Hockey Association, whether it was for the Findlay Trojan Hockey Team he was always a fixture out there at the games.”  Cliff said Weldy was very, very patriotic.  “Whenever you saw him, he pretty much had his medals somewhere nearby because he wanted people to know that the USA went in there in that timeframe and beat the Russians.”  Weldy’s obituary states that friends may call at Fassbender Swanson Hansen Funeral and Cremation Services on Saturday, June 10, beginning at 10 am until the time of service at 11 am. Rev.  A reception will follow in the funeral home reception room. Interment will be in the Park Cemetery.  Condolences may be expressed online at fassbenderswansonhansen.com.  In lieu of flowers, donations may be mailed in remembrance of Weldy to Bridge Home Health and Hospice, 15100 Birchaven Lane, Findlay Ohio 45840."

Cincinnati Bearcats running back Charles McClelland was one of those players. McCelland was one of the bigger-school prospects to land with the Titans.  #Bearcats running back Charles McClelland is signing with the Tennessee Titans as a UDFA. — Justin Williams (@Williams_Justin) April 29, 2023  McClelland was extremely productive for the Bearcats in 2022. McClelland led the Bearcats in rushing with 849 yards and seven touchdowns via 146 attempts (5.8 yards per carry). A dual-threat option, McClelland accounted for 965 total yards of offense by adding 14 receptions and 116 receiving yards to his offensive totals.  McClelland was a big-play threat. McClelland was an explosive game-breaker who rushed for 30-plus yards on six different rushing attempts, and 60-plus yards on two separate carries. McClelland rushed for 100-plus yards in three contests for Cincinnati.  McClelland did not test particularly well at Cincinnati’s Pro Day. He ran the 40-yard dash in a disappointing 4.56 seconds. Mcclelland also leaped a 32-inch vertical. McClelland’s testing results led to a lackluster 2.36 Relative Athletic Score. McClelland relies on instincts and football I.Q. as opposed to high-level athletic traits. The Titans prioritized athletes via undrafted free agency. McClelland was an exception to that rule.  Charles McClelland is a RB prospect in the 2023 draft class. He scored a 2.36 #RAS out of a possible 10.00. This ranked 1335 out of 1745 RB from 1987 to 2023. https://t.co/eUWyTZJnVv #Titans pic.twitter.com/BE58sH3KhK — Kent Lee Platte (@MathBomb) May 1, 2023  McClelland has a difficult path to Tennessee’s 53-man roster. Derrick Henry remains a workhorse back. The Titans drafted Tyjae Spears with a top-100 selection. Spears is guaranteed a role as a chance-of-pace back.  The Titans also have last year’s fourth-rounder Hassan Haskins, who is an outstanding special teams player. McClelland’s opportunity could arrive if the Titans decide to keep four running backs on the initial 53-man roster (which they did last season). In that case, McClelland would be competing with 2022 undrafted free agent Julius Chestnut.  We’re excited to monitor McClelland’s progress throughout training camp and the preseason."

Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s goals in the first leg meant that it was a tall order if Milan were to reach the final in Istanbul next month, and there was to be no miracle comeback last night as Inter won again – this time 1-0 – thanks to Lautaro Martinez’s goal.  It means that the Rossoneri have now been beaten without scoring in four straight games against their city rivals, which comes amid a torrid stretch of form against the lower-rankings sides in Serie A too.  Maldini spoke to SportMediaset after the game and he was asked in particular about the gap with Inter in terms of ability and squad depth, something which he recognised was there before alluding to a lack of tactics to combat the Nerazzurri.  “The gap is real: there hasn’t been a contest in the last four games. Today we played a little better, but it was compromised by the result in the first leg,” he said (via MilanNews).  “It’s Inter’s way of playing that bothers us and we’re unable to find countermeasures, then we’ve also struggled against teams less strong than Inter in the recent period…”"

The 'Big Three' of Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer have dominated the ATP Tour for nearly two decades but age and injury have been catching up with them in recent years.  Top seed Djokovic's 6-2 4-6 6-2 defeat by Rune on Wednesday means that for the first time in 19 years neither the Serb nor the injured Nadal will play in the Rome final.  Djokovic, who has now lost two in a row to Rune, said the next generation of players led by world number two Carlos Alcaraz is like a breath of fresh air for the sport.  ""A new generation is here already,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""Alcaraz is number one in the world from Monday, obviously he's playing amazing tennis. I think it's also good for our sport that we have new faces, new guys coming up.  ""We've been saying this for years that we can expect that moment to come when you have a kind of shift of generations.  ""I'm personally still trying to hang in there with all of them. I still have the hunger to keep going. Let's see how far I'm going to play.""  Nadal and Djokovic share the record for most men's Grand Slams with 22 titles each, while Federer won 20 before retiring last year, but the gruelling Tour is taking a heavy toll on their bodies.  Nadal has not played since injuring his hip at the Australian Open in January and has missed the claycourt swing ahead of the French Open, where he is a 14-times champion.  Djokovic, who battled an elbow injury recently, called for the physio during his match against Rune and took a painkiller to get him through it.  When asked if Roland Garros would be the most open tournament in years, Djokovic smiled and said: ""It depends if Nadal plays or not.  ""But next to him Alcaraz, Rune - these guys are right there in contention, some of the biggest favourites to win the title.""

The day-long trip was enjoyed by 35 seniors with Happy Wanderers Coordinator Linda Ruehrmund, a retired Cardington teacher.  The group climbed aboard a comfortable bus in Mount Gilead and enjoyed a ride to the Great Lakes Museum on the Maumee River in Toledo. There the group heard from archaeologist Terri Stolden who studies ship wrecks on Lake Erie.  Stolden told the story of exploring several of the 600 shipwrecks in Lake Erie and some of the history of the estimated 2,000 shipwrecks in the Great Lakes.  Participants had an hour to tour the museum with its exhibits about the Great Lakes. There were many artifacts from ships and shipwrecks along with hands-on experiences and videos.  Following lunch at Tony Packo’s restaurant, noted for its connection to Jamie Farr in the TV series “MASH,” the group travelled to Tiffin’s American Civil War Museum.  This unique community museum is run by volunteers in a repurposed United States Post Office. It has many displays about Ohio’s contribution to the Civil War, along with information about Civil War prison camps, clothing and uniforms of the war, and progress of trains and telegraph of the era.  Happy Wanderers is open to all who enjoy travel and fellowship. The group is in its 26th year and was founded by Ruehrmund. Wanderers come from all over Morrow and Marion counties.  An additional nine trips are scheduled this year. Most are in Ohio with the exception of the Sight and Sounds Theater in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  The remaining trips include the following:  • May 23: A matinee “Dear Soldier Boy” at the Ohio Star Theater with lunch and shopping in Walnut Creek, Ohio.  • June 23: Malabar Farms and Kingwood Gardens with lunch at Malabar Farm Restaurant.  • July 13: “Tied up in Knotts,” the story of Don Knotts of the Andy Griffith Show told by his daughter, along with lunch and shopping at Walnut Creek.  • Aug. 17: Indian Lake boat ride – a pontoon boat ride with a stop for lunch.  • Sept. 21: “Grumpy Old Men,” a musical comedy with dinner at LaComedia in Springboro, Ohio.  • Oct. 4: Jack Pine Studio in Laurelville, Ohio, glass blowing and other craft demonstrations with lunch in Circleville, Ohio.  • Nov. 11 is a Saturday Mystery Trip, “Timeless Treasures,” a red, white and blue day.  • Nov. 16-18: “Miracle of Christmas,” at the Sight and Sount Theater in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with additional activities to be announced.  • Nov. 29: “Miracle on 34th Stree” at LaComedia in Springboro, Ohio.  • Dec. 12: Ohio Star Theater, “Rhythm of the Dance,” followed by a visit to the David Warther Museum of carving.

The lease was days from coming due, and we needed to downsize. But the real deal is that on this planet, that car could have got me shot. Three times in the past few months, I’d inadvertently gotten into other people’s cars — all the same make, model, and color — parked in various parking lots throughout Santa Barbara, only to realize I had entered into someone else’s unlocked four-wheeled abode. And no, I didn’t steal anything. Fortunately, no one was home at the time. Two White cheerleaders in Texas — not so lucky — recently got shot for doing the same thing.  Naturally, none of this was my fault. It was my car’s.  It’s a perfectly fine car — better than that, even. It’s a RAV4 hybrid, a dignified, professional-looking charcoal gray. Good visibility, commodious, and pseudo-responsible from an ecological standpoint when it comes to greenhouse emissions. It is, however, the single most anonymous, invisible car on the road — perhaps the planet — a steel-ish tortoise shell on four wheels that pretends to be a compact SUV. Every Saturday afternoon at thousands of shopping malls across America, thousands of hapless Dagwoods — zombie dads — can be seen clicking their key fobs in the vain hope of finding their RAV4 via echolocation.  It’s a wonder more of them haven’t been shot.  It’s a wonder so many leave their cars unlocked.  Fortunately, my backup car doesn’t have the same issues. That’s because it’s a bike. And absolutely no one will ever accidentally happen to just hop on it, either. Back when I got it 37 years ago, my bike was custom-built — by local builder Mike Celmins — to suit the idiosyncratic geometry of my body parts. But in the intervening years, I’ve beat the crap out of it. Only remnants of the original sky-blue paint remain, and most of the frame is covered with semi-oxidized blotches of naked steel tubing. Functionally, however, it’s a thing of joy — imagine careening downhill on the equivalent of a steel coat hanger. It’s a mechanical miracle that makes me grin like a fool, at least for a moment, no matter how pissy the mood inhabiting me.  I mention all this because it’s National Bike to Work Month. I am told Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse and Goleta Mayor Paula Perotte will celebrate this event by ceremonially riding bikes off Stearns Wharf in municipal tandem.  I mention it as well because in America, you are what you drive as much as what you eat, with whom you fornicate, or what — or perhaps whom — you happen to shoot. The numbers in this regard are not what they could be. In America, we have 336 million people, 466 million guns, 278 million cars, and only 100 million bikes. Of the 154 million people who work, 116 million drive to the job. All but 10 million of those drive alone. According to the U.S. Census, only 616,000 bike to work.  John Burke | Credit: Jeff Kennel  For a host of obvious reasons, cycling to work is not a viable option for everybody. But for many it is. Given that 70 percent of all trips taken in the United States are less than two miles, the bike could be used a whole lot more than it is. (Given that we’ve already had 200 mass shootings this year, we can also say the gun could be used less. And no, those two Texas cheerleaders don’t qualify as a mass shooting.)  Given our climate, weather, and geography, there’s no reason why Santa Barbara isn’t the bike commuting capital of the world. Throw in the exhilarating emergence of the e-bike and it should make it the capital of the universe — and yes, I know, those kids are out of control. In a recent podcast with Trek Bikes mogul — and part-time Santa Barbara resident — John Burke and Trisalyn Nelson, chair of UCSB’s Geography Department and emerging brainiac in bicycle activist circles, Burke observed that 35 percent of all trips made in Copenhagen — that’s in Denmark — are made by bike. Even in Copenhagen’s cold and wet Decembers, he said, the number is 35 percent. But in sunny, beautiful, and beckoning Santa Barbara, the number is closer to 5 percent. Five percent! With the advent of e-bikes, our hills no longer qualify as viable excuses. Burke, by the way, is the one responsible for the flotilla of white electric bikes for rent seen buzzing throughout downtown and adjacent neighborhoods.  Trisalyn Nelson | Credit: Courtesy  Nelson is currently creating a data dashboard to track bicycle-involved accidents, near-accidents, and their locations. For those with a story about such events, go to bikemaps  .org and tell it. Among other things, Nelson is trying to pinpoint problematic locations to alert prospective riders and to goad the powers-that-be to take remedial steps.  Nelson is a data freak, intent on filling a major void when it comes to policy matters. Right now, she’s dealing with the stigma inflicted by stupid kids — two to a bike, helmet straps dangling, and distracted by cell phones. How many have been involved in actual accidents? Go to her website and log in. Her solution? How about slower e-bikes, for starters, ones that top out at 20 mph as opposed to 28. Teenagers on e-bikes should be embraced as a great and wonderful thing, she says. To be modified, absolutely. But mostly to be celebrated.  At a time when monthly payments for new cars have skyrocketed to $729 a month — up 24 percent — and for used cars to $563 a month — up 40 percent — shouldn’t our next car be a bike? And that doesn’t include the cost of insurance, registration, gas, repairs, or parking. As for RAV4s, I understand the manufacturers have just added the letter “J” to the brand. It stands for joyous. But if you rode a bike, you’d already be there."

Perhaps one of the toughest losses he has ever suffered in his career came in the game publicly known as ""Fail Mary.""  The most exciting play in American football is the hail mary, where a team desperate to score a touchdown to tie or win the game tries a last gasp deep throw to the end zone and hopes for a miracle.  That's exactly what the Seattle Seahawks tried to do in Week 3 of the 2012 season in a Monday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers. It was Russell Wilson's third-ever game in the league, and both teams came into that game with a 1-1 record.  70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now  We've seen Aaron Rodgers throw it plenty of times, but he has also been victim of the hail mary.  The 2012 referee lockout became a huge problem for the NFL  Now that you're here, it's time for some context. At the start of that season, the primary NFL referees were all out of the league as the NFL and the officials' union could not come to terms on a new collective bargaining deal.  With the officials' lockout, the season started anyway, and the league hired replacement referees. But the problems arised quickly: in Week 2, a referee had to be removed from a New Orleans Saints game because he was a fan of the team, and on Thursday Night Football of Week 3, the game-winning field goal for the Baltimore Ravens against the New England Patriots was clearly over the crossbar, but the referees called it in.  That was nothing compared to what was to come.  Aaron Rodgers, Packers on wrong side of Fail Mary  Now, we should be real with our readers. Except for the final play, that Monday Night Football game was boring, and nothing good was supposed to come out of it. Except that, with 12 seconds left and losing 12-7, the Seahawks had one final shot to throw the ball to the end zone and score the game-winning touchdown.  That's exactly what Russell Wilson did. Or, well, kinda. (You have to click on the video to go to YouTube, since NFL blocks the video)  It's clear as daylight that the ball wasn't caught by Golden Tate! The Seahawks receiver had nothing to do with the ball, which was 100% intercepted. But the referees signaled the touchdown and gave the victory to Seattle.  The levels of confusion right after the play were as high as it could get, and obviously, the Packers were not happy. Rodgers himself issued an apology to the league fans.  ""First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do, and I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport (has) generated a multi-billion dollar machine, by people who pay good money to come watch us play. And the product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control.""  But Rodgers and the Packers didn't have to wait for the primary officials to return. After the debacle, the league negotiated a new deal with the union as quick as they could, and they were back three days later for the Thursday Night Football in Week 4.  But the Fail Mary will always be a bad look for the league, and unfortunately for Rodgers and the Packers, they were on the wrong side of it.  Poll : 0 votes"

This is a historic visit as Scholz will be the first German leader to come to Seoul in 13 years since former Chancellor Angela Merkel's trip in 2010 to attend a G20 summit.    This surely reflects the strength and importance of the partnership between the two nations. His visit is expected to open new avenues for economic and many other cooperations between the two countries.    Especially during his visit here, Chancellor Scholz has chosen to witness the Korean Peninsula's division firsthand at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). This holds great symbolic value. Having experienced its own division and reunification, Germany is open to sharing its valuable insights and experiences with South Korea.    Both countries and their businesses underwent strong transformation processes after World War II and the Korean War, respectively. Koreans speak respectfully about Germany's ""miracle of the Rhine"" while Germany highly recognizes South Korea's ""miracle on the Han River"" and its global triumph of the K-wave.    Now facing common challenges such as de-carbonizing the industry production, e-mobility, diversification of supply chains and digitalization, German and Korean companies are competing and collaborating to find the best solutions.    The summit between Chancellor Scholz and President Yoon is expected to foster deeper economic cooperation between the two countries. A remarkable total of $14.6 billion German investments in South Korea between 1962 and 2020 showcases the strong history of foreign direct investment and numerous joint business projects between Korean and German companies demonstrate the collaboration on equal footing, between esteemed and valued partners.

When I was allowed to hold him, after a few weeks, he was so small he fit into my hand.  It's a miracle we survived. I suffered eclampsia – a dangerous condition that causes high blood pressure – and my liver and kidneys failed: he spent three months in the hospital's special care unit.  Ivory is five years old now. Every day when he gets home from school we have a five-minute hug. I make the most of those moments as I know they won't last forever. My daughter, Afrika, is 14 and on her way to being a young woman.  I am incredibly proud of them both but I have to admit that when I meet women who don't have children, I have a guilty feeling of envy. Bringing up children has brought me joy – but it's also been my greatest struggle.  So I can well understand why more women that than ever are choosing not to have children, or to limit themselves to a single child.

And it's true. Unless we take drastic action, in just 40 years' time, there won't be enough younger workers to fund our pensions.  The 'replacement' fertility rate required to keep the population stable is 2.1 children per woman. In the UK (and many other Western countries) that is down to 1.6 and continuing to fall.  Immigration may fill some of the gap, but what we urgently need to do is to support the people we most want to have children – and that's hard-working men and women who will contribute to the public purse.  Some, like Tory MP Danny Kruger, seem to think our reluctance to have children is down to the narcissism of the 'me' generation, but the women I talk to are making practical decisions, shaped by the cost-of-living crisis, shortage of housing and student debt.  We all know bringing up children is tough. When someone tells you they're pregnant today, you might instinctively say 'Congratulations!' but you're probably also thinking 'Wow, get ready for the financial hit…'  Money has always played a part in our decisions to have children. There was no way I could afford a child in my 20s. By the age of 37, I had bought two properties and sensibly saved enough money to live on, but the year I took off work with Afrika set me back more than financially: it set me back ten years in my career. I had to fight to get back into the workplace – and that was tough.  I'm still climbing out of the financial pit that childcare cast me into. I hired an au pair, which may sound like a luxury, but it was cheaper than nursery. At times, I was borrowing against one credit card to pay another.  NANA AKUA: Immigration may fill some of the gap, but what we urgently need to do is to support the people we most want to have children – and that's hard-working men and women who will contribute to the public purse (stock image)  I'm a single mother, but not by choice. My relationships with Afrika and Ivory's fathers did not work out. And with the divorce rate so high, many women find themselves coping alone like me.  For them especially – and even for many couples – the cost of childcare is ruinous. We need a complete rethink of the way women are treated by the tax system and in the workplace environment.  As Penistone and Stocksbridge MP Miriam Cates says, we incentivise the purchase of solar panels and use tax breaks to encourage businesses to invest – so why should the state remain neutral when it comes to matters of family and fertility?  As things stand, parents who work more than 16 hours a week and earn less than £100,000 are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare a week for children aged three to four. And from April next year, some free childcare provision will be provided to younger children. That's a start but we need to do much more.  We fund schools. I'd like to see education extended to a fully funded provision of nurseries. We know children thrive in these settings: they become better-socialised and faster learners.  And we know there is a benefit to the economy in having women in the workplace. So, men, it's time to step up. The rich countries with the lowest fertility rates are those where women get the least help with the household – like South Korea where the birthrate is at a perilous 0.84 and women do 4.43 times as much domestic work as their partners.  We have to find a way of relieving the pressure on parents. For the last eight years, I've been giving motivational talks to teenagers and when I ask if they see children as part of their future, fewer and fewer are saying yes. That's sad – if we want to turn it around we need to do something, fast."

In 1948,as the world picked up its pieces from the ashes of WW2, the Jews who were dealt a particularly heavy hand established the Independent state of Israel.  Advertisement  As the war had raged on exposing man’s darkest side, Jews were disproportionately targeted. By the time the war ended with the decisive defeat of the Nazis, some six million Jews had been killed.  As with any new beginning, Israel encountered steep challenges from the onset. From its establishment, the new state of found itself besieged by formidable enemies and beleaguered by monumental internal challenges. Wars were fought in 1967,1973 and 2006. Even until this day, Israel remains a state in a constant state of war.  Advertisement  Israel remains surrounded by hostile Arab countries and has had to fight just to exist.  But it has not all been bombs, bullets, and bayonet for Israel. Its adversity-driven culture has also resulted in a boom, producing battlefield entrepreneurs that have worked stupendous economic and technological miracles which belie its tiny size and population of just under ten million people. For a country this small and hounded, its spectacular achievements are some of modern history’s most impressive feats.  Advertisement  In their seminal book“ The Start-up Nation: The story of Israel’s economic miracle” authors Dan Senor and Saul Singer examined in luminous detail how a community of penniless refugees transformed a land described by Mark Twain as ‘a desolate country …a silent mournful expanse,” into one of the most dynamic entrepreneurial economies in the world one which produces more startups than Japan, China,India, Korea, Canada and the UK,  According to Senor and Singer, in 2008, for each person venture capital investments in Israel were 2.5 times greater than in the United States, more than 30 times greater than in Europe, 80 times greater than in China, and 350 times greater than in India. Comparing absolute numbers, Israel—a country of just 7.1 million people—attracted close to $2 billion in venture capital, as much as flowed to the United Kingdom’s 61 million citizens or to the 145 million people living in Germany and France combined. And Israel is the only country to experience a meaningful increase in venture capital from 2007 to 2008.  Advertisement  Even the wars Israel has repeatedly fought have not slowed the country down. During the six years following 2000, Israel was hit not just by the bursting of the global tech bubble but by the most intense period of terrorist attacks in its history and by the second Lebanon war. Yet, Israel’s share of the global venture capital market did not drop—it doubled, from 15 percent to 31 percent. And the Tel Aviv stock exchange was higher on the last day of the Lebanon war than on the first, as it was after the three-week military operation in the Gaza Strip in 2009.”  As a country, Israel has also remained wonderfully open to migrants. At its founding, Israel became the only country in history to explicitly address in its founding documents the need for a liberal immigration policy. In 1950, Israel’s new government made good on that declaration with the Law of Return, which until now guarantees that “every Jew is entitled to come to this country.  Advertisement  Israel’s economic miracle is due as much to immigration as to anything. At Israel’s founding in 1948, its population was 806,000. Today, numbering over 9.364 million people, the country has grown more than nine-fold in seventy-five years.  Israel is also no diplomatic shrinking violet. The wars the country has had to fight have congealed into age-long enmity between Israel and its Arab neighbours. However, over the years, as a result of Israel’s rapid economic and technological advancements, many countries who were formerly hostile to it have sought the improvement of diplomatic ties.  Advertisement  Israel’s burgeoning reputation as a diplomatic and democratic heavyweight underpinned by its considered economic and technological status has made it a key player in diplomatic relations.  What more can be said of this country which produces more water than it needs despite more than half of the country being a desert? Can anything more laudatory said of a country whose startups and technological inventions have gone on to redefine irrigation, pharmaceuticals, weapon technologies and even warfare?  Advertisement  What more can be said of a country that was given zero percent chance of surviving at its founding but has today become a model for how to thrive in the face of adversity.  In a world riddled by conflicts and crisis, Israel points the way in how to transform adversity into advancement.  Advertisement  There is no doubt that an ailing world can learn a ton of lessons from this most innovative of countries."

Especially during his tenure with the Chicago Bulls, Jordan was invincible. For him to be able to get on the world stage and dominate, several miracles had to take place when he was a child. Some even before he was born. During an interview with Vanity Fair in 1998, His Airness talked about one such miracle.  Born to Deloris Jordan and James R. Jordan on 17th February 1963, there was a serious complication at the time of Jordan’s birth. The anchor to his life, his beloved mother had suffered a heartbreaking loss while she was pregnant with NBA’s biggest superstar. Despite her own loss, Deloris was forced to stay in bed so things don’t get any worse.  When Michael Jordan’s mother was forced to stay in bed  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Jordan’s list of accomplishments might be too long to put into words at once. He has achieved the unthinkable on the court and continues to do so after his retirement. The 6x NBA champion three-peated the NBA title twice. He was the Finals MVP in all six championship wins. 14x NBA All-Star, 5 NBA MVPs, and 3 All-Star MVP awards just barely scratch the surface of his achievements.  Apart from his achievements on the court, Jordan also went on to become the first billionaire to come out of the NBA world. However, all this and much more couldn’t have happened if Deloris’s miscarriage scare wasn’t avoided when she was pregnant with Jordan.  via Imago Chicago Bulls All-Star forward # 23 Michael Jordan file photos.

He said, “During my mother’s pregnancy with me, her mother died unexpectedly.” While Deloris was mourning the loss of her mother, the doctors feared a miscarriage.  Since there was no other way to avoid this mishap, Jordan’s mother was forced to stay in bed. He added, “According to my father, there was a near miscarriage and there was some question as to whether I would make it or not.” Everything eventually went well at the time and the world got the privilege to witness the greatness of the highest standard.

Just before Carlos and TK were getting married, Carlos' father was murdered, which prompted him to delay his wedding and investigate his father's killer.  The two episodes of 9-1-1: Lone Star was titled Best of Men and In Sickness and In Health. Both of them aired on May 16, 2023, on FOX.  9-1-1: Lone Star Season 4 finale recap: Carlos delays his own wedding after his father's murder  The episode began with a focus on Wyatt. After a terrible accident, he was finally recovering slowly. He was even happy about his progress. He was also supportive of his father Judd, who later saw a miracle.  The episode then shifted to a case where an inebriated man carjacked a four-wheeler with a toddler name Piper in the back seat. He was very high and drove straight into a swimming pool. Thankfully, the car's owner, Piper's mother, called 911 and the APD and AFD responded quickly. The driver saved his own life but left the toddler inside.  Owen arrived at the scene and bravely saved Piper. Tommy and the team recovered the child's pulse. This was a miracle since she had died for a few minutes in the pool.  Judd received a call from Marleen, informing him that there was a chance that their son Wyatt would never be able to walk again. Everyone was extremely upset about this and nobody knew how to break the news to him. Ultimately, Marleen and Judd decided to break the news to him, leaving him heartbroken.  Judd decided to take care of Wyatt and keep him in his own house. He informed Owen that he was quitting his job, a move that the latter supported.  Meanwhile, Carlos got offered a job by his father Gabriel with the Texas Rangers. He turned the offer down by saying that the organization was racist.  Gabriel and Carlos didn't share the best relationship as the former was not supportive of his son's homosexuality. But their relationship slowly mended and Gabriel was even excited to attend Carlos' wedding with TK.  Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Gabriel was shot to death by an unknown assailant at his doorstep. Carlos decided to postpone the wedding after his father's murder. He was sure that the culprit was a man called Pablo Martinez who had ties with the cartel, and decided to investigate the case on his own.  But everyone soon made him realize that Pablo was only protecting his father and he was an undercover cop. Carlos realized his mistake and regretted that he was going to kill an innocent man. He even apologized to TK for delaying the wedding and proposed to him again. TK accepted instantly.  The lovebirds were then married in front of their friends and family. Paul officiated the wedding and Iris was Carlos' best man. Even Owen arrived with his own family.  Owen's brother Robert told his family about his disease and his desire to kill himself. Although Owen tried to stop him, a few days after the wedding, Robert took his own life. Owen was beside him when this happened.  Poll : 0 votes"

It was the kind of silence as in a theater, when the conductor taps the music stand and raises his hands, everyone awaiting what would come next.  “My goal in life,” the young man said, “is to have a son and be a better dad to him than my (estranged) dad is to me.”  Imagine this room, a classroom at New London High, all full of rugged athletes about to catch a few tears, listening to their friend’s story. There was no sound. No phones out. Nothing but compassion.  As real as it gets.  This happens weekly at New London High now thanks to former Whaler (and former major leaguer) Rajai Davis, who has come back to his hometown and his alma mater offering a new mentorship program for the school’s athletes. Davis and Larry Delong, pastor at the Miracle Temple Church in the city, offer their life experiences to the kids, who turn vulnerability into strength.  “I'm doing this because I know I wanted this when I was their age,” Davis was saying. “If I had this, I would have made different choices. I've had opportunities to be exposed to a lot more now and I know these kids never will be unless somebody like myself brings it. We never talked about a lot of this. It was always swept under the rug.”  Davis works as the Senior Director of On Field Operations in Major League Baseball, a liaison with the Commissioner's Office as a resource in clubhouses, to whom players can voice their concerns. In that job, Davis did a filming about sexual assault and domestic violence, encouraging players to think about issues and behaviors that too often find their way under the metaphorical rug.  “I've been talking with Phil (New London athletic director Phil Orbe) about doing this kind of program with the kids here for the last year and a half,” Davis said.  The program works through the website acalltomen.org, which aims to promote healthy, respectful manhood through training and educational resources for companies, government agencies, schools and community groups. The program’s “collective socialization of manhood” comes through what it calls the “Man Box,” the community organizing model.  The kids already understand the traps for which the “Man Box” raises awareness: Men need to be strong. They don’t show emotions. They can’t be vulnerable. Except that two days a week after school, Davis and Delong provide this non-judgemental atmosphere awash in openness, honesty and truth.  They talked about their home lives. Their goals and dreams. What’s required for college. They talked about how easy it is for men to objectify women, despite the layers of respect the kids have for their mothers. They talked about how they perceived the behavior of some girls in the building as consistently disrespectful — and their frustration with how they believe administrators don’t believe the boys as much as the girls. They spoke of conflict resolution. They discussed the many traps for teenagers and how, as Delong said, “sometimes, better choices lead to lonelier roads.”  There was one instance when a young man was sharing something from his life and another began to laugh. The speaker immediately quoted new football coach Bobby Sanchez, who invites his players to share. “As Coach Sanchez says, ‘the ones who laugh in here are the ones who end up alone in the future.’”  There was no more laughing.  The kids agreed it was the most worthwhile hour of the day.  “Sometimes,” author Brene Brown wrote, “the most dangerous thing for kids is the silence that allows them to construct their own stories — stories that almost always cast them as alone and unworthy of love and belonging.”  And then here in this room they all belonged. A bunch of kids talking about real life with no fears about vulnerability, disconnection, criticism, failure and conflict. The concept of fear, so frequently a protective barrier and solidifying division that helps keep us apart, suddenly had no place here.  So much for the concept, too, that learning ends at the final bell. There is no more important undertaking on school grounds for the kids than this new program. And it’s going to grow.  “We're building this now as a team so that eventually we will be able to reach everyone,” Davis said. “But we have to start small. But big doors swing by little hinges, right?”  This is the opinion of Day sports columnist Mike DiMauro"

Ezekiel was also ordered to refrain from talking about the Shakahola issue.  The preacher is under investigation over the alleged indoctrination of his followers.  He is currently out on a Sh3 million bond with a surety of a similar amount or an alternative of Sh1.5 million cash bail.

Not yet, but another disaster is coming  With respect to national leadership going forward, it is time to face a hard fact: the United States needs a miracle.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are yet to be revealed, but the three riders of political disaster are already before us as the pace picks up for the 2024 election.  Dementia-Senility, cluelessness, and hubris gallop into view. With every sighting, the need for a miracle becomes increasingly evident as the major candidates for the presidency and vice presidency come closer. Joe Biden, in the view of many, is astride the horse of dementia-senility. Kamala Harris is in the saddle of the steed of cluelessness. Donald Trump is mounted on the stallion of hubris.  There are and will be others, but these are the ones now kicking up the most dust. God help us.  Joe Biden is to be understood and pitied, having lost a wife and young children tragically. One would think it would take a lifetime to get over such grief — if ever. Now this heart-breaking past is mingled in President Biden with the challenges of old age (I understand those challenges well at age 81). The positives of aging can be, among others, wisdom, and experience. However, old-timers must be honest enough to recognize that they may distort the past or forget the consequences of bad decisions in earlier life. If Biden wins the presidency in 2024, he will need all the wisdom he can muster since he would be the oldest elected president in American history.  Vice President Kamala Harris too frequently seems to be thrust into roles for which she has no preparation — like Biden’s appointing her as “czar” of migration in this season of unprecedented turmoil at the nation’s southern borders. True or not, she has come across as being clueless as to what to do about that staggering problem. Harris did not help herself by going to Atlanta for a political fundraiser just as migrants pressed in on the country’s gates, awaiting the end of Article 42, and the near obliteration of the boundaries. “Kamala Harris is to hit Dem Soiree as Title 42 lifts,” shouted a headline in the New York Post.  Then there’s the case of another 2024 candidate, Donald Trump, who seems to have a serious case of hubris, the belief that one is invulnerable and above the clutch of past actions and mistakes. Hubris is a case of intense arrogance.  It is true that there are no perfect people and hence no perfect candidates. We must carefully consider the temperament of Candidates and the impact of their personalities on decisions they might make if they win office.  Dementia-senility can bring confusion and serious forgetfulness, a loss of focus, and emotional control, to name a few of the symptoms. These are not the attributes fit for confrontations with the tyrants and shrewd overlords of the present world disorder.  Cluelessness dims the ability to see through subtleties and propaganda. It blocks leaders from understanding what is really going on. In a national and international scenario populated with crafty masters of bait and switch a clueless national leader can be snookered easily.  The chief of state suffering hubris is prone to take risky actions. He or she underestimates threats on the one hand or, on the other, overestimates his or her own ability to knock out the adversary. This is scary stuff in a nuclear world. While John F. Kennedy might have been afflicted with hubris, nevertheless in the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 he had sufficient intelligence to know the Russians were not likely to ignite a nuclear war. His successor, Lyndon Johnson demonstrated a high degree of hubris about Vietnam, and he underestimated the determination and ability of the enemy in continuing to fight. Fifty thousand American lives were snuffed out because of the continuing miscalculation on the part of both Johnson and Kennedy.  Nixon demonstrated cluelessness regarding the Watergate scandals that brought down his presidency. As a low-level member of the White House staff in that era I knew of aides who urged the president to take the initiative to reform his campaign organization and take full responsibility for ridding it of dirty tricks and questionable strategies. Because higher-level staff prevented those exhortations from going into the Oval Office, or because of Nixon’s own choices, his presidency was brought down.  Gerald Ford, Nixon’s immediate replacement upon his resignation from the presidency, lost the election to a full White House term by revealing during a debate that he was clueless regarding the extent of Communist control in Eastern Europe.  And then there was the striking hubris and cluelessness of Bill Clinton’s abuse of the Oval Office as a hideaway for his sexual escapades. In that, Clinton was following in the steps of Kennedy and who knows who else?  The bottom line: Voters must go beyond soundbites and appearances from candidates and look deeply into their characters, temperaments, and records.  The national and world scenes are far too delicate to be handled by a president whose age prevents him or her from taking reasonable approaches to crises, or so clueless that he or she cannot discern what is really going on behind the charade by which shrewd enemies conceal the facts, or national leaders who suffer from hubris so great that they overestimate themselves and underestimate their enemies.  The imperative: Pray for a leadership miracle for the United States in 2024."

Mack has spent time with five different NFL organizations. Mack played collegiately at Notre Dame.  The 2023 XFL season reached its conclusion with the Arlington Renegades defeating the DC Defenders in the 2023 XFL Championship Game. XFL players became eligible to sign NFL contracts starting this past Monday. Mack represents the first XFL signing for the Titans.  Mack is joining a tight end room that contains Chigoziem Okonkwo, Josh Whyle, Trevon Wesco, and Kevin Rader. Some of these roles are written in stone. Okonknwo is Tennessee’s clear-cut No. 1 tight end as an explosive playmaker that’s expected to take a step forward in 2023.  Whyle is an exciting fifth-round selection that could play himself into an immediate role. Wesco is one of the league’s best blocking tight ends. That skill set matters to the run-heavy Titans, who are looking for Wesco to replace Geoff Swaim. Rader is a holdover from the conclusion of the 2022 campaign. Thomas Odukoya and Justin Rigg are also on the roster.  Mack probably needs the Titans to keep four tight ends in order to compete for a 53-man roster spot. Stranger things have happened, especially given Tennessee’s lack of receiver depth. Mack will receive an opportunity to compete."

Hilda Effiong Bassey is a popular Nigerian chef known on social media as Hilda Baci, CNN reports. Motivated by her Naija roots, Bassey set out to set a new world record for her home country, hosting a marathon to cook the most consecutive nonstop hours by an individual. Hosted in Lagos, Bassey worked to beat the previous record of 87 hours and 45 minutes set in 2019 by Indian chef Lata Tondon. Tondon sent in her well wishes via social media as Bassey began cooking on Thursday, finishing up on Monday and setting a new world record with a whopping 100 hours of nonstop cooking.  Bassey said her motivation for the challenge was putting Nigerian food on the global radar, creating over 55 recipes and more than 100 recipes throughout the cookathon.  “Nigerian cuisine is the best out there. The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food,” Bassey told reporters.  Many showed up in droves to support the chef as she danced and waved at fans from her kitchen. Popular Nigerian artist Tiwa Savage visited Bassey to encourage her along with politicians, the Governor of Lagos state, reporters and locals, including Udak Obong who traveled through the night to come out.  “I drove 12 hours to be right here to support my sister, my friend. She’s just amazing,” said Obong.    Enioluwa Adeoluwa, an influencer who served as MC for the cooking marathon said this type of community is common in Nigeria and they were all supportive of Bassey’s efforts.  “When a Nigerian is doing something we all come out to show support…We are super excited. She’s doing such an amazing job.  Bassey admitted that the journey was laborious, saying she even thought about quitting, but with the massive amounts of support shown, she pushed through and was happy to accomplish such a major feat.  “The first day was the most difficult. I was ready to give up 6 hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible,” said Bassey.  She is still waiting for the Guinness world record committee to confirm that all criteria has been met before officially naming Bassey as the new record holder. But all of Nigeria and the diaspora agrees that after cooking for 100 hours straight, Bassey has just blazed a trail that will open doors for generations of chefs to come.  “She’s opening the door to the African food market and showing all the youth out here that if you can dream it, you can achieve it,” said actor Damilola Ogunsi.

This show marked the first show on the Westville's calendar for 2023, and had over 4600 fans in attendance for this most righteous Dead cover band.  The evening's festivities began on a lovely New England afternoon. The band took the stage around 6:15pm, and wasted no time by diving into an exploratory build up prior to ""Eyes of the World."" Drummer Joe Russo dug into deep percussion early, and keyboardist Marco Benevento unfurled a beautiful sequence on the piano. A bluesy jam ensued, followed by a funky transition into ""The Music Never Stopped."" The vibe became mellow as the music flowed into a ""Black Peter"" tease, but quickly picked up, with a raging guitar jam via guitarists Tom Hamilton and Scott Metzger back into ""The Music Never Stopped.""  Joe Russo welcomed his two young daughters with pint-sized guitars on stage before the band performed ""Here Comes The Sun"" for the first time. Both Russo and Hamilton contributed vocals to this classic Beatles' tune. The girls remained for the rest of the set, and unleashed a few rock star moves of their own.  A very spacey jam lead into ""Estimated Prophet,"" proceeded by a layered jam, with notable contributions by Metzger. A slower, more melodic improvisational section gave way for an edgy jam into ""The Wheel,"" with an emphasis by bassist Dave Dreiwitz. Both Dreiwitz and Hamilton raced through an incredible build up that transformed into a perfectly placed ""Real Morning Party"" tease, which is a song by Benevento. The music rolled into a deliciously psychedelic ""Uncle John's Band,"" before these fine musicians stopped for a breath of air. With Russo like a freight train on the drums, ""Bertha,"" was up next, and concluded this stellar set.  The band returned for round two, and picked up where they left off with ""St. Stephen."" This raging opener lead into more improvisational pleasantries on the piano by Benevento. The guitars elevated this jam, ushering the music back into ""St. Stephen,"" before a face melting segue into ""I Need a Miracle."" I need a miracle everyday, indeed. The crowd assisted Metzger with these famous lyrics, followed by a boot scooting, bluesy breakdown. The music rolled into a euphonious ""Ramble On Rose,"" with a breezy jam by Hamilton.  More psychedelic goodness emerged with ""Scarlet Begonias,"" which flowed into a reggae inspired improvisation that was almost spooky at times. Benevento's daughters Illa and Ruby joined their father on the keys as the band moved into a heated ""Fire on the Mountain."" The layers of piano brought a huge smile to proud papa Benevento. This tune was all Hamilton, from the soulful vocals to the galvanized jam. After returning to ""Scarlet Begonias,"" Russo announced, ""It's daughter night here at JRAD. Big hand for Illa and Ruby Benevento. It's feeling like Father's Day on Mother's Day. We're just lucky to be here. Happy Mother's Day.""  The music was not over quite yet, as this talented bunch served up a monster, sixteen minute ""Throwing Stones"" that went into type two territory. A melodious jam skillfully jettisoned back into ""Throwing Stones."" The set ended on the heart felt ""So Many Roads."" The band returned to play a high energy ""Good Lovin,"" which returned to ""The Wheel,"" before ending the show with an affirmative bang.  Joe Russo's Almost Dead always brings fresh jams and vibrant tunes. We as fans are extremely lucky to experience music from them with their children, on top of that.

Most Read from Bloomberg  That’s the thinking of Amy Wu Silverman, head of derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets.  “The tale of optimism does not exist,” she told Bloomberg Television. “Is there a possibility of a congressional miracle? Who knows — but right now folks are pricing that this is going to be a very tumultuous debt ceiling. If it at all comes in a little bit easier than we expect, that right tail is very cheap.”  The volatility market is looking for action in stocks, and equities need to drawdown before Congress takes action, she said, adding that she expects an “eleventh hour, 2011-type” situation. Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the Cboe Volatility Index or VIX, has been trading below 30 — a level considered a sign of heightened volatility — for most of 2023. The VIX was also tamped down in 2011 amid a similar standoff around the debt ceiling before it peaked near 50 in August and remained above 30.  “That’s what these bets in the market are saying right now,” she said. “They think we’re going to get back there.”  Lawmakers took a cautiously optimistic tone after a Tuesday meeting between President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, saying that while they remained far apart, parties were hopeful they could find some middle ground. Contracts on the S&P 500 rose in premarket trading on Wednesday morning.  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that her department could run out of cash as soon as June 1. Rates on short-dated Treasuries expiring around that so-called X-date have soared, but analysts have pointed to a lack of reaction from equity markets, with the benchmark gauge stuck in a narrow range.  Story continues  Silverman explained that the VIX is low because bullish S&P calls are cheap, and she pointed to “bearishness across the board.”  “The most underpriced reality right now is the idea that this debt ceiling situation actually gets resolved quicker and easier than we think,” she said. “Folks are very, very well prepared for a debacle. And so if we don’t get it, it would be very interesting to see all these hedges roll off.”  --With assistance from Jonathan Ferro and Tom Keene.

It seems like heady stuff, and it’s true that avant-garde cinema is not for every taste, but there’s an intoxicating compulsion and approachability to Barney’s work. His is the stuff of violent mass spectacle, human achievements on grand architectural and operatic scales, secret societies, and arcane rituals, and how the miracle of it all that creation is just an imperfect, Frankensteinian mirror to the mysterious and overlooked functions of biology.  Barney’s work emerges from tension, the titles of his pieces providing the ends of threads that, once pulled, open him up for contemplation, contextualization, and sometimes dissection. He is known for an ongoing video and photography series called Drawing Restraint, which describes a line between muscle growth and artistic production; River of Fundament is a three-act opera based on Norman Mailer’s Ancient Evenings; “Redoubt” employs the voyeurism and punishment myth of Diana and Actaeon in the exploration of what he called “humanity’s place in the natural world”; and now “Secondary,” which dramatizes a fateful American football game in which Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley is paralyzed in 1978 by a violent hit from Oakland Raiders defensive back Jack Tatum. Moving between the worlds of fine art and provocation, Barney is probably best known for his epic, eight-year, and five-film project “The Cremaster Cycle” (398 min), undertaken between 1994 and 2002.  Metrograph is hosting a rare screening of all five parts in the order in which they were created, which is not the order in which they are numbered, culminating with an in-person conversation with Barney and frequent collaborator Maggie Nelson. It is the first New York screening of this work since 2015. Barney has vowed there never be a broad home video incarnation.  “The Cremaster Cycle” is named for the muscle in male anatomy primarily responsible for raising and lowering testes in response to temperature. Its most disturbing, and arguably most sophisticated sequence is in the middle of its final and longest installment, “Cremaster 3,” in which its wordless hero, The Entered Apprentice (played by Barney himself), is strapped into a dentist’s chair at the center of the Chrysler Building, partially stripped and forced to ingest the crushed metal sepulcher, a violently-compressed 1938 Chevrolet Imperial, of serial murderer Gary Gilmore. Gilmore is played by Barney in “Cremaster 2” as a being born from a seance, gestated in a fleshy umbilicus stretched between two cars parked at a remote gas station, where the killer murdered attendant Max Jensen (Michael Thompson)."

On June 17, 1972, he was united in marriage to Joyce Ann Bradley in Akron, Ohio.  Arthur was a 1958 graduate of Florida School for the Deaf and Blind. For seven years after graduating, he worked as a typesetter for a newspaper where he was self-taught. He then attended Gallaudet University in Washington D.C. where he studied and graduated with his degree in Sociology in 1971. Arthur began working as a teacher at Montana School for the Deaf for two years. Before going on to further his education, he would marry the love of his life in 1972. He then attended California State Northridge where he gained his Master’s in Education.  After achieving his first Master’s degree, he and Joyce moved back to Florida where they welcomed their first son, and he started teaching at his high school alma mater. His family then moved to Utah and he taught at Utah School for the Deaf. It was in Utah that his brother-in-law, Raymond Bradley, would lead Arthur and Joyce to Christ in 1977, and they would welcome their second son. This year was a life-changing year for him and his young family.  Arthur went on to teach at various other institutions for the deaf including California School for the Deaf, Southwest Collegiate Institute of the Deaf, and Oklahoma School for the Deaf. While teaching in Big Spring, Texas, he would welcome his third child and only daughter. He decided to continue his education and received his second Master’s degree, which was in Counseling. After this achievement, he would continue to teach at schools in Florida, California, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, before making a final move to Missouri where he taught at William Woods University from 1996 until his retirement.  He was incredibly dedicated to the deaf community. Arthur was a true pioneer for the deaf culture and for sign language. Nationally known for his influence in the deaf community, he made a way for individuals to know that they can succeed and have the best things in life. He truly made a long-lasting, positive impact on the world that will continue to bless people for generations to come.  Arthur was a very brilliant, dedicated, and driven man. Along with his many accomplishments in education and career, he was also successful in creative ventures. For many years he had a one-man comedy show, authored a book, and acted in a movie about the Book of Job. He was actively engaged in his church life where he was a deaf leader, Sunday school teacher, and held various leadership positions. His love for God and people shone through everything that he did.  It is important to note that Arthur was a huge football fan. He was successful in the sport, earning the title of All-American in high school. His passion for the game would be passed down to his sons who also earned the All-American title, and eventually would trickle down to his grandchildren. Their common love of the game created an extremely special bond.  After his retirement from teaching, Arthur’s main goal and priority was spending time with his family and grandchildren. He loved attending his grandkids’ sporting events and rarely missed a ball game. He never missed church, always showed up with a smile, and loved being involved. Even when his health began to decline, Arthur never complained. His family was his greatest pride and he loved them deeply. He will be missed immensely by those who know and love him.  He is survived by the love of his life and wife of nearly 51 years, Joyce; children, Randy (Janelle) Dignan of Jefferson City, Nick (Ashley) Dignan of Groves, Texas, and Jennifer (Jorge) Morales of New Bloomfield; grandchildren, Briella, Rayana, Grant, and Clara Dignan, Cade Madelyn, Colt Arthur, and McKinley Ann Dignan, and Amelia, Benton, Conan, Darrion, and Emalie Morales; nephew, Philip Van Dignan; niece, Nelda Knapik; and numerous additional nieces and nephews.  He was preceded in death by his parents, Peter and Edith; and brother, Philip Dignan.  Friends will be received on Thursday, May 18, 2023, from 2:15 p.m. – 3:45 p.m. at Bible Baptist Church in Jefferson City. A funeral service will begin at 4:00 p.m. with his sons, Randy and Nick Dignan, officiating.  Expressions of sympathy may be made to the Deaf Fund of Bible Baptist Church in memory of Arthur.  Arrangements are under the direction of HOUSER-MILLARD Funeral Directors, 2613 West Main Street; Jefferson City, MO 65109. (573) 636-3838.

The family were airlifted to hospital from the scene, between junction 3 for the Pilsworth Interchange and junction 4 for Simister Island.  Tragically, 38-year-old Frankie, who was 18 weeks pregnant, died from her injuries on Monday (May 15).  A 22-year-old man, Adil Iqbal, of Hope Street in Accrington, has been charged with causing Frankie's death by dangerous driving as well as two other charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, relating to the two boys.  Tributes have since been pouring in for the Chadderton mum-of-two and a fundraiser for the family has amassed more than £40,000.  Meanwhile, two of the boys, Tobias and his cousin, Tommy, have been in critical care at Manchester Royal Hospital.  In an update, Tobias' parents, Becci and Arron Welby, said their ""hearts ache inside"" as their son has been placed in an induced coma with a brain injury and fractured skull.  Calling him their ""brave boy"" and ""our warrior"", the pair said Tobias faces a long road to recovery, ""but our precious boy is fighting"".  ""The medical specialists are doing their best around the clock while our family tries to make sense of what has happened.  ""We ride this emotional rollercoaster day by day, minute by minute"", they added.  A photograph of the boy in his hospital bed has also been posted on social media.  The family said they ""battled with the decision"" to post the heartbreaking image.  The Welbys added: ""My son is strong, a fighter and we have faith.  ""We have had some positive news today from his most recent brain scan but we are not out of the woods, the doctors tell us to take it slow day by day.  ""Every day we hope for continued miracles.  ""He and his cousin both are proving how strong they can be and are currently stable.  ""Our hearts ache inside.""  They said they are currently finding comfort in prayer and each other, and believe ""in our core"" that the amazing team at the hospital, as well as the fast action of first responders on the scene of the crash, ""that our boys will keep improving day by day"".  ""Tobias, mummy and daddy are waiting for you. You are our whole world"", they added.  Iqbal appeared in the dock at Manchester Magistrates’ Court on Monday afternoon. No pleas were entered. The case was adjourned for a preliminary hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court on June 19. He was remanded into custody until the next hearing.  "

After His death by crucifixion, He rose from the dead three days later. The Christian belief is that Jesus sacrificed Himself on the cross and bore the sins of all the people. His Resurrection grants eternal life for all those who believe in Him, and the celebration of Easter stands as one of the most important and holy days on the Christian calendar.  Orthodox Easter, or Pascha and Catholic Easter, have the same roots and both celebrate the miracle of resurrection. The main difference is they are celebrated on different days. The Catholics follow a different calendar than the Orthodox; Orthodox Easter usually falls after Catholic Easter.  Greek Orthodox Easter holds unique traditions different from the Catholic traditions. Worshippers work together to bring the miracle of resurrection to life.  Preparations for Pascha begin 40 days prior to Easter; Greeks would commence in fasting, prayer, and the attendance of liturgy services during this time. Great Lent prepares believers to reach for, accept, and attain the calling of their Savior. Observance of Great Lent calls for the abstinence of many foods including all meat and dairy, repentance, and restitution for all sins committed in the past year. The duration of this period is finalized on the Sunday of the sixth week, Palm Sunday, which celebrates the beginning of Holy Week. Jesus’ arrival in Jerusalem, where He was greeted by people waving palm branches. Worshippers welcome Jesus into their hearts and show their willingness to follow Him by this greeting. The Palm Sunday tradition is that all gather in the church prior to the Divine Liturgy and fold the palm leaves into cross shapes. The church is then decorated with the palm leaves. Concluding the Palm Sunday mass, the priest distributes the blessed palm crosses to all as a symbol of victory and peace.  The church services during Holy Week run for hours, and there is a different service every day to follow the Passion of Christ, the days that led Him to the cross, and to Resurrection, according to the Greek Reporter website.  On Holy Wednesday, the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts is held. This evening is devoted to repentance, confession, and the remission of sins by the Lord. Those who attend are given the opportunity to repent their sins in Confession in preparation for communion. The service closes with the priest blessing each person with anointing oil, which many people believe has healing powers.  Holy Thursday follows with a depressing liturgy as Jesus’ betrayal is recalled and He is eventually led to His death. Four events are celebrated on this day and the ‘Twelve Gospels’ are read during service to prepare for Good Friday.  On Good Friday, the people are in mourning and the church bells ring throughout Greece to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. People will gather at the church Friday night to participate in a funeral procession for Jesus. They follow the priest and the ‘Epitafios’, a wooden construction carrying the precious cloth depicting the body of Christ and adorned with flowers. Mourners are given candles with red cups, and all share the holy light as they walk outside to mourn their savior. The processions are accompanied by a police escort, and the roads are closed for them to walk. People must be extra careful while holding the candles as there have been many instances where coats and even hair have accidentally caught fire. The Good Friday Procession is arguably the most renowned event of Holy Week, as it thoroughly recreates the biblical scenes and brings the story of Easter to life.  On Holy Saturday, or the service of the ‘Anastasi’, Greeks gather at the church at midnight for the Resurrection ceremony. Greeks ditch the dark-colored Good Friday Candles for white candles, or ‘lampathes’. Lampathes are gifted to children by their godfather or godmother and are often decorated. Children keep their lampathes for the year as they have been blessed by being lit from the Holy Flame that comes from Jerusalem. At midnight, the priests join the Greeks outside the church and chant “Christos Anesti!” and the people respond “Alithos Anesti!” This can be translated to, “Christ is risen,” “Truly, He is risen,” respectively. Greeks celebrate Christ’s Resurrection and pass around the Holy Light to bring home and bless their houses.  Returning home from Midnight vigil, it is customary to make a cross out of candle smoke above the front door to symbolize the Resurrection. Then, it is time to celebrate.  The family sits around the table to crack red eggs, symbolic of the blood and tomb of Christ. Everyone gets an egg, and it becomes a competition to see whose egg is the strongest. Families will go around the table saying the phrase “Christos Anesti,” “Alithos Anesti,” as they smash their eggs against each other. The person with the strongest egg is said to have good luck for the next year.  After eating the eggs, the traditional midnight meal is served. ‘Magiritsa’ is a special Greek soup made with lamb intestines, kidneys, and other innards. It has a distinct taste and most definitely does not appeal to everyone, but it serves as a festive way to signify the end of the 40-day fasting period.  The Easter celebrations continue throughout the day, where Greeks prepare to break their fast and enjoy lamb. The lamb is traditionally cooked for hours, rotating on a spit, which can serve as a frightful sight for a young child, or non-Greeks. ‘Tsoureki’, a sweet bread, is also prepared and served at the Easter table. Food is an integral part of Greek Easter, and most anticipate this feast all year.  Greek Easter is a day full of family, dancing, food, and celebrating. It is a day meant to be spent with loved ones. People are given a chance of rebirth as they repent their sins as they honor Jesus’ death. The belief is that Jesus died for the sins of the people, and with the miracle of His Resurrection, people are given a second chance. The traditions of Greek Easter help to preserve this miracle and allow people to experience the true story. It enhances the authenticity of the celebration, and stands as a resurrection for all.

What a winter!  Breaking all records, the long drought has ended and, at least temporarily, plentiful precipitation has saved the day.  It’s given new meaning to the moniker, “Greatest Snow on Earth,” which fell “greatly” in all-time record amounts across the state—over 900 inches at Alta—and clobbered the mountains across both central and southern Utah. Not everyone is happy; the ear-nose-and-throat specialists will have a “dry season” and the gastroenterologists will be scraping for business.  Confused? To the dismay of those particular medical specialties, Utahns will be cured of their dry coughs and will no longer be hopelessly resigned to “farting dust.” Drink up, folks!  It’s just one more disastrous crisis averted in Utah’s roller-coaster history that will likely be attributed to a miracle. Surely, Gov. Spencer Cox and most of the residents were praying that the drought would end, saving our much-treasured, amply-sized lawns and the trees that were never meant to grow here, and ensuring that Utah’s biggest industry—ski tourism—would continue its healthy growth.  The renewed water supply will also mean that pink flamingos will, once again, choose to vacation on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, and that the wandering naturists will be able to see water during their Sunday walks on the GSL shore.  Utah’s invariably-temporary end of the drought is likely to become another folk legend. It’ll go something like this in the history books: “Luckily, the seagulls had been poised and ready for takeoff. Flying from California, with their buckets of snow, they managed to make the 2022-2023 ski seasons one of the most profitable ever, dumping more than 30 inches of water and delighting everyone with endless schussing.” Then again, maybe that white stuff—all 75 feet of it—wasn’t snow at all! Ha-ha.  What, but a miracle, could explain the bonanza of welcome water? Sure, the relentless “atmospheric rivers” of moisture were an essential element, but we need to remember that it’s the “lake effect” that plays such a big part in the Wasatch Mountains' annual snowfall. Without those unique evaporative lake-effect contributions to the Wasatch snow depths, Utah’s northern ski resorts would have far less snow. It’s frankly amazing that so much snow could have fallen during a season when the GSL had retained only about 75% of its total surface area—shorted of almost 800 square miles of evaporative capability. That’s a miracle!  Sadly, there’s truth in the adage, “Be careful what you pray for.” Record precipitation is presenting the possibility of a replay of SLC’s 1983 snowmelt, when rivers flowed on the city’s primary thoroughfares after record temperatures changed the snow to wild torrents. Should that happen, we should try to have the seagulls ready and waiting, using their buckets, once again, to save the day.  Despite the ailing Brigham Young’s hearty verbal embrace of the vision before him when he arrived at the Salt Lake Valley— “This is the right place”—Utah has not exactly been the perfect spot to settle and thrive. Fraught with problems from the very beginning, it’s been a challenging location for living. Its high-altitude aridity is an unavoidable fact. Nevertheless, Young’s dreamy prediction of making the “desert blossom as a rose” has been mostly spot-on. Chalk it up to ingenuity, some fortuitous luck, and lots of hard work, Utah and the Valley of the Great Salt Lake have become a remarkably successful venture, one that would have surely baffled its early detractors.  Arriving late in the year 1847, the Mormon pioneers lost no time in planting the crops they’d need to sustain them through the next year, but autumn conditions didn’t favor a bounteous harvest, and they barely survived. The spring of 1848 brought a second planting of crops, and those did pretty well until a hoard of “Mormon"" crickets (not sure they had actually been baptized) descended from the skies. The pioneers exclaimed, “Oh, sh-t!” and things looked pretty grim.  We all know the story: The people prayed and then, voila! A flock of hungry seagulls, divinely conscripted for that specific campaign, descended on the crickets and ate every last one of those crunchy little critters. That event became a popular folk legend, though some historians have questioned whether the birds actually saved the day or only made a small contribution. Most important, miracle or not, the settlers enjoyed a healthy harvest and were able to make it through another winter.  But, that’s not where the legends about seagulls end. Despite the rudeness of Californians—describing the garbage-eating and disease-carrying birds as “flying rats”—it is rumored that seagulls equipped with special saddles brought a plentiful array of pretty, young women to early Salt Lake City, who, at just the right moment, parachuted into the fledgling town, and helped Young to fill all vacancies in his 56-wife harem. Yes, that’s right; the seagulls, once again, provided fortuitous relief to the problems of the saints. And we all know now that those 56 wives contributed to wildly-plentiful offspring and a permanent economic and political “Young” dynasty.  Utah is a great state. Endowed with amazing natural wonders and geological treats, replete with intelligent and industrious people, blessed with one of the best economies and lowest jobless rates, it stands as a living monument to the American Dream.  It’s certainly worth asking: Without the seagulls, where would we be today? Audubon would be proud.

Sometimes traditional approaches to motherhood do not work and when they fail that is when women on the journey begin taking different paths to motherhood. Alison Murray is a woman whose motherhood journey includes becoming a blended family, pregnancy and loss, adoption and a miracle. Murray’s story is as much a story of the journey to motherhood as it is a testament to faith and seeking professional support and resources unapologetically.  EBONY spoke with Murray to discuss her unique path to motherhood and to hear the lessons she has learned from her journey to motherhood.  EBONY: What was your journey to motherhood?  Alison Murray: My journey to motherhood is not what I dreamed it would be. I had it all planned out in my mind after I got married. Dwayne [her husband] and I would wait a couple of years and then start growing our family. What I wasn't thinking or appreciating at the time was the fact that I became a mother the moment I got married, as I gained my bonus son, Deuce. So, as planned, we waited a few years and then started trying to conceive. The desert that I would find myself in over the next seven years would be so devastating, I seriously doubted whether motherhood would be a reality for me. After four second-trimester miscarriages, one infant loss, and the miracle of our two sons (one through adoption and the other live birth), I can humbly say that my journey to motherhood has been one fraught with so many trials but ultimately one of triumph.  What led to your decision to adopt?  The decision to adopt came after our second pregnancy loss. I was sitting in church while a presentation was being given about adoption and fundraising to support birthmothers associated with a local adoption agency. My stepson gave me a hard jab to my ribs and then a not-so-secretive nod to the pulpit. Dwayne was in the choir loft, so I had no idea what he was thinking. However, after church, we started to have an initial discussion about what going down the path of adoption would mean for our family. It was not a backup plan or a second option. We desperately wanted to add to our family, and we were presented with a way that we honestly hadn't considered. The adoption process is not for the faint of heart, and we learned and are still learning that the process is a challenging one.  How did you overcome miscarriages and loss during your journey?  I didn't. I'm still not over them. Even when I was finally able to give birth to my son, the scars of that time and trauma remain. After Joshua died, the doctors forced me to take a break from trying. That was a very difficult space to be in. I was 35 and thought that the door was closing. What I held onto was that Joshua was the first child to survive, albeit a short time outside my body. Joshua was God's promise that Malachi was coming. That's why I advocate so heavily for mental health for those dealing with infertility, grief, and bereavement from pregnancy loss and infant loss. Therapy saved my marriage and my life. It gave me space to work out all my thoughts and emotions. To be quite honest, I still don't attend baby showers. It's a personal preference. One of my mantras is ""Protect my space and Protect my peace"". Gently declining things like baby showers are how I accomplish that. But I still make sure the momma-to-be gets an awesome gift.  What words of encouragement or advice would you offer to other women on a similar journey to motherhood?  No journey is the same. In the valleys or the desert, it's okay not to be okay. Try to hold on to ""your happy"". Most importantly, lean on Romans 8:28. He hasn't failed me yet, and I know He won't fail you either."

Miss Holroyd said that Winnie-Rae's loud cry during the delivery gave her hope that everything was going to be well.

Miss Holroyd added they are very happy that their daughter is home after spending more than half a year in hospitals but are also a bit scared of not having nurses’ support 24/7.  She added: ""It's just that worry of her getting ill because she's so small and she's still on the oxygen support.  ""She’s got a feeding tube and stoma, which is a lot for a parent to take in.  ""She’ll need her oxygen support until her lungs grow enough.  ""We've been told that she can potentially come off that when she’s two.

There was to be no miracle comeback from AC Milan as they lost 1-0 on the night against Inter and 3-0 on aggregate, crashing out in the semi-finals but also losing a fourth derby in a row against the Nerazzurri in which they did not score.  Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s goals in the first leg meant that a minor miracle was needed to reach the final in Istanbul next month, but it never came and Lautaro Martinez’s goal in the second half last night stamped Inter’s ticket.  Pioli spoke to Mediaset after the game to try and reflect on what was obviously a memorable run for the team deep into the competition, but another hurdle fallen at when it comes to their city rivals.  “It’s a big disappointment, let’s face it. We’ve had a great journey in the Champions League yes, also thinking about what we did last year, but we wanted to get to the final because that counts. There is disappointment,” he said (via MilanNews).  “Unfortunately we conditioned this semi-final with the first 15 minutes of the first leg, then for the rest we were up to a very strong team.  “We had two chances to reopen the tie I can’t reproach my players for anything. We tried with everything we had. Now we have to finish the season well, it would be a shame…  “The regrets are clearly for the first few minutes of the first leg, but then Inter won both games, not really dominating. Today much more similar to the second half of the first leg. Then we didn’t manage to score.  “We were doing well with positions, we lacked quality and precision.

(San Mateo County Sheriff's Office via AP, File)  Newly unsealed court documents show that the wife of a California radiologist accused of trying to kill his family by driving over a cliff told rescuers he was depressed and needed a psychological evaluation  REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- The wife of a California radiologist accused of trying to kill his family when he drove his Tesla off a cliff along the Northern California coast told rescuers her husband was depressed and needed a psychological evaluation, according to a newly unsealed search warrant affidavit.  The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that Neha Patel repeatedly told rescuers that Dharmesh Patel intentionally drove off a San Mateo County cliff on Jan. 2 in a bid to kill her and their two children, ages 4 and 7. All four survived in what one official called an “absolute miracle.”  Dharmesh Patel, a Pasadena radiologist, said he pulled off the road to check on a possibly flat tire, according to the warrant. Witness testimony does not appear to back up his account.  “He drove off. He’s depressed,"" Neha Patel told a California Highway Patrol officer as she was flown away from the crash site, according to the Chronicle. “He said he was going to drive off the cliff. He purposely drove off.”  Dharmesh Patel, 41, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted murder. He is in custody without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 12, at which time a judge will decide if there's enough evidence to move ahead with a trial.  Patel was driving his white 2021 Tesla Model Y along the Pacific Coast Highway south of San Francisco when the car plunged several hundred feet off the cliff at Devil’s Slide. Firefighters had to cut the family out of the wreckage.  The warrant affidavit includes an interview with Patel while he was recovering from major lower body injuries. In the interview, he said his wife was irritated shortly before the plunge off the cliff because she didn't want to stop at his brother's house in San Mateo County before making their drive home to the Los Angeles area, the Chronicle reported.  He said he was not really depressed but that he felt down because times were bad in the world, according to the affidavit.  ""Asked if he felt suicidal, he said, ‘You know, not like a plan, not usually,’"" the affidavit said."

Makeup legend Bobbi Brown’s Jones Road Beauty opens its new East Hampton store on Wednesday, May 17.  The new store, located at 55 Main Street, is the first on Long Island for the brand though Brown has long had a home in the Hamptons.  “I love to work where I live and really love living in Sag Harbor. It’s so relaxed,” Brown tells Behind The Hedges.  In fact, her new company’s name comes right from East Hampton.  “We had worked with some copywriters and were racking our brains on the name for weeks and nothing was sticking,” Brown remembers.  “Then one day, my husband and I were driving to the Hamptons and I was navigating. I looked down and there it was on the Waze navigation app: Jones Road. I immediately loved the name and so did my husband and the team. We checked to see if it was available and it was, so the brand became Jones Road. I’m also obsessed with all things British so I liked that it sounds like a bespoke UK brand.”  Jones Road was created with the philosophy that the world doesn’t need more beauty products but instead needs better beauty products. The clean, high-grade formulations are meant to work with every skin type and tone and are simple to use.  “I’m a makeup artist and I love formulating and creating new products,” explains Brown, who left her well-known namesake company in 2016 (Estée Lauder bought the company in 1995 and Brown stayed on with the company for nearly two decades. She is no longer affiliated or associated with Bobbi Brown Cosmetics or Bobbi Brown branded products).  “When I started working on Jones Road, I was thinking about what I wanted and what I know other women wanted because they were asking me on my social media channels. I was focused on creating a clean beauty brand that over-delivered on my expectations and Jones Road is it: an edited indispensable collection of clean, high-grade formulations designed for all ages, skin types and skin tones.”  Jones Road launched in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic as a direct-to-consumer cosmetics line. The flagship store opened in Montclair, New Jersey, where Brown and her husband also reside, in 2021 and there is also a store in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.  “When someone is wearing Jones Road, I want them to feel like themselves on their best day. The most powerful beauty product is self-confidence. I want our customers to feel good in their own skin, with just the right amount of makeup,” Brown says.  Brown says she set out to create the makeup equivalent of a Swiss Army Knife, “products that were clean, easy to use and multi-purpose that worked for any skin type or skin tone.” Many of the products fit that description, but her favorite is the Miracle Balm, “a one-of-a-kind game-changing product.” It’s now available in nine shades.  “On my social channels, I do a lot of educational content about Miracle Balm to show consumers how to use it. You use your fingers to press into the balm, breaking the seal so all the emollients mix into the formula. Then, you just rub your fingers together and pat the Miracle Balm onto your cheeks and/or lips (for a subtle glow and to add luminosity). It makes you instantly look better,” she says.  “The Jones Road aesthetic — cool, clean beauty — aligns perfectly with the Hamptons vibe,” Brown says. “It’s hard to find the perfect space so when we saw this location open up, we jumped on it. We love the neighborhood, it’s one of my favorite alleyways. We’re so looking forward to opening our doors.”  Several launches are planned this month. Jones Road recently released a lab sample of its first fragrance called “Shower” and it sold out within 48 hours – not to worry, though, Brown says it will be back on the shelves this fall. Jones Road is also introducing a collection of tinted powders later this month, just in time for the summer.  For Memorial Day weekend, the brand is releasing a limited-edition set of mini Miracle Balms “that I think will be gone in days,” Brown says. “We are so excited to launch a new bronzer this June.”  Email [email protected] with further comments, questions, or tips.

The town council has agreed to give Kerry Irving, who has a massive global following online for his escapades with his spaniels, the highest order of merit the local authority can give.  The Freedom of the Town is given to someone who is, in the opinion of the council, a person of distinction and has rendered eminent services to the local area.

He will be bestowed with the honour at a special ceremony to be held at Hope Park – the home of the statue of Mr Irving’s beloved spaniel Max – on Friday May 26 at 1.30pm.  Max died last year but has left a huge legacy behind. The popular dog was awarded the animal equivalent of an OBE – the PDSA Order of Merit – and raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities and supported people through the Covid-19 pandemic through social media updates of adventures with Mr Irving in the Lake District.  Mr Irving credits Max for turning his life around after a traffic collision left him with chronic pain and unable to walk as well as mental health issues.  There will be a short council meeting at the park to confirm that the authority will confer the honour, and then the mayor, Cllr Steve Harwood, will present Mr Irving with the Freedom Scroll before a short speech is delivered.  Council clerk Vivien Little said the honour was being conferred on Mr Irving because he had raised the profile of the town so much, had done incredible work for charity and for Hope Park.  He had also done a huge amount to bring mental health issues to the forefront nationally."

Christ is Risen!  Once again we are assembled for the Clergy Laity Assembly of the Holy Metropolis of New Jersey. I have just returned from a pilgrimage to the Patriarchate of Alexandria, and I would share some of the inspiration that all of the pilgrims – received, from His Beatitude Patriarch Theodore, from the faithful clergy, and the lay leaders we encountered.  For this ancient and venerable Church – founded by the Apostle and Evangelist Mark himself, has embraced a healthy and positive zeal for mission throughout Africa, despite the many and arduous challenges She faces.  As we engage today on behalf of our Metropolis, with many reports and useful information, I will uphold the example of our Alexandrian brethren, to inspire our labors to even greater heights. They serve an entire continent, and for their fidelity to the canonical order of the Church, they have endured an uncanonical invasion of their rightful ecclesiastical domain by the Russian Church. This unfortunate state of affairs speaks to the righteousness of the Alexandrian cause; for they suffer for standing with our Most Holy Ecumenical Patriarchate, by supporting the independence and autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. Against such pressures, our problems cannot loom very large, for we are blessed to live in a country of freedom and prosperity. And the Metropolis of New Jersey is a network of successful communities who receive great benefits, merely by being American.  Therefore, today as we consider all the items on our agenda, I want all of us to keep our Alexandrian brothers and sisters in mind. They do not allow a paucity of resources to keep them from ministry. They not only make do with what they have, they multiply the effects of their ministries through their love and devotion. They take the little, and they turn it into the great. Much like our Lord Jesus Christ did when He fed the Five Thousand.  Everyone remembers the story of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, the only miracle to occur in all Four Gospels. There are two ways to look at it. First, we can easily say that for the Lord, Who created Heaven and Earth, to multiply five loaves and two fishes to feed the thousands, would have surely have been simple. But there is another way to think about this miracle.  Perhaps, when the young boy offered all that he had – and I note here the detail from the Gospel of John, that the boy’s loaves were of the poorest quality – perhaps the people who witnessed his pure offering were inspired. Perhaps many of those thousands had brought food with them, that day, but were keeping it hidden only for themselves. When they witnessed the generosity, and the Lord’s blessing, their hearts were freed to be generous with others. I am not saying that one version is better or worse than the other. But I think you will all agree with me. We can consider them both miracles.  Therefore, when I consider the wonders of community building, of missionary activity, and all the superb efforts of the Patriarchate of Alexandria on behalf of all Africa, I see a similar miracle. They are doing so very much with so very little. And here in the God-saved Metropolis of New Jersey, we are no different, except our resources are certainly more abundant. What is needed is to maintain and augment our generosity of spirit, our capacities to love and forgive, our commitment to philanthropy and compassion. The blessings of this Metropolis are self-evident: outstanding clergy and lay leadership, established communities, and a desire to live the Gospel.  Let us then, my beloved sisters and brothers in the Risen Lord, take inspiration from our brethren across the sea. And let us apply ourselves at every stage of Church life with the same passion and the energy that is transforming Africa.  We have every advantage. We have every opportunity. With God’s help, and through the intercessions of His Holy Mother and those of the Metropolis’ heavenly patron, Saint John Chrysostom, we shall succeed.  Χριστὸς Ἀνέστη!"

Zoe Milsom and her beloved Frenchie “fur baby” got pregnant at the same time. Now, the mom is recalling the thrilling experience.  Milsom, 29, is already mom to Leon, 13. She and her beau, Paul, got engaged in May 2020, eager to see their family grow.  But an ectopic pregnancy and a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can affect fertility, dashed her hopes of a baby.  A human one, that is.  While Zoe Milsom was pregnant, Beau curled up on her belly and rarely left her side. Jam Press  Milsom and Beau experienced losses — a void that baby Alfie helped fill. Jam Press  The couple soon welcomed Beau, the French bulldog, into their home as their beloved “fur baby.”  “She was the second child I never had and quickly became one of the family, going on holidays and any trips with us,” Milsom told Jam Press.  Her 2022 pregnancy, then, came as quite the shock, as did Beau’s seven months later.  “I couldn’t believe we were going to be mommies together,” Milsom gushed.  For Milsom, Alfie was a miracle after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy and believing she’d never conceive another child naturally. Jam Press  While the couple weren’t “very happy” about their pup’s pregnancy because it “definitely wasn’t the right time,” they welcomed the challenge.  “I was very excited, as the feeling of being a mom is amazing,” she continued. “It’s a new life being brought into the world — or in her case, nine — and we planned on keeping at least one puppy for her to have a motherly bond with.”  Milsom couldn’t wait to see how Beau interacted with Alfie, who was born in November 2022, after the pup cozied up to her belly for nine months.  Two weeks after Alfie arrived, Beau gave birth to a litter of nine, but none of them survived due to complications from an infection.  Beau and Alfie are best buds now. Jam Press  “I understood her pain having lost a baby of my own,” Milsom said, recalling how forlorn Beau appeared as she moped around the house. “I couldn’t stop crying, and I tried all I could to save them, but nothing worked.  “I felt like I had let my little girl down, as she had gone through all of that for nothing — it was heartbreaking,” she added.  While Beau has since been spayed, her bond with little Alfie is “amazing.”  “It’s amazing seeing them together, as she protects him with her mothering instincts and sees him as one of her own,” Milsom said of her “miracles.”  “I look at them both everyday, and my eyes fill with tears because of how in love and proud I am of my two little babies,” said Milsom. Jam Press  When Alfie cries, Beau attempts to soothe him by licking his face. Jam Press  When Alfie cries, Beau soothingly licks his face and often “falls asleep with him at night.”  Where Beau filled a void for Milsom, Alfie is doing the same for the Frenchie.  “I’m so grateful for both of them, they’re miracles,” Milsom said.  “I look at them both everyday, and my eyes fill with tears because of how in love and proud I am of my two little babies.”"

LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — WNY has played a huge role in celebrating the history and preserving the future of one of New York State's most iconic recreational areas, the site of two Olympic games, Lake Placid.  In February of 2020, Daybreak took you up for the start of what was then a $100 million renovation, but ultimately the project grew to a $550 million overhaul spanning several years, modernizing 6 different venues (five in the Adirondacks and one in the Catskills) as well as the construction of a new administration building for the Olympic Regional Development Authority in Lake Placid. Now that it is complete, the upgrades are getting high marks.  At this year's Miracle On Ice fantasy camp, the men behind the miracle, like former Sabres' captain, Mike Ramsey, got their first peak at the renovated complex.  ""It's a wonderful town, it's a pretty cool place to visit and obviously it holds a pretty special place in my heart,"" Ramsey said.  This project wasn't just a fresh coat of paint and new furniture, it was a restoration and reimagining of all of the sites, bringing them back to international competition standards, and beyond. Among the projects, Whiteface, Belleayre & Gore Mountains received updates to snowmaking, electrical, lodge, lift improvements or replacements, and E-groomers.  At the Olympic Jumping Complex they built Intervales Lodge, added new LED lighting, elevated deck, frost rails and in-run reinforcements, elevator replacement, gondola, and summer surfaces. It is now the only facility in North America certified for summer and winter training and competition. At the Olympic Center they added LED lighting, 1932 and 1980 arenas modernization, Oval modernization, refrigeration plant, e-zamboni’s, a new public space called Miracle Plaza, and a brand new Lake Placid and Olympic Museum.  Among the biggest investments was at Mt. Van Hoevenberg, where they built a new 55,000 square foot building called the Mountain Pass Lodge, along with new snowmaking, electrical improvements, a biathlon stadium, e-groomer, roller loops and roadway paving, Nordic competition trails, and even a mountain coaster. The facility also features the nation's only indoor refrigerated bobsled and luge start track.  All of this work, has a strong Queen City footprint, beginning with the original architectural design work, done by the Buffalo team of CannonDesign. Jamie Graham says it is a project that will stay with her.  ""It's a once in a lifetime project. A project with so much history. It was really great just to see that from beginning all the way through the end and when it opened back up.""  Buffalo's Hadley Exhibits brought much of that work to life, in one of the new centerpieces, the Olympic museum.  ""It was a lot to start with and I never really thought about 1932. There was a whole 'nother game"" company president Ted Johnson. He said this was definitely a project of passion said.  ""It was such an emotional connection, remembering where I was for the miracle on ice. My mother never showed emotion and there she is and she's crying and I'll never forget that.""  Another WNY connection came with the pennants on the wall in the museum. The recreations are the handy work of Buffalo's own Oxford Pennant.  There is history all around, but the mission here was to celebrate that history and replace the artifacts that were still in use, like the mechanics in the Olympic Center's refrigeration plant, that supports the ice surfaces of three indoor rinks and the outdoor speed skating oval. It was the same system that was in use when Herb Brooks' team won gold, and Eric Heiden took home 5 gold medals during the 1980 games.  Facilities Superintendent Eric Martin, a Rochester native, says he was having to get very creative to even keep things going.  ""It was old and dated. I was finding parts on eBay, hot-wiring things here and there, the parts just weren't available,"" Martin said.  Olympic Center General Manager Chadd Cassidy, who grew up right next door to the center, says this is about keeping the facilities sustainable for the next 50 years or more.  ""We can do everything that we did before, but we do it a lot better,"" Cassidy said."

Psalms 34: 18 KJV  Today we celebrate the life of our beloved Cynthia Denise “Footsie” Travis, a wonderful daughter, loving mother and grandmother, a beautiful sister, aunt, Godmother, cousin and friend.  On May 7th, 2023, as the sun begin to set, Cynthia transitioned from this Earthly Realm in the comforts of her home in Benton Harbor, Michigan. She was employed by JVIS Manufacturing, Benton Harbor Michigan for several years where she worked in numerous capacities.  Cynthia graced the world with her presence on November 11, 1960, to the proud parents of Delores Carter Travis and Bill Robinson in Berrien Center, Michigan. She was coined with the nickname “Footsie” by a family friend. She was short in stature, yet she had the heart of a giant.  Cynthia accepted Christ as her personal savior at an early age under the spiritual guidance of Reverend C. L. Woodson at Pleasant Grove Missionary Baptist Church, where she was a member of the youth choir and was crowned many times as the Tom Thumb Queen. She enjoyed spending time with family and friends and she never met a stranger.  Cynthia received her formal education in the Benton Harbor Area Schools District and was a proud graduate of the Benton Harbor High School class of 1978 in which she remained a faithful member.  Cynthia was formerly employed at Mercy Hospital as a Pharmacy Tech (her 1st job), the Manager of Burger King for many years, and Wollin Products where she received her miracle child.  Upon graduation, Cynthia enlisted in the United States Army where she proudly served as PFC Cynthia Denise Travis, and upon completion of her tour she became a member of the Michigan Army National Guard where she served for many years. She would often celebrate with fellow soldiers and Captain Newton, whom she loved and respected dearly.  In 1986 she married the love of her life, Mr. Leonard Brock, and to this union a precious little girl was born whom they affectionately named Lenesha Denise.  Cynthia continued living life her way and as graduation was drawing near for Lenesha, she showed us once again that her story would be told her way. To all of our surprise Cynthia and Eddie French welcomed a miracle, literally, and what better way to express their gratitude as the name of their new bundle of joy, their baby girl, Miracle Denise Delores Travis. A special thank you to God and an honor to her Mother and Miracle’s grandmother, the late Mrs. Delores Carter.  Cynthia loved her girls Lenesha and Miracle, with her whole heart and adored her grandchildren Dontrall, DeAndre, Jamylah and Jaylen.  Cynthia was an awesome sister to all of her siblings and the bond she shared with each of them was established at an early age, as Mama Delores made sure of that.  Cynthia enjoyed life and lived it unapologetically. She told her story, her way.  Cynthia would often say that “she was tired and I’m going to go lay down” and in true “Footsie” fashion, this time she meant it. Her favorite song in which she sang as a child was “I Shall Wear A Crown”. It is our prayer that our Lord and Saviour heard her plea.  Our dearly beloved Cynthia Denise, we will cherish the many memories and hold dear in our hearts your love and kindred spirit, you’re free.  She leaves precious memories to be cherished in the hearts of her daughters: Lenesha Travis and Miracle Travis of Benton Harbor, MI and Gwendolyn Williams Wallace of Indianapolis, IN.

It’s an aptly bold reintroduction for the artist’s first real statement since coming out as gay and nonbinary, and following their big move from Nashville to New York. Titled “Cheerleader,” the release sees Anne redefine themselves with a queer anthem and accompanying visual to reclaim nostalgic environments that often leave out LGBTQ+ people.  From bouncing through choreo with pom poms in-hand to making out passionately in the bleachers, the entire video is a power-pop run through every classic high school scenario — only in Anne’s world the misfits are centered and popular kids are all pushed to the side. This, for Anne and their castmates like co-star Eva Victor , “became a therapeutic catharsis” and led to a much “lighter feeling” after all was said and done. And this joy is palpable, with Anne repeating the sunny hook, “I’ll be your cheerleader,” amidst other satisfying “woo’s!” and a pitched down “chic electric!”  ""The Gay Miracle"" — A Poem by Liza Anne  There is so much found in a sacred beginning.  Maybe the most sacred thing is when you realize it’s not a beginning at all.  My nose pressed to the glass of all the moments in yesterday when  my body, my love, my spirit, my language, my perspective, my emotions  all hinted at, nearly screamed towards, what I only recently had full context for.  The miraculous slow uncovering of what has been pulsing in me since birth  The slow melt into oneself - finally and on time.  That is the gay miracle ...  to notice - and deeper, still ... to recognize  not because it is new but because it is ancient.  As known in your earthly body as breath and a window into the great celestial  A promise that everything everywhere is expanding and healing and there are seconds  Second chances, second winds, second childhoods.  We are the conscious plant, aware of their growing, blooming from the soil of those around us saying  “I see you and when you are ready, you will, too.”  That patient, generous holding that comes from a community who understands - with a sobering weight - the process of becoming.  I am here now because I have been loved in a way that makes sense to me.  I am not scared anymore - I am comforted by the context that comes with the miracle of being gay.  Every second that goes by, I understand more.  The grief I felt, the discomfort, the itchy skin because clothes felt wrong  How hugging my friends flushed my face pink and gave me a fever  How many times I felt almost, not quite - othered within either.  And all of the sudden I look around at the piles of pain  Cataloguing what didn’t seem related  And I am healing.  Being gay is a miracle.  Wherever there has been loss, ten fold it is recovered in the undeniable sense of belonging that comes with it.  Leaning into the parts of myself that felt other and finding a deeper sense of home - that is the gay miracle.  Coming around the corner to a second childhood - that is the gay miracle.  Holding each other in a way that can only bloom from what has been historically and secretly shared - that is the gay miracle.  It is the quiet self being given a megaphone, finally.  It is another childhood but this time with what you needed, tenfold.  It’s the truth put on and danced around in.  It is the constant wonder of softening, lightening, opening, widening - it is the conversation I want to be having over and over again.  My movement towards joy holds hands with, is twisted up with and completely meshed with being gay.  One couldn’t happen without the other. I am so happy to be here."

Addressing the media at the PHU office, at Etul Kotte, MP Gammanpila said that having made controversial remarks regarding Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism, ‘Pastor’ Fernando couldn’t be allowed to continue with his sowing of discord with other religions.  ‘Pastor’ Fernando flew out of Bandaranaike International Airport, on May 14. After President Ranil Wickremesinghe’s directive to investigate ‘Pastor’ Fernando, over his recent statements, he announced his intention to come back home over the coming weekend.  ‘Pastor Fernando’ declared open the ‘Miracle Dome,’ built at a cost of Rs. 3 bn, about a year ago. The construction of the state-of-the-art building was launched in 2015. The Catholic Church has denounced ‘Pastor’ Fernando, while urging tangible measures against him.  Attorney-at-Law Gammanpila said that ‘Pastor’ Fernando, who calls himself a ‘prophet’, should be dealt with under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Lawmaker Gammanpila said that actually ‘Pastor’ Fernando had caused more harm to Catholics by his ‘miracles’ and utterances than to other religions.  Explaining how ICCPR applied in ‘pastor’ Fernando’s case, MP Gammanpila said that if found guilty he could face a prison term of up to 10 years. The former minister urged the police to take a court order to ban ‘prayers’ at the Miracle Dome as the failure to do so could create an environment for violence.  The MP said that if the police failed to act, they would be forced to launch protests against ‘Miracle Dome’ gatherings.  The MP told The Island that the police should investigate whether ‘pastor’ Fernando deliberately insulted other religions to cause a violent backlash. “We have had experience of catastrophic situations as a result of violence inspired by people. We shouldn’t allow that to happen again,” the MP said."

But the Englishman's fireworks failed to lift the Punjab Kings which slumped to a 15-run defeat to the already-eliminated Delhi Capitals in its make-or-break IPL game in Dharamsala on Wednesday.  The defeat was a biter pill to swallow for the Kings who have been now pushed to the brink of elimination by a team that miraculously rediscovered its batting mojo.  With nothing but pride to play for, Delhi put on 213 for two on the board on the back of South African Rilee Rossouw's stunning 82 off 37 balls.  Even skipper David Warner was fluent during his 31-ball 46.  And the enigmatic Prithvi Shaw, playing his first match in almost a month, returned to form with a sparkling 38-ball 54.  If only these batters had come up with efforts like these in the early stages of the tournament, Delhi would still have been in the race for the playoffs.  But their stroke-filled knocks have now dealt a huge blow to the Punjab Kings' hopes of making the playoffs.  With just 12 points from 13 matches, the Kings are still in with a mathematical chance.  On Friday, Shikhar Dhawan's team will take on Rajasthan Royals, another team on 12 points from 13 games, in another make-or-break game.  The winner of that clash is still unlikely to get into the playoffs as the Royal Challengers Bangalore (12 points from 12 games) would take a big step forward if it beats the Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday.  The RCB would then qualify if it beats the Gujarat Titans, the first team to reach the playoffs on Sunday and Mumbai Indians (14 points from 13 matches) loses to Sunrisers Hyderabad on the same day.  Among the teams battling for the remaining three playoff spots, Chennai Super Kings (15 points from 13 matches) and Lucknow Super Giants (15 points from 13 matches) are comparatively better placed.

That’s how many it takes to be dubbed a “saint.” Are you a saint? I’m not.  In this Patheos column, we plan to ask: would a scientific confirmation of a miraculous healing help us in determining sainthood? What do you think? Let’s explore the question.  How do Roman Catholics understand miracles?  If you’re a Roman Catholic you’ll likely think of miracles as…  “…wonders performed by supernatural power as signs of some special mission or gift and explicitly ascribed to God…. Hence the miracle is called supernatural, because the effect is beyond the productive power of nature and implies supernatural agency.”  In short, a miracle is a proof of sorts, a proof that God is at work. We read in the Catechism of the Catholic Church how miracles provide evidence to tantalize our rational sensibility.  “Thus the miracles of Christ and the saints, prophecies, the Church’s growth and holiness, and her fruitfulness and stability are the most certain signs of divine Revelation, adapted to the intelligence of all; they are “motives of credibility” (motiva credibilitatis), which show that the assent of faith is by no means a blind impulse of the mind” (Vatican 2003, 1.1.3.156.).  So, let’s wonder out loud: might we examine miracles scientifically? Especially, might we examine scientifically the two or more healing miracles each saint performs?  After all, Pope Francis enlists science in the service of rendering a theological judgment. “The process of Saints’ Causes moves from the scientific evaluation of the Medical Council or technical experts to a theological examination.” So, may I respectfully ask about a scientific investigation into healing miracles?  Let’s ask Cardinal William Joseph Levada  I got my chance to ask this question. It was during a meeting of the CTNS (Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences) board one Saturday in late Spring 2014. Seated next to me at the meeting was fellow board member, Cardinal William Joseph Levada (1936-2019).  The cardinal was the right person to ask. Not only was he interested in the interaction between faith and science, but he had also served as Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Vatican from 2005 to 2012. And, only a few weeks prior to our conversation, on April 27, 2014, Pope Saint John Paul II along with Pope Saint John XXIII had been canonized. This meant the investigation of Pope Saint John Paul II’s two miracles had recently concluded, something the Cardinal would likely know all about.  The Two Healing Miracles of Pope Saint John Paul II  In the case of Pope Saint John Paul II, one miracle involved a French nun, Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, who had suffered from Parkinson’s Disease. In 2005, her congregation prayed to the pontiff in heaven to intercede on her behalf. She was then healed.  The second miracle involved Florabeth Mora of Costa Rica who was healed of an otherwise fatal brain aneurysm. The healing, she said, was the result of John Paul’s intercession during prayer.  These claims were investigated by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. The results of the investigations were then reported to Pope Francis, who promulgated the canonization decree.  How did Cardinal Levada answer?  With this in mind, during coffee break I asked Cardinal Levada about the two healing miracles this way: “do you think the investigation into the veracity of these miracle claims counts as an example of science serving faith?”  Our conversation took two coffee breaks to follow the long, long train of logic: could scientific investigation confirm or disconfirm that God had acted miraculously? Or, to be more precise, could science determine that what happened “can only be attributed to divine intervention”?  Finally, the Cardinal demurred. “No, I don’t think so.”  “Why?” I pressed.  “Because in almost all cases we’re talking about healing miracles. And healing miracles are especially difficult. They’re ambiguous. It’s difficult to distinguish between a supernatural cure and a spontaneous remission. Even after medical investigation, it’s not crystal clear exactly what was responsible for the healing.”  I was reminded of my friend Paul Lange who would describe healing miracles prosaically as examples of the freak rate.  Jesus’ miracles were unconvincing.  Not everyone who witnesses a miracle is persuaded by what they see. Even Jesus’ miracles were ambiguous to some viewers. In the healing miracle of the man with the withered hand, for example, Jesus only raised the ire of the Scribes and Pharisees.  On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. The scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. Even though he knew what they were thinking, he said to the man who had the withered hand, ‘Come and stand here.’ He got up and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, ‘I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to destroy it?’ After looking around at all of them, he said to him, ‘Stretch out your hand.’ He did so, and his hand was restored. But they [Scribes and Pharisees] were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus. (Luke 6:6-10)  The Scribes and Pharisees witnessed exactly what others witnessed. But, they could not believe that the healings had come from God. So, they began to plot against Jesus.  I gather we should conclude with Cardinal Levada: healing miracles are ambiguous. Regardless of what you perceive objectively, you can still subjectively deny that divine power had anything to do with it.  Conclusion  Is this the best definition of miracles? Miracles are ”wonders performed by supernatural power as signs of some special mission or gift and explicitly ascribed to God.”  I think the problem is with the phrase, “explicitly ascribed to God.” In the case of Jesus and in the case of Pope Saint John Paul II, the healing miracles remain ambiguous to those who witness and to those who investigate them.

It was the call she and her family had been praying for: the hospital found a kidney that would match Charlene’s daughter, MaryAshley.  “Within a few minutes of getting the call, our faculty jumped in,” said Charlene, who works at a school in Charleston, South Carolina. “One of the teachers got on the computer and got us a flight booked [to LA.] Our principal went out and stopped the traffic so we can get out.”  There’s a reason the community jumped to action as soon as the Barbots got the news that a kidney is available for MaryAshely. It took 10 years to find a kidney that would be suitable for the 19-year-old.  Get Southern California news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC LA newsletters.  Born with a kidney defect as well as developmental delays and speech/hearing impairments, MaryAshley had her first kidney transplant surgery before her second birthday. Several years later, her body rejected the donated organ, so the family had to resume the grueling journey of looking for a donor for Ashely.  “We knew at that point the possibility of another transplant was slim to none,” Charlene says. “Close to 400 people tried to be living donors for her. We went down that road for 10 years. Hundreds of people tried to be donors for years including family, but no one was a match.”  Because MaryAshley has unusually high levels of antibodies in her blood, her system would fight and reject any new organ into her body.  “There are what I call ‘good’ antibodies and ‘not-so-good’ antibodies,” explains Dr. Dechu Puliyanda, a pediatric nephrologist who has been taking care of MaryAshley. “Good antibodies like COVID fight off infections. But like in MaryAshley’s case, when you have antibodies against another person, it means if that person gives you the kidney, those antibodies will attack the kidney immediately.”  When MaryAshley turned to the Cedar Sinai’s transplant program for help a decade ago, the extent of her antibodies was 99.9%, which is why she could not get any donors.  Fast-forward to now, it’s been seven months since MaryAshley had a kidney transplant at Cedars Sinai. Her medical team believes all the signs are pointing the right direction.  “I got a call from the biopsy, saying there was no rejection. My jaw fell off,” Dr. Puliyanda recalls. “It was a big miracle.”  With a new lease on life, MaryAshley doesn’t want to miss a beat in everything she does, according to her mom.  “She has far more energy than we do. She doesn’t want to waste a second of it,” Charlene says. “She’s always asking me, ‘What are we going to do tomorrow? What are we doing the next day?’ She’s ready to take on the world every day.”  In her quest to finding joy in everything in life, MaryAshley has been keeping busy. After attending her first prom, where she was a nominated as a prom queen runner-up, the teen also had her first job-shadowing experience by observing nurses at her school.

While most aptly described as noise-punk, the band has dabbled in a wide range of styles over the years, from jazz to psychedelia to contemporary classical. It’s no surprise that Miracle-Level, their newest album, is so electric with creative risks.  In many ways, Miracle-Level is a typical Deerhoof album – from the first bars of “Sit Down, Let Me Tell You a Story”, listeners are met with needle-sharp electric guitar, jagged riffs playfully warring with the softness of the vocals, set to a backdrop of machine-gun drums. In other ways, Miracle-Level is entirely different: most notably, the entire album is in singer Satomi Matsuzaki’s native Japanese.  When asked for the reasoning behind this choice, band members have cited both a desire to appeal to the rising popularity of J-rock in English-speaking countries and the desire to reject English, the language of “the world’s policemen.” While certainly unconventional, this double-edged philosophy works perfectly for a band so skilled at striking delicate balances as Deerhoof.  The overall sound of Miracle-Level is energetic and rock-forward, but songs often fall into gaps of contemplative silence or dissolve into silly rock n roll riffs as in “My Lovely Cat!”, switching their tempo and energy at the drop of a hat. Unlike more traditional punk (including earlier work by Deerhoof), the clean and simple production of Miracle-Level gives a sharp, art-pop feeling to the album, in the same way that a paint-splattered canvas might look refined when placed in a frame.  If there’s a major gripe to be had with Miracle-Level, it’s that the album isn’t exactly approachable. Between its frantic instrumentation and wild melody lines, the experience of listening all the way through feels kind of like sitting in a speeding car without a seatbelt on. Frequently, songs break down midway through and collapse into spiraling, repetitive riffs, a motif that may grow tiresome to some listeners by the end of the album.  Luckily, Deerhoof has a talent for apportioning breathers. “The Poignant Melody” and “The Little Maker” take down the tempo, offering a bluesy sound that highlights the wavery charm of Matsuzaki’s vocals, and “Miracle-Level” begins as a soft piano ballad, a welcome relief after the thrash and clamor of “Jet-Black Double-Shield.” When the energy builds so high as to become grating, Deerhoof knows how to pull it back down just as skillfully as they ratchet it up.  However, even these songs don’t give listeners full respite. Just as the more punk-forward songs on the album insist on complexity, the more mellow songs still carry a certain tension. Though uneasy high notes and dissonant, echoey piano chords prevent the listener from finding true comfort, these choices give the album a sense of artistic cohesion. Even in its calmer moments, Miracle-Level is a live wire, a current thrumming beneath its surface."

The basic materials company recently released its quarterly earnings data on May 3rd, beating the consensus estimate by $0.58, with an earnings per share of $3.78. Though the return on equity is impressive at 81.02%, Scotts Miracle-Gro did have a negative net margin of 16.57%. The business earned $1.53 billion in revenue for the quarter, falling short of analysts’ predictions of $1.61 billion and experiencing an 8.8% year-over-year decrease in revenue.  Scotts Miracle-Gro Co specializes in the production, marketing, and distribution of products and services for lawn care, gardening and landscape, hydroponic hardware and growing environments, lighting controls, and marketing agreements. With this wide array of offerings available under its umbrella brand name Scotts Miracle-Gro has grown into a household name synonymous with successful gardening techniques.  The recent upgrade from a “sell” to a “hold” rating comes as welcome news to both investors in the company and those who rely on Scotts Miracle-Gro’s products for their own lawn care needs. As predicted by analysts, the basic materials company is set to post an EPS of 2.8 for the current year.  Overall it is clear that Scotts Miracle-Gro remains a leader in its industry but also continues to work towards improvement despite fantastic returns on equity year after year while delivering excellent service as well as top-of-the-line products.

On Friday, May 5th, UBS Group lowered their target price from $80.00 to $70.00. Raymond James had also lowered the target price from $92.00 to $86.00 on Thursday, May 4th while Stifel Nicolaus had lowered it from $80.00 to $78.00 on the same day with Barclays following suit on Wednesday, April 26th when they too reduced Scotts Miracle-Gro from an “overweight” rating to an “equal weight” rating thereby bringing down their price objective for the company from $105.00 to $70.00. Furthermore, Truist Financial had decreased their price objective on Scotts Miracle-Gro from $70.00 to $65.00 on Thursday, May 4th.  Interestingly though, four investment analysts have given Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock a hold rating while three gave it a buy rating with one offering it a strong buy rating delivering it with overall Moderate Buy consensus ratings coupled with a consensus price target of $76.29 as stated by Bloomberg.  Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock opened at $65.53 on Wednesday with its fifty-day simple moving average located at $70.88 and its two-hundred-day simple moving average situated at $65.38 as observed by financial indicators.This type of behavior is scaring some investors since this indicates an uncertainty about future revenue since the value has continually being adjusted downwards despite previous optimism.  However,it is important to note that Scotts Miracle-Gro has continued to demonstrate its resilience within its field of specialization;with major areas of focus including lawn care products,gardening services both for indoors spaces and landscape as well as hydroponic hardware and growing environments. The company has consistently offered valuable products and services to meet consumers’ needs.  Looking deeper into the recent news, it is observed that on Thursday, February 16th, EVP Denise Stump sold 2,503 shares of the stock at an average price of $86.51 thereby attaining a total transaction of $216,534.53. Following the sale,the executive vice president now directly owns 39,875 shares in the company valued approximately at $3,449,586.25.On Friday May 12,Ceo James Hagedorn sold 25,000 shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro’s stock price at an average value of $67 amounting to a net worth of $1,675,000.00.The Chief Executive Officer now directly owns 179,899 shares in the company equating to approximarely $12 million dollars.The transaction was disclosed in a document filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission through which valuable information can be obtained.Also,during this timeframe,EVP Denise Stump had sold an additional number of stocks.  The above data depicts instability since there is no statistical constant variation between value purchased or resold by executives,and its analysis reveals that insiders own 27.28% of the enterprise’s Shares.  Institutional investors and Hedge funds made several acquisitions and dispositions respectively in recent times.Subsequently,hedge fund owners have initiated series of negotiations leading to possible transactions with Scotts Miracle-Gro Co.  Overall,it is important investors need to weigh various factors before making investment choices ,however it’s advisable not make any rush decisions solely upon seeing information about target pricing.A good understanding should be reached as pertaining to all relevant factors before any decision making thereby edifying one from mistakes that could culminate into financial loss.At last count around 69% percent ownership belonged to institutional investors and hedge funds,speaking volumes for vested interests in the stability of this stock."

Weekly injections of semaglutide were found to significantly reduce the weight of adolescents in a major trial of the new drug.  Experts said the findings support calls for children as young as 12 to be given the appetite-suppressing medicine, in a bid to drive down childhood obesity levels.  Researchers described the results of the treatment - which saw children lose an average of three stone - as ‘transformational for many teenagers.’  Almost half of 12 to 18-year-olds using the drug dropped below the clinical cut-off for obesity, according to the research involving 201 youngsters  They suggested early intervention could help protect children from a lifetime of obesity and its associated health complications.  But they warned it was likely children would pile on the pounds once they stopped using the treatment, meaning they would potentially be taking it ‘for life.’  Almost half of 12 to 18-year-olds using the drug dropped below the clinical cut-off for obesity, according to the research involving 201 youngsters.  On average, those taking part weighed 17 stone and lost 3 stone during the 16-month trial.  Three-quarters (74 per cent) of those taking semaglutide had an improvement of one or more BMI categories compared to fewer than one in five (19 per cent) taking a placebo.  Overall, it was found to reduce the proportion of children with the most severe degree of obesity from 37 to 14 per cent.  Presenting his findings at the European Congress on Obesity in Dublin, Dr Aaron Kelly, from University of Minnesota Medical School, said semaglutide should be available on the NHS for all teenagers with obesity ‘as part of a comprehensive treatment approach’ including lifestyle advice.  It was found to reduce the proportion of children with the most severe degree of obesity from 37 to 14 per cent  He said: ‘Semaglutide is transformative for many children who are able to get access. It can be lifechanging.  ‘Nothing brings me more pleasure than hearing the stories from adolescents who have been struggling their entire life to manage their weight of it. This gives them a tool to help take control of their weight, it’s transformational for many teenagers.’  The earlier children started taking the medication the better their outcome would be, he added, ideally tackling obesity before it could fully progress.  But he admitted those given the ‘lifechanging’ drug would likely need to stay on it for life, or risk the weight piling back on.  He added: ‘Obesity is a chronic disease. So chronic diseases require chronic treatments. You have to stay on that medication probably for the rest of your life.  ‘If you take that treatment away, it's like a rubber band, the weight goes right back to where it started.’  Going under the brand name of Wegovy, the weight loss drug has recently been given the go-ahead for use in adults on the NHS.  Regulators have yet to decide whether to grant its use - alongside a programme of diet and exercise - for obese teenagers.  A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said: ‘Following clinical trials and a formal review by the MHRA, our medicines are granted a licence which will outline the approved indication and recommended dosage for UK adolescent patients.’  Commenting on the study findings, Professor Alex Miras, Professor of Endocrinology, Ulster University, said he was keen to see the drug approved by NICE but suggested delays in its availability could slow proceedings.  ‘Children in this trial have lost a very significant amount of weight. What is interesting is that so many achieved normal BMI which is a remarkable achievement,’ he said.  ‘We were expecting the medication to become available for adults in May but this has been postponed yet again. We don’t even know whether it will become available this year.  ‘I think that NICE is unlikely to move forward, unless it has got more certainty that the medication will be available.’"

Or Louisiana. Or Alabama.  Lately, the way people talk about those states has started to change. Instead of looking down on the Gulf South, they’re seeing it as a model.  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  “In this region, we have decided to go big,” said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  Second grader Demi Hill, 8, listens during class at Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network, in New Orleans, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) (AP)  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country’s highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  “We know how to teach reading,” she said. “We just have to do it everywhere.”  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten, informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read, but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading. It’s well worth the time, according to Assistant Principal Erika Brown, who said that in college she didn’t learn a thing about teaching kids to read.  “I was winging it,” she said of her early years in teaching.  During a recent session with four second-grade girls, Brown had the girls spell “crib,” asking, “What are the sounds you hear?”  Like a choir, they chanted back four individual sounds, counting them with their fingers: “c-rrr-i-buh.” This was one of the techniques Brown had learned in the training; counting four sounds, or phonemes, gave students a clue that the word had four letters. Increased screening also helped the school identify these girls as needing extra help.  “Are y’all ready for a challenge word?” Brown asked, and the girls shouted, “Yeah!” Their faces fell when Brown revealed the word: bedbug. They had no idea what the word even meant. But with Brown’s gentle guidance, the girls broke down the word into six phonemes. They were even ready for another challenge.  “Can we spell cock-a-roach?” one of the girls asked.  A second-grader in the school, Joshua Lastie, said he likes how his teacher helps him if he trips over a hard word, like “happened” or “suddenly.”  “The school is trying to make the words way easier for kids,” said Joshua, 7.  One challenge that comes with the emphasis on small-group intervention is the strain on scheduling and staffing. Literacy coaches from the state are helping the charter network strategize on how to reach all students. One resource the state can’t provide, says Lisa Giarratano, the chief academic officer at ReNEW, is time.

Louisiana state Rep. Richard Nelson, a Republican who has championed literacy reform, said pointing to laws passed in other Deep South states made it easier for him to introduce legislation and “sell across party lines.”  “Every time I present a bill, I say, ‘Look, Mississippi has very similar challenges to what we have in Louisiana, and they’ve been able to make this work,’” Nelson said.  There is still far to go for children in the Gulf South, especially considering the disruptions to schooling from the pandemic and several major hurricanes and tornadoes. Mississippi, after stellar gains in the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress, saw reading scores drop in 2022, although they are still at the national average. Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group, could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular. In 2019, Alabama ranked 49th in NAEP reading scores for low-income fourth-graders; in 2022, it ranked 27th. Amid the pandemic that saw most states lose ground, Louisiana soared from 42nd to 11th. Mississippi ranks second-highest in the country, after Florida.  Alabama’s state superintendent of education, Eric Mackey, says he has confidence in the reforms — in part because they’ve worked before. Alabama invested heavily in training on the science of reading, then known as phonics, in the early 2000s, and scores rose. Then the Great Recession hit, teachers and literacy coaches got laid off, and the state lost its gains.  Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  “We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,” Mackey said. “This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.”  ___  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

The children, aged 13, 9, 4, and 11 months, were found in thick jungle in Caqueta province, local media reported. The plane, a Cessna 206, was carrying seven people on a route between Araracuara and San Jose del Guaviare, and went missing on May 1. Colombia's military said the two pilots of the plane and the children's mother were found dead on May 16. Footage and images released by the Colombian Military Forces shows the downed aircraft, soldiers searching for the children with canines, as well as traces left behind by the children, such as a bottle and fruit peels. The military said its canine units were able to track an improvised shelter made by the children along with other elements that gave them clues to the trail of the missing minors. The children were found in good health and were taken to a hospital in San Jose del Guaviare. They are expected to be reunited with their families soon. The discovery of the children is a miracle, and it is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

To clear his head that sometimes fills with suicidal whispers, he finds the silence of a cemetery near his family’s New Albany home. And the former Christian seminarian drops to his knees and cries out to God.  At age 25, an often vigorous time in life when some may feel invincible, the Columbus native is making peace with trials and hardship and hurdles. Major depression and suicidal ideation is a natural spinoff of more severe traumatic brain injuries.  “So much of the Christian life is paradoxical,” Fathauer said during a recent visit to Columbus. “The centerpiece of the Christian faith is a cross and, historically speaking, a cross was a form of capital punishment. It was an ugly, horrendous image.  “And now we put it on our buildings, we put it on our tattoos, we wear necklaces. So how did that happen?”  “Only God could turn such a horrible symbol into something so marvelous that we see today. And it’s a juxtaposition between pain, suffering, trial, difficulty, testing, and then resurrection, life, hope, and eternity. It’s this combination.”  Therein lies a short summary of Fathauer’s life nearly eight years after a skateboarding accident nearly killed him in front of the home of parents Brett and Lora Fathauer on Marilyn Drive in Columbus. He sustained a serious head injury when he was struck by a vehicle Sept. 18, 2015, and was taken by Lifeline helicopter to Indianapolis for specialized care.  The medical diagnosis: a severe diffuse axonal brain injury, degree three, down to his brain stem.  Indianapolis IU Health Methodist Hospital doctors, well acquainted with serious head trauma from serious accidents at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, initially and repeatedly told Fathauer’s family that the then-17-year-old’s progress toward everyday living and functioning probably would require an 18-month timeline.  “They (once) said I’d have the mental capacity of a 9-year-old,” he recalled.  Yet he came home walking and talking five weeks after the accident.  Shortly after that, he spoke and taught at a Christian seminar he earlier had organized at YES Cinemas downtown as part of his school senior project. He still meets people with technical knowledge of such injuries who cannot fathom his life today not only as a polished professional in a highly technical field, but a husband and father of four, including nearly 3-year-old triplets with wife Chelsea.  A few weeks ago, he met a registered nurse who heard just a part of his story.  “I’m so glad your (brain ) injury wasn’t that bad,” she said, unaware of quite the opposite.  He looks back at the trauma and drama of 2015 with a view that God somehow found a way to use for good even the darkest, most horrific moments of his life.  “I’m not much of a cook or a chef,” he said. “But I understand how you know the basic process and procedures for making a good dish. And you take these individual ingredients, the spices and the meat and the flavoring, whatever it is, and you put them in a pot of some sort, you turn on the heat, and then out comes a delicious meal.  “And I’ve thought about that since the accident. That’s when I think the Lord started cooking in my life — when I was hit by that car. And that’s when he turned up the heat.”  Wife Chelsea has been alongside him for the whole process. At age 19, she accepted his marriage proposal a month before the accident. She has witnessed extreme highs and frightening lows.  “She has said to me ‘I feel like I am married to a roller coaster,’” Fathauer said. “I’m not afraid for you to write that down. Absolutely, I think she is.”  His boss, Matthew Schad, at Schad Law in New Albany, is well aware of everything in Fathauer’s struggle and success. Schad met Fathauer when he became his attorney through the aftermath of the 2015 accident. Schad’s friendship influenced Fathauer’s decision to pursue law.  The former Columbus resident saw how he could use the empathy, determination and faith learned from his tragedy to help others.  “I tell people that I became a personal injury attorney because of what happened to me,” Fathauer said. “And I became an estate planning attorney because of what could happen to you.”  The accident also has marked wife Chelsea’s new career plans. She is currently studying medicine at Indiana University to become a doctor.  “It definitely was inspired largely by his injury and all the wonderful care that he received,” Chelsea said.  She added that the extra care taken by surgeons, nurses, physical therapists to form real, longer-term relationships with them touched her deeply. She wants to do the same for families in whatever medical field she eventually chooses.  She, like her husband, remains astonished at his recovery, and brushes aside some of her spouse’s praise for her care and persistence during a restoration that stretched at least a couple years or more. It included relearning some proper social cues and behaviors that his brain had lost.  “His recovery obviously doesn’t make too much scientific sense,” said his wife. “I’d say it’s definitely a miracle. “But I think that a lot of it also was his personal strength and desires. When your loved one is injured, I think the natural human desire is to want to protect them and prevent their failure and their feeling self-conscious. But Cameron was never really like that.  “He always really wanted to know every area that he could improve. And I tried to foster his independence and let him dream and set goals.”  She recalled his biggest battle: cognitive function. She recalled his biggest dream: law school.  And she recalled her biggest immediate reaction: “OK. This is going to be really hard.”  Her husband who until then had dreamed of pastoring felt an abrupt change.  “It was like an Etch-a-Sketch where God shook the screen and erased everything else,” Fathauer said.  He acknowledged that law school was more than tough, especially amid the stress of starting a family. Yet, more than once in a conversation, he mentioned that a raw and real Christian life sometimes is one marked partly by suffering and setbacks, even after there have been apparent life-saving miracles.  “The response to affliction, the response to difficulty in trial, at least in regard to especially suicide and depression,” he said, “is just to hold on.”  And therein lies another paradox and a substantial spiritual twist. The man whom some see as a literal, walking miracle finds light in his darkest times and feels renewed life — at a cemetery.  Presentations  The New Albany attorney and former Christian seminarian mixes his passions these days at churches and elsewhere with free presentations he calls “Receiving and Returning: A Practical Theology of Estate Planning.” The presentations cover everything from the theology of private property to wills and trusts. Plus, he intersperses elements of his personal story into the mix.  Information: 812-590-1727 or [email protected]"

Although the shops are almost done being renovated, the owners wanted to continue to pay homage to the Desert Passage roots. (Rachel Aston/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @rookie__rae  The Miracle Mile Shops on the Strip is set to complete its first set of renovations in 16 years in the next few weeks.  The renovations for the mall located at the Planet Hollywood resort were meant to brighten and modernize its interior, which houses 170 tenants, according to Robert Buchanan, the vice president and general manager of the Miracle Mile Shops.  The last time the mall — which first opened in 2000 under the name Desert Passage — was renovated was in 2007 when it changed its name to Miracle Mile.  “It was just time, and of course for us really wanting to stay vibrant and a viable option for people to come shopping on the Strip,” Buchanan said.  The Miracle Mile renovations include adding modern light fixtures, interactive displays and more seating areas in the mall’s walkway, installing new ceilings in certain areas, installing projection technology for light shows inside the mall and placing over 21,000 square-feet LED screens throughout the interior and exterior of the property.  Over 20,000 square-feet of LED screens were installed on the mall’s exterior and about 1,600 square-feet of LED screens were added to the interior. The focus on adding LED screens is meant to help Miracle Mile stand out amid the many shopping and entertainment options on the Strip, according to Buchanan.  “There is a lot of visual stimulation (on the Strip) and you really need to, you really need to take advantage of that opportunity,” Buchanan said. “We’re competing with everything else out there.”  The renovations are slated to finish in June, according to Buchanan, although installation of some exterior LED screens could continue until November.  Other updated features of Miracle Mile include two indoor light shows. One will be a continuation of the Rain Show that happened in the past at Miracle Mile. New features of the Rain Show will include two walls of water that can have light displays shown on them, according to Buchanan.  The other show, called “Elements” and reflecting elements like ice, fire and earth, will be shown outside the V Theater.  Putting more shows inside Miracle Mile is meant to provide more entertainment and experiences in the mall, according to Buchanan.  “People are looking for those experiences,” he said. “The Vegas experience, even if it’s a store that customers might find in their market, for example that we put in, it’s the Vegas version of that store.”  Buchanan said there have been plans to renovate Miracle Mile since 2017. Officials were set to start the renovations in 2020 but those plans were delayed by the pandemic. He said the renovations started up again in January 2022 and have focused on individual sections over the last year and a half so the mall could stay open during the renovations.  Despite a lot of updates to the mall, some old favorites of Miracle Mile will stay, including the painted ceilings above some of the walkways and portions of the Moroccan facades that were original to the Desert Passage mall. Additionally, the mall is keeping the facade of the Desert Passage ship.  “The way I characterize it is that we’re renovating, we’re updating but we’re not losing that Desert Passage character,” Buchanan said.

Photo / Stephem Jaquiery  Dr Divya Adhia attaches cables to a cap covered with electrodes, which unexpectedly helped to restore Dunedin author Dr Lynley Hood’s vision recently. Photo / Stephem Jaquiery  Scientists are calling it “an accidental miracle” after research aimed at alleviating chronic pain was found to restore the sight of a Dunedin woman who has had an acute form of glaucoma for more than a decade.  Now University of Otago researchers are trying to replicate the result, in a bid to create new treatments for people with vision loss.  Prominent author Dr Lynley Hood (80) fractured her pelvis in a fall in 2020, and has had severe lower back pain ever since.  So she decided to participate in a University of Otago chronic pain treatment research project involving the placement of a cap on her head, wired with electrodes that use electrical currents to stimulate the brain.  Project co-leader Dr Divya Adhia said the Dunedin School of Medicine research began in May 2021 and looked at the effects of brain stimulation on chronic pain.  Dr Hood attended brain stimulation sessions five days a week for a month, she said.  There were two study groups — the main group, who received the electrical stimulation into the brain, and the placebo group, who had the electrical current pass across their scalps.  Dr Hood was part of the placebo group, and over the four-week period her eyesight steadily improved to nearly 100 per cent, Dr Adhia said.  “Surprisingly, her vision improved so much that her ophthalmologist said it was a miracle.  “Miracle is not a word we use very often in science, but it was — an accidental miracle.  “It wasn’t the intended outcome, but to see that my research has actually made an impact with people is really miraculous.”  Dr Hood said she had been living with severely reduced vision for the past 12 years.  She had no central vision in her left eye, her right eye was like “TV static” and it was difficult for her to adapt to changing light conditions.  It had effectively stopped her from reading and writing and she had to give up her work as an award-winning author.  She was told her eyesight was never going to get any better, so she took it in her stride and decided to help others with low vision by becoming a founding member of the Visual Impairment Charitable Trust Aotearoa (Victa).  To have her vision slowly return following the procedures was life-changing, she said.  “At first, I thought I was imagining it.  “They’ve got such flash equipment that they could trace every millisecond of the current — it went across my scalp and into my eyes.  “The equipment showed that the cells in my retina went, ‘hey guys, something’s happening’, and it sent a whole lot of messages down my optic nerve to the parts of my brain that makes pictures and words and colours out of electrical messages.  “It’s really important that other people benefit from this.”  Dr Adhia said the research team were now designing another study to run alongside the chronic pain study, which would investigate how it had happened and how it could be used to improve low vision for other people.  Dr Hood was also excited.  She said the “side effect” had given her a new lease on life and she now had plans to return to writing and had several new books in the pipeline."

Something fishy  It sounds like something out of a myth: once or twice a year, amid a dramatic thunderstorm, fish plummet from the sky onto the streets of Yoro, a town in Honduras. (The jury’s still out on the science, but the leading theory is that the creatures are sucked into the sky from the nearby Atlantic Ocean by giant water spouts.)  Where some might see a miracle, the ad agency Ogilvy saw an economic opportunity for the town, where most residents live on under $1 a day. In partnership with sustainable fish company Regal Springs, Ogilvy worked with the town to create a plan to compensate locals for catching the falling fish.  This year, on April 23, when the fish began to fall, locals ran out to catch it, filling bags and even wagons. The “Heaven Fish,” as Regal Springs called the product, were then cleaned, processed, packaged and sent to restaurants and grocery stores. Locals made about $6 a pound on their catch, transforming a strange phenomenon into a most unusual livelihood.  Read more at Fast Company  Penning perseverance  When the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021, decades of progress on women’s education and rights suddenly dissolved. Women in Kabul found themselves confined, no longer allowed to work outside the home.  But some, like Husneya Saidi, age 21, have found creative ways to pursue their dreams. Stuck at home, Saidi found refuge in an online storytelling course created by human rights advocate Homeira Qaderi. The course gave her a way to express her experience: “[The Taliban] may have closed the doors of the university to me, but I will fight them with the might of my words,” Saidi said. “My pen will serve as my unyielding weapon.”  View this post on Instagram A post shared by KIMIA (@kimia_arts_)  Yes! reports that many Afghan women have turned to writing or art to portray the difficulties they’re going through — and imagine a better future. “The Taliban may impose restrictions on our public lives,” said Kimia, a 23-year-old artist who managed to complete her final semester at Kabul University under Taliban rule, “but they can never extinguish our unwavering determination to learn and relentlessly pursue our dreams.”  Read more at Yes! Magazine  Not just horsing around  In rural parts of Mexico, many people depend on horses, mules and donkeys for transportation and work in the fields. But historically, veterinary care in such areas has been lacking. Through the Rural Veterinary Experience Teaching and Service (RVETS) program, veterinary students and volunteers have been bringing free care to underserved rural areas since 2010.  Not only are these rural clinics a boon for local livestock owners, but they also provide hands-on experience for the students — vaccination, dental work, castration and more. As 24-year-old student Dereck Alejandro Morín told the New York Times, “What they teach you in school is one-third of what life in the countryside is really like.”  RVETS’ work isn’t easy: funding can be hard to come by, and sometimes security risks restrict travel. But as Dr. Víctor Urbiola, director of RVETS Mexico, put it, “if we can help even one donkey that carries 80 kilos of water for an old woman, all the effort we make is totally worth it.”  Read more at the New York Times"

Most interested buyers are parking lot companies wanting to demolish it.  Lifelong Coloradan and pastor CB Barthlow used to hang out on Downtown Denver’s streets when he was a heavy drug user. One building that always caught his eye was the Carson Press, a distinct, abandoned structure at 2019 South St., with red brick framing, massive windows and a concrete entrance with an impressive arch — a relic of 1930s Denver.  Now boarded up, the Carson Press is a stone’s throw away from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless headquarters, the Stout Street Clinic and some massive new luxury condos, at the nexus of Denver’s growth and despair.  A few years back, Barthlow decided to open up Beacon Church. His mission: Serve unhoused residents and drug users, people like he used to be. He wanted a spot near downtown, at the epicenter of Denver’s drug and homelessness crises, close to many fellow service providers’ offices.  The Carson Press was his dream spot for his new endeavor. But getting it proved tough.  According to city records, the building has traded hands six times since 2017. Barthlow kept striking out as he attempted to buy. Beacon Church couldn’t afford the asking price.  Eventually, the church came into a windfall, and Barthlow struck a deal with then-owner Benjamin Weinstein, for a little over $1.5 million. Barthlow knew, at the time, the building would need work.  “It’s a shell,” he said. “It doesn’t have infrastructure.”  Just bringing it up to code to be allowed inside was going to cost the church roughly a million dollars. A full build-out was more than Barthlow could imagine paying, and as a new entity, taking out a loan was impossible for the church.  So while the building has remained vacant, Beacon has been holding services at the Bluebird Theatre, on a stage Barthlow used to play as a soul singer and musician.  Homeless encampments often set up in front of the old press. Barthlow will ask the people sleeping outside if they need anything and encourage them to keep an eye on the building.  From time to time, people break through the boarded-up door and inside to use drugs or get out of the cold.  Once, upon returning from vacation, Barthlow realized 30 people were squatting inside. They had brought in couches, beds and desks. The place was filled with trash, including used syringes.  At first, Barthlow said, he “freaked out.” Then, he mustered the courage to go inside and tell the people they had to leave, that he was operating a business there, and that he’d be calling the police. He called the non-emergency line and waited outside for six hours for the cops to show up and escort people out the back.  “I had to hire a hazmat company to clean out what was in there,” he said.  When the Beacon Church first priced the buildout, pandemic-era supply chain issues had driven costs of construction up. The church decided to wait for construction prices to drop.  But costs have only gotten higher since Beacon first bought in 2021.  “The buildout costs when we got the building were three million,” Barthlow said. “Now they’re closer to four-and-a-half.”  While the church has been around a few years now, taking out a $4.5 million loan is out of the question, so Beacon has put the Carson Press back on the market.  Scott McClean, of Development Advisors, is the listing agent on the building. It’s being sold for $1.8 million and advertised as a shell property.  So far, there has been some interest, but most has been from parking lot companies with underwhelming offers looking to demolish the building and turn the land into a surface lot.  “I’m just praying and waiting for our God to do something amazing,” Barthlow said. “We need a miracle of $4 million dollars, so I can turn that into a church and outreach center.”  If that doesn’t pan out, he hopes the proceeds from selling the building can pay for a long-term lease in a nearby spot.  Pulling off a new project is going to be tough to afford. Barthlow said that’s why so many churches, like his, are formed in the suburbs, and away from the centers of greatest need.  “There are so many parts that are changing the way Denver is right now,” Barthlow said. And the class disparity between people living on the streets in tents and suffering from addiction and the newcomers to the neighborhood who can afford $1 million condos across the street troubles him.  As he sees it, the rise in property values and rents Denver has experienced in recent years makes it tough to help the people with the greatest needs.  “I love my city, and I’m here to serve my city, regardless of what clothing or what apparel she wears,” Barthlow said. “But I know the way things have changed recently have made it prohibitive for entities such as ourselves to do good.”"

Carlo Ancelotti's side were hammered 4-0 by Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, with Pep Guardiola's side earning revenge for last season's defeat by Los Blancos at the same stage.  This time the second leg was not at the Santiago Bernabeu, where Madrid produced a string of astonishing moments to overcome Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and City on the way to winning last season's competition.  Madrid, who have won five of the last nine Champions Leagues, have grown used to pulling off spectacular and sometimes inexplicable comebacks in Europe.  Even when Madrid have been outplayed, they have clung on by their fingertips and found a way through. Many across the continent thought it was about time for that to change.  However, the way the match began seemed to set things up for another Madrid survival masterclass.  Guardiola's City dominated, just as they did last week at the Bernabeu in the 1-1 first leg draw, before Vinicius Junior sucker-punched the English side on the counter.  At the Etihad, Erling Haaland was foiled twice by Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the second of which was a brilliant, bewildering save.  - Different story -  However, unlike in the first leg, Bernardo Silva broke free of Eduardo Camavinga's shackles and was decisive.  The Portuguese midfielder struck twice, leaving Madrid with an uphill struggle -- although they have come back from those before.  Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos hit the crossbar with a rocket from distance.  ""On this occasion things didn't go our way like they did last year,"" lamented Courtois, referring to the German's piledriver.  Last season Rodrygo Goes struck two late goals in less than two minutes to force the second leg to extra-time, and Madrid improved after the break, with a comeback still not off the table.  However, City eventually stepped up another gear to whisk the game away from Madrid, scraping around for another moment of inspiration but finding the cupboard bare.  Eder Militao deflected Manuel Akanji's header into his own net for City's third and Julian Alvaraz rolled the fourth past Courtois to wrap up their emphatic victory.  ""Evaluating what happened in this moment what happened makes no sense to me,"" Ancelotti told Movistar.  ""It's a defeat that hurts but sometimes it can happen in football, in the Champions League semi-final against a strong opponent that played better than you.""  The Italian coach said he was planning on seeing out the last year of his contract, which expires in June 2024.  Madrid's board and president Florentino Perez have backed Ancelotti staying over the past couple of weeks, at least in public, but his future will inevitably be debated during the weeks ahead.  When Madrid's magical concoction of individual skill, never-say-die spirit and luck runs out, questions get asked.  Perez may wonder if Madrid need something more tangible than miracles next season.  rbs/cw"

Her beloved daughter survived one challenge after another. Now they're enjoying every moment with this miracle baby. Madelyn Mire was born weighing only one pound, four ounces. The frightening journey began when her mother, Jennilee, was 20 weeks pregnant.  ""Everything was going really well until then! I almost skipped that appointment, so there are a whole lot of miracles surrounding that, but I found out my cervix was 100% effaced,"" explains Jennilee. That's considered a medical emergency and could have forced Jennilee into labor at any moment, so doctors performed a procedure to try to delay it.  At that point, Jennilee was told she had to get to 24-week pregnancy, or her baby wouldn't survive. They had already been through so much. ""Our previous daughter was born at 26 weeks, she actually passed away. And so, we this was our rainbow baby and here we are, going through this again,"" explains Jennilee.  LUNCH FOR THE SOUL: Father of 7 discusses recovery from traumatic brain injury  They transferred to a hospital in the Texas Medical Center with a Level 4 Neo-natal Intensive Care Unit, equipped and staffed to help dangerously ill or premature newborns. Tiny Madelyn was born at 23 weeks and two days and the courageous feats to save her life began. She and her mom had the same infection.  ""She had contracted E. coli, which was her most immediate danger at the time. It crossed the blood-brain barrier, because when they're that small, they don't really have one, and it became meningitis. She also had a brain bleed and cysts on her brain. She had respiratory distress syndrome, which most of the preemies do, but she was on a ventilator for that. She had a heart PDA, which is an issue that they have when born preterm. And then of course they're always worried about their eyes and are hearing when they're that small,"" states Jennilee.  Jennilee went into action beyond medicine to save her newborn. ""I went in ready for battle, spiritual battle and I just started praying and casting death off of her, pleading the blood of Jesus over her. I had actually been introduced to a ministry called The Supernatural Life and had some spiritual deliverance in my life, and it really opened my eyes to the fact that we're in a spiritual battle. In Mark 16: 17-18, it says that the signs shall follow those who believe and at the end of that, it says they shall lay hands on the stick, and they will be healed and I knew that I had seen healings right in front of my eyes,"" says Jennilee.

The doctor stopped me and said, 'we don't know what happened, but it's not there and there's no sign of the necrotizing whatever it's called, the brain is not dying, and we don't see the meningitis.' I almost collapsed, and the doctor caught me and told me to keep praying,"" she added.  From that day on, Jennilee says little Madelyn began to thrive. ""The brain bleeds stopped, and it started drying up, the cysts started shriveling up, and her heart PDA closed in time,"" says Jennilee.

We went through this before, and when it was happening again, it was hard not to think the worst up front with Jennilee going into labor again,"" said Madelyn’s dad and Jennilee’s husband, Jacob. ""All I could do was just get into reaction mode. Just basically be there for support and continue to pray.

It's a miracle that happened to her that she recovered that she's a 23 weaker and there's nothing wrong with her. She's perfect. She doesn't have any delays. No health effects, no cerebral palsy. Just nothing and her eyes are perfect. She's unreal,"" says a smiling Jennilee.  The Mire's believe a natural approach helped in Madelyn's healing as well, they didn't allow vaccinations when she was only two pounds, and her dad was her blood donor. They also want families to realize we have two centers in Houston known for saving micro-preemies, like Madelyn.

CHINESE PROPAGANDA PROGRAM IN US SCHOOLS QUIETLY CHANGES HEADQUARTERS NAME TO AVOID SCRUTINY  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  ""In this region, we have decided to go big,"" said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country's highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  ""We know how to teach reading,"" she said. ""We just have to do it everywhere.""  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten, informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read, but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading.

Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group, could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular.

Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  “We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,” Mackey said. “This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.”"

The policy, Title 42 , allowed immigration officials to immediately expel immigrants who did not meet asylum standards. Its conclusion has led to a predictable surge in illegal border crossings.  With or without Title 42, it is inevitable that more people will come to this country. In 2022, the United States had about 2.76 million people cross the southern border — a new record even though Title 42 was being enforced.  HOW TO STOP THE LEFT'S DANGEROUS, DESPICABLE WAR ON WORK  The real question for policymakers is: What should replace Title 42? What policy changes and innovations can get the border under control and stop illegal immigration?  House Republicans passed a proposal last week to bolster border security. But until the U.S. begins expanding legal pathways in addition to its border security efforts, it will remain frustrated with the modern world’s migration challenges.  The Republican package hits many of the usual notes — a restart for border wall construction and increased penalties for violations of immigration law. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), the House Majority leader, called the bill “the strongest border security package that Congress has ever taken up.”  Yet the legislation is noteworthy for what it’s missing: legal pathways into the country. Despite what many critics of the legislation will argue, border security investments and policies are important and valuable. They complement legal pathways. There’s no silver bullet or miracle cure for illegal immigration. Instead, we need a suite of policies that both expand legal immigration and build up the border.  By leaving out expanded legal pathways, the Republican proposal leaves out a critical ingredient. We need to see legal options as key pieces of border control rather than as antithetical to border security.  The agricultural guest worker visa program , the H-2A visa, illustrates this well. When agricultural visas were expanded from 1995 to 2015, illegal border entries fell because workers were able to come legally. The relationship between illegal and legal entries is basically a one-for-one exchange.  As a scientific matter, much of immigration’s flows are determined by trends outside of the U.S. Take Guatemala , for example. It has the opposite economic problem of the U.S. It has more people than it has jobs, so the mismatch draws people to the U.S., where jobs are more readily available.  We should also see legal immigration as an opportunity to strengthen America. The U.S. has a huge labor shortage. States across the country have more job openings than unemployed people.  In fact, this labor shortage dwarfs the immigration surge. Even if every single one of the 2022 crossers were admitted and allowed to work today, the U.S. would still be millions of workers short.  These needs are already known in Washington. On April 18, a bipartisan group of more than 50 legislators sent a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services pointing out how farmers and businesses that use current guest worker programs need help affording the visa application process .  In recognition of this reality, the Chamber of Commerce announced its own immigration proposal package on May 1. It includes many of the border security improvements that Republicans passed but marries it with expanded legal immigration routes. That’s the right recipe for border security.  CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA  An effective immigration policy will require both a high wall and a wide gate. Immigration reforms that enable businesses to find the workforce they need will keep our economy on its strong path.  Congress must take action and build new bridges, not just walls. We’ll find success only if we embrace both smart border security investments along with new legal pathways."

That Canelo ring walk was spectacular, which was acclaimed by millions of viewers around the world. Televisión Azteca produced the signal that reached all corners of the world through more than a hundred platforms. Rodolfo Vargas has become a very important asset for world boxing, with great management and leadership skills.  The municipalities of Zapopan and Guadalajara worked in unison to ensure that the previous events during the week generated great expectations and a sense of belonging among all Jalisco. Governor Enrique Alfaro demonstrated his great sense of humanity and gave himself, body and soul, to achieve the collaboration and coordination of all so that El Rey returned home.  I was impressed by the modernity of Guadalajara, with spectacular restaurants and delicious food, entertainment centers, friendliness, and hospitality. I keep singing mariachi songs in my mind and flashes of what that week was like, and that I will never forget. I am sure that we will not have to wait 30 more years for the next great boxing show in our country.  I had the great good fortune to celebrate Mother’s Day with my precious and adoring mom. It is a blessing to have her so healthy and in perfect condition with us.  Our family was formed based on unity, love, and respect, and it was my mother who was always and continues to be aware of everything. She is the undisputed boss.  My brother Hector gave us a beautiful letter dedicated to Dona Martha.  “Mothers are the earth, the seed, the rain that gives life, they are the miracle that creates miracles giving life, they are love without barriers, they are guides, teachers, warrior defenders, sweetness and they are the reason why life flourishes and grows with the purest and most unconditional love. Relentless guardians and are our shelter from storms. They are our Sun and our shade, as well as our Moon and our Light in the dark.”  On Saturday in South Africa, Kevin Lerena beat Ryad Merhy, from Belgium, in a good fight, thus winning the right to dispute the Bridgerweight world championship against the current champ, Lukas Rozanski from Poland.  This division continues to produce great results, as all the fights are of great interest, being in themselves small heavyweights who compete with each other with skill and power without giving advantages to the mastodons of boxing’s mother division.  This coming Saturday is so special: the best of the best from Men and Women will meet in the rings of Las Vegas and Ireland. Vegas will host one of the most anticipated fights of the year. The undisputed WBC, WBO, IBF and WBA world champion, the undefeated Devin Haney will face who was The King, pound for pound, just three years ago, Vasiliy Lomachenko. That same day undisputed super lightweight champion Shantell Cameron will defend against undisputed lightweight champion Katie Taylor. What an unbelievable weekend of boxing.  I traveled to Mérida to inaugurate a gym at the Arrayanes Institute, a very well-established place under the leadership of José Chapur and the great champion Guty Espadas.  I was able to greet many dear friends of sports and society in that town, especially Mr. Jorge Carlos Ramírez Marín, Mr. José Manzur, and the two Guty Espadas.  This gym is first class, equipped with a ring, speed balls, punch bags, all from the Cleto Reyes brand, and everything necessary to comply with the WBC certification.  Now it remains to promote Yucatecan boxing and to find the champions of the future soon.  DID YOU KNOW…?  Devin Haney started his career in fights that took place in bars and nightclubs in Tijuana.  Devin is the reversed American dream. His father, Bill, trusted our country to take care of them, and thus be able to start his career at a young age. Not being able to fight in the United States because he was a minor, he found a helping hand to develop in Mexico. Many fights took place in Tijuana, many lessons, times of shaping to be a great contender winning WBC affiliated championships. Devin won The WBC World Youth championship, the NABF, The Continental Americas and the Silver championship before winning the interim title, the WBC world title, and now is the undisputed king of the division.  TODAY’S ANECDOTE  My mom accompanied my dad on a trip to the Orient, something unusual, and in one of the stops, they attended a world title fight in South Korea.  The attention to my mom was as if she were a queen. Already in the arena, she was seated next to the Minister of Sports of that country. Everything was going well until in the third round, Guty Espadas Sr. knocked down the local idol with a crushing right hand, and my mother stood up to shout euphorically, in favor of the Mexican, while the stadium was completely silent before the fall from Korean.  Don José turned around and firmly said: “Madam: shut up and sit down please!”  Eventually, Guty did not manage to be crowned, the local hero from Korea won. Regardless of that fact, the Minister no longer spoke to my mother a single word.  Little by little, in our family we learned that in boxing there are no nationalities, colors or races. All fighters are the same and they are loved in an extraordinary way, regardless of whether they are champion or challenger, and that’s how you feel: a legitimate and sincere pity and respect for the loser, at the same time there is joy, jubilation, and pride for the winner.

Suddenly, 2-year-old Willow, a Border Collie-Goldendoodle mix, jumped into the raging waters of a box culvert next to the freeway.  “She just jumped up and over the cement barrier,” Jessop said, adding that Willow has never tried to jump into the water before.  Willow was immediately swept through the tunnel that traveled under Interstate 15.  “We just wanted our dog—we didn’t know we loved her so much” This is Willow.

The family raced downriver, hoping to get ahead of Willow. But after about 40 minutes of searching alongside animal control, police, firefighters and other city employees, Jessop said they were beginning to lose hope.  “We just wanted our dog. We didn’t know we loved her so much,” an emotional Jessop said.  Suddenly, a call came over the police radio saying that Willow may have been found.  “I didn’t know if that meant dead or alive,” Jessop said.  Willow was alive and uninjured, but scared as she hid in the bushes along the creek. She had managed to get out of the runoff-swollen creek on her own.  “She was just up on the bank. She was dirty. She was wet. She was cold. She was shaking,” Jessop said. “I don’t know how she would have climbed out with that current so strong.”  After the joyous reunion, the family is watching Willow very closely and keeping her on a leash near water. Jessop also expressed his gratitude for employees of Lehi City who helped in the search.  “We just had a reunion that we didn’t think that we would have,” he said. “It was an unexpected happy ending. It was an answer to prayer and a miracle that we all experienced yesterday morning.”  Jessop is also warning other families with pets and children about the dangers of Dry Creek."

Holmes, who was granted an immediate stay of her April 27 prison-reporting date by virtue of a hail Mary appeal filed by her lawyers, was celebrating her second Mother's Day on Sunday at the beach in San Diego. The UK Daily Mail scored some paparazzi shots of Holmes carrying her newborn daughter Invicta and partner Billy Evans carrying two-year-old son William and some balloons down to the beach near their reported $9 million home (a rental).  As we learned recently via an odd and fairly softball profile of Holmes in the New York Times, she and Evans relocated from Woodside, where they'd been living until sometime last year — maybe until Holmes's November sentencing — to San Diego, which is where Evans's family lives. This is perhaps practical from a childcare standpoint, given that Evans is about to become a single dad, save for some miracle or untold legal strategy that grants Holmes more continued freedom.  As NBC Bay Area reports, Holmes's attorneys just filed a new motion in the state appeal of her fraud conviction, which gives the state 21 days to respond. Once the state responds, the lawyers have another 21 days to respond to that. So, this maneuver seems designed to give her another month or so with her newborn child before beginning what's to be an 11-year sentence.  Though will she really end up serving all of that? Half of that?  The privilege that has pervaded this entire case and trial has been pretty obvious, apart from the actual sentence by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila. Holmes's attorneys had tried to argue for no jail time at all, while she faced a maximum of 20 years for each of the four fraud counts on which she was convicted.  Judge Davila rejected Holmes's appeal of her conviction on April 10.  Holmes's co-defendant and co-conspirator at infamous blood-testing startup Theranos, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, was tried separately and sentenced in December to 13 years. Balwani also appealed his conviction to the Ninth Circuit, that appeal was denied, and he began serving his time not far from San Diego last month.

That's because Gath vows he wouldn't have the best pacer he's trained, Miracle Mile winner Catch A Wave, unless Yambukian came along.  Yambukian is Catch A Wave's older half-brother and impressed Gath and his wife, Kate, from day one.  ""I'll always have him to thank because he's the reason we have Catch A Wave,"" Gath said. ""Yambukian was showing us plenty and that's why we bought the next one out of the mare (Coppagoodone) as a yearling.""  While Yambukian has built a more than creditable record with just 29 starts netting 11 wins, six placings and $145,530, Catch A Wave is one of Australasian harness racing's hottest properties.  Catch A Wave's 22 starts have netted $1,123,120 in earnings from 17 wins and a second.  He hasn't raced since completing the huge Chariots Of Fire and Miracle Mile double with his Mile win at Menangle on March 4.  But he's back at Team Gath's Long Forest property and turning plenty of heads.  ""He spelled really well. He had about a month out and has come back noticeably bigger. It's everything you hope for,"" Andy Gath said.  ""He arrived back here on April 15 and should be back racing by late July.""  Catch A Wave is one of Australia's best pacers. Picture: Stuart McCormick  Catch A Wave's next major target is the world's richest harness race, the inaugural $2.1m TAB Eureka, at Menangle on September 2. He is the $3 pre-post favourite.  ""I'd say he'll do his lead-up racing in Victoria, probably two runs before the Eureka,"" Gath said.  ""But, we'll finalise all that closer to it.""  So while his baby brother starts to get fit again, Yambukian has taken the opportunity to shine.  The big, strong five-year-old returned from his own spell with a good Melton win last Saturday night.  Life gets harder from the back row (gate nine) when he backs-up in the Western Ford Pace (2240m) at Melton this Saturday.  ""He was entitled to win the other night because he had a nice run in front,"" Gath said.  ""He's run most of his best races up on the speed, so the back row makes it harder this week.  ""But he seems to have come back well and is still pretty lightly raced for his age.  ""He's worked his way into a strong grade now, so he's going to have to keep improving to keep the wins coming.""  Another highlight of Saturday night's Melton meeting will be brilliant trotting mare Queen Elida's quest for a fifth successive win in the I Didn't Do It Free-For-All (2240m).  She returns from a Sydney trip where she brilliantly won the Group 1 Macarthur Mile at Menangle two week's ago.  Queen Elida will still need some luck from inside the back row (gate eight) against fit and proven open-class performers Ultimate Stride (four) and One Over All (five).  One Over All is a stablemate of superstar Just Believe, who was flown out of Melbourne on Tuesday night, headed to Sweden for the huge Elitloppet Trot at Solvalla in Stockholm on May 28.  * Adam Hamilton is a paid contributor writing on harness racing for News Corp"

Every part of my body was reduced to ruin, from loss of hair and loss of weight to the mind-numbing fog of chemo brain. Things you wouldn’t think would be affected were affected, like my urinary system, my joints, my mouth, and even my vision — all proof of what the oncologists said every time they saw me: “We’re killing you to save you.”  By the fifth and sixth cycles, I looked like a skeleton. I sometimes frightened myself when I looked in the mirror.  As a poet, I wrote about my experiences. The poems are now available in my book, “Running from the Reaper: Poems from an Impatient Cancer Survivor.” One of the poems is about the horror I saw reflected in the mirror:  CHEMO CYCLE BLUES  I was brushing my teeth this morning  when I looked up after spitting.  There in the mirror was a bald man  holding a toothbrush, his eyes  full of bewilderment and incredulity,  his face pallid and gaunt,  his eyes deeply sunken, lips chapped,  his beard and hair gone.  I leaned closer to the glass to better glimpse  the stranger holding my toothbrush.  I was so skeletal that at Halloween that I could have been an emaciated zombie. I wouldn’t have needed any make-up or anything to play the part. At times, I worried that I’d never return to the old me. I worried that even if I survived, I’d be this ruin of a man, weak and pathetic, shuffling around like the undead for the rest of my life. There were times when I was so distraught that I thought about giving up, just calling it quits.  But I was surprised at the resilience of the human body. My body began to repair itself almost immediately once the chemo cycles ended and the chemicals were out of my system. As I sit here writing this today, it’s only been three months since my last cycle and my last infusion. And yet, almost like magic or a miracle, my body has mostly recovered. I’ve gained back three-fourths of the weight I lost. I think I’ll be back to my pre-cancer weight by summer. My hair, including my facial hair returned as good as ever (see photo).  The brain fog I suffered is gone, as if a warm wind blew away the obscuring clouds that confounded my thinking. I’m keeping a Recovery Journal in which I chart my growth with graphs (how much I weigh, circumference of my biceps, how much I can bench press or leg press, etc.) My strength is returning. I’ve been playing racquetball for almost the entire time since the chemo cycles ended.  Yesterday, I played four games without breaking a sweat or being short-winded. I win most of the time. I’m getting stronger every day. Even my libido has returned (thank goodness).  Friends who haven’t seen me in a while remark how much better I look. “Your face is fuller, and your skin color looks healthier,” they tell me. One friend, who recently saw me walking down the hall at the university, said he could tell that I was stronger by my determined and self-assured gait. “That’s the old John I’ve always known,” he said as we passed.  If I have any advice to impart to others going through cancer it is this: Who you are at the lowest point, when your body is most wrecked, is not who you will remain. Don’t despair. Have hope. When the cancer treatment ends, your body will begin to rebuild itself. It will heal. It may not happen as quickly as it did for me, but it will happen. One day, you will be able to look at yourself in the mirror and see only the post-cancer you.  For me, even though it’s only been three months since my treatment ended and I was pronounced “cured,” there have been days when I almost forget that I ever had cancer at all.

In most cases, we have artificial sweeteners to thank for this.  On paper, sweeteners are a miracle ingredient, helping us to reduce our calorie intake and protect our tooth enamel, all the while avoiding sugar-induced energy crashes and the dips in mood that follow. But a wave of fresh evidence suggesting these calorie-free additives might contain underlying health risks is sparking a backlash – and not for the first time.  This week, the World Health Organisation said long-term use of artificial sweeteners (NSS) could raise the risk of various health problems including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and does not help people manage their weight over a prolonged period.  Another study of 4,000 people published earlier this month, in the Nature journal, linked erythritol, a popular sugar substitute, to increased risk of blood clots. In 2022, the findings of a nine-year study of 103,000 French adults gave a similar conclusion: researchers linked aspartame to an increased risk of stroke, concluding that sweeteners “should not be considered a healthy and safe alternative to sugar”. So should we be reaching for the sugar cubes instead?  It seems even the experts have mixed views. Responding to the French study, Helena Gibson-Moore, nutrition scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation, acknowledged there can be “conflicting messages around the safety and health effects of artificial (or low calorie) sweeteners, which can cause confusion among consumers. This is often because messages are based on evidence from individual studies, rather than the totality of the evidence”.  It’s worth remembering that studies even of this scale are limited, she added, and there may be many other factors that lead a study participant to suffer from adverse symptoms. Others have pointed out that you’d have to consume an extreme amount of sweetener every day to put yourself at risk (or be very unlucky). One message it seems nutritionists can agree on is the well-established recommendation of “everything in moderation”.  Understanding sweeteners  Sweeteners were used during the sugar shortages of the First and Second World War, later becoming more popular as a result of 1960s diet culture, when they were marketed for weight loss. But their history dates even further, to 1879, when a US scientist experimenting with coal tar derivatives accidentally tasted on his hands some of the chemicals he had been working with, leading to the development of saccharine.  There are now several different types of low- or-zero-calorie sweeteners approved for use in the UK, but the ones most commonly used in food and drink include aspartame, saccharin, sorbitol, sucralose and stevia. In toothpaste, chewing gum and mouthwash, it’s most likely to be xylitol.  For a long time, scientists believed that most sweeteners were more or less the same, and had no nutritive impact on the body. But recent studies have shown this may not strictly be the case. “If your brain detects something sweet, it doesn’t matter if it’s natural sugars, artificial sweeteners or something else: it sends a signal for our bodies to react in some way,” says Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian who teaches nutrition to medical students at Aston University. “Whether or not that reaction is significant is a different matter,” he explains.  In addition, different sweeteners cause different signals: “Aspartame, which is broken down in the body, has a different effect to others like saccharine,” Mellor adds as an example, “and this can have other effects on the bacteria in our gut microbiome.”  The biggest change in thinking in recent times, he explains, is a shift in thinking by nutritionists. “Rather than seeing sweeteners as a wholesale replacement for sugar, we should be using them as part of a step-by-step approach in working to reduce our sugar intake overall”.  In other words, replacing that daily can of sugary Cola with two cans of the “diet” or “zero” alternative gets a big thumbs-down from the experts. Drinking the odd can of “diet” Cola as a way of weaning ourselves off the habit is a far better, if less appealing, option.  Further to this, sweeteners could be guilty of luring many of us into a false sense of security when it comes to healthy living. Guidance published by the WHO last year on the use of sweeteners in the context of reducing type 2 diabetes concluded that there was no evidence that replacing sugar with sweeteners contributes to weight loss.  The paper was controversial, Mellor notes, but the fact remains: when it comes to having a balanced, nutritious diet, indulging in sugar-free chocolates won’t cut it. “It’s what we eat around those sweeteners that matters,” he says. “There is no doubt sweeteners can be useful,” he adds, and for diabetics who can’t have sugar at all they provide a safer treat. “But consumers should be aware of the pros and cons.”  Are ‘natural’ alternatives any better?  Fruit and flower-based syrups are increasingly popular for use in baking, hot drinks and other forms of dessert. Agave nectar, for example, has a milder flavour than honey, and molasses and maple syrup are both popular vegan alternatives to honey. The sugar in these may not be refined, but it is still high.  “With any of these options, it’s important to remember that your body is still processing sugar and sweetness,” says Dr Mellor. A squeeze of honey to sweeten something like tea is “OK”, he suggests, “but agave in particular is very fructose-rich, which in large amounts is difficult for your bowel to absorb and can have a laxative effect. It also converts into fat quicker than other sugars.”  It’s important to think about the quantities involved, therefore – you shouldn’t need as much agave as regular honey in your tea or porridge. An even better option is to experiment with herbs and spices: according to Mellor, it’s often a different flavour, and not sweetness, that the body is really craving.  Ground ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg are all strong “sweeter” flavours that can trick the body into satisfying that sweet tooth. Similarly, Mellor recommends adding black pepper to fruit like strawberries: “It stimulates the taste buds in the same way as sugar.”  He concludes: “Sweeteners, fruit, sugar – it’s all fine in moderation. It’s important to enjoy food, and think about new flavours. We don’t always need to reach for that sugary hit.”"

The miracle material has become a disastrous material – at least, in the way we use it.  There is hope in the global deal to end plastic pollution under negotiation, which is due to land by 2024. The report UNEP is launching today, Turning off the Tap, is coming out just ahead of the next round of talks, and is intended to inform negotiators. What does this report tell us?  First, that there are stark negative economic costs of plastic pollution, running in the hundreds of USD billions annually, destroying infrastructure, impacting energy production and tourism revenue, clogging our drains and flooding our cities, and potentially impacting human health through exposure to hazardous chemicals.  Second, the report tells us that the starting point for change is to eliminate unnecessary and problematic plastics. Three shifts are then required: accelerating the market for reusable products, accelerating the recycling market, and reorienting and diversifying the market for sustainable and safe plastic alternatives.  Third, we need to take a full life-cycle approach to plastics – by which I mean rethinking every stage from the design of products and systems, plastic production, use, recovery and disposal. Redesign of packaging, systems and products is crucial. Chemical engineers and manufacturers have to get creative, both on products and packaging instead of defaulting to plastic when designing products. Finally, we also need to ensure the safe disposal of whatever is not yet designed to be circular and deal with a significant legacy of existing plastic pollution.  This is difficult, we know. I speak to you from Kenya, which is one of more than 30 countries in Africa to have banned single-use plastic bags. This is brave, but we know that going circular is complicated and challenging. We know that poverty and access remain critical barriers to overcome. We need innovation from manufacturers, importers, exporters and governments to make this possible.  If the global community can deliver, plastic pollution could fall by 80 per cent by 2040. This would dramatically reduce social, environmental and human health costs, cut greenhouse gas emissions and create up to 700,000 jobs – mainly in the Global South.  We at UNEP are asking everyone to get involved in the just transition to a new plastics economy, which will improve livelihoods for millions of workers in informal settings.  Governments can deliver a strong deal to end plastic pollution. Businesses can show innovation and commitment to move away from virgin plastics – starting immediately. The financial sector can put its capital behind the transformation. International Financial Institutions and other large investors need to move significant investments towards solid waste management and collection systems, which must include recyclings and organics. Creative chemical engineers must take a hard look at product design and weed out harmful chemicals and plastics. And citizens can use their voices, votes and wallets.  Plastic can continue to bring huge benefits to humanity, but only if we completely rethink the system to keep it circulating in the economy, and out of the natural world. The science is clear: we must turn off the tap on plastic pollution."

Worry not, the hit series Mrs. Davis (now streaming on Peacock) has anticipated this desire, and it has placed the prolific Jake McDormand in the role of Wiley. He’s front and center, helping to lead the rebellion, and his scenes with Betty Gilpin (Mrs. Davis) are always loaded.  If McDormand looks familiar to you, it may be because he has plenty of acting credits to his name. His work isn’t confined to science fiction and genre, but he does appear in such projects often. In continuing celebration of the madness that is Mrs. Davis, we’re running down our favorite roles performed by the talented Mr. McDormand.  Limitless (Brian Finch)  One of McDormand’s biggest showcases was in this 2015-2016 CBS series. It was a spin-off from the Bradley Cooper movie of the same name. A mysterious drug gives Brian (McDormand) the chance to unlock the full potential of his mind, and Cooper’s character from the movie is on hand to guide him. Running for 22 episodes, the series also featured Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as well as Ron Rifkin and Colin Salmon in recurring roles.  RELATED: Margo Martindale’s Greatest Sci-fi/Genre Roles Outside of Mrs. Davis  Response to the series was mixed, but the response to McDormand was not. He was a natural stand-in for Cooper, we liked him, and we were very interested in where his journey could have gone. He was able to make Brian’s shifting back and forth between different areas of the show believable. He would have taken the series to some incredible places, but CBS canned the whole thing after one season. They didn’t see limitless money there.  What We Do in the Shadows (Jeff Suckler)  He only appears in three episodes in Season 1 (and one episode in Season 2), but McDormand makes an impression. That’s not an easy thing to do in this series because every single person on the screen (and behind the screen) is a genius.  Technically, he played the role of “Jeff.” In reality, he was the reincarnation of Gregor, a former lover of Nadja (Natasia Demetriou). Her influence leads Jeff to a mental breakdown, but eventually he discovers his true self. McDormand is hilarious, but also touching, which is the key to the entire series. He demonstrates it perfectly.  With a passion for farewell topiaries and getting beheaded, Jeff/Gregor was a fun addition. There could always be a way for him to return to the series.  Watchmen (Nelson Gardner)  McDormand was only in one episode of this landmark miniseries. Why do we mention it? For one thing, every episode of this 2019 miracle show is special. For another, the episode that he appeared in was “This Extraordinary Being.” It’s the installment where Angela (Regina King) gets the true history of Hooded Justice.  Nelson Gardner, aka Captain Metropolis, was an integral part of the Hooded Justice story. They were lovers, but Nelson also refuses to help at a critical point. He is all about hiding true identity and being careful about when to become involved, and McDormand plays it all perfectly. It is a heartbreaking addition to the already heartbreaking history of Hooded Justice.  RELATED: “Yes, Tyler Durden Inspired Wiley’s Look in Mrs. Davis”  Live Free or Die Hard (Jim)  Dad’s not dead. McDormand has the honor of kicking off this 2007 Die Hard sequel by groping Lucy McClane (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in a car. Bad move, Jim. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is on the scene right quick, and he’s taken on both Hans Gruber and Ellis. Pathetic frat-rapist Jim is toast.  There’s not much to it, but Jim is another character in the Die Hard series who cannot possibly die soon enough. He’s not at the Ellis level (no one is), but it’s a tradition in this series. He helps to illustrate the John/Lucy dynamic, which will be important for the rest of the movie. McDormand plays “snot-nosed MRA trash bag” quite well.  Related  Aquamarine (Raymond)  In 2006, McDormand showed off his magical romcom skills. Emma Roberts finds a mermaid in a beach club pool (happens to her all the time) and McDormand falls in love. The romance between Aquamarine (the mermaid, played by Sara Paxton) and Raymond is not the point of the movie, but it’s nice.  Raymond could have been just another brainless, pretty-boy lifeguard who was rejected from both Baywatch and Temptation Island. That’s the role, but McDormand gave it some personality. We’d normally despise a character like this, but we liked him as played by McDormand. That’s huge. Huge! He helped Aquamarine be where the people are.  Bring It on: All or Nothing (Brad Warner)  We felt it necessary to remind everyone that he was in this. It’s not science fiction or genre. It was straight-to-video. McDormand lives and laughs alongside Hayden Panettiere. If Mrs. Davis fans are brutally honest with themselves, then this could be what they are remembering McDormand from.  Admit it, and this will all be over.  Jake McDormand brings it on every week on Mrs. Davis, which streams new episodes on Peacock every Thursday."

Brown appeared in 13-of-14 contests. The Miami, Florida native recorded 32 tackles, 6.0 tackles for loss and 4.0 sacks. Prior to playing at Troy, Brown attended Itawamba Community College.  Brown is a 6-foot-3, 295 pound interior defensive linemen. Brown put forth outstanding testing numbers throughout Troy’s Pro Day. Brown ran the 40 in a lightning-quick 4.92 seconds with an elite 2.72 20-yard split.  Brown also leaped a 32.5-inch vertical. Sheer strength was on display via Brown’s 30 reps on the bench press (225 pounds). Brown earned a 9.46 Relative Athletic Score for his efforts.  Shakel Brown is a DT prospect in the 2023 draft class. He scored a 9.46 #RAS out of a possible 10.00.

Teair Tart is a major success story, and others such as Naquan Jones and Sam Okuayinonu have hung around and contributed. Brown’s development will be spearheaded by Titans defensive line coach Terrell Williams.  Tart has yet to sign his tender, which could lead to more reps for Brown throughout the summer. Brown will also be in direct competition with the aforementioned Jones, Jayden Peevy and Tyler Shelvin. Brown’s $105,000 in guaranteed money indicates he possesses a legitimate opportunity to compete for a 53-man roster spot."

Now, she wants to share her story.  Example video title will go here for this video  GARFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio — It's been just over a year since an 8-year-old Garfield Heights girl was shot in the eye. Her case remains unsolved to this day.  On March 16, 2022, as kids are falling asleep after a barbecue at a home on Grand Division Avenue in Garfield Heights, a shot goes off outside.  Inside, 8 year old Nyairra Green is hit.  “We was all laying in my Mom’s friend’s bed and then I got up and it just hit me. Then I laid down and I holded my right eye,” Nyairra said. ""I thought I was going to die.""  As Nyairra is rushed to the hospital, her mother Shernisha Cheney is aware that no matter what happens, her daughter's life has been permanently altered.  “The scar, the bullet, the prosthetic eye is definitely a constant reminder,"" Cheney said. ""Just hearing her say those things about how she didn’t want to die that night, that’s what she told me on the way to the hospital. She said, 'Mommy, I don’t want to die,' and I said 'You’re not going to die.' That plays over and over and over again in my head. Every single day.""  We first met Nyairra on April 19th 2022, one month after she was shot.  She was wearing a Be Kind Shirt, her eye covered in a patch, showing off her new Barbies.  She, along with her Mom were asking for anyone with information in her case to come forward. It’s a case that remains unsolved to this day, despite a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.  Now at the age of nine, Nyairra wants to share her story with Mom by her side, because she survived and she knows there are others who don’t.  “I want to know why y’all have guns if you don’t need it to protect somebody. If you don’t need it to protect you,” Nyairra said.  Nyairra also wants people to know the night she was shot and lost her right eye is not the only thing that defines her.  She’s also a singer, active in her church. She's a sister and an aspiring nail and makeup artist.  “You can be shot in a place where you’re not supposed to be here, and God saved you. So just to see her grow and just to see God’s miracle is amazing to me,” Cheney said.  But the scars of gun violence aren’t just visible on the outside, and Mom notices the differences daily.  “She’s still very confident, but she has attachment, she has anxiety, she has attachment issues. She’s never wanted to be around me so much, like we sleep together every night and to see how scared she is, it just makes me feel helpless because how am I supposed to help her? I feel like I do everything I’m supposed to do and she still feels this way,” Cheney said.  And just because her eye is now different, others treat her differently.  “My daughter is getting bullied, like these are the things that come with it. I had a little girl tell my daughter ‘shut up or I’ll shoot you again.’ These are the things we have to deal with,” Cheney said.  Cheney says it’s her daughter’s strength that carries their family through, but catching Nyairra’s shooter is what would really bring some peace of mind.  “It would mean the world to me because anyone that careless should not be out on the street,” Cheney said.  And for Nyairra, a sense of safety."

The historic Mediterranean-style building on West Seventh Street housed the former school for decades, but was leveled in the wake of a 2020 fire that ripped through the boarded-up and abandoned structure.  With nothing but a heaping pile of contaminated debris remaining, Casa Ramona Executive Director Esther Estrada, a former longtime San Bernardino councilmember who attended Ramona School in the 1940s, sought and received federal funding for a costly cleanup.  Crews began removing the remnants late last month and expect to finish by the end of June, Estrada said in a phone interview Tuesday, May 16.  “It’s going very, very well,” she added.  From what Estrada has seen these past two weeks, crews are packaging the rubble into large boxes to be hauled away.  Workers are there five days a week.  San Bernardino-based Brickley Environmental, the company tasked with the cleanup, has placed gauges around the property that alert workers to any hazardous materials in the air, Estrada added. In the event of an alert, crews implement mitigation measures.  Furthermore, Estrada continued, company representatives have engaged with those living near the property and answered any and all questions.  While clearing the Casa Ramona site after three years is reason to celebrate, Estrada worries about what will become of the property as long-range plans to develop affordable senior housing there unfold.  Chiefly, Estrada fears the soon-to-be vacant lot will attract illegal dumping and homeless encampments.  Vandals and thieves already made off with the chain link fence that was placed around the site after the building was razed, Estrada said.  “It’s been very, very disappointing and disheartening,” she added. “We deserve to have a better way of life in San Bernardino.”  Councilmember Theodore Sanchez, whose 1st Ward includes Casa Ramona, is in the same boat, and recently pitched his council colleagues on earmarking $100,000 for the installation of a wrought-iron fence around the property.  “The place will be vacant for a while until Casa Ramona pulls another miracle and secures a couple million dollars to get senior housing built there,” Sanchez said by phone this week. “In the meantime, if it’s a vacant lot on the westside that’s not secured, it will turn into a dump site.”  Casa Ramona presently operates out of Nunez Park."

Norway’s Alessandra could nab her first U.K. top 40 appearance with “Queen of Kings,” new at No. 18 on the chart blast. Alessandra and “Queen of Kings” placed fifth in the grand final.  Also, Eurovision runner-up Käärijä of Finland could make a top 40 debut with “Cha Cha Cha,” new at No. 21 on the chart update.  At the top of the chart blast is “Miracle,” Calvin Harris’ hit collaboration with Ellie Goulding which is targeting a sixth non-consecutive week at the summit.

For the five siblings, three of whom are on wheel chairs and all five of whom suffer from physical disability, muscular dystrophy and convulsions, the misery was multiplied, as their wheelchairs, medicine, special beds and bathroom were buried under the rubble.  The family now lives with relatives close to their old shelter. Every morning relatives carry them out as people continued to flock to the site, some showing sympathy at their harrowing experience, and others carrying gifts for the girls.  “The house blew up while we were being moved out. Our wheelchairs, medicine and clothes were inside. Nothing was left,” said 16-year-old Hanin, who has a disability in both legs.  The others are aged 3, 18, 29 and 38. The emotional toll of losing the house seemed to have worsened the older brother’s mental state, as he has become very nervous, always shouting and sometimes crying, his relatives said.  According to officials from Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip, the latest round of Israeli air strikes, which began on May 9, have destroyed 15 residential blocks, containing more than 50 apartments. In addition, 940 buildings have been damaged, 49 beyond repair.  The Israeli military says it takes every effort to limit civilian casualties and damage and accuses the militant group of hiding command centres and other military sites in residential areas.  On May 13, Hanin’s older brother Jalal received a call from a private number, but he went out to let his cousin respond as he stutters while talking. The caller was an Israeli officer who ordered them to evacuate the house five minutes before they bombed it.  The cousin, Hussam Nabhan, 45, tried to stall with the officer, telling him the house included disabled people, but it was all in vain, he said.  “He told me you to have five minutes. We rushed to the house and found the girls lying on the ground. Thanks to the neighbours we have been able to take them out and we managed to leave the house by a miracle,” he told Reuters.  The mother, Najah, 57, said they failed to take anything from the house even the identity cards.  “The house was the girls’ shelter, they had got a disabled toilet, wheelchairs, a bed to sleep. Things that had been difficult to get, now there is nothing,” Najah said.  “How am I going to carry her after the wheeler was gone, also the (healthy) mattresses were gone,” she added.  The Gaza Strip is home to 2.3 million Palestinians in cities, towns, and refugee camps squeezed within an area of 365 square km (141 square miles). Its borders are sealed off by neighbouring Israel and Egypt, citing security concerns with Hamas, which runs the territory.  Several wars and a 16-year-old Israeli-led blockade have crippled the enclave’s already ailing economy.  (Reporting by Nidal Almughrabi, Editing by William Maclean)"

Ben Affleck stars in ""Hypnotic."" Ketchup Entertainment  “Hypnotic,” the new psychological thriller starring Ben Affleck, failed to mesmerize audiences at the box office this weekend.  The Robert Rodriguez-directed film earned only $2.4 million at the box office in its opening weekend, the lowest total for a movie released on at least 1,000 screens in Affleck’s decades-long career.  In the film, Affleck plays Danny Rourke, a detective whose search for his missing daughter leads to him teaming up with a psychic (Alice Braga) and chasing a bank robber who appears to have mind-altering powers (David Fichtner).  Even without adjusting for inflation, “Hypnotic” fell short of Affleck’s other noted career bombs, including 2003’s “Gigli” ($3.8 million opening weekend) and 1998’s “Phantoms” ($3.1 million).  Advertisement:  The failure of “Hypnotic” wasn’t a surprise, given that the film faced one crisis after another during its production. A combination of COVID delays, an insurance lawsuit, a seemingly shuttered studio, and a lack of marketing made the chances of the film achieving mainstream success vanishingly small. In fact, it’s a minor miracle that the film was completed and released at all.  Rodriguez originally intended to shoot the film in spring 2020 in Los Angeles, and had already completed a costly pre-production before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In fall 2020, the film’s producers unsuccessfully sued their insurance company, with a judge dismissing the case in July 2021. In total, production was set to start before being shut down three separate times. When filming finally kicked off in fall 2021, production shifted to Rodriguez’s own personal studio space in Austin.  By the time “Hypnotic” began filming, Solstice Studios, the upstart company overseeing the project, had laid off all but 10 people, including its CEO. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the skeleton crew’s sole focus was completing Solstice’s duties to market and distribute “Hypnotic” both domestically and internationally.  Even with the cost-cutting, creative editing, and a slimmed-down runtime of 92 minutes, the film’s budget has been estimated between $65-80 million by various sources.  Advertisement:  In an interview with Chron, Rodriguez described Affleck and co-star Alice Braga laughing as they filmed what was supposed to be a high-speed motorcycle chase scene at 7 miles per hour inside Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios.  “COVID shut us down, and we kept losing money, and having to shoot it faster and faster,” Rodriguez told Screen Rant in a separate interview. “Even my crew was like, ‘Are you sure we can get away with just pipes and a sign? Is that going to work?'”  In February 2023, Deadline released an article stating that “Hypnotic”‘s international buyers were looking to back out of their deals, which required that the movie be released in at least 2,000 theaters in the U.S. Shortly before the article’s release, producers announced that they had found a new distributor with Solstice out of the picture: Ketchup Entertainment.  The little-known company had never handled a film of the size and budget of “Hypnotic” before. Its most well-known film domestically was 2013’s “Linsanity,” which grossed approximately $333,000 in the U.S. and Canada, according to Box Office Mojo.  Director Robert Rodriguez on stage during the Q&A for “Hypnotic” at SXSW in Austin.  In March 2023, an audience at the South by Southwest festival in Austin saw an incomplete “work in progress” version of the film, only two months before it was scheduled for nationwide release. And leading up to its May 12 release, there was a conspicuous lack of marketing for “Hypnotic,” with Affleck doing no interviews for the film.  Advertisement:  In the end, it may have been Rodriguez’s commitment to releasing “Hypnotic,” a film he’d been tinkering with since 2002, that got the movie over the finish line.  Despite a lackluster response from both critics (a 35 percent freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (a C+ grade on CinemaScore), the “Spy Kids” director is proud of what he accomplished. In an interview with Collider, Rodriguez compared the production to working on his first film, 1992’s “El Mariachi,” which had a micro-budget of $7,000.  “It made the movie better to have so much taken away from us,” Rodriguez said. “I had to rely on my own ‘Mariachi’ tricks, and it was really fun. I think people will sense the fun that we had making it.”"

Laura Bray testified on Capitol Hill about these issues. Four years ago, her daughter, Abby was diagnosed with Leukemia.  “We were told we were lucky that this Leukemia, unlike many other pediatric cancers, has a cure,” she told lawmakers.  So, Abby started a drug regimen.  “When a child doesn’t want to take her meds anymore, when they can’t take the pain of being poked and prodded again, when they lose their hair, when it’s just too much, we all focus on the importance of the medicine for their survival,” Bray said.  Then, the family got more bad news.  “I was sitting in a hospital room with Abby when I first heard the words ‘we don’t have the drug needed today; it’s on shortage,’” Bray recalled. “My Abby, our fierce middle child, caught it right away and said ‘I thought I needed this. Does this mean I die?’”  Abby’s miracle cure was hit by shortages of three different drugs over nine months. So Bray started a nonprofit with the mission of ending this issue. It’s called Angels for Change.  The family isn’t alone -- The FDA lists more than 120 drugs currently in shortages. Another tally from pharmacists has more than 230 drug shortages. Drugs like common antibiotics, asthma drugs and heart meds have been in short supply.  The conversation on Capitol Hill turned to transparency and collaboration.  “Greater transparency will help us better understand where we need to shore up the domestic production and invest in new technologies,” Rep. Kathy Castor (D) Florida said.  “We must encourage American innovation, increase domestic manufacturing capabilities and promote the adoption of quality generic drugs,” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) Washington said.  Bray told lawmakers it will take a multi-layered approach to solve a problem with such high stakes.  “Together we can ensure no child will ask their parent, ‘will I die if I don’t get my medicine,’” she added.

(WBRC) - Chief Nick Bowles says they want graduates and their families to celebrate the momentous occasion, but he wants to see it happen safely and responsibly.  Last year, Anniston Police responded to calls from hundreds of people at a party, and several began shooting at one another. Six people were shot, and Chief Bowles says it was a miracle that none of the injuries were life-threatening and no one lost their life.  He says this year, party goers must be vigilant.  “If they see weapons call the police department, we’ll handle it,” said Bowles. “That’s what we’re here to do. We would rather come and run some people off or check some people if they are there with weapons than come and put children in body bags.”  It’s a graphic warning, but Chief Bowles says parents and children need to hear it.  “It starts with this group of ABC people who are invited, and that’s all that’s supposed to be there,” says Chief Bowles. “But this XYZ group decides to show up and may not get along with ABC, and then violence erupts. That may just start with fist fights or words or whatever. But more and more these young folks have been turning to violence with weapons with firearms, and the result is devastating.”  One way to prevent your child’s party from this type of violence is to have security. Chief Bowles says you can hire an officer with their department  “There are legal ways at city meeting centers or places like that it will also bring police officers in for a cost,” says Chief Bowles. “Some of that stuff will really bring down any violence. You know you’re not going to show up to a party with a police officer there that are not going to let them start any trouble.”  He wants to remind adults who plan to chaperone these parties that if they see weapons or any violence, they should contact the police.  “The alternative is not calling the police and having gun violence erupt at your party and then that adult possibly being a part of the people who get charged because they let this happen,” says Chief Bowles. “Parents can talk to their kids as well. If they’re going to send them to these parties, hey, you need to be aware if somebody shows up and starts some stuff starts, fights, leave. It’s your time to go.”  Get news alerts in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store or subscribe to our email newsletter here.  Copyright 2023 WBRC. All rights reserved."

After knocking out the upstart Seattle Kraken in seven games with a 2-1 win Monday night, Dallas booked a date in the third round with the Vegas Golden Knights.  It wasn’t pretty, but really, aside from three bad periods in game one, three and six, the Stars proved they were the better team in a lengthy series, and handled Seattle’s strong back-checking pressure and solid goaltending to win.  The two matched up in 2020 on the Stars’ miracle run to the Stanley Cup Final, where Dallas dominated and took it 4-1. Both teams have changed significantly since then- even current Stars coach Peter Deboer was on the bench for the Golden Knights. Here’s a look at some factors that might influence the series.  Home Cookin’  Dallas has been great at home this season overall, but especially in the playoffs. The Stars went 22-10-9 at the American Airlines Center in the regular season, and now are 5-2 in the postseason. Aside from game one against, goalie Jake Oettinger has been his best at home as well, highlighted by a shutout of Minnesota in game five of round one.  Vegas earned the 1-seed in the regular season, so 3-seed Dallas does lose home ice advantage it’s had the entire postseason thus far. Can they earn at last a split at T-Mobile Arena to try to flip the script?  What’s going on with Robertson, Oettinger?  Dallas’ clearest flaws have come from the inconsistent play of team leaders Jason Robertson and Oettinger. After scoring 46 goals in the regular season, Minnesota and Seattle have keyed in on Robertson and held him to just two goals through 13 postseason games. He did show signs of breaking out of it with a three-assist effort in game six vs. the Kraken, but still hasn’t quite been the same player he was in the regular season. Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski have more than picked up the slack, though- combining for 17 goals in the first two rounds.  Oettinger is a different story. It’s been more of a Jekyll-and-Hyde effect through the first two rounds. He was 18.6 seconds away from a second shutout in Monday’s game had it not been for a tally with 18.6 seconds left. On the other hand, he gave up at least three goals in a whopping three times that series. The Stars need him to steal at least two games in Vegas to have a chance- which he is certainly capable of doing (look no further than his 64-save performance in game seven vs. Calgary last year).  Scouting Vegas  After missing the playoffs for the first time in their young franchise history last season, the Golden Knights rallied with a Pacific division title this season. Former Boston Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy has done the opposite of what his former team did this postseason and helped them back to the conference final, led by a new core.  It’s a completely different core led by much less starpower than years past. Former Buffalo Sabre Jack Eichel leads the way with 14 points, while former depth piece Chandler Stephenson has emerged as a top-six player. Big parts of its early core like William Karlsson, Jonathan Marchessault and Alex Pietrangelo are still around.  In net, the young tandem of Adin Hill and former Winnipeg Jet Laurent Brossoit lead the way. Of the teams still remaining in the playoffs, Vegas has split its goalie starts the most, but Brossoit has been the hotter hand of late and will likely start game one.  DSF Prediction: Dallas’ run comes to an end in six games. Vegas has re-tooled and is a deeper, less arrogant team than three years ago. It’s hard to imagine Oettinger being able to steal two or three games on the road, which he’ll need to do- especially if Robertson still isn’t scoring. I don’t think Pavelski and Hintz can carry the Stars past a more solid all-around Golden Knights team by themselves. But hey, it’s been a great run – and I’ve certainly been wrong before."

Cardinale has been heavily criticised for the lack of investment since he took over the club and it remains to be seen what will happen in the summer, with major changes needed."

Going undrafted, the Miami Heat gave the young guard an opportunity by calling him up from their g-league team in the 2019-2020 season, the same season Jimmy Butler arrived in South Florida. At 26 years old, he has gone from someone who was on 10-day contracts to someone who is now the Heat’s starting PG in the midst of a deep playoff run.  He has had the best year of his career this season. Putting up averages of 9.4 ppg, 2.5 apg, and 0.9 stls on 40% shooting, 87% from the free throw line and 34% from deep.  Vincent is one of those “culture” type of guys where his impact goes beyond the box score numbers. He has been valuable and available all season long. He was playing off the bench (but in the regular rotation) for about half this season. But when Kyle Lowry went down with a knee injury that kept him out an extended amount of time, Vincent earned the starting spot and ran with it.  He has been able to hold it down and run the offense for Miami, and although he doesn’t have those eye popping numbers, he has been very consistent overall on both ends of the floor.  Specifically during this playoff run, Vincent has had huge moments. Including hitting a big time 3 pointer to cut the lead to 1 in the closing seconds of game 5 vs the Milwaukee Bucks.  The Heat went on to tie the game, send it to OT and complete the gentleman sweep of the best team overall in the NBA on the road.  Vincent has had some strong offensive outings including a 20+ point performance in game 1’s road victory against the New York Knicks as well.  The combo guard is set to hit free agency this coming offseason. According to Shams, there could be a significantly strong market around the league for Vincent’s services.  Being that he is unrestricted, Miami won’t be able to match any offer for Vincent. His ability to be a reliable starting PG who can also play well off the bench could be very enticing to opposing teams.  Hopefully, the winning culture, loyalty and already strong built relationships within the Heat team/staff is enough for him to stick around.  Vincent is a very key role player to have on a championship team and is a great “Heat Culture” kind of guy.  If this 8th seed Heat team pulls off the miracle and secures an NBA championship it will be very hard to see Vincent walking away from that. Even if they don’t, Miami is a pretty attractive destination that could make it a long, difficult decision to leave especially for a role player.  All in all though, money talks. We’ve seen it with PJ Tucker just a year ago. The goal would be to find a happy medium in contract negotiations money wise, but there could always be that one team who is willing to break the bank. Especially on a young, versatile player with lots of upside."

Madeline Kaklikos, 24, and her husband, Jon, 27, welcomed their miracle twin boys, Cole and Nate, in February following ten rounds of fertility treatment over three years.  Medics described Madeline's case as one-in-50 million, due to the fact they were both conceived using different methods and were each developed in a different uterus.  Madeline, from Melbourne, Australia, discovered that she has a rare congenital condition called uterine didelphys - where a woman is born with two uteruses - when she and her husband began trying for a baby in 2020 without any success.  After thinking they were never going to fall pregnant, Madeline and John were shocked but totally over the moon to learn that were actually expecting two miracle babies.  Madeline said: 'After ten rounds of fertility treatment and years of trying to conceive, it never crossed our minds that we would fall pregnant naturally while undergoing IVF.  'I'd already been diagnosed with PCOS in 2017, when I was 18, and knew it would be difficult to conceive.  'However, during an ultrasound to investigate further, it was discovered that I actually have two uteruses and I was diagnosed with uterine didelphys (UD).'  Jon and Madeline were told it may be difficult to conceive naturally (Picture: Caters News Agency)  Doctors suggested the couple try IVF, and two embryos were implanted into Madeline's 'more accessible uterus' but unfortunately didn't take.  'We kept trying, but by the time I had my eighth round, I was terrified we'd never have a baby,' commented the mum.  'It was a dark time, and I really struggled to find hope.'  A few months later, the next egg collection was able to make 11 embryos, and in June last year the pair got the call that they were finally pregnant.  'I was with Jon, my parents and brother, at the time of the call, and we all erupted into screams and had tears streaming down our faces as we hugged,' said Madeline.  Each foetus developed in a separate uterus (Picture: Caters News Agency)  It was at the 10-week scan that Madeline learned she was expecting twins, with a second spontaneous baby in her second uterus.  'Jon and I looked at each other in total disbelief,' she recalled.  'The doctors explained to us that the chances of having one baby in one uterus and a second in the other were one-in-50-million.  'We also realised that they had been conceived at different times and in different ways. One twin was conceived through IVF, and the other was naturally conceived.'  As the pregnancy was classed as high risk, Madeline was under constant monitoring and was offered a planned C-section as her condition made a natural delivery impossible.  The twins are now three months old and are happy and healthy (Picture: Caters News Agency)  Madeline gave birth to her twins on February 20, at 34 weeks, and says that she was petrified, but her husband kept her calm.  'When I was able to hold my babies for the first time, I felt like my heart was going to explode,' she said.  'We only had 10 minutes before they were taken to special care, but it was everything I'd dreamed of.'  Although Madeline found it hard to be separated from the newborns, she spent as much time with them as possible and found comfort in the fact they were looked after by 'amazing nurses' if she wasn't there.  After 17 days in hospital, Cole and Nate were discharged and able to go home with their parents.  'Having newborn twins was hectic, but they're three months old now and are doing well,' said Madeline.  'We're loving life as parents to our miracle twins.'  Do you have a story to share?

(KALB) - On Tuesday, May 16, a naturalization ceremony in Central Louisiana made citizenship official for several, and it was one of the most diverse naturalization ceremonies to take place in the Western District of Louisiana.  Moments after receiving her naturalization certificate, Milly J. Robinson said this is something she has dreamed about for a long time, growing up in Kingston, Jamaica.  “You have to believe in yourself and trust God because he is a way maker, he is a miracle worker, he’s a problem solver,” said Robinson. “So, a moment like this, it’s all God, bro.”  Robinson was one of 20 immigrants who became citizens at a naturalization ceremony held in Alexandria. They hailed from 18 countries, scattered across six continents. Judge Joseph Perez-Montez presided over the ceremony. He shared with the new citizens his own experience with the naturalization process.  “So, I am the child of immigrants from Cuba,” said Montez. “My entire childhood I was reminded of the value of citizenship and the importance of appreciating what the country has to offer. When you grow up in that environment and you are reminded of things like that, that are easy to forget all the privileges we have as citizens of this country.”  Sinae Baek came to the U.S. from South Korea in 2012 as an international student. Baek is a violinist with the Rapides Symphony Orchestra.  Even after 10 years, Baek admitted that it was hard to contain emotion when she heard her name called.  “Well, initially I was excited,” said Baek. “In the middle of the ceremony, I got a little sentimental and emotional but mostly I am very excited.”  After the new citizens said the Pledge of Allegiance, they were dismissed from the courtroom with strict instructions from U.S. District Judge Dee Drell, ordering them to do the most American thing anyone can do, eat a hamburger.

A Canfield mom has a unique problem and she’s hoping you can help with a miracle.  She didn’t pour the cement, but Kelly Long helped build the special needs playground at Walnut Grove in Canfield.  “I have a set of twin daughters who both have autism. I’m also on the board of directors for the Autism Society. I go out to the school systems and I advocate for services and accommodations in the school systems, because any special parent knows, it’s kind of a battle to get those services,” Long said.  Now, Long has her own battle — a fight for her life.  “I have end-stage kidney failure. I have been a type 1 diabetic for almost 34 years. I’m on the kidney transplant waiting list at the Cleveland Clinic,” Long said.  Long had an evaluation there recently and got some bad news.  “Most people have a few or some antibodies, and I have 64, which is excessive. I’ve been told that only 18% of the population will match me,” she said.  Now, Long is praying for a small miracle.  “So I need to find someone who is O positive, that’s part of that 18% to match me. For anybody that wants to learn more about donating a kidney, you can go to www.ClevelandClinic/KidneyDonor.org. It’s an online process,” Long said.  If you’re not O positive though, there are still ways you can help Long.  “That one person is all we need, but we just need thousands of you to share it and help find somebody to get her better,” said Dana Winters, Long’s longtime friend."

In short, it’s a feast of froth.  Still, by all accounts, it is one of the symphony’s most anticipated and popular annual concerts, a season-ender — and literally ending every year with Sousa’s rousingly patriotic anthem “The Stars and Stripes Forever.” The music gets underway at 3 p.m. Sunday in the Vacaville Performing Arts Theatre.  “We’re almost in the final stages of rehearsals,” longtime symphony conductor Semyon Lohss said during a telephone interview Sunday, adding that the last of two would be Thursday night at the Laurel Creek Elementary School in Fairfield.  The program begins with John Williams’ “Superman” March; followed by Offenbach’s Overture to his operetta “The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,” a piece with tuneful, exhilarating melodies; Faure’s Pavane; Sullivan’s (he of Gilbert and Sullivan fame) Overture to “The Pirates of Penzance”: and Johann Strauss Jr.’s “Orpheus-Quadrille,” in which “Strauss used passages from Offenbach,” noted Lohss, a native of Russia who have lived in Fairfield for decades.  After an intermission, the second half of the program boasts “a beginning that will be rather unusual,” he said, referring to a past silent-auction fundraiser that awarded the winner with the prize of leading the orchestra during the Sunday afternoon concert.  The guest conductor? Nancy Hopkins, who, said Lohss, has never conducted an orchestra but received “a crash course” on conducting with two 45-minute lessons. She will lead the musicians in a rendition of Leroy Anderson’s “Belle of the Ball.”  What would a Pops concert be without a taste Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story” tunes? A lot of hummable ones, for sure: “I Feel Pretty,” “Maria,” “Something’s Coming,” “Tonight,” “One Hand, One Heart,” “Cool,” and “America.”  The program will continue with Hermann’s “Duke Ellington Fantasy,” and Stone’s arrangement of several Cole Porter songs, from “You Do Something to Me” and “Love for Sale” to “Night and Day” and “Anything Goes.”  Like the lilting songs of Jerry Bock’s “Fiddler on the Roof” score? You will hear plenty of them: “If I Were a Rich Man,” “Matchmaker,” “Miracle of Miracles,” “Sunrise, Sunset,” “To Life,” and “Tradition.”  Anderson’s song library returns with “Fiddle-Faddle,” and Sousa’s 1896 march, his best-known work and the official U.S. national march, closes out the symphony’s 36th season with a formidable and riveting blend of wind and brass instruments and percussion that may remind many of the sound patriotism while tugging at the ol’ heartstrings.  Of the annual Pops concert, Lohss expressed “pleasant surprise” about attendance numbers over the years.  After the concert, year over year, he remembered “walking into the (VPAT) lobby and just observing the atmosphere, how people communicate with each other after the concert.”  “Every time, people tell me they enjoyed the program,” Lohss recalled, adding, “They’ll say, ‘I’ve never heard that particular piece of music, but I enjoyed it.’ “  IF YOU GOSolano SymphonyPops concertWhen: 3 p.m. SundayWhere: Vacaville Performing Arts Theatre1010 Ulatis Drive, VacavilleTickets: $10 to $35Telephone: 469-4013Online: www.solanosymphony.org"

The fact that you exist — and that you’re happy— is a form of protest.”  “I love that you’re so unhappy because I’m happy,” Buttigieg said of his critics. “I love being a dad; I love this life; I love that I’m alive; I love that I made it out of the closet.”  Buttigieg added that it’s important for all LGBTQ people to live their lives openly and joyfully “not only to show other people that you can have it, but to show other people that we’re not going anywhere.”  Buttigieg’s memoir, rewritten for younger audiences, was released Tuesday. It is “the book I wish I could go back in time and hand to younger Chasten,” he said during a recent interview with People.  The memoir, which tells the story of Buttigieg growing up gay in a small Midwestern town, debuts as books with LGBTQ characters and themes are being targeted for removal from school libraries and classrooms nationwide.  Roughly half of last year’s most frequently challenged books were targeted for containing LGBTQ content deemed “sexually explicit,” according to the American Library Association.

The 2023 NBA Draft Lottery took place Tuesday evening, with the 14 teams who did not make the playoffs being drawn to determine the order of picks. Victor Wembanyama of France was widely regarded as a once-in-a-generation talent, who will almost undoubtedly be picked first.  Utah's chances at drawing #1 in the lottery were slim (4.5%), but Jazz fans hoped for a miracle. Some even offered tributes to the iconic ""9th & 9th Whale"" sculpture in Salt Lake City in hopes of landing Wembanyama.  The Jazz ended up with pretty rotten luck, drawing number 9 out of 14.  The San Antonio Spurs were the lucky ones, landing #1. The full order is below:    Spurs Hornets Trail Blazers Houston Rockets Detroit Pistons Orlando Magic Indiana Pacers Washington Wizards Utah Jazz Dallas Mavericks Orlando Magic Oklahoma City Thunder Toronto Raptors New Orleans Pelicans  With ""Wemby"" no longer an option, here are the top 10 draft prospects Utah could end up with, depending on who is chosen by teams 2-8: (ranked by Sports Illustrated)  2. Scoot Henderson, G League Ignite  3.Brandon Miller, Alabama  4. Jarace Walker, Houston  5. Amen Thompson, Overtime Elite  6. Anthony Black, Arkansas  7. Taylor Hendricks, UCF  8. Cam Whitmore, Villanova  9. Ausar Thompson, Overtime Elite  10. Cason Wallace, Kentucky  Will Utah choose one of these top 10 young athletes? Or will they hedge their bets on another player that most talent scouts overlooked? We'll find out on June 22."

Example video title will go here for this video  MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md. — The owners of a doggie retreat in Montgomery County are happy that no one was hurt after a car crashed through their building earlier this month.  According to Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Spokesman Pete Piringer, crews were called to the Sniffers Doggie Depot on Westmore Road around 4:30 p.m. on May 11 for reports of a car crashing into a building.  Video of the crash shared on the Sniffers Doggie Retreat Instagram page, shows a person coming through the door and speaking with staff just moments before a silver SUV crashed through the front windows, moves through the lobby before crashing through another wall and coming to a stop in the kennel area.  No injuries were reported but two dogs escaped during the incident and were later found and returned with their families.  “It's really incredible,"" said Hillary Stains, co-owner of Sniffers Doggie Retreat regarding the fact that no staff members or animals were hurt. ""We can rebuild the building at any time but we can never replace a dog.”  Stains explained that two employees were behind the desk in the lobby area with a client waiting to pick up their dog when the crash happened. A third employee was in the kennel area and didn't even see it coming until the wall came down.  Stains had just gotten home from work when she received a phone call from an employee saying a car had crashed into the building and she needed to come back. It wasn't until she saw the damage that she realized the extent of what happened.  The person behind the wheel was another doggie retreat client who had come to pick up their dog, according to Stains. She says she doesn't know why the car came barreling through the building but is thankful no one was hurt.  ""Really a miracle,"" she said.  Two dogs were able to escape during the crash and Stains said finding those dogs was their top priority. The first dog was located safely that night around 8 p.m. Employees volunteered their time to help find the second dog.  Staff searched for days, but in the end, the dog returned on its own. On Saturday, two days after the crash, the dog was found waiting for an employee who arrived to open the business around 6 a.m. When the staff member opened the business, the dog simply walked inside.  With no injuries reported and the two lost dogs found, Sniffers moves toward fixing the damages. Stains said there is no word on an estimate of how much damage was caused but is working with insurance to get it all sorted out."

It was like 3,000 years ago. The red sea parted, big deal. It’s not the first time that happened.”  The statement that Jews regularly observe Passover is accurate. Retelling the story of the Israelite slaves’ exodus from Egypt each spring is one of the most widely observed Jewish practices, and is frequently cited as an inspiration by politicians (including the person who holds Giuliani’s old job, New York City Mayor Eric Adams).  Meanwhile, there is no historical record of the Red Sea ever parting. The Torah says that God was able to make the miracle happen with the help of Moses, who led the Israelites to freedom — but there is no evidence that such a phenomenon has happened before or since. Some have sought to offer scientific explanations for such an event.  The vast majority of the $10 million suit focuses on allegations by Nicole Dunphy, a former Giuliani associate, that he pressed her into sexual activity without her consent and harassed her continually almost as soon as she began working for him in January 2019.  The Jewish elements of the lawsuit were first reported by the Forward. In addition to mocking Jewish observance of Passover, Giuliani is also accused in the complaint of disparaging Jewish men’s penis sizes and commenting about the “‘freaking Arabs’ and Jews.” He also made racist comments about other groups, according to the suit.  Giuliani, who was New York City mayor from 1994 to 2001, and in 2021 was barred from practicing law in New York state due to his repeated false claims about the 2020 election. Through a spokesperson, he “vehemently” denied the allegations Monday to the Associated Press."

This is their second album since they regrouped for ‘Happiness Begins’ back in 2019. The overall vibe of the album is perfect for a laid-back day in the sun.  Starting with “Miracle,” we get a funky bass rhythm mixed with an island type of piano riff that continues to drive the song to be very fast-paced but also have you dancing and grooving. The lyrics continue to be a heartfelt letter to a partner about them being a miracle in their life and how they make them feel. Romantic, heartfelt lyrics are something that has always been a staple with the Jonas Brothers and their songs. Upbeat, loving songs that you can dance and even scream out whenever.  “Montana Skies” shifts the pace to something more laid back while describing that although they have friends and people that live in more busy cities like New Jersey or Calabasas, they’d rather go to a calmer setting with lyrics like “Montana skies / Georgia sunsets / you’re the one walking in my head.”  The third song off the record, “Wings,” was the lead single from the record.. Driven by a synth bass rocking the driving pace, it talks about the other person, a partner, being the inspiration for them to fly with these “wings” they will use to fly and go on to new ventures.  “Sail Away” follows a description of transcending their current reality and going off to a different world when they are in the comfort of their partner. Lyrics such as “you make my physical spiritual / when I’m in your arms I sail away” have a choir that helps to emphasize the song and its soulfulness. “Celebrate!” is indeed a cause for celebration as we’re greeted by a choir that rejoices in a time to be alive. Guided by the sound of trumpets and heavy bass to emphasize the dance feel that it has. The lyrics continue to echo this chorus of celebrating through the good and bad times, and this is the time to allow for that stress to leave your body and simply dance.  The record continues with “Americana,” which contains multiple references to American culture as it describes a certain person with their sense of fashion and music taste. A song that highlights a laid-back kind of relationship where “we’re gonna get home when we get home.” Another single from the record, “Waffle House” allows listeners to gain insight into the struggles within the family as this song addresses moments where the three brothers have clashed in the past. But even when the times get rough, things will get figured out through deep conversation. Despite coming from a ‘‘headstrong father and a determined mother,” it’ll all get figured out in due time, and “[they] know it’s all love.”  Throughout the second half of the album, things begin to slow down.“Vacation Eyes” is guided by starting us off with a beautiful piano melody that then gets supported by a steady, easy-going drum beat and a strong bass rhythm. The lyrics tell us how they feel on vacation already just by getting lost in their partner’s eyes. “Little Bird” is a much slower song, as every Jonas Brothers album does have at least one song that’s relatively slower than the rest of the album. “Walls” is the perfect way to wrap up the album by being another relatively slower, more reflective song on how deep in love they are with their partner, and if they were to leave, they’d be devastated.  “Summer in the Hamptons” is more of a catchy repetitive track emphasizing the feelings of getting close to your partner, and “Summer Baby” continues the constant love they have for their partner, continuously falling in love with them every single day.  Overall, this album is an upbeat, catchy compilation where everyone can vibe and relax at the beach or listen on a drive with friends.  Verdict: Jonas Brothers’ “The Album” is the album for the summer and is another heartfelt album that surpasses its previous release."

She was barely six when she was cast in her first role as Natalie Hillard in Mrs. Doubtfire, and in a new interview with The Guardian, she revealed that even though her experiences on the sets of her films were generally positive, being in the public eye caused her lasting damage and trauma.  “I don’t think you can be a child star without there being some kind of lasting damage,” Wilson told the outlet. “The thing that people assume is that Hollywood is inherently corrupt, and there’s something about being on film sets that destroys you.”  She continued, “For me, that was not necessarily true. I always felt safe on film sets…I worked with a lot of really wonderful directors, who were used to working with children.”  But, she said, the media was not as compassionate, and the internet was not a safe place for her: “I was still sexualized,” she said. “I had people sending me inappropriate letters and posting things about me online… I made the mistake of Googling myself when I was 12 and saw things that I couldn’t unsee.”  After appearing the the 1996 film Matilda, she said things were difficult because people conflated her with her character, something she didn’t know how to handle at such a young age.  “I saw that [fans] were disappointed that I wasn’t as smart, pretty, nice, as they expect you to be. I think they were expecting me to be Matilda, and she’s wonderful, but she’s not real,” Wilson explained. “She’s brilliant in every single way. She’s smart, and kind and powerful. Then they met me, this nerdy, awkward teenager who got angry sometimes, but couldn’t even channel her anger into powers. I was never going to live up to that.”  Photo: Everett Collection  As she got older and she became less in-demand as an actor, she said she “had this Hollywood idea that if you’re not cute any more, if you’re not beautiful, then you are worthless… I directly tied that to the demise of my career. Even though I was sort of burned out on it, and Hollywood was burned out on me, it still doesn’t feel good to be rejected.”  Though she still works as an actor, Wilson has also become an advocate for child stars. In the past few years she has detailed her experiences in a 2016 book as well as in the HBO Max documentary Showbiz Kids. Wilson has a new book out now called Good Girls Don’t."

And that’s why he is a recipient of a 2023 ESL Jefferson Award.  Jipson enlisted in the Marines straight out of high school, just a few years after 9/11.  “The first four years I was in Camp Lejeune. Deployed twice to Iraq in those 4 years,” he said.  During his eight years of service to our country, Jipson went through a lot physically, mentally, and emotionally.  Jason Jipson (WHEC) photo)  At times, he considered taking his own life.  “There was one point when I thought, ‘Tonight’s the night’ and then I was like, ‘I’ll wait until tomorrow’ and the next morning I woke up and I was like, ‘This isn’t okay. The way this feels is not okay.'”  That was the beginning of a decades-long mental health journey. Jipson was one of the first veterans here in Monroe County to take part in Trybe Ecotherapy, an outdoor program designed specifically for veterans to manage the effects of stress, anxiety, depression, or trauma.  When he completed the program, he became a peer mentor to help those vets in line behind him.  “I am not a veteran. I never had military service. I’m a clinician and there’s a level of connection that Jason had with these folks, that I just will never have,” Lindsay Cray, chief program officer of Trybe Ecotherapy.  “He sees people struggling and he’s not afraid to go in where it’s a little dark sometimes and we all need people to grab us by the ears and drag us out of the rabbit hole when we go down there and Jason has been a big part of that for me,” said Thomas Borden, a U.S. Navy veteran.  “He’s always willing to get in the ditch with you. Jason is like, ‘It’s alright. I’m going to get in there and dig with you because I’ve been there before,'” Alan Bartlo, a Marine Corps veteran, said.  His work has helped veterans live better lives.  “I feel like it’s my purpose. It’s why I’ve been put on this earth is to do exactly what I’m doing and I couldn’t be able to do that unless all of that stuff happened,” Jipson said.  And this is not where Jason’s dedication to the community ends.  He’s also a coach for children with special needs at Miracle Field in Webster.

Hilda Bassey, 27, known on social media as Hilda Baci, began cooking in her kitchen Thursday and continued till Monday evening, preparing more than 100 meals in all.  Baci is hoping to beat the Guinness World Record set by Lata Tondon, an Indian chef who cooked for 87 hours and 45 minutes straight in 2019.  Guinness World Records said it will have to review the evidence to ensure Baci didn’t cook the books.  “We are aware of the record attempt and are looking forward to receiving the evidence for our Records Management Team to review before we can confirm the record is official,” a rep said.  Thousands of Baci’s supporters gathered in the Lekki area of Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial hub, on Monday as she was finishing up her cooking marathon.  Nigerian chef Hilda Bassey, known on social media as Hilda Baci, began cooking Thursday. Twitter / @TheHildaBaci  The renowned Nigerian chef said she hopes her efforts will showcase how hardworking Nigerian women are and shine a spotlight on Nigerian food.  “Nigerian cuisine is the best out there,” she told CNN.  “The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food,” she added.  Baci began cooking Thursday and continued through Monday evening. AP  The chef said she nearly gave up on her first day of cooking but that once she surpassed the previous record, she felt inspired to continue, setting a goal for herself to hit 100 hours.  Tondon, the previous record holder, shared a heartfelt message of support for Baci as she proceeded with her attempt.  “The first day was the most difficult,” Baci said. “I was ready to give up six hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible.”  Baci said she nearly dropped out after six hours of cooking. AP  Crowds gathered in support of Baci as she cooked, and despite forgoing sleep, she remained positive, oftentimes dancing and waving at the many fans who showed up in droves to support her, according to CNN.  Celebrities including Nigerian musician Tiwa Savage and local politicians also came to support Baci.  The determined chef only took 5-minute breaks every hour or accumulated one hour after a stretch of 12 hours.  Thousands of people turned out to support Baci as she attempted to break the record. AP  After Baci surpassed the previous record, President Muhammadu Buhari tweeted that it was a great night for Nigeria.  “Hilda’s drive, ambition and resilience have brought great interest and insight into the uniqueness of Nigerian food,” the president wrote.

Two of his old clubs face off on Thursday night when the Owls attempt to overturn a monumental 4-0 first leg loss against Peterborough United at Hillsborough.  Beevers, 33, is now plying his trade the other side of the world in Australia. But he's back on these shores after making a surprise return. He landed back in the UK just in time to shake off jetlag and play a part in the Steel City Derby legends game last weekend.

Ex-players from both sides of the Steel City divide turned out and more than 1,400 supporters turned out to watch an entertaining charity match end 4-3 in the favour of the Blades.  Beevers progressed through Wednesday's youth ranks before making more than 150 appearances for the Owls. He then had a three-year spell with Posh prior to departing for A-League side Perth Glory last summer.  No side has ever overturned a three-goal deficit never mind a four-goal handicap but the former England under-19 international refuses to rule anything out.  Speaking to Yorkshire Live, the 33-year-old said: ""I'm going to go down. I would have liked it to be tighter to be honest!  ""Look, you never know. Looking at it I think Wednesday need to score a couple of early goals before half-time. It's a tall order of course it is, but if they get that early goal they could potentially put them on the back foot. Hopefully it'll be a good night of football.  ""Stranger things have happened. I'm sure there'll be a massive crowd there which can be intimidating for the away side. Hopefully they can make it a good tie.""  READ NEXT:"

They have now been married for over fifty-one years. He has two daughters and four grandchildren.Greeson shares, “How do you define the words journey and miracle? What do you base your definition on? Many times, these are defined by what’s happening in an individual’s life or simply by an emotional response to a particular situation. Sometimes, these words are used so often that their meaning and their impact on our lives are actually diminished and can even become inaccurate.“These wide varieties of definitions can make for great discussions and good learning experiences when conducted respectfully and with open minds. In A Journey of Miracles, I share my thoughts on what these two words mean to me. It is written to honor what God has done, and continues to do, in my life. I am not a professional writer, so I know through the whole writing process, I was helped and inspired by the Holy Spirit. I pray they encourage, remind, renew, and engage each of you.“God created you. God knows each of you. God loves you. You are significant to him. You are his miracle. He longs for you to join him on the journey he has for you. Trust God. You are never alone. God has never made a mistake with a life. You have a purpose in his world.”Published by Christian Faith Publishing, Christopher Greeson’s new book will engage the spirit as readers reflect and consider their own blessings.Greeson shares in hope of offering an encouraging hand to anyone struggling with their purpose or personal connection to God.Consumers can purchase “A Journey Of Miracles” at traditional brick & mortar bookstores, or online at Amazon.com, Apple iTunes store, or Barnes and Noble.For additional information or inquiries about “A Journey Of Miracles,” contact the Christian Faith Publishing media department at 866-554-0919."

Heather, 61, cemented herself as a beacon of Hollywood success throughout the '80s and '90s, thanks to her roles in wildly popular shows like Melrose Place and Dynasty - but in the early 2000s, she embarked on a sudden downward spiral that saw her facing numerous run-ins with the law, multiple hospitalizations, and over 20 stints in rehab.  Ava, now 25 - whom Heather welcomed with her ex-husband, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, in 1997 - never wavered from her side, and it was her long-lasting and steadfast support that was said to have helped the star finally get sober in 2019.  Heather's descend from the top first began in 2008 - one year after she and Richie, now 63, opted to go her separate ways.  Amid Heather Locklear's rollercoaster of scandals, arrests, and addiction issues, there was one person who stuck by her through it all - her fiercely loyal look-alike daughter, Ava Sambora  As Ava, who recently received her masters degree from the University of Southern California, continues to make her mother 'proud,' FEMAIL and recapped their very special relationship  At the time, she was arrested for a suspected DUI, and even though it was later revealed that she was sober when she was taken into custody, the event was the first of many controversial endeavors to plague the Spin City alum.  Over the next decade, police would be called to Heather's home on multiple occasions, and she would rack up eight different charges after allegedly attacking law enforcement officials who were trying to calm her down.  To what she's said about growing up in the spotlight and how she helped Heather overcome her substance abuse struggles to her own impressive achievements and booming career - here's everything we know about Heather's 'miracle' daughter, Ava  And Ava reportedly had a front-row seat to it all. As the now 61-year-old continued her implosion, it was said that her young daughter was left heartbroken, and 'begged' her mother to get the help that she desperately needed.  Even so, the now-25-year-old stood by her mom through it all - in fact, Heather's powerful journey to sobriety has seemed to only make her and her daughter closer.  Ava, who followed in Heather's footsteps and launched her own career as an actress and model, has been very outspoken about how much her mom has taught her over the years - and she even once credited the movie star with helping her to overcome her 'debilitating' anxiety.  Heather has been just as loud about how much Ava means to her, referring to her as a 'miracle' and praising her 'kindness' and 'strength' in previous interviews.  As Ava, who recently received her masters degree from the University of Southern California, continues to make her mother 'proud,' FEMAIL went ahead and recapped their very special relationship from start to finish.

Downward spiral: Heather faced numerous run-ins with the law and was hospitalized multiple times - all while her young daughter Ava 'begged' her to get help  Heather and Richie Sambora tied the knot in December 1994, and they welcomed Ava together in October 1997. They are seen together right after her birth  After 12 years together, Heather (seen with Ava throughout her childhood) filed for divorce in 2006, and when it was finalized in 2007, the exes received joint custody  But soon after she and Richie went their separate ways, Heather's troubles began.

However, after 12 years together, she filed for divorce in 2006, and when it was finalized in 2007, the exes received joint custody of then-nine-year-old Ava.  Then, in September 2008, she faced her first run-in with the law, when she was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She plead no contest to reckless driving  But soon after she and Richie went their separate ways, Heather's troubles began.  In March 2008, it was reported that her doctor had called 911 after he started to worry that she was going to end her life. Emergency responders rushed to her home, but said she appeared to be fine.  Then, in September 2008, she faced her first run-in with the law, when she was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence.  Although tests confirmed her blood alcohol level was under the legal limit, authorities believed that prescription medication she was taking for her anxiety and depression had caused her erratic driving.  She ultimately plead no contest to reckless driving and was sentenced to three years probation.  In February 2018, she was arrested for domestic violence and battery against a police officer after she allegedly kicked three law enforcement officials while they were trying to calm her down during an argument between her and her boyfriend, Chris Heisser - all of which Ava reportedly witnessed.  In February 2018, she was arrested again after she allegedly kicked law enforcement officials while they were trying to calm her down during an argument between her and her boyfriend  She then headed to rehab, and at the time, a source told Entertainment Tonight that it was her daughter who encouraged her to finally 'get the help she needs'  'Ava begged her mom to go to rehab,' a source told the outlet.

She was arrested again in June 2018 - this time, for allegedly attacking a police officer and EMT after they received a 'disturbance' call from her home  However, Heather's problems weren't over. In June 2018, she was hospitalized after she reportedly threatened to shoot herself over suspicions that Chris was cheating on her.  She also reportedly started choking her mother and hit her father when they tried to calm her down.  She was then put under a three-day psychiatric hold, but days after returning home, she was arrested again - this time, for allegedly attacking a police officer and EMT after they received a 'disturbance' call from her home.  She was released hours later, after paying $20,000 bail, but was rushed to the hospital later that day due to a suspected overdose.  Afterwards, a source told Us Weekly that Ava was 'heartbroken' over her mother's continued downward spiral.  The insider said that the Dynasty star's 'erratic behavior' left the then-20-year-old 'really sad.' They added that she and Heather were 'always incredibly close,' which made it even harder for her.  But thankfully, they said Ava's father was a 'great support system,' and that she was 'leaning on him' amid Heather's on-going struggles.  Road to sobriety: After more than 20 rehab stints, Heather finally turned it around - thanks, in part, to her daughter's unwavering support  In the months that followed, Heather was in and out of treatment facilities '20 times' before she finally got sober in 2019 - and Ava never gave up on her mother. they are seen together in 2013  At the time, Richie exclusively revealed to DailyMail.com that he has assembled a team of doctors and specialists to ensure Heather and their daughter's best interests were taken care of.  'I will of course always be there for Heather, and especially Ava,' he said. 'I am very proud of my daughter for her composure and strength during this difficult time.'  Throughout her downward spiral and numerous stints in rehab, the mother-daughter duo stayed very close, and Ava's support never wavered.

Throughout her downward spiral and numerous stints in rehab, the mother-daughter duo stayed very close, and Ava's support never wavered.  Heather's legal troubles were finally put to rest when she plead no contest to her outstanding eight charges, which resulted in her being sentenced to 30 days in a residential mental health facility.  'Ava has a very loving and supportive relationship with her mom,' a source said to People at the time.  'And as painful it is, she knows that it's in her mom's hands and God's hands. All she can do is like anybody else, just pray and support.'  When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, it was reported by People that Ava was quarantining with her mother, who was a year sober at that point, as well as Heather's parents.  'Heather is gardening, taking walks and cooking like a fiend. She cooks for herself, Ava and her parents. It’s very sweet,' revealed someone who was close to the actress.  In an essay she penned for People in 2020, Ava spoke out about how her mom helped her overcome her own 'debilitating' anxiety. They are pictured together in 2016  She added that Heather 'always made her feel heard' and 'never judged her.' 'She treats every person with respect and makes them feel important,' gushed the now-25-year-old  'It’s really amazing to see how she managed to turn things around. Heather is always happiest when she is with her daughter.'  In an essay she penned for People in 2020, Ava spoke out about how her mom helped her overcome her own 'debilitating' anxiety.  'My mom has shown me kindness in so many ways,' she wrote. 'I lived almost an hour away from her, and when I would have anxiety attacks, she would drive over and visit me.  'Anytime of the day, she would stop what she was doing and come to comfort me. When I would insist she did not have to, she would stay on the phone with me late into the night, until I was calm enough to sleep.'  She added that Heather 'always made her feel heard' and 'never judged her.'  'She treats every person with respect and makes them feel important,' continued the now-25-year-old.  Heather praised her daughter's 'confidence and strength' in the article, while calling her a 'miracle.' They are seen together in 2012  'While she embodies kindness in many ways, her ability to care for and give to others is what I admire most. She is selfless and inspires me to be selfless as well.'  Heather praised her daughter's 'confidence and strength' in the article, while calling her a 'miracle.'  'She never has a bad word to say about anyone, and for a teenage girl, that is something,' she gushed.  'She doesn’t feel the need to put others down in order to feel better about herself. I’ve often seen her transform a potential gossip fest into a conversation about that person’s most amazing attributes.  'Ava is an example to me to always try to find the good in someone. I have watched her from afar and up close throughout her life, and I aspire to be more like her.  'Her kindness is contagious. We are very close, and I am blessed to call her my daughter.  'She is completely unaware of all the good she brings to this world - it’s just who she is. I couldn’t be more proud of her.'

She started acting back in 2012, when she starred in Judd Apatow's film This Is 40.  She then appeared in the Disney Channel series Good Luck Charlie, and the sitcom Fresh Off The Boat.  Her other acting credits include the 2018 TV movie Mommy Be Mine and the thriller flick A Dark Foe.  She also appeared in the YouTube series SummerBreak 3, a fake reality series that followed a group of students during their summer break.  But it seems as though Ava (seen in 2019) has opted for a much-quieter lifestyle in recent years, turning her social media profile to private and taking a step back from acting  She graduated from Viewpoint High School in Calabasas in June 2015, and then headed off to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied psychology  After finishing college in 2020 - with a GPA of 4.0 - she enrolled at University Of Southern California, where she recently received her master's degree in marriage and family therapy  She is also a successful model.

At the university, she joined the sorority Alpha Phi, but she told ET that her classwork always came first.  'I like to do what I think is cool, not what other people think is cool. I'm not into partying. I'm not about it,' she said. 'Don't try to persuade me, it won't work.'

'I was never concerned with their fame,' she explained. 'It was kind of surreal to come into that realization, because they are just mom and dad.  'Then all of a sudden, it becomes clear just how world-wide celebrated they are, and how incredibly talented they are, and it becomes an even bigger privilege for them to be my parents on a larger scale, outside of the day-to-day family basis.  'As I got older, I learned to appreciate it more - especially since I would love to follow in my mother’s footsteps.'  She also dished on the important advice that her mom gave her when she started her own career as an actress.  'The best advice my mother ever gave me was not to take everything so personally. There are going to be a thousand times you’ll hear ""no,"" but, it only takes a few yeses, and waiting for those yeses will be worth it,' she continued.  'I think that’s such an important mindset to have in this business. There could be a million reasons why they don’t want you for a part.

(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)  Mohegan — Taj McWilliams-Franklin, one of the most popular and productive players in Connecticut Sun history, will have her No. 11 jersey hoisted to the rafters following Sunday’s home opener against the Washington Mystics at Mohegan Sun Arena.  McWilliams-Franklin’s number will join Margo Dydek (12), Nykesha Sales (42), Katie Douglas (23), Lindsay Whalen (13) and Ashja Jones (15) during a special ceremony following completion of the 1 p.m. start. She will be joined by her former coach, current Mystics general manager Mike Thibault, and Whalen for the ceremony.  McWilliams-Franklin spent eight years with the franchise, four with the Orlando Miracle. and four when the Miracle relocated to the Sun in 2003. She averaged 12.4 points and 7.5 rebounds with the franchise and later went on to win WNBA titles with the Detroit Shock and Minnesota Lynx before retiring in 2012.  “I am surprised and humbled at this amazing honor,” McWilliams-Franklin said in a team release. “I loved my time as a Connecticut Sun and grew as a person and a player. Learning that this organization viewed my contributions to this amazing sport as worthy of this type of honor, brings tears to my eyes. I did not have a big name. I did not come from a big D1 school, but I came with big goals and a big work ethic; and that’s what the Connecticut faithful appreciated and cheered for.”  With Friday’s season opener at the Indiana Fever just days away, the Sun made the following roster Moves on Tuesday:  • Signed 5-foot-10 guard Ty Harris to a mult-year contract extension through 2025. Harris, who played at South Carolina, was acquired in a three-team team with New York and Dallas. She was the No. 7 overall pick of the Wings in the 2020 WNBA draft.  “She is a great fit for our organization and culture as a person and a player,” said general manager Darius Taylor. “We look forward to her being a part of our franchise for the years to come.”  • Acquired 6-1 guard Leigha Brown, a rookie from Michigan, in a trade with the Atlanta Dream for the Sun’s third-round pick in the 2025 draft. She was drafted No. 15 overall last month by the Dream.  • Waived two players — second-year guard Nia Clouden of Michigan State (the No. 12 overall pick by the Sun in 2022) and rookie forward Caitlin Bickle of Baylor, who signed a training camp contract with the team."

You are required to pay high prices in bewildering, ever-changing combinations so you can wait in line to have your belongings and your own body scanned before waiting again to squeeze into a small, cramped airplane seat between dozens of other, equally annoyed, possibly less-than-hygienic passengers.  Yes, granted, it's the miracle of flight and utterly amazing that we can safely hurl humans through the air at all, but one feels certain the Wright Brothers' plans included more leg room.  In fact, more than half of all tweets from travelers who mentioned an airport by its Twitter username could be characterized as ""angry,"" according to a Forbes Advisor analysis of 37,000 tweets between March 2022 and March 2023.

No, that honor fell to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, the closest one to Disneyland.  But JAX was a close second.  Of all tweets calling out @JAXairport by name, 60% were negative, according to Forbes, using words like ""line,"" ""TSA,"" ""garage,"" ""delays"" and ""employees.""  Coming in fourth was fellow Florida destination Tampa International Airport (TPA), targeted with 57% angry tweets (""bags,"" ""delayed,"" ""luggage,"" ""security,"" ""canceled"").

It may not be that a majority of travelers are peeved, but they're the ones most likely to talk about it. Happy, or at least not-actively-aggravated passengers tend not to tweet about their experiences, which creates a self-selecting group of seething resentment.  Also, it's been a weird few years for air travel. The pandemic shut things down, then people were masked and anxious, then some were masked and angry. Massive countrywide flight cancellations have popped up from staff shortages, severe weather and even an FAA computer glitch which aren't the airports' fault but may have caused indiscriminate Twitter ire.

Knowing ahead of time that you're going to be frustrated helps, and everything you can do to minimize that is good.  Wear comfortable clothes.  Get there early and bring something to read or do, both for the wait and the flight. Charge your electronics before you leave the house and top them up, if possible, while waiting at the gate. Bring games you like, download TV shows and movies ahead of time.  Apply for TSA Precheck or Global Entry. Pricey, but worth it for frequent flyers who would like to speed things up and keep their shoes on.  Pick your seat for whatever's most convenient for you, whether it's better legroom, easier bathroom access or whatever. Upgrade if you can.  Bring headphones or ear pods, ideally noise-canceling ones.  Bring snacks. If you have a flight with a meal consider the vegetarian option. You'll probably get it faster and it's usually a better quality. Also, a reusable water bottle is perfectly fine as far as the TSA is concerned and you can fill it up past the security checkpoint, or ask a flight attendant (if they're not busy). Hydrate!  Avoid contacts and makeup. Dry air inside the cabin makes both uncomfortable.  Keep moving. Move your legs up and down, walk the aisle between the seats when it's empty, move around during layovers. Whatever keeps the blood flowing. Compression socks, especially on longer flights, can help regulate blood flow in your legs.

A Faction Focus article on Tuesday reveals the Strands of Fate army rule, which has some definite mechanical similarities with the Sisters of Battle’s Miracle Dice.  Eldar players in Warhammer 40k 10th edition will roll 12 Fate Dice at the start of the battle. The results of the dice are set aside – later in the battle, before you roll to hit, wound, damage, advance, charge, or for a battle-shock test, you can use a Fate Die. Rather than rolling one of the dice, you’ll use the stored result on that Fate Die. If you don’t like the result on your first 12 Fate Dice you can roll again, rolling one less die – a process you can repeat until you accept your fate.  The Sisters of Battle’s Miracle Dice were previewed on May 10, and similarly allow you to substitute a stored die result for one you’re about to roll. The difference is that Eldar start the battle with lots of Fate Dice but struggle to get new ones, while Sisters pick up a Miracle Die every turn, every time they lose a unit, and through some unit abilities.  Updated 10th edition datasheets in the article show that some Eldar units have new rules that interact with the Strands of Fate and Fate Dice. The psychic Farseer can, once per turn, change the result on a Fate Dice being used by a unit within 12” into a six. Meanwhile the humble Eldar Guardians generate additional Fate Dice when they hold an objective at the end of your Command phase, giving you a trickle of new dice.  The article also shows the first Eldar Detachment for 10th edition, the Battle-Host. This has a very simple army rule, granting each unit in your force one re-roll to hit and one re-roll to wound every time it shoots or fights. We also get to see the Fire and Fade Stratagem, which for 2CP allows a non-aircraft unit that isn’t engaged to move after it shoots. It can’t charge later in the turn, but this could be a powerful tool to move a unit into cover, or forward onto an objective.  The article reveals the weapons profile for the Prism Cannon, the main ordnance of the Fire Prism gravtank. This massive laser’s Focused Fire mode has the unique Linked Fire Weapon Ability, which allows one Fire Prism to calculate its range and line of sight to a target from another Fire Prism that it can see – one Fire Prism channels its weapon into another Fire Prism’s gun. Popping a Fire Prism out of cover, using it to draw line of sight for another gravtank’s Focused Fire, then using Fire and Fade to retreat to safety seems like a classic Eldar move.  The way that Linked Fire is worded suggests it’s an Eldar-only Weapon Ability, rather than one that’s shared across several Warhammer 40k factions. We saw the Conversion Weapon Ability on the Leagues of Votann on May 11, but though they’re the only force making new Conversion beamers in the 41st Millennium, both the Imperium of Man and Adeptus Mechanicus have a few relics from the Horus Heresy hanging around."

In a recent interview with ESPN Brasil, he voiced his resolve and reflected on the team’s journey so far.  Gabriel Jesus sends out a rallying cry, believing in Arsenal’s chances for the title despite the setback.  Despite some stumbles, Jesus is satisfied with the progress made by Arsenal this season.  With two more games in the Premier League, Arsenal remain hopeful while Manchester City, leading by four points, have one game less played.  As the Premier League title slips out of Arsenal’s grasp, Gabriel Jesus stepped up to rally the team for what seems an impossible task.  Following a disappointing defeat against Brighton & Hove Albion, Jesus’s message to his teammates and Arsenal’s fans is one of resilience: the battle isn’t over yet.  A heart-to-heart with Gabriel Jesus  Speaking with ESPN Brasil after Sunday’s match, Jesus didn’t mince words about Arsenal’s performance.  “I think that, if you look at it, our team didn’t play well from the beginning. We didn’t manage to play,” Jesus said.  “We didn’t manage to have the ball. We played a lot of long ball. And up front, if you don’t win a duel, the second ball. They control the game.  “They play and don’t care if they lose the ball. They take chances. That’s football. Brighton have good players who take chances, who break the first line. The forwards are quick and have quality.  “Our side didn’t work. Our game didn’t work. Our game went way down. We are really upset.”  About the title being unable to win the Premier League, Jesus added, “Impossible, no. Mathematically, it’s not over.  “When I arrived at this club, that’s what I learned. Don’t give up, always try. We still have chances, but it’s obvious that it became very difficult. But we’ll fight until the end.  Looking back at Arsenal’s season  Despite the setback, Jesus is satisfied with Arsenal’s season, acknowledging the team’s stumbles but also recognising the progress made.  “Obviously, many will talk and comment.  “When you’re good, everyone wants to talk and show up. When things happen like you don’t want, then the opportunists appear. But we know that we need to look at our side. We had everything to win the Premier League.  “But, unfortunately, due to some games that we did badly, we ended up losing points we couldn’t. And we got to this situation,” explained Jesus.  Looking ahead  Four points behind Manchester City, Arsenal now face Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side, with one game in hand, are set to play against Chelsea, Brighton, and Brentford."

The project reached its conclusion after 11 years of planning.  MCH has been a CMN hospital since 1987, receiving funding for varying groups across the hospital. CMN partners with local members of Odessa such as Walmart and Sam’s Club and has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars each year they’ve been partnered with MCH.  Samantha Serrano, the program manager for CMN, said the unveiling of the balloon is another massive step for the program and its fundraising.  “It’s a game changer for us, I think a lot of people in our community are still very much unaware of what Children’s Miracle Network does here for their local community,” Serrano said. “I don’t think they understand that when they give back to their local CMN hospital it stays here, it doesn’t go anywhere else, it stays in the Permian Basin to bring awareness and to bring back funds for their, you know, maybe even just their neighbor. It may not directly impact them but it brings back funds to support the high standard of care that we want to get here at Medical Center.”  Now under the full branding and label of a CMN hospital, Serrano said the hope is increased awareness and local contributions, ensuring that children can be treated at MCH no matter the cost.  CMN’s executive chair member Kelby Davis provided a personal testament to the impact of the program’s funding. A mother of three, Davis described how CMN has helped with surgeries, intensive care and the general health for all of her children.  “All three of our children were born right here inside this building and all three of them went to the NICU, and that’s not something as a mom you ever think could happen,” Davis said. “You picture them laying on your chest and you having those moments with them, but they all went off to the NICU. But the only thing that made that okay is because I know that we have Children’s Miracle Network resources inside that building with a beautiful team of humans that care so wonderfully for these babies.”  As the partnership between MCH and CMN continues to grow and receive more awareness, the goal between both institutions is still to provide all the support children need.  “I think that they have the resources in that NICU that they need. They have the resources on the pediatric floor that they need,” Davis said. “We have play-dough to bring to a kid after they have surgery or on Halloween Sam brought us all in the NICU just a little piece of Halloween candy from Children’s Miracle Network. Those are the things that matters when your babies need them. Those are the things that matter when you’re kind of walking through the worst of times.”  Like this: Like Loading...  Related"

Well, not only mine–yours, too. Consider, for one thing, how your fingernail is tough enough to scrape off the blackened residue from the bottom of an enamel pot, yet soft enough that it doesn’t leave a scratch. Despite many decades of work by the manufacturers of scouring pads, brushes and sponges, no other material has been found that so perfectly performs this simple task.  The human body has been getting a bad rap lately. Covid-19 owes much of its power to the body’s occasional tendency to do battle with itself. The coronavirus can set off what’s called a cytokine storm, a sometimes-fatal overreaction of the immune system. In the effort to repel the invading army, the body blows up its own munitions dump.  So in times like these, it might be worth remembering all the ways that, most of the time, the body does a tip-top job.  For example, your nose is full of tiny hairs that catch dust in the air before it enters the lungs. Your throat rarely malfunctions, even though it’s required to do unlikely double-service as a highway for both air and food.  Or consider this piece of genius engineering: The human forehead produces a sheen of moisture on a hot day in a way that helps the body shed heat. The hotter you get, the more sweat you produce. Clever, right?  As Bill Bryson notes in his book The Body: A Guide for Occupants, it is estimated that between one and five of your cells turn cancerous every day. And nearly every time, your immune system locates and kills them. As Bryson puts it: “Our bodies are a universe of 37.2 trillion cells operating in more or less perfect concert more or less all the time.”  Some things, I admit, are not ideal. Take the fact that an adult male of normal proportions will, when run at by a toddler, find that his genitals are at the perfect height for a high-speed collision. If done with sufficient vigour, the impact may even prevent the creation of further children. As sibling rivalries go, that’s not a bad effort.  The arrival of pimples during adolescence also remains a mystery. First of all, do they have to appear on the face, the most visible part of the body? Couldn’t the body choose somewhere out of the way, like the backs of the knees? And why do outbreaks arrive at the exact moment we first become interested in matters of romance? Why can’t we get the pimples over and done with when we’re 10 years old and don’t yet care about our appearance? Or why can’t they wait until we’re 90, when many of us once again don’t care?  If I were an engineer overseeing the evolution of the body, I’d have also spent more time choosing some of the materials. Shouldn’t the hard-working parts—the hips and knees—be made from something a bit more durable? And is it wise that the mouth is responsible for so many crucial tasks—eating, breathing and speaking?  All the same, we should be grateful for what we have. How wonderful it is that our hair grows at the rate of approximately one centimetre per month—fast enough to keep hairdressers in business, but slow enough that both hairdresser and client have something new to talk about when they meet.  And I don’t know where we would be if someone hadn’t thought to equip the human body with a bottom. As Australian writer Tim Winton established in his children’s book The Bugalugs Bum Thief, human beings without backsides can’t sit down; they lower themselves onto a chair and simply slide off.  Plus, without a bottom, we’d be on our feet all day, leaving us too tired for the things that all humans should find time to do—sing a song of praise to the body and all the things it (normally) does for us.  Next, if you've ever had a colonoscopy, you'll relate to this woman's hilarious story.

But his story is very different to that of most – he is a burn survivor whose journey of recovery is testament to the power of the human spirit.  Next month will mark five years since the event that forever changed Van Baalen’s life when, just weeks after celebrating his 21st birthday, he was competing in a paragliding competition and collided with power lines. He lost consciousness and when he awoke, he was lying on the ground surrounded by flames and on fire. Still strapped into his paragliding harness, Van Baalen managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage. His injuries left him fighting for his life. Katinka Rheeder, a specialist nurse and manager of the Netcare Milpark Hospital’s dedicated burns unit where he was treated for more than a year, said the burns recovery journey involves many small steps over a long time.  “Kelvin had sustained severe burns to approximately two-thirds of his body surface. Local trauma statistics indicated a mere 30% predicted survival rate for burn injuries of this extent and severity,” she said. Kelvin’s skin had been burnt so badly that it could not heal or regenerate. He spent his first month in a medically-induced coma, underwent more than 27 surgeries including extensive wound debridement and skin grafts. He also had to undergo a gruelling programme of physiotherapy and ancillary health support before being able to come off ventilation. This was more than 300 days after the accident.  Today, his reality is vastly different. He now gets up every day to conduct site checks for a construction company. “I am also studying again. I had originally wanted to become a commercial pilot but now I’m happy to be studying BCom finance,” he said. Even more remarkable is his return to playing sport. “I love golf and play at least once every week, and I recently became an ambassador for the Country Club Johannesburg, participating in disabled tournaments. I am currently playing a two handicap.”  More than a year after his first admission Van Baalen was discharged for the next stage of his treatment at Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital, where he stayed for two-and-a-half months. Complications with infection, graft rejection and organ failure are common, Rheder said. The joints are usually very stiff and if daily physiotherapy is not done it can result in permanent contractures, when the tissue tightens or shortens causing pain and a reduced range of movement. Van Baalen said it had been just three-and-a-half years since he got to come home for good. “That was not the end of digging deep – I had to push myself to walk around, adding more laps each day. But, it was worth it.”"

""I want to be able to walk and do other things without pain and struggle,"" Angel told the outlet.  ""All I really want now is to get better and just to be normal like other kids."""

However, for The Young and the Restless’ Jeremy, it appears there may be no coming back from his murder. Sure, Phyllis killed the man in self defense but we all know that she won’t get off without a fight, considering her involvement with him to bring down Diane. And the fact that the police found his body, well, for now, anyways, he’s simply dead.  However, his portrayer, James Hyde, is already making a comeback and it appears that fans can look forward to seeing him in a new Christmas movie titled A Christmas Frequency this holiday season — and, as an added perk, he’ll be joined by another familiar face… The Bold and the Beautiful’s Denise Richards (Shauna), first reported exclusively by our sister site, Variety.  Soap-vet-turned-director, Lindsay Korman-Hartley shared a photo with Hyde and Richards and stated, “Merry Christmas with these two wonderful and talented people. James Hyde and Denise Richards, thank you for bringing the magic to Christmas on air.”  Fans quickly rushed to the comments with excitement, especially at seeing Hyde reunited with Korman-Hartley since their time on Passions where the two shared scenes together as Sam and Theresa. “Theresa and Sam Bennet,” follower Kerry Keil cheered. “Love this pic!”  So, what can you expect from A Christmas Frequency?  As Variety detailed, Richards will star as morning radio show host Brooke Walkins, who is secretly separating from her husband Todd, played by Hyde, but also losing ratings on her show. As a way to save it from being canceled, Brooke agrees to be set up on a series of blind dates live, as suggested by her producer Kenzie, as a way to land her a plus-one to the company’s Christmas party. However, Kenzie learns the guy she’s interested in applied to date Brooke, and when he becomes a hit with listeners, she must choose between her heart and her job.  More: Photo, soap fave’s new wife is pregnant  Considering Korman-Hartley has directed numerous movies for Lifetime and LMN, A Christmas Frequency, which is being produced by Nicely Entertainment, could very well fall into one of the network’s holiday lineups. Stay tuned, as we’ll bring our readers more details as they are released.  In the meantime, and while we wait to see if somehow, someway Jeremy will come back from the dead just in time to get Phyllis off the hook for his murder, look back at other daytime stars who made it in movies and primetime then returned to soaps in our photo gallery below."

Their opponents in Istanbul on 10 June will be decided on Wednesday, when Real Madrid meet Manchester City to settle their finely-poised tie (20:00 BST).  After completing a 3-0 aggregate win over fierce rivals AC Milan, Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti was quick to state his preference of avoiding record 14-time champions Real.  ""I would like to avoid Real Madrid because the competition seems made for them,"" former captain Zanetti said.  But, regardless of what happens in the final, football journalist Guillem Balague believes it is ""a miracle"" that three-time winners Inter have made it this far.  The Nerazzurri finished second to Bayern Munich in a group which also contained Barcelona, before going on to beat Portuguese clubs Porto and Benfica and prevailing in the first Milan derby in European competition for 20 years.  ""In the next few days we will realise what we did,"" manager Simone Inzaghi said.  ""For us it was a dream but we have always believed in it.  ""It was an extraordinary path and winning a derby in the semi-final like this brings great satisfaction.  ""Madrid and City are two of the best teams in Europe.""  World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez, who scored the only goal in Tuesday's second leg to begin the celebrations among the Inter supporters, echoed his manager's sentiments.  ""It is an incredible joy, I am delighted. I thank my family. This sport is the most beautiful thing in the world,"" Martinez said.  ""Playing in the Champions League final is a dream.""  'Manchester City or Real Madrid will be heavy favourites'  Inter are the first side to reach the Champions League final despite finishing as runners up in their group since both Liverpool and Tottenham in 2018-19  Inter's most recent Champions League triumph came in their last final in 2010, when Jose Mourinho masterminded victory over favourites Bayern Munich.  They will require an upset of perhaps greater magnitude to overcome Real Madrid or Manchester City - tied at 1-1 after the first leg in Spain.  ""Real or City would be heavy favourites but Inter are a well-balanced side,"" Owen Hargreaves, a Champions League winner with Manchester United, told BT Sport.  ""They are going to come up against a super team,"" he added. ""But they will want to finish the job now. They will be a problem in the final for whoever they play.""  Inter failed to compete for the Serie A title this season and sit 17 points adrift of formidable champions Napoli.  But the Coppa Italia finalists have thrived in the cup competitions, and in Europe Inzaghi's organised side have kept a competition-leading eight clean sheets.  ""In the important moments, Inter have always come through,"" European football expert Mina Rzouki told BBC Radio 5 live.  ""I know people think that whoever wins the other tie will overcome this Inter side, but I wouldn't be all that confident.""  Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who won the trophy in 2005, said on BT Sport: ""They are in with a chance, they deserve this chance.  ""They are tough to beat, they carry a threat. Whoever they face, they are in with a shout.""  While keen not to face serial-winners Real, Zanetti, part of Inter's 2010 Champions League-winning team, did not lose sight of what the club had achieved.  ""It is a great emotion. The group deserved to play in a Champions League final after 13 years,"" Zanetti told Sky Italia.  ""We are waiting to know the name of our opponents, but what this group has done is very important.  ""The most important thing is to get there; it was a difficult path."""

YOU JUST SAW EVERYTHING KIND OF FALLING AROUND YOU. THIS IS A PHOTO OF WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE O.R. WHERE TAYLOR WAS HUNKERED DOWN. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS AND DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY HITTING WAS WHEN I WAS THE MOST SCARED. TAYLOR AND HER FAMILY SURVIVED. BUT EVEN WITH THE DESTRUCTION AROUND THEM, THAT DIDN’T CHANGE THE FACT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GIVE BIRTH VERY SOON. SHE NEEDED TO GET TO SAFETY. THAT WAS A TASK IN ITSELF BECAUSE I’M UPSTAIRS AND I SAID ALL THE HALLWAYS ARE DARK. EVEN WHEN THEY CARRIED ME DOWN ON THE BACKBOARD, IT WAS DARK GOING DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU KNOW, YOU’RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND. YOU CAN’T REALLY SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING. SO THE FIRST LIGHT I ACTUALLY SAW WAS ONCE WE GOT OUTSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL, ONCE SHE WAS OUTSIDE, TAYLOR SAYS, SHE STARTED TO REALIZE THE TRUE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORM. IT WAS MUDDY. THERE WAS THERE WERE TREES AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. THERE WERE CARS AND STUFF KIND OF EVERYWHERE. SO I KNEW THAT IT WAS PRETTY BAD. SHE WAS THEN RUSHED TO NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL, WHERE SHE SUCCESSFULLY GAVE BIRTH AT 7:30 P.M. TO HER SECOND SON, BRADEN. HE WILL BE TEN AND HE HE’S DOING GOOD. HE’S IN FOURTH GRADE NOW. HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE DAY HE WAS BORN. SO WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. A DECADE LATER. AND TAYLOR SAYS IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH TIME HAS ALREADY PASSED. COMING UP ON TEN YEARS FEELS A LITTLE SURREAL, LIKE IT DOESN’T FEEL LIKE IT’S BEEN TEN YEARS SINCE THE TORNADO HAPPENED. OF COURSE, MY DAILY REMINDER IS MY CHILD, TAYLOR, USING HER UNIQUE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE TO HELP OTHERS SOON TO BE MOMS. TODAY, SHE’S NOW A NURSE AT THE VERY HOSPITAL WHERE SHE GAVE BIRTH AT NORMAN REGIONAL HOSPITAL. IT’S DEFINITELY COME FULL CIRCLE. I WORK IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. IN FACT, SHE EVEN WORKS WITH THAT SAME DOCTOR WHO DELIVERED BRADEN. SHE DIDN’T REALIZE WHO I WAS FOR A WHILE BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER. AND THEN ONE DAY SHE JUST WALKS UP TO ME AND SHE’S LIKE, YOU’RE SHAYLA, AREN’T YOU? AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH. AND SO SHE STARTS SHOWING ME PICTURES THAT SHE HAD FROM THE HOSPITAL AND STUFF. AND SO WE JUST KIND OF SHARED OUR PICTURES AND I TOLD HER THANK YOU, EVEN THOUGH SO MANY PEOPLE LOST SO MUCH ON MAY 20TH, 2013, A GLIMMER OF HOPE AND A MIRACLE ALSO TOOK PLACE THAT DAY, SOMETHING TAYLOR SAYS SHE WILL NEVER TAKE FOR GRANTED.

The mission, a great work of solidarity, according to the writer, began in the western province of Veraguas, as it was a strategic territory that facilitated access to the deep country as well as to the transit zone and the capital.  Operation Miracle allowed performing approximately 50,000 eye surgeries and its scope of attention covered 75,000 people in total, Gonzalez said.  Many of the surgeries were performed in Panama and some in Cuba.  Among the main diseases that were treated were cataracts, glaucoma, retinal damage and vision disorders resulting from diabetes, he added.  In 2009, the political science graduate said, the newly elected government at the time (referring to the Ricardo Martinelli administration) decided, without any consultations, to terminate Operation Miracle, leaving 69,000 people pending on ophthalmologic services.  After highlighting the role of Cuban physicians in other missions in Panama, such as in 2020 and 2021, when members of the Henry Reeve International Brigade collaborated in the fight against Covid-19, Gonzalez pointed out that the demand for the return of Operation Miracle is not aimed at replacing Panamanian professionals, as he is in favor of deeply social ideas.  Science and technology, works of human accumulation, must be at the service of the people, the analyst remarked.  jg/abo/mem/ga"

She and her children Henry and Margot are reliving their recent trip to a Queen Creek Costco, one that was anything but ordinary.  The siblings were chosen by Phoenix Children’s as fundraising ambassadors for the hospital's latest charity drive.  “It’s something that they get to do that is associated with Phoenix Children’s, that’s not negative, that’s not scary, that’s fun,” said Calkins.  Seven-year-old Henry was born with a rare autoimmune disease that’s forced him to spend much of his life in and out of the hospital. It's a genetic condition that can cause his own immune system to attack itself.  His sister Margot was recently diagnosed with the same condition.  “Henry’s life has drastically changed since he’s moved to Phoenix Childrens,” explained Calkins.  Specialized medical care provided there has given both of her kids their lives back. But that care isn’t cheap. It costs $2.7 million per day to operate Phoenix Children’s, providing for nearly 270,000 patients each year.  “All those different programs need funding, and it truly makes a difference,” said Calkins.  Last week, Henry and Margot were sent to the Queen Creek Costco with a job to do.  As honorary employees, name tags and all, they checked receipts and processed returns.  The siblings slipped on hairnets and made pizza and decorated cakes, all while urging customers to make a small donation. During the month of May, those donations are matched by Costco, hoping to raise more than a million dollars.  “Henry and Margot were just like jumping around, you could see how excited they were, they were telling them thank you, and telling them what they’ve been through, and why it meant so much,” said Calkins. “A lot of the employees seemed to be really passionate about talking to customers about donating after that.”  It’s clear from the photos that the kids' visit left an incredible impression, giving employees all the motivation they needed to hit their goals and beyond.  For Calkins, the hundreds of paper balloons hanging from the wall representing each donation sent her family and others like it a powerful message from the community.  ""That's why we love where we live, they are always here for us,"" said Calkins. “Get over to your local Costco and donate because you are changing a child's life.”"

Skincare lovers say the new £8 Miracle Balm from Revolution is so good, they've even stopped wearing foundation.  Said to instantly soothe dry lips, skin and hands among a whole host of other uses, some are already calling the new balm a dupe for the renowned Elizabeth Arden 8 hour Cream that’s £29.  Currently on sale at ASOS for the reduced price of £6.40 , shoppers could be saving more than £23 by opting for the so-called dupe, MyLondon reports.  READ MORE: Boots shoppers say £10 ‘miracle’ anti-ageing Olay eye cream ‘works like magic’  Amid the five star reviews on the Revolution site, one shopper said: “I believe in Miracles. This balm is great. I've used it on my lips and cheeks during the day, on my feet and hands overnight and on my face whilst in a dream room. It's on par with Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream but the tube looks more stylish and the price is a lot more reasonable. This is a product I'll be buying regularly.”  Another added: “I usually use a much more expensive balm (8 hour cream) but thought I’d give this a try. I’m impressed! It works well on dry or sensitive areas of the face and body. A little goes a long way. It has a light scent which doesn’t overpower. It is also much cheaper than my usual balm. I’ll definitely be buying again.”  Another calls it a ‘’One product wonder’’, stating that: ‘’As with the whole miracle range I now won't be without this. I use as an overnight face mask and I am now so happy with my skin I have stopped wearing foundation. I also have very curly hair and a smidge of this works wonders for frizz! What a product indeed. It really is a one product wonder.”  The balm has been inspired by the number one best-selling Miracle Cream moisturiser, which went viral as the dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream. It sold out twice last year - once in just 48 hours, with 10 pots being sold every minute. We’re expecting the latest product from the range to be just as popular.  The new Miracle Balm is an all-in-one protectant that instantly moisturises, smooths and hydrates dry, chapped skin as well as providing protection from further irritation and dryness.  Infused with a subtle rose scent and enriched with skin-loving Vitamin E, the multi-tasking supercharged skincare balm is said to calm skin from the first use.  But what’s more is that it can be used on the face, lips and neck, as well as cuticles to help manicures last longer. It can even be applied to the cheek bones for a natural dewy finish, or used to prevent flyaway hairs or tame unruly brows.  Some shoppers have complained that the product is ‘too thick’ and have struggled to squeeze it out of the tube, commenting: “Balm doesn’t squeeze out of the tube at all, it’s too thick and you have cut the hole bigger.”  However, when we tried the product for ourselves, we managed just fine. It’s been working wonders on my nail beds between manicures, but I also love using it to smooth down my hair or to comb through my brows for that on-trend fluffy look.  The Miracle Balm is available for £8 at Revolution Beauty Bay for only £8.00, but is currently cheapest for £6.40 at ASOS . You can also explore the entire Revolution Pro Miracle collection here.

I wrote a few myself. The Big Tech media corporation had essentially killed itself before Mr. Musk took control.  As the sink-carrying billionaire walked into Twitter headquarters (with a wallet $44 billion lighter) last October, the home base for reporters and influencers was little more than a boring left-wing echo chamber.  While Mr. Musk demonstrates the ability to run successful businesses (the world’s wealthiest people often do), many thought he was too late to save Twitter. The censorship, shadow banning and so-called fact-checking were killing the marketplace of ideas. It drove many users, including me, away.  Many business-saving initiatives are being pursued at Twitter — selling blue checks and subscriptions and sharing ad revenue, to name a few — but nothing seems to be accelerating the successful turnaround that free speech advocates so desperately want to see. While it was a lot of fun to see NPR called state-run media, the business of Twitter still seems to be on thin ice.  The Big Tech media corporations’ legacy of going beyond being just communication mediums is a tough one to overcome. These entities are writing, editing and controlling stories with little regard for truth or actual events. Big Tech is frustrating and disappointing us, but it’s eerily similar to what traditional news outlets have been doing for years.  We know that embracing “woke” culture at the expense of free speech ultimately fails, but can it be stopped in time for a turnaround? Hopefully, Mr. Musk will refrain from exercising his editing skills and remain a free speech absolutist.  Mr. Musk promised a change. He knew open-minded people are hungry for a fair platform that welcomes all ideas and ignores cancel culture. But despite his best efforts, it seems it will take a miracle to turn Twitter around.  That miracle may be happening, however, now that Tucker Carlson announced he is taking his show to Twitter. This is a brilliant move, especially for a media personality particularly critical of the mainstream media, accusing them of bias and hypocrisy and questioning their commitment to free speech.  Within a few hours of Mr. Carlson’s announcement, his video had already reached an exponentially higher audience than anything in a Fox News leader’s wildest dream. His message about the critical value of free speech, truth-telling, and reporting the news without fear of censorship or editorial interference is a rallying cry bringing people together and surely a topic of discussion in traditional network boardrooms.  It doesn’t cost much to be an independent journalist these days, but it costs a fortune to be a corporate one. Anyone with a smartphone, a web connection and ideas can find an audience. Producing a show for a television network, however, can be expensive due to the need for high-quality production equipment, studios and personnel. And the legal costs are surely prohibitive, because when you exercise free speech, some don’t like what is being said.  As he brings his new show to Twitter, Mr. Carlson and the platform will surely be sued, repeatedly. But the Constitution is on his side. Protecting your free speech rights can cost a lot, especially when defending them in court. McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission wasn’t easy even back in 2014, but it was worth it.  Unlike traditional media outlets, Messrs. Carlson and Musk seem unafraid of the cultural fear of threatened boycotts, legal fees, jury awards, and settlements that cause journalists on the left and the right to think twice about expressing their points of view — and news executives outright preventing it.  News executives see the value of free speech falling below what it costs to be associated with retribution for opinionated or firebrand anchors. Simply put, the constitutional freedom at the heart of all the others costs them too much.  The good news for Mr. Carlson is that Mr. Musk already paid the $44 billion bill.  As traditional legacy media continues to lose credibility the same way Twitter was losing users before Mr. Musk took over, there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon — for Mr. Musk, for Mr. Carlson and for all of us.  Using Twitter to circumvent the restrictions, regulations and obstacles set up by traditional media networks is a genius move — and could be the miracle that saves Twitter. I know I’m going to give Twitter another try.  • Shaun McCutcheon is a free speech advocate, an Alabama-based electrical engineer, the founder of Multipolar, and the successful plaintiff in the 2014 Supreme Court case McCutcheon v. FEC."

The original ’90s trance-inspired single, released back in March on Sony Music, marked the first joint track from Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding in almost a decade, and was accompanied by a futuristic music video set in a desert landscape.  Speaking to Apple Music at the time, Harris said: “I've done the trancey-sounding things before, but I've never been this fast, so it feels good. When I was 14, it was '98, '99 – for me it was kind of [a] formative trance and house era. I thought maybe I'll just try and recreate something that could be from back then.”  Next month, David Guetta will kick off his weekly FUTURE RAVE residency at Hï Ibiza – voted DJ Mag’s number 1 club two years running – taking place every Friday from June 2nd, and featuring Dutch DJ Morten and James Hype for a selection of the dates.

However, it wasn't until April 24 that she gave birth to her first child.  ""This is a new stage for us,"" Aurora, 33, said Thursday, her new son, Waylon, resting in her arms.  ""We've never done the newborn stage before,"" she said. ""It's all new. The lack of sleep is new. All of our kids, when we got them, were old enough they were sleeping through the night, so that’s new. But it’s great. I love it. Definitely gives a whole new purpose.""  Aurora was told at age 16 she would never conceive because she has polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause infertility. Doctors said if she did conceive, she wouldn't be able to carry to full term.  She and her high school sweetheart husband, Justin Aurora, have been together for 16 years. They had accepted they would have to adopt or foster if they wanted to be parents. It just happened sooner than they could have imagined.  Their oldest kids, Justyce, 15, and Jacob, 14, came into their lives when she and Justin were still kids themselves.  Ashlee worked as a nanny in Post Falls when she and Justin were 20. The grandfather of the family told Ashlee he knew of an older couple who needed help raising two young kids and asked if she would meet them. They went to dinner with the family the next day.  ""We met these two little spitfire toddlers who were super shy and quiet,"" Ashlee said.  The children came to the elderly couple, of no relation, from birth parents who were not capable of caring for them. Ashlee and Justin began watching them in 2010, and within a month the siblings were living with them. By 2012, the Auroras had legal guardianship of the siblings, although they still stay in touch with the older woman, who they consider a grandmother.  ""We were still young and doing our own thing,"" Ashlee said. ""I knew at some point I wanted to have kids some way. I always thought it would be cool to go to Indonesia and do a mission trip. But it all just kind of happened. It totally was a God thing. God arranged it how it was supposed to be.""  She credits Justyce and Jacob for jump-starting their adult lives. They went from carefree young adults to grown-ups with the responsibility of caring for little ones who needed them.  ""It changed a lot for us, but totally for the best,"" Ashlee said.  Before long, Bryson came along. He was 7 months old when the Auroras first fostered him. He was in and out with his birth family, but when he landed back in the system, they knew he was meant to be with them.  Bryson, now 10, entered their lives after Ashlee took foster care training.  ""At the end of the class, they tell you how many kids are in foster care, and it broke my heart,"" Ashlee said. ""So we agreed to do foster care. And we ended up with ... a houseful ever since,"" Justin said.  How do they do it?  ""We're broke,"" Justin joked.  He works at Kaiser Aluminum; she works at Children's Village. They have their four children, plus a friend's daughter, Lily, who stays with them throughout the school year, and they provide respite for foster parents. Their doors are always open when a child is in need.  ""We have a lot of support. Our families help us a lot,"" Ashlee said. ""Justyce drives now, so that is really helpful.""  Through years of being adoptive parents to children they adore, the Cataldo couple expected to be empty-nesters by their early 40s.  But, as the saying goes, expect the unexpected.  ""In August, I had the day off and I woke up and I just had this weird feeling I should take a pregnancy test,” Ashlee said.  She convinced herself it was impossible, but when she jumped on social media, the first video she saw had a baby in it. Then the next one.  “I was like, ‘OK God, if there’s four more videos of babies, I’ll take a pregnancy test.’ And the next six videos were all of babies. So I took a pregnancy test,"" she said. ""At that time, I would have only been like three-and-a-half weeks. They all showed up super positive.”  In disbelief, she sent a picture of the pregnancy test to her cousin, with whom she is incredibly close.  “I was like, ‘Is this what I think it is? I think I’m crazy, I don’t know,’ and she was like, ‘Oh my gosh, Ashlee, that’s positive,'"" Ashlee said. ""It took a good two months before I really fully believed it.""  “And how many pregnancy tests?” Justin chimed in with a grin.  ""I took a lot of pregnancy tests,"" she said, smiling back.  Justin admitted he was excited after the initial shock wore off.  ""Mostly because I thought I had it figured out, how the future was going,"" he said.  That first day was rough for both of them. Was this real? Would they miscarry?  ""I've always prayed that I'm thankful I can't conceive if I'm not going to carry,"" Ashlee said. ""Emotionally, I don't know how I would handle that. I've always been stressed about that.""  Ashlee was most excited to tell the big kids, although Justyce knew before her parents knew she knew.  ""She cheated and saw my prenatals (vitamins) in my purse,"" Ashlee said, beaming a smile at Justyce. ""She was a sneaker.""  ""Before that, I saw your pregnancy test,"" Justyce responded, also smiling.  Jacob said he was excited to welcome home a baby brother.  ""I’m a lot older than he is, so it will just be cool,” he said. “It didn’t feel real at first.”  ""At first I was like, that’s so weird,'"" Justyce said. “Then I thought it was really cool. I’m really happy.”  “For now, I’m fine with him,” Bryson said. “He’s going to start crawling and get in my room. The No. 1 thing off limits — my books.”  For Ashlee, foster care is near to her heart. She said she always knew at some point she wanted to adopt through foster care, because she wasn't supposed to be able to have kids.  ""Justin's just really good at going with the flow, and letting me bring lots of kids home,"" she said with a laugh.  Although they have a miraculous new addition, they have been loving parents for a long time. That love will only continue to grow.  ""Our kids are all our kids,"" Ashlee said."

Born at Cedars-Sinai three months premature on Dec. 6, 1945, the infant weighed just 14 ounces. The odds of her survival were 1 in 50,000.  Carol’s doctors provided her with breastmilk via an eyedropper. After a few weeks, the eyedropper was replaced with a feeding tube. The liquid nutrition, coupled with the Jewish hospital’s incubators for preterm infants as well as skilled obstetricians trained in the latest scientific advances, allowed the fragile baby to beat the odds.  Carol not only survived—she thrived. The “miracle baby” grew up in Westwood, graduated from USC with a triple major in English, social services and education and went on to start a family with her husband, David Zaslow. They had two daughters, Tracy and Carrie, both of whom became doctors, crediting their mom for inspiring their respective career paths. Tracy is a primary care sports medicine physician in Los Angeles, and Carrie is an ophthalmologist in New York.  Coinciding with Mother’s Day, Cedars-Sinai recently published an article about their former patient. The medical center said Carol’s long life was centered on family and service. She spent several years as a kindergarten and first grade teacher in the Inglewood Unified School District before becoming a stay-at-home mom. Believing helping others was fundamental to a fulfilling life, she started a D.A.R.E. program at her daughters’ elementary school, served as a Brownie troop leader and was elected to the board of a nonprofit literary arts organization.  In her third act, Carol, an empty nester, became a published children’s author, co-writing an award-winning series of books called “Little Kids do BIG Things.”  Last year, Carol was admitted to Cedars-Sinai for mitral valve regurgitation, a progressive heart-valve disease. She was readmitted several weeks later due to surgical complications. On June 10, 2022, she passed away.  Carol believed happy, healthy kids become compassionate and engaged adults—an outlook that informed her life’s choices. To honor that legacy, while showing appreciation to the hospital that always felt like family, the Zaslows, who are Jewish, recently launched the Carol Zaslow Memorial Fund, which supports pediatric research at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children’s.  As of press time, the campaign had raised more than $170,000 of its $200,000 goal.  “Driven by the idea that investing in children’s health is so critical because they are tomorrow’s adults, and understanding pediatric research has always been underfunded, our family has decided that the Carol Zaslow Memorial Fund will be dedicated to furthering pediatric research to be able to maximally impact lives for generations to come,” the family wrote on Carol’s memorial page.  This past weekend marked Carol’s daughters’ first Mother’s Day without their dearest mom, the woman who at birth defied all medical expectations and went on to live a long and meaningful life. In interviews with Cedars-Sinai, the Zaslows discussed the various ways they remembered Carol, a wife, mother and grandmother.  “Maybe I’ll make her famous lemon Bundt cake, and I definitely will set aside some time to read a book,” Carrie said. “My mom loved to read.”  Tracy’s Mother’s Day plans included being “together with family and sharing our favorite memories of her.” One of those memories involved when Carol was in the hospital last year. “I’ll never forget her radiant smile when her two granddaughters made a surprise visit and showered their grammie with big hugs,” Tracy told Cedars-Sinai.  For Carol’s husband, David, Mother’s Day was an opportunity to reflect on how “blessed [he was] to find such a wonderful, caring, kind woman to be my wife,” he said. “Carol truly was a miracle baby, and that blessing led to our wonderful, very accomplished daughters who were blessed with their own children—our five happy, healthy, bright grandchildren who bring so much joy. The odds were stacked against Carol, but look at the legacy she left.”"

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate  A Houston resident’s recovery after a severe stroke is being described as “a miracle” by his wife and his surgeon.  A Sunday in January that began with lunch out with friends took a turn for the worse later that night when 42-year-old Jeremy Simmons collapsed and fell unconscious in his home.  His wife Laura Simmons called 911 and Jeremy was rushed to HCA Houston Healthcare North Cypress hospital. A CT scan showed he had a stroke, four brain aneurysms and excessive bleeding to the brain.  INSIDER NEWSLETTER: Must-read stories and news to know from the Cy-Fair area  Laura said the only signs before his collapse were a headache and nausea, but they just thought it could be food poisoning.  Jeremy was transported to the hospital’s sister facility, HCA Houston Healthcare Northwest, which has a Level 2 Trauma Center.  Laura said the night was a blur. She worried about the effect an event like this might have on their five-year-old daughter.  “Our entire world just turned upside down in a split second. So, I just really wanted some normalcy for her,” Laura said.  The family tried to keep her routine as normal as possible.  SURPRISE CELEBRATION: Spring-area hospital throws surprise birthday party for 62-year-old recovering from tear in heart artery  “My in-laws obviously came into town and we kept her at school. …She's a very smart and intuitive five-year-old and I didn't want to tell her too much because I don't want to scare her,” Laura said. “She wasn't able to see him for 28 days which was probably the hardest part.”  According to National Institutes of Health, a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a ruptured blood vessel bleeding into the brain.  Neuroendovascular surgeon Dr. Shamaelah Javed, who was on call that day, said what made Jeremy’s case unique from others she’s seen was his relatively young age and the major bleeding.  She said Jeremy had a rare malformation affecting only 1 in 600,000 people, and 70 percent of patients in these cases don’t even make it to the hospital.  “Honestly, I wasn't expecting that he would have such a remarkable recovery,” Javed said. “And all this is basically attributed to the kind of care that he got in the in the hospital along with the treatment we offered.”  Javed said the use of new devices and technology helped throughout the process.  “This is like a miracle because his chances of walking out of the hospital were very long,” she said. “Him surviving was one thing but being disabled—severely disabled—was another fear that I had.  “But he just came back to see me a couple of weeks ago and he's doing very well. He's recovered a lot. So, I think the new treatment modalities that we have has made a huge difference in his recovery.”  After surgery, Javed said most of his aneurysms had healed and bleeding stopped.  “Dr. Javed came to the waiting room and when she said that I just fell the ground, thanking God that he's here and he's going to be ok and we're going to get through this,” Laura said. “We’ve still got a long road ahead of us (but) he has beat all odds and progressing every single day.”  During Jeremy’s time in the ICU, Laura said that she visited 40 days straight, not missing a day to check on her husband. Now, he is undergoing rehabilitation and looks forward to recovering from the traumatic experience.  The Simmons family returned to the hospital Monday for an event honoring stroke patients during Survive Stroke Week. Observed from May 15 through 21, the week is an opportunity to spread awareness of signs and symptoms, and the importance of calling 911 immediately if someone has a stroke.  Javed said that people of all ages should watch out for strokes. She suggested people live a healthy lifestyle and get medical checkups regularly.  Laura urges people to seek treatment immediately if they’re experiencing symptoms.  “If there's something unusual like migraines or numbness to your arms or blurred vision, just don't waste any time. Get to the doctor immediately,” she said. “And obviously, as anybody knows, you're your biggest advocate for yourself and your health. Talk as a family. I had no idea that strokes ran in both sides of this family very strongly and I didn't realize this until he was in the hospital.”  As Jeremy continues to make progress during his recovery process, he looks forward to playing with his daughter, returning to work and golfing in his free time."

The commercial mortgage-backed securities loan from Natixis has been sent to special servicing, ahead of its expected expiration in July, according to data from Trepp and Morningstar Credit Information and Analytics. Onni Group did not respond to a request for comment.  Onni has an option to extend the loan by another year, according to the Morningstar data. However, this option requires the building’s income to be 1.1 times the monthly debt service — a requirement Onni is not currently achieving, therefore triggering the special servicing.  Onni bought the 1 million-square-foot office complex at 5750 Wilshire Boulevard for $630 million in 2019, taking it from the hands of Tishman Speyer. Months later, it scored WeWork as an anchor tenant, occupying about 32 percent of the space — a deal hailed as a win for Onni, given WeWork’s $47 billion valuation at the time.  The same year, Onni negotiated the CMBS loan and a $69.4 million mezzanine loan from Brookfield, according to a report from DBRS Morningstar.  But the timing was inopportune. WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann was ousted as CEO a few months later after a failed attempt to take the company public. By 2022, WeWork had vacated its entire 335,000-square-foot lease.

At the end of 2022, the campus was about 46 percent vacant and the firm reported net cash flow of $20 million — down from $30.2 million when the CMBS loan was issued, according to Morningstar data.  Tenancy at the property, and therefore income, has been a rollercoaster since then.  In January, Sony Pictures signed a deal to lease 225,000 square feet at the building — a major boost for the property.  But three months later, the loan’s special servicer said two major tenants — Media Brands Worldwide and Sky Dance Media — were expected to vacate the property once their respective leases expire later this year. Together, the two had occupied 165,000 square feet of space. Neither company responded to requests for comment.  However, unlike many office owners with floating rate debt, Onni has been feeling less of the pain that has come with rising interest rates, given it purchased a rate cap when it secured the loan in 2019.  Onni has been paying an interest rate of 3.75 percent on the loan since July of last year, loan data shows, coming out to about $1.3 million a month interest or $15.6 million a year."

Danger lurks under the surface.  There have been more than 20 drownings in these Lake Michigan waters since 2010.  In 2013, one drowning was hundreds of yards away from the lake. In fact, this threat to a 6-year-old boy didn’t involve a drop of water. And its unthinkable occurrence astounded the world.  It was a July day on a family outing to the popular beach at Mt. Baldy. a 126-foot dune an hour’s drive from Chicago. The Woessner family made that trip from their home in Sterling, Illinois.  That’s where we found Nathan’s parents, to take us back to that traumatic summer day a decade ago.  “It pretty much started out as a long weekend, camping with friends,” Greg recalled. “There was a trail going up to the top of the dunes.”  Nathan and his friend were following their dads. Suddenly, a panicked call to the dads from the friend who said Nathan disappeared in a hole. Through his initial confusion, there it was: “Plain as day, a round, black hole about 15-18 inches in diameter perfectly round hole right straight down,” Greg said.  Greg could hear Nathan, but couldn’t see him.  “(I) was actually talking with Nathan, he was still down there, you could tell he was worked up, scared. Just pretty much trying to clam him down. We’ll get to you, don’t worry,” Greg said.  But then, seconds later, as Greg and his friend were digging, the hole collapsed.  Nathan’s friend ran down to get help, other dad ran over the dune to the parking lot to a phone to call 911. By then the other boy made it to Nathan’s mom.  “Just by the tone of his voice and his expression, he was just so frightened, and it frightened me,” Faith remembered. “My mind couldn’t grasp or understand and I just remember, ‘no, no, no, no!'”  Together, on their knees, furiously clawing at the sand, the situation was dire.  “I was digging, Greg was digging, we were digging with all of our might, and the sand, it was so unforgiving,” Faith said. “I remember praying, immediately praying, asking God to give him air to breathe, to hold him and I kept repeating that over and over. ‘Hold him, give him air to breathe.'”  Emergency responders arrived. Strangers joined in. With shovels at first — then excavating equipment.  “If you ever dig in sand, you’re never getting anywhere, unless you try to get so big,” Greg said.  A backhoe was brought in — but still no sign of Nathan.  “I remember telling (God), ‘I need him back I need you to give him back to me. I know he’s special but I need him back,’ and it was that same prayer over and over and over,” Faith said.  Agonizingly. The effort stretched on. Greg: “At this point, it’s been so long they were on a recovery mission now, and not a rescue.”  Josh Zimmer was prepared for the worst. He was called upon to bring his bigger backhoe to pick up where the smaller one left off. Together they did the careful work of digging.  “It’s very slow and meticulous,” Zimmer said. “Ryan had a probe which is just a metal rod it’s about 4 foot down probing the ground to see if he could feel something. And then we would do a grid and I would nice and gentle two inches at a time.”  Then, the news finally came. More than three hours later. Nearly 12 feet underground. They reached Nathan after unearthing 400 tons of sand. But as many feared, the outcome was grim. His body was limp and cold. He had no pulse.  “I don’t know if you want to call it a mood but it was quiet and sad and still because nobody knew, he had no vital signs,” Zimmer recalled.  And in that moment of darkness, as Greg and Faith were on their way to the hospital to identify the body, is where the Miracle on Mt. Baldy was revealed; a paramedic noticed a wound on Nathan’s face was bleeding, telling him his heart was still pumping.  “They went into a frenzy suddenly he was back and they were doing everything they could to stabilize him,” Faith said.  “They rushed us over to the hospital,” Greg struggles to find the words, and motions toward his wife. “That’s the point right there in the waiting room, but he came in, right to her, he’s alive.”  Faith replies: “Best words I ever heard.”  Today, Nathan is a student at Unity Christian School in Fulton, where he’s a 16-year-old sophomore.  “Well, I don’t remember much about it,” Nathan offered. “I do remember walking up the hill beside my friend. Next thing I remember is waking up with a bunch of nurses and everyone around me.”  After a week of treatment at Comer Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Nathan bears no sign of his childhood trauma, physically, or emotionally. He’s a stand out athlete on the school’s basketball team. He plays soccer and is a member of the brand new school volleyball team.  What he does have is gratitude.  “God was there and God is the reason I’m still here today,” Nathan said. “I’ll just be casually thinking about something and it’ll come to mind. And it reminds me and gives me hope that there’s a plan and that I’m meant for something.”  “He doesn’t live in a way that’s timid or shy,” said Jackie Hass, one of Nathan’s teachers at Unity Christian School. “He’s very vivacious. He takes what happened to him to really understand that life is an opportunity and a gift and you have to enjoy it every day, because he does!”  “Every experience, every new memory watching him grow, every birthday new sports, new friends,” Nathan’s mom said. “I have really thoroughly enjoyed watching him experience that, it’s not lost on me that we could have just as easily not had that.”  Someone else was changed by that day: Josh Zimmer, who also knew he was part of something bigger than any of them could understand.  ” I just couldn’t go to sleep that night, and I knew God was real,” Zimmer said. “Because He did something I know was impossible.”  That night, he called his family’s pastor and was baptized in the church.  “My in-laws came, they got out of bed, and my wife and the preacher’s wife, yeah it was a life-changing moment.  How did Nathan survive his time buried in the sand?  “There are stories about a dead tree trunk and an air pocket down in the ground, but I think the Lord was with me the whole time. He has a purpose for me and I don’t think my time was then,” Nathan said.  How the void developed in the shifting sands is still being studied, but for everyone involved, there is little doubt about what they witnessed.  “God spoke to me,” Faith said. “He spoke to my heart, ‘I’m giving him back to you he’s a gift to you, I love you,’ it was such an overwhelming feeling of gratitude and awe.”  Greg offered his hard-earned insight: “Slow down and capture and love every moment that you can with your kids, your loved ones.”"

Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana have seen a promising turnaround in their student reading scores after passing a series of similar literacy reforms. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)  NEW ORLEANS (AP) — It’s a cliché that Kymyona Burk heard a little too often: “Thank God for Mississippi.”  As the state’s literacy director, she knew politicians in other states would say it when their reading test scores were down — because at least they weren’t ranked as low as Mississippi. Or Louisiana. Or Alabama.  Lately, the way people talk about those states has started to change. Instead of looking down on the Gulf South, they’re seeing it as a model.  Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022. Louisiana and Alabama, meanwhile, were among only three states to see modest gains in fourth-grade reading during the pandemic, which saw massive learning setbacks in most other states.  The turnaround in these three states has grabbed the attention of educators nationally, showing rapid progress is possible anywhere, even in areas that have struggled for decades with poverty and dismal literacy rates. The states have passed laws adopting similar reforms that emphasize phonics and early screenings for struggling kids.  “In this region, we have decided to go big,” said Burk, now a senior policy fellow at ExcelinEd, a national advocacy group.  These Deep South states were not the first to pass major literacy laws; in fact, much of Mississippi’s legislation was based on a 2002 law in Florida that saw the Sunshine State achieve some of the country’s highest reading scores. The states also still have far to go to make sure every child can read.  But the country has taken notice of what some have called the Mississippi miracle. Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia , Kentucky and Virginia are among the states that have recently adopted some of the same policies. As Mississippi climbed the rankings, the Barksdale Institute, an influential organization in literacy policy in the state, got phone calls from about two dozen states.  The institute’s CEO, Kelly Butler, said she tells them there’s no secret to the strategy.  “We know how to teach reading,” she said. “We just have to do it everywhere.”  All three states have trained thousands of teachers in the so-called science of reading, which refers to the most proven, research-backed methods of teaching reading. They’ve dispatched literacy coaches to help teachers implement that training, especially in low-performing schools.  They also aim to catch problems early. That means screening for signs of reading deficiencies or dyslexia as early as kindergarten , informing parents if a problem is found and giving those kids extra support.  The states have consequences in place if schools don’t teach kids how to read , but also offer help to keep kids on track.  Mississippi, for one, holds students back in third grade if they cannot pass a reading test but also gives them multiple chances to pass after intensive tutoring and summer literacy camps. Alabama will adopt a similar retention policy next school year. It also sent over 30,000 struggling readers to summer literacy camps last year. Half of those students tested at grade level by the end of the summer.  At schools like Schaumburg Elementary, part of the ReNEW charter network in New Orleans, the new training has helped teachers zero in on what students need to read better. The share of kindergarteners reading at grade level at the charter network grew from 38% in December 2021 to 55% this spring; first-graders grew from 19% to 43%.  The state requires every K-3 teacher, elementary principal and assistant principal to take a 55-hour training course in the science of reading. It’s well worth the time, according to Assistant Principal Erika Brown, who said that in college she didn’t learn a thing about teaching kids to read.  “I was winging it,” she said of her early years in teaching.  During a recent session with four second-grade girls, Brown had the girls spell “crib,” asking, “What are the sounds you hear?”  Like a choir, they chanted back four individual sounds, counting them with their fingers: “c-rrr-i-buh.” This was one of the techniques Brown had learned in the training; counting four sounds, or phonemes, gave students a clue that the word had four letters. Increased screening also helped the school identify these girls as needing extra help.  “Are y’all ready for a challenge word?” Brown asked, and the girls shouted, “Yeah!” Their faces fell when Brown revealed the word: bedbug. They had no idea what the word even meant. But with Brown’s gentle guidance, the girls broke down the word into six phonemes. They were even ready for another challenge.  “Can we spell cock-a-roach?” one of the girls asked.  A second-grader in the school, Joshua Lastie, said he likes how his teacher helps him if he trips over a hard word, like “happened” or “suddenly.”  “The school is trying to make the words way easier for kids,” said Joshua, 7.  One challenge that comes with the emphasis on small-group intervention is the strain on scheduling and staffing. Literacy coaches from the state are helping the charter network strategize on how to reach all students. One resource the state can’t provide, says Lisa Giarratano, the chief academic officer at ReNEW, is time.  In a national climate where education debates are often polarizing, the three Gulf states passed their sweeping education reforms with bipartisan support, starting with Mississippi’s in 2013. Louisiana state Rep. Richard Nelson, a Republican who has championed literacy reform, said pointing to laws passed in other Deep South states made it easier for him to introduce legislation and “sell across party lines.”  “Every time I present a bill, I say, ‘Look, Mississippi has very similar challenges to what we have in Louisiana, and they’ve been able to make this work,’” Nelson said.  There is still far to go for children in the Gulf South, especially considering the disruptions to schooling from the pandemic and several major hurricanes and tornadoes. Mississippi, after stellar gains in the 2019 National Assessment of Education Progress , saw reading scores drop in 2022, although they are still at the national average. Around two out of five Louisiana third-graders, a particularly hard-hit age group , could not read at grade level at the end of last year. The same goes for over one-fifth of third-graders in Alabama.  Still, evidence suggests these states have made promising gains for low-income kids in particular. In 2019, Alabama ranked 49th in NAEP reading scores for low-income fourth-graders; in 2022, it ranked 27th. Amid the pandemic that saw most states lose ground, Louisiana soared from 42nd to 11th. Mississippi ranks second-highest in the country, after Florida.  Alabama’s state superintendent of education, Eric Mackey, says he has confidence in the reforms — in part because they’ve worked before. Alabama invested heavily in training on the science of reading, then known as phonics, in the early 2000s, and scores rose. Then the Great Recession hit, teachers and literacy coaches got laid off, and the state lost its gains.  Alabama has learned its lesson, Mackey said.  “We have to break that cycle of generational poverty. One of the best ways to do that is to make multiple generations of readers,” Mackey said. “This is something that we have to be in for the long haul.”  ___  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

(NewsNation) — The Vatican is now investigating an extraordinary event that allegedly took place during a mass at a Roman Catholic Church in Thomaston back in March, leaving the faithful in awe.  Rev. Joseph Crowley, the head of the St. Maximilian Kolbe Parish, was leading Mass at St. Thomas Church in Thomaston when he reported the wafers distributed during Communion multiplied inside the ciborium, which is the container used to hold the wafers, also referred to as Communion host.  “God duplicated himself in this moment. Very powerful, very awesome, very real, very shocking. But also, it happens,” Crowley said.  A parishioner who was assisting with distributing the Communion wafers allegedly reported that there was a shortage of hosts. However, they then found there were plenty of wafers remaining.  Now, the alleged event is being investigated as a possible “miracle” by the Vatican.  Although the multiplication of communion wafers may seem relatively inconsequential, it holds great significance for Catholics.  In the 21st century, only four eucharistic miracles have been recognized throughout the world, according to Magis Center.  The Eucharist, or Communion, is considered the holiest sacrament in the Catholic faith. Catholics believe the bread and wine become the literal body and blood of Jesus Christ during the blessing, rather than mere symbols of his presence.  The news quickly reached the Archdiocese of Hartford, prompting an investigation to determine whether a genuine miracle had occurred within the church.  Now, the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Doctrine of Faith, the entity responsible for safeguarding the Catholic faith worldwide, has been alerted and has initiated its own investigation into the matter.  The alleged miracle at St. Thomas Church has a special connection to the late Father Michael McGivney, the founder of the Knights of Columbus. He spent the final years of his clerical career at St. Thomas Church and is just one more verified miracle away from final consideration for sainthood.  If McGivney were to be canonized, he would become the first man born in the United States ever to be elevated to sainthood.  The Catholic Church has a meticulous process for verifying miracles. The Vatican’s investigation is expected to take approximately two weeks.  Regardless of the outcome of the investigation, the reported miracle has reignited debates about faith, miracles and the supernatural.  Devan Markham contributed to this report."

As the Holy See, aided by the Archdiocese of Hartford, investigates the case, parishioners are hoping that church officials eventually recognize the miracle as the genuine article.  “We’re all waiting in suspense for word from Rome,” congregant James Clark, 51, told the Post on Monday. “I believe in my heart that it’s real, but obviously you need confirmation before you can say with absolute certainty that a miracle occurred.  “It’s just so heartening to know that God’s children haven’t gotten so spiritually bereft to where He still won’t give us a sign every now and then, a little nibble, to bring us back to f"

(WBTV/Gray News) - Three people are dead after a truck fleeing law enforcement crashed into a home in Shelby, North Carolina, on Sunday, WBTV reports.  The incident started in Blacksburg, South Carolina, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office.  According to deputies, dispatch received a call Sunday around 12:55 a.m. that a white pickup was following and shooting into the caller’s Dodge Charger.  After the chase reached North Carolina, the 911 call was transferred around 1:07 a.m. to the Cleveland County dispatch center.  Deputies from Cleveland County say they tried to stop the suspects, but the truck fled by running a red light and headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and turned off the headlights.  According to deputies, they lost sight of the truck momentarily but found it crashed into the home.  The pickup driver allegedly fled from deputies by running a red light. The truck headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and the headlights were turned off before crashing into a house.  The homeowner said that after nearly 50 years of living in the home on Suttle Street, he’s glad to still have his life. Others in the neighborhood said the incident was unlike anything they’ve ever seen.  “What I see is a lot of destruction and a lot of craziness,” neighbor Franklin Batten said. “I never seen bodies before or people die in an accident like this before. I never witnessed it in my life.”  Officials with the Shelby Police Department said six men were in the car at the time, five between the ages of 15 and 20.  Officers say three of the men have died, three were taken to the hospital and one was released.  No one in the car that was being chased was hurt.  “Given the relentlessness with which these suspects pursued and shot at the victims, it is a miracle that no one in the victims’ car was injured. I am proud of the joint effort between all the involved agencies to work through this investigation,” Cleveland County Sheriff Alan Norman said.  Copyright 2023 WBTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

The UKLASH Eyelash Serum, £37.99 here , has been praised for giving users longer, fuller eyelashes, and Molly-Mae was keen to try out the product for herself. In a YouTube video posted on Thursday, the influencer talked through some of her upcoming beauty journeys, including whitening her teeth and trying out the UKLASH serum.  Molly-Mae said: ""Another thing that I've also been trying, I've seen so many girls on TikTok and YouTube and all over the place talking about their lash growth journey"". Molly-Mae revealed that her eyelashes were affected during her pregnancy, admitting a combination of the postpartum hair loss and rubbing her eyes caused them to thin and shorten.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube) (Image: UKLASH)  Molly-Mae told her viewers: ""My lashes were definitely one thing that took a hit through my pregnancy. I also have a really bad habit of rubbing my eyes a lot.  ""My lashes over the last few months and over my pregnancy have really thinned out, so I bought UKLASH. Which I've heard literally works miracles for growing your lashes.""  The lash serum has been lauded as a miracle worker for helping revive short, thin, or sparse eyelashes, and helping them become thicker and fuller, with users typically seeing results in 8-12 weeks. Consistency is the key to seeing results, with UKLASH recommending you apply the serum every night to get the results you want.  During her YouTube video, Molly-Mae confessed that she struggles to remember to do something every day. The former Love Island star said: “I’ve only just started using this, I’ve only done like three nights of applying it, then I actually missed a night. If there’s something that needs to be done every day, don’t count on me to do it…I guarantee even if I put it beside my bed I’ll forget, but I’m going to try not to because I really want to see an improvement with my lashes.”  The UKLASH Serum contains biotin peptides which are vital for healthy hair growth and Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 which stimulates keratin growth. It also contains green tea extract, which helps to grow long fluttery lashes, and vitamin B5 which smooths, conditions and supports your lashes to make them look thicker and healthier.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube)  To use the serum, first make sure you’ve removed all your makeup using an oil-free cleanser, then apply a single swipe of the serum along your lashline, just like you would when applying eyeliner. The UKLASH website suggests that a single dip of the product should be enough to cover both eyelashes, then leave the product to work overnight.  There’s even a money back guarantee if you don’t see results within 12 weeks of proper use, so if you’re sceptical about it working, you know you won’t be out of pocket if you don’t see any results.

The deer was found fatally wounded after being hit by a car. A game warden arrived and shot the deer in the head to try and end the animal’s suffering.  ""That’s part of their job,"" said Glen Bryant, President of All Things Wild Rehabilitation. ""You wouldn’t want someone that is in bad shape to be left on oxygen just to keep them around if they’re in a lot of pain. It’s the same way for the animal. They’re here to do what’s best for the animal.""  However, when rescuers arrived the injured deer was still alive. It managed to survive getting hit by a car and being shot. Then, the wildlife group noticed movement in the deer’s belly. The nearly dead deer was pregnant.

Moments before the doe’s death, crews performed an emergency C-section and pulled two fawns from her body.  ""It makes you really proud,"" said Foxworth. ""It makes your heart smile and bring a tear to your eyes to know that you did something good in this crazy world.""  All Things Wild plans to care for the fawns until they reach a safe age to be released into the wild.  ""It was a miracle that they survived,"" said Scott.

The close game came to an end after Notre Dame gained draw control in the seconds to remain, stripping UF of any chance to pull off a miracle.  The No. 6 Florida Gators (17-4, 5-1 AAC) lost to the No. 8 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (15-5, 6-3 ACC) 16-15 Sunday in the National Collegiate Athletics Association Women’s Lacrosse Championship tournament.  “To play a team like that, who is so good, you need to play a full 60 minute game,” Florida head coach Amanda O’Leary said.  Notre Dame scored the first goal of the game after gaining draw control. However, the Gators quickly showed their opponent this would be a close matchup and scored three consecutive goals in the minutes that followed.  Florida senior Emily Heller scored the first goal for UF in the 11th minute. Following was a goal from Gators junior Ashley Gonzalez fed by her teammate junior Maggi Hall. The third goal was from Florida sophomore Emma LoPinto. UF took an early 3-2 advantage through the first period.

Kiwior has impressed having come into the starting lineup to replace Rob Holding in recent weeks, as William Saliba remains on the sidelines through injury.  The £21m centre-back went down holding his foot after his boot came off under the challenge of Brighton’s Evan Ferguson, before a cross was delivered right over Kiwior’s head to allow Enciso to easily nod past Aaron Ramsdale.  Deniz Undav and Pervis Estupinan added to the Seagull’s lead to give them a convincing and deserved 3-0 win and leave the Gunners needing a miracle to claim the title over Manchester City, who are now four points clear with a game in hand.  After the defeat, Micah Richards attempted to defend Kiwior before Keane dismissed his fellow pundit’s thoughts in typically brutal style: “You talk about putting your body on the line, last-ditch defending and stuff, you don’t stay down like that. Micah, his boot came off, his foot didn’t come off.”  The Poland international explained after the game: “I felt contact and lost my boot and didn’t even see the goal. I hoped VAR would intervene and chalk off the goal, but unfortunately, the ref saw it differently.  “After we conceded the second our heads dropped and we couldn’t come back,” he added.  READ MORE: Arsenal taught £77m lesson by brilliant Brighton and De Zerbi as title finally slips from Arteta’s grasp  Gary Neville weighed in on commentary, claiming Kiwior just had to “stand up” whether he thought he was fouled or not.  He said: “Kiwior is injured but the fact that he was injured, I mean… He goes down holding his ankle and left Arsenal short in the middle of the box.  “He goes down. Can he not just – I’m scared of saying it… And I’m sure the lads in the studio, Roy [Keane] and Patrick [Viera], might be thinking it and have a bit more to say.  Story continues  “If you’re injured you’re injured. But as a centre half, surely you just have to stand up and let the attack finish?”  Jamie Carragher took to Twitter to label the moment embarraassing.  He wrote: ‘It was a embarrassing Kiwior stayed down whether it was a foul or not (it wasn’t) there was very little wrong with him.

Photograph: BCCI  IPL 2023 has been a roller coaster ride with nail-biting finishes and heart-stopping moments, but Sunday's doubleheaders were a snooze-fest.  CSK fans must have clung to their seats hoping for a miracle from their beloved Thala to pull off a master-stroke, but alas, it was not meant to be.  Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh continued their brilliant run of form as they pulled off one of the surprise results of the season to breach fortress Chepauk, with the Kolkata Knight Riders defeating Chennai Super Kings by six wickets.  Chasing 145, KKR lost three quick wickets in the Powerplay with Deepak Chahar taking three wickets, dismissing Rahmunllah Gurbaz, Jason Roy and Venkatesh Iyer, before the CSK spin attack even came into the game.  Kolkata looked in trouble at 33-3, but the left-handed pair Rinku and Rana put on a hall of fame display on how to play spin at Chepauk with a 99-run partnership to take their side home with nine balls to spare.  IMAGE: Rinku Singh celebrates his half century. Photograph: BCCI  Rana remained unbeaten with 57 off 44 balls while Rinku scored a 43-ball 54. This was the highest fourth wicket partnership in the IPL at the M A Chidambaram stadium.  The match will be remembered for RR's outstanding performance, which showcased how to play spin in challenging conditions and keep the pressure on a formidable opponent.  IMAGE: Nitish Rana slammed the winning runs. Photograph: BCCI  Initially, Rinku was the aggressor, but Rana picked up pace and extinguished any hope of CSK defending the total. Rana made the most of a dropped catch on 18 by Matheesha Pathirana in the deep to reach his fifty and stood firm to hit the winning runs.  Rinku, who became an IPL sensation with his five sixes off the last five balls against the Gujarat Titans to conjure up a miracle win for Kolkata last month, struck another fifty of the season before being run out. He was eventually awarded the player of the match."
