While the international man of debauchery’s client list may never be revealed, Epstein’s old emails and calendar contain plenty of information to raise eyebrows about some of the most wealthy and well-known socialites.  One of the biggest names in Epstein’s rolodex is the prolific philanthropist and megabillionaire Bill Gates. No longer just known for his computer programming savvy and lectures on greenhouse gases, Mr. Gates’ personal acquaintances are starting to peek through thanks to the investigative work of the Wall Street Journal.  Never forget when Bill Gates was asked if he learned a lesson from being pals with Jeffrey Epstein: “Well, he’s dead.” pic.twitter.com/iNlBZ60jv7 — Ashley St. Clair (@stclairashley) May 22, 2023  He Knows What You Did  The Wall Street Journal reported that Jeffrey Epstein allegedly had found out about an affair Bill Gates had with a Russian bridge player and then used this knowledge to blackmail the Microsoft figurehead. Gates reportedly met the woman in question, Mila Antonova, in 2010 at a bridge tournament.  Ms. Antonova met Mr. Epstein later in 2013, and a relationship of some sort was spawned.  RELATED: Jeffrey Epstein’s Calendar Shows Overall Acceptance of Debauchery By the Elite  Mr. Epstein was kind enough to pay for her software coding school and also paid for the apartment she lived in while attending school. Fast forward to 2017, and Mr. Epstein solicited Mr. Gates to reimburse him for Ms. Antonova’s school, alluding to his knowledge of their card game indiscretions.  Mr. Gates’ communications team has become quite adept at responding to Epstein news, releasing the following statement this round:  “Mr. Gates met with Epstein solely for philanthropic purposes. Having failed repeatedly to draw Mr. Gates beyond these matters, Epstein tried unsuccessfully to leverage a past relationship to threaten Mr. Gates.”  Epstein isn’t even alive anymore and he’s still getting the elite to cop to affairs? Impressive.  Never forget that Bill Gates was asked in an interview if he thinks his ex-wife Melinda was warning him about Jeffrey Epstein “sexually compromising” him. His response: “No — I had dinner with him, and that’s all.” pic.twitter.com/K6b2jYerIU — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx) May 22, 2023  So Many Calendar Invites  Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein more than half a dozen times in 2011. He also had dinners at Mr. Epstein’s townhome and even flew on his private plane in 2013 to Florida.  It makes you wonder what Mr. Gates did to offset the greenhouse gas footprint from that flight, but I digress. It’s important to remember that Mr. Epstein had registered as a sex offender in 2008 after soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution.  While Mr. Gates has mentioned numerous times that he laments ever having met with Jeffrey Epstein, given what type of a monster this man was, it’s hard to believe a man of Bill’s means was unaware of the caliber of man he was spending so much time with.  RELATED: Lawyer for El Chapo and Jeffrey Epstein Now a Ranchera Singer Who Goes by ‘The Attorney’  In other interesting meetings Mr. Gates held with Mr. Epstein was with the Nobel Peace Prize committee chair Thorbjorn Jagland in 2013. This meeting happened shortly after Mr. Epstein bragged to a Gates employee that he knew “the Norwegians” and could help Bill win a Nobel Peace Prize.  Just contemplate that the next time you hear Bill Gates lecture about the need to cut down your energy footprint to save the world.  Jeffrey Epstein threatened to expose Bill Gates’ 2010 affair with a Russian bridge player if he didn’t participate in a $ billion charitable fund, according to a new bombshell report. Couldn’t happen to a nicer man! — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) May 21, 2023  Is This How It Works?  What needs to be getting more attention is the amorous card player Mila Antonova. How did this woman get her apartment and schooling paid for without wondering why?  Ms. Antonova claimed she had no idea about Mr. Epstein’s background, telling the Wall Street Journal:  “I had no idea that he was a criminal or had any ulterior motive. I just thought he was a successful businessman and wanted to help.”  The long pause after Jim Caviezal says, Epstein island isn’t the only island is like a gut punch pic.twitter.com/tEAn7P6eek — Karli Bonne’ (@KarliBonnita) May 20, 2023  Because that seems plausible, there are so many crazy rich dudes running around wanting to just help out individual women with no other goal than to give back… give me a break!  She went on to claim:  “Epstein agreed to pay and he paid directly to the school. Nothing was exchanged. I don’t know why he did that. When I asked, he said something like, he was wealthy and wanted to help people when he could.”  If there are any stupid rich dudes out there just looking to help someone out where they can, I’ve got some dreams of my own that I’d be happy to cash in on for nothing in return.  RELATED: Report: Shotgun Found 30 Feet From Body of Epstein-Linked Clinton Aid Whose Death Was Ruled a Suicide  The Web They Weave  After the news broke, presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy wrote:  “I’ll release the full Epstein client list without apology. The administrative-police state should stop protecting its chief sponsors while weaponizing itself against its opponents. The first step to fix corruption is to see it.”  I’ll release the full Epstein client list without apology. The administrative-police state should stop protecting its chief sponsors while weaponizing itself against its opponents. The first step to fix corruption is to see it. https://t.co/oZ7z2EIQDo — Vivek Ramaswamy (@VivekGRamaswamy) May 21, 2023  While we’d all love to see the client list, it’s possible Vivek just destroyed his chances of being elected President of the United States. In fact, we should make sure we see proof of life for Vivek in the near future.  After all, it’s been three years since Mr. Epstein’s “suicide,” and we still don’t have the Justice Departments Inspector General’s report on the investigation of his death. Weird, perhaps it’s lost somewhere with the JFK assassination files and the Roswell UFO evidence.  Is there hope that any real justice will be levied for the women used and abused by Mr. Epstein at the whims of the world’s most powerful and influential? Maybe.  Deutsche Bank just settled a $75 million lawsuit alleging that the bank knowingly benefited from Epstein’s endeavors. Additionally, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to be deposed in two civil cases that allege the same.  The filing for the cases states:  “JP Morgan’s relationship with Epstein in allowing his sex-trafficking venture to access large sums of cash each year went far beyond a normal (and lawful) banking relationship.”  None of us with common sense thinks these banks and wealthy movers and shakers were ignorant of what type of man Epstein was and what he was doing. Perhaps someday, some of them will pay for it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vbWFkcmFzdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9qZWZmcmV5LWVwc3RlaW4tZW1haWxzLWluZGljYXRlLWF0dGVtcHQtdG8tYmxhY2ttYWlsLWJpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtb3Zlci1hZmZhaXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Your primary job is to run toward dangerous situations to keep the public safe which often requires putting your own life on the line. It also puts you face-to-face with situations that can be gruesome and hard to witness. For example, the aftermath of a serious car accident or a shooting. While it may be easy to say that's what they train for and they knew the possibilities, at the end of the day they are still human beings, and no matter who you are, witnessing events like those can weigh heavy on their minds for the rest of their lives.

"political assassination","2019-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Nagpur"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-23T15:47:33","Vidya Bharati schools across the country use false claims, cultural indoctrination and consistent anti-Muslim rhetoric to instil Hindutva ideology in young minds.  Astha Savyasachi  New Delhi, May 23 (KMS): It was time. Everything was ready for the biggest function in the school – a grand stage, a hall decorated with magnificent lighting, jam packed audience seats, and high-profile chief guests: Union minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda, Puducherry governor Kiran Bedi and several ministers from Karnataka.  And then the curtains were up.  At least 100 students – most of them from Class 11 and 12 – dressed in white shirts, white pants and saffron dhotis, some carrying saffron flags, ran towards the centre of the stage where a huge poster of the Babri Masjid was placed. That’s when the narrator announced (in Kannada) on a loudspeaker, “They demolish the structure with anything they can get their hands on. With enthusiasm, Hanuman bhakts, with Hanuman’s anger, demolish the Babri structure.” As the narrator, the students on the stage and the audience cheered in excitement — ‘Bolo Shri Ramachandra ki Jai! Bajrang Bali ji jai, Bharat Mata ki, Jai!’ – the poster of the Babri Masjid was torn down.  This was the School Day function at Sri Rama Vidya Kendra High School located in Kalladka, Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. On December 15, 2019 – around a month after the Supreme Court ruling which called the demolition of the Babri Masjid a ‘violation of law’ – the students of this school were made to enact the demolition. The school is owned by a powerful RSS leader from Karnataka, Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who defended the play in front of the media: “It is not a mosque. It is just a building. It is a historical event that we are depicting… Who are Babur’s children? We are not against Muslims. We are against terrorists. The play was done to show historical events and what is the problem with it.” Bhat is also known as one of the political mentors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  This was not the first time that a school run by the RSS was accused of indoctrinating its students with Islamophobia and other undemocratic, unconstitutional and intolerant beliefs.  Bhonsala Military School (BMS) in Nagpur has been linked to various attacks by Hindu extremists in the recent past. During the investigation into the 2008 Malegaon blasts and 2006 Nanded bomb blast case, Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) found — (1) training camps were organised in BMS where several terror-accused were trained, and (2) meetings, to plan the bombings, were held in BMS between the accused, senior RSS leaders and their affiliates. According to an Outlook article on the Maharashtra Military Foundation, Pune — run by Lt Col (Retd) Jayant Chitale — the school’s visitor’s book, which also preserves the names of all the men trained on campus, revealed that Shrikant Prasad Purohit, who later became an accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case, was also enrolled there.  The past, the present  Under the leadership of M.S. Golwalkar, in the year 1946, the RSS established its first school in Kurukshetra named Gita School. But the ban on the RSS, soon after the assassination of M.K. Gandhi by Nathuram Godse in 1948, put a roadblock on the expansion of the Gita School model. After the ban was lifted, in the year 1952, RSS leaders Krishna Chandra Gandhi, Bhaurao Deoras and Nanaji Deshmukh together laid the foundation stone of India’s first Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, in a building rented at a monthly rent of Rs 5.  With time, such schools began to be established across several locations in Uttar Pradesh. To manage and coordinate their functioning, a state-level Shishu Shiksha Prabandak Samiti was set up. Later on, with the expansion of these schools to other states, such committees were also set up in Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Similarly, Sarvhitkari Shiksha Samiti was established in Punjab and Chandigarh while Haryana had a Hindu Shiksha Samiti.  In the year 1977, an apex all-India body named Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan (Vidya Bharati) was formed to coordinate the activities between these state committees and administer all the schools run by the RSS across the country. The registered office of Vidya Bharati was in Lucknow, while the functional headquarters were in Delhi. In their book titled RSS, School Texts and the Murder of Mahatma Gandhi: The Hindu Communal Project, Professors Aditya Mukherjee, Mridula Mukherjee and Sucheta Mahajan highlight that by the time this body was formed, “there were already about 500 RSS schools in the country with around 20,000 students enrolled in them”.  Their book explains the trajectory of expansion of Vidya Bharati schools:  “In the early 1990s the BJP governments in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh encouraged the growth of Vidya Bharati schools and even permitted them to set their own syllabus and conduct examinations for the lower classes and run teacher training programmes. By 1993–94 the total number of schools run by Vidya Bharati was claimed to be 6,000 with 40,000 teachers and 1,200,000 students. With state power coming to the BJP at the centre in 1998, the RSS influence in schools took a quantum leap. In 1999, there were reportedly 14,000 Vidya Bharati schools with 80,000 teachers and 1,800,000 students… In September 1998, the Kalyan Singh government sought to link all state run schools to the RSS shakha. It was made compulsory for all primary schools in the state to involve RSS pracharaks for imparting Naitik Shiksha or moral education.”  According to Vidya Bharati’s official website, it currently runs 12,828 formal schools across India with more than 3.4 million students enrolled in these schools. It also runs more than 6,400 informal education centres by the name ‘Sanskar Kendras’. The website clearly defines the ‘Mission’ of Vidya Bharati: “To develop a National System of Education which would help building a generation of young men and women that is committed to Hindutva and infused with patriotic fervour; physically, vitally, mentally and spiritually fully developed; capable of successfully facing challenges of life; dedicated to the service of those of our brothers and sisters who dwell in villages, forests, caves and slums; and are deprived and destitute, so that they are liberated from the shackles of social evils and injustice and thus devoted, may contribute to build up a harmonious, prosperous, and culturally rich Nation [emphasis added].”  The Wire looked into the Vidya Bharati schools and their curriculum, which look designed to promote communal hatred and produce RSS footsoldiers. What follows was revealed from their books, their curriculum and interviews with students and alumni of RSS-run schools in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.  From Vidya Bharati textbooks  “Name the young scientist of Kanpur who invented the Jyoti lamp which burns with cow urine.” – Here’s one of the questions from Bodhmala 5, a book series taught in Vidya Bharati schools.  Vidya Bharti Sanskriti Shiksha Sansthan (VBSSS), headquartered in Kurukshetra, Haryana, publishes a book series named Bodhmala for Classes 4 to 12. Books in this series discuss diverse subjects/topics – history, geography, politics, personalities, martyrs, morals, festivals (only Hindu ones), religious books, science, general knowledge and much more. With no dedicated subject teacher, the students are expected to read these books on their own. However, on the basis of these books, a Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha (All India Culture Examination) is conducted across the country wherein the students scoring more than 50% are given certificates. Students from outside of Vidya Bharati schools also appear in the exam. The Wire learned in its interviews that there have been instances where students from government schools too appeared for the Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha – though this was a choice made by the individual students and not by the schools.  A deep study of the Bodhmala series reveals that by glorifying Hinduism, projecting it as the only religion in India and attaching an inflated sense of pride to it, all of these books instil the ideology of Hindutva into young minds. The book by Mukherjees and Mahajan writes about the Bodhmala series, “The Vidya Bharati Sansthan claims to be engaged in providing to the young generation education in religion, culture and nationalism. The catechistic series is part of Sansthan’s effort in this direction… Much of the material in these books is designed to promote blatantly communal and chauvinist ideas, and popularise RSS and its policies and programmes.”  National chauvinism and Hindu supremacy  These books make unabashed efforts to gradually suffuse the concept of Hindu supremacy into the minds of students. Every textbook in the Bodhmala series ensures that it fulfils the purpose of (1) establishing India as the origin of all civilisations that have ever existed; (2) referring to the Hindu Sanatan religion as the supreme religion of India by either negating the existence of other religions or by appropriating them; and (3) belittling and ridiculing other nations, their cultures and history. For instance, Bodhmala 8 claims, “Hindu culture is like a deep ocean in which different ideas merge into one. Different cultures and civilizations were born in the world, but today they do not even have a name’ and ‘All human beings originate from India.”  Bodhmala 9 cites a poem —  जब धरती पर घोर जंगली मानव ही बसते थे,  वस्त्र पहनना नहीं जानते, पशुवत ही फिरते थे,  भाषा हीन विचारहीन होकर बात संकेतों से करते…  हिमसागर की पुण्य भूमि पर प्रथम मनुष्य प्रकट हुआ  (When only wild humans used to live on the earth  (They) did not know how to wear clothes, used to roam like animals  Without any language, without any thoughts, talking with signs…  The first man appeared on the holy land of Himsagar)  These books speak in rhetoric, often making unverified, unsupported and illogical claims. Bodhmala 9 says, “Symbols of Hindu culture are inscribed on Greek coins. San Agustin, the holy city of Colombia is named after Rishi Agastya. Legend of Karna is popular in Babylon, the Caspian Sea is the land of Kashyap… There has been an indelible influence of India on the literary tradition and poetry of Malaya and Java. Ramayana is the national book of Shyam Desh. The old name of Iran is Aryaan. The scriptures of the Parsis said — We offer sacrifices to the works of the Aryans.”  The content is filled with false claims with no supporting evidence. For example, Bodhmala 6 states, “This universe has been created from the supreme conscious element ‘Brahma’… Many cultures of the world have originated from this beautiful land of India. It has been an inspiration for mankind all over the earth.” The research by Mukherjees and Mahajan notes the examples mentioned to describe the ‘spread of the light of Aryatva by Bharatiya Manishis’ – “The credit for lighting the lamp of culture in China goes to the ancient Indians. India is the mother country of ancient China. Their ancestors were Indian kshatriyas….The first people who began to inhabit China were Indians. The first people to settle in Iran were Indians (Aryans). The popularity of the great work of the Aryans—Valmiki Ramayana—influenced Yunan (Greece) and there also the great poet Homer composed a version of the Ramayana. The Languages of the indigenous people(Red Indians) of the northern part of America were derived from ancient Indian languages.”  In the year 2005, a committee was set up under the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) of the Ministry of Human Resources Development to discuss the ‘Regulatory Mechanisms for Textbooks and Parallel Textbooks taught in Schools outside the Government System’. It was asked to study and report on both textbooks used in government schools not following the CBSE syllabus, as well as books used in non-government schools, including those run by religious and social organisations. Many experts from different states, various governmental and non-governmental organisations, educational institutions and concerned citizens all over India were brought into the process and gave their suggestions to the committee.  In its report, the committee made stern observations about the textbooks used in schools run by the RSS:  “The textual materials greatly exaggerate ancient India’s achievements without any of the factual and empirical substantiation required to make that case. They also echo the Hindutva chauvinist narratives that present the country as a victim of repeated foreign aggressions and invasions, especially by Muslim rulers. All past achievements are referred back to the ancient pre-Islamic era. The landscape is bereft of all Muslim or Christian cultural or religious presence. History is shown to develop around a single axis, which bifurcates Indian people into true Indians and aliens, as Hindus and others, as victims and tyrants, as invaders and vanquished. The fact that India has since ancient times been a multicultural, multi-religious, syncretic society has not been emphasised sufficiently thus manipulating the future generation into a pattern of narrow-minded and intolerant thinking.”  ‘Akhand Bharat’  The classroom and corridor walls of Vidya Bharati schools are decorated with glossy maps and large graffiti depicting Bharat Mata, as a woman clad in a saffron sari holding the saffron flag – a symbol of Hindutva – accompanied by a lion. Behind her is a map of ‘Akhand Bharat’, the RSS ideal of an undivided India, often referred to as ‘Vrihattara Bharat’, or greater India, which posits that modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were once a part of India. Many students confirmed that August 14 is celebrated in RSS schools as Akhand Bharat Diwas since RSS believes that it was till August 14, 1947 that India was undivided. Tilak Pal Singh Baghel, an alumnus (2003-05) of Saraswati Shishu Vidhya Mandir, Bhander – a school run by the RSS in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh – told The Wire, “They laid more importance on August 14 than August 15 [Independence Day].”  The curriculum also makes many mentions of an ‘Akhand Bharat’. Bodhmala books mention the ‘ancient names’ of various countries – Moy (Mexico), Aryan/Parshu-desh (Iran), Upaganasthan (Afghanistan), Lava deep (Laos), Varun Dweep (Borneo), Shyam Desh (Thailand), Champa Desh (Vietnam), Brahma Desh (Myanmar), and Malay Dweep (Malaysia). Bodhmala 5 emphasises that “the division of Akhand Bharat engineered by the enemies is getting manifested in our thoughts” and appeals to the students, “We have to make a pledge that we will restore the Akhand Bharat that we worship.”  Tilak, who works in a multinational company while pursuing his interest in anthropology on the side, said, “‘Our school used to organise essay competitions. Usually, the topics given were reflective of the ideology of Hindutva and Akhand Bharat. I remember in one of the competitions, I got the topic ‘Akhand Bharat ki parikalpana aur us mein Hindutva ka sthan (The concept of Akhand Bharat and the relevance of Hindutva in it).”  For the books used in Vidya Bharati schools in Bihar, the CABE report observed, “They mention that on ‘achieving worthy ‘sanskar’, people began to be called Aryans… and they travelled east and south to spread Vedic culture.” Similarly, on the books used in Uttar Pradesh, the report commented, “The existence of Bharat as one nation in the modern sense of ‘nation’ is projected into the ancient past repeatedly to fill the child’s consciousness with racial national pride.”  Along with the Bodhmala series, VBSSS also publishes guidebooks for teachers – Praveshika (Elementary), Madhyama (Middle) and Uttama (Senior). These books too push the idea of an Akhand Bharat, “…New history proves that today’s independent countries like Trivishtapa (Tibet), Upaganasthan (Afghanistan), Brahmadesh (Myanmar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka) and Kingpurush (Nepal) had once been part of undivided India.”  ‘Hindu Rashtra’  हर बाला देवी की प्रतिमा बच्चा बच्चा राम है  हर शरीर मन्दिर सा पावन है  गाय जहाँ माँ प्यारी है  इसके सैनिक समरभूमि पर गाया करते गीता थे  These lines from Bodhmala 4 construct in young minds an image of India being a Hindu nation by using religious symbols and concepts from Hinduism – Devi, Ram, Temple, Cow and Bhagwad Gita – to describe the nation as a whole. In its very first paragraph, these lines mention India, “The holy mountains, holy rivers, many pilgrimages, temples and gurudwaras were built here from time to time, seeing which we are still holy and blessed.”  Like Bodhmala, Itihas Ga Raha Hai (IGRH) is also a series of supplementary textbooks taught in Vidya Bharati schools. The CABE report made an important observation on the IGRH series taught in Chhattisgarh, “One of the central planks of the RSS is the equation of ‘holyland’ with ‘motherland’– and the claim that because Muslims and Christians have their Meccas elsewhere, they are not fully loyal to the country. The text exhorts children to remember who they are so as not to become slaves again and asks rhetorically, ‘Whose is this country? Whose motherland, fatherland and holyland is it? Whose customs and festivals are celebrated according to the agricultural rhythms and climate of this land? Which people call Sivaji, Rana Pratap, Chandragupta, Bhagwan Ram, Krishna, Dayanand their great leaders?’ (The implication clearly is that festivals like Eid and Christmas are not locally rooted)… The books refer constantly to ‘Mother India’ from whose womb many brave sons were born, who worshipped her and died for her, with the Gita in their hands and Vande Mataram on their lips.”  Who is a Hindu?  The books clearly define ‘Who is a Hindu?’ and add that Hindutva is the “ideal ideology” and the “need of the hour”.  Bodhmala for Class 10 has a separate topic titled ‘Hindu kaun?’ The content explains (in Hindi), “While defining Hindutva, Dr Radhakrishnan said that Hindutva is a way of life, a flow that leads to smooth life and prosperity, a tradition and an ideal that thinks of the welfare of everyone, from humans to animals, birds and all parts of nature” and adds, “Hindutva is the only power that can bring peace to the whole world, happiness and prosperity to mankind. It is the need of the hour. It is an ideal lifestyle which teaches a man to live as a human being…It is not right to consider Hinduism [the text subtly changes ‘हिंदुत्व’ to ‘हिन्दू धर्म’ ] as a communal word.” The theory given by Savarkar in a pamphlet named “Essentials of Hindutva” – which was retitled “Hindutva: Who is Hindu” and reprinted in 1928 – is iterated in the book, “Every citizen living in this country is a Hindu only if they pay respect to this land by considering it as their motherland, fatherland, holyland.”  Mukherjees-Mahajan’s research writes about the different Q&A series present in almost every Bodhmala book: “They present RSS–VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) propaganda in the form of catechisms to be memorised by the faithful as absolute truths.” Here are a few examples to highlight their point —  Q. Who got the first temple built on [sic] the birthplace of Shri Ram in Ayodhya?  A. Shri Ram’s son Maharaja Kush.  Q. Who was the first foreign invader who destroyed the Sri Ram temple?  A. Menander of Greece (150 BC)  Q. Who got the present Rama Temple built?  A. Maharaja Chandragupta Vikramaditya (AD 380–413).  Q. Which Muslim plunderer invaded the temples in Ayodhya in AD 1033?  A. Mahmud Ghaznavi’s nephew Salar Masud.  Q. Which Mughal invader destroyed the Rama Temple in AD 1528?  A. Babur.  Q. Why is Babri Masjid not a mosque?  A. Because Muslims have never till today offered Namaz there.  Q. How many devotees of Rama laid down their life [sic] to liberate Rama temple from A.D. 1528 to A.D. 1914?  A. Three lakh fifty thousand.  Q. How many times did the foreigners invade Shri Ramajanmabhumi?  A. Seventy-seven times.  Q. Which day was decided by Sri Ram Kar Sewa Samiti to start Kar Sewa?  A. October 30, 1990.  Q. Why will 2 November 1990 be inscribed in black letters in the history of India?  A. Because on that day, the then Chief Minister by ordering the Police to shoot unarmed Kar Sewaks massacred hundreds of them.  Q. When were the Shilanyas of the temple laid in Sri Ram Janmabhoomi?  A. 1 November 1989.  Q. What was the number of the struggle for the liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi which was launched on 30 October 1990?  A. 78th struggle.  Some other questions which have been included along with answers are:  Q. ‘When did Ramabhakta Kar Sewaks unfurl the saffron flag on Shri Ramjanmabhumi?’  Q. ‘Mention the names of the young boys who laid down their life while unfurling the saffron flag’.  The CABE report also stated, “Students taking Vidya Bharati’s Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha are made to memorise that 350,000 “Rambhakts” sacrificed their lives to “liberate the temple”.” Vinay Sultan, a 34-year-old journalist who studied in Sharda Bal Niketan, a school run by the RSS in Nagaur, Rajasthan from 1993 to 2005, told The Wire, “‘Vidya Bharati schools in Rajasthan used to have a series named ‘Sanskar Saurav’. They used to talk about the Ramjanmabhumi movement and the Kothari brothers (The Kothari Brothers came to Ayodhya from Kolkata to participate in the Kar Seva in October 1990. They were killed by police while performing the kar seva. Ram was 23 and Sharad was just 20 years old when they were killed.) They used to teach us about all the ‘martyrs’ from Rajasthan who died in the Ramjanmabhumi movement. Later on, one chapter on the Godhra pogrom was also added to the book.” He added, “They used to have a separate paper for Sanskar Saurav and the marks would get counted in the final result. It was one of the main subjects, not a secondary one.”  There is also a Q&A on the Kothari brothers in Bodhmala 8. Bodhmala for Class 9 talks about Bhagyachandra who had ‘spread Vaishnavism in Manipur’ and whose ‘grandfather Pamhiba made Hinduism the state religion’. It also mentions Narayan Guru, “The temples built by Narayan Guru became the centres of the organisation of the Hindu society. If Narayan Guru had not done the memorable work of stopping the trend of conversion in Hindu society in Kerala, Hindus would have become minority from majority.” Here’s an excerpt from Bodhmala for Class 6 that talks about the heroes who laid down their lives for the Hindu religion–  “‘You will get money, you will get the kingdom!’  ‘But why?’  ‘Just leave your religion and accept Islam.’  ‘No, never’… And in the end he was killed. The child was Haqeeqat Rai Prithvi Singh.”  Who are ‘others’?  The CABE Committee noted that much of the material in the so-called Sanskrit Jnan series taught in the RSS-run schools is “designed to promote bigotry and religious fanaticism in the name of inculcating knowledge of culture in the young generation.”  Mukherjees-Mahajan’s research highlighted some of the extracts from the reports submitted to the CABE committee”  During the reign of Ashoka, Gaurav Gatha – books published by Saraswati Shishu Mandir Prakashan – for Class 4 says, “Ahimsa began to be … advocated. Every kind of violence began to be considered a crime. Even hunting, sacrifices in yajnas and use of arms began to be considered bad. It had a bad effect on the army. Cowardice slowly spread throughout the kingdom. The state bore the burden of providing food to the Buddhist monks. Therefore people began to become monks. Victory through arms began to be viewed as bad. Soldiers guarding the borders were demoralised…. The preaching of Ahimsa had weakened north India.”  On the rise of Islam, the same book teaches, “Wherever they went, they had a sword in their hand. Their army went like a storm in all the four directions. Any country that came their way was destroyed. Houses of prayers and universities were destroyed. Libraries were burnt. Religious books were destroyed. Mothers and sisters were humiliated. Mercy and justice were unknown to them.’ It spreads Hindutva propaganda masquerading as history, ‘Delhi’s Qutb Minar is even today famous in his (Qutbuddin Aibak) name. This had not been built by him. He could not have been able to build it. It was actually built by emperor Samudragupta. Its real name was Vishnu Stambha…. This Sultan actually got some parts of it demolished and its name was changed.”  ‘Itihaas Gaa Raha Hai’ (IGRH), another supplementary series taught in Shishu Mandir schools, in its book for Class 5 talks about the “forceful conversion” of Hindus: “Innumerable Hindus were forcibly made Musalmans on the point of the sword. The struggle for freedom became a religious war. Innumerable sacrifices were made for religion. We went on and on winning one battle after another. We never allowed foreign rulers to settle down but we could not reconvert our separated brethren to Hinduism.”  In IGRH 12, one of the statements on Christianity reads – “It is because of the conspiratorial policies of the followers of this religion that India was partitioned. Even today Christian missionaries are engaged in fostering anti-national tendencies in Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal, Bihar, Kerala, and other regions of our country because of which there is a grave danger to the integrity of present day India.”  The same book says about Islam – “Thousands of opponents of idol worship, the followers of Islam, go to the pilgrimage centre of Islamic community at Kaaba to worship “Shivalinga”. In Muslim society, the greatest wish is to have a darshan of that black stone (Shivalinga). In another question, children are asked to fill in the blanks ‘rivers of blood’ as an answer to the question on the means by which Prophet Mohammad spread Islam.”  According to the CABE report, these books communalise the psyche of students, sharpen their Hindu identity and provide space and legitimacy for the promotion of crude propaganda against minorities by a two-fold process: “(a) through repeated glorification of Hindu icons, practices, kings and other persons in history and (b) by presenting non-Hindus mostly in highly negative manner and belittling their characters and contributions.”  Pushpendra Singh Baghel, an ex-student from Saraswati Shishu Vidhya Mandir, Bhander, Madhya Pradesh told The Wire, “Every year on Christmas and New Year, our teachers used to say in class that this is not from our culture. This was also written in the magazine Devputra which was distributed in all Vidya Bharati schools.” Vinay Sultan recalled, “In our books ‘Sanskar Saurabh’, sometimes, for Muslims, they would use the words ‘Aakranta’, ‘Videshi Aakranta’, ‘Vidharmi’ etc.” Tilak Pal added, “Devputra had articles by RSS ideologues saying that there were a lot of mistakes made between 1945 and 1949. If they [Muslims] had followed the two-nation theory and built a Muslim country, why didn’t we build a Hindu country?… It had a travelogue series where the writer argued that all the countries in Europe are religiously aligned, mainly to Christianity. When they can have a state religion, why can’t India have it? In all those articles, there was no space for coexistence with other religions…In their entire curriculum, there was no place for secularism. Their ideology enforces that no other community should stay in India other than the Hindus.” He continued, “Our teachers, directly or indirectly, used to teach us that Muslims are people you cannot trust. They would say, ‘Muslims are foreigners. They have come from outside. They are violent. They are all the converted Hindu population who have forgotten their past. These are the ones who left their religion for the fear of life. How can you trust such people?’”  The curriculum establishes a clear and impermeable demarcation between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Bodhmala 7 states, “We believe in pre-birth” – thus clearly demarcating ‘we’ as ‘Hindus/Jains/Buddhists’ since other religions don’t believe in pre-birth. Bodhmala 8 says saffron, the colour associated with the RSS and Hindu rightwing, is a “symbol of quietness, has scientific and chemical qualities and inspires us towards renunciation and sacrifice”. In an attempt to further define ‘us vs them’, Bodhmala 9 says, “Our rituals are not complete without Gangajal…It is our lifestyle to consider Cow, Ganga and Tulsi as motherhood.”  All the students we talked to echoed the same experience – there were hardly 2-3 Muslim students in the entire school. There was no teacher who belonged to the religious minority. No Muslim or Christian festival was celebrated in the school. The principal was a member of the RSS, usually the Shakha Pramukh, and a Brahmin by caste. Most of the students, teachers and headmasters would go to the RSS shakhas regularly.  Distorted history  The CABE report commented on the Vidya Bharati textbooks, “There is no distinction between fact, fiction and mythology… [Bodhmala 7 clearly states “Mahabharata is our history book”] The entire aim of the history written in these textbooks appears to be the projection of the Hindu communal imagination that the Indian nation has always been primarily and essentially a Hindu one, with its most glorious moments and highest achievements unfolding under Hindu kings.” These books focus excessively on the Mughal invasion of India, highlighting its role in the destruction of the Hindu temples. The report discovered statements encouraging bigotry in the Vidya Bharati textbooks, like “Muhammad bin Qasim died the death of a dog… Shivaji protected the cow, dharma, sanskriti, he is known as the protector of cows and Brahmins.” Vinay Sultan said about the curriculum followed in his school, “During all those years, they would focus on all rulers and the characters which had fought against Muslims like Haqeeqat Rai, Maharana Pratap, Chatrapati Shivaji. They walk you slowly and steadily into that Hindutva mindset.”  Bodhmala 10 talks about the ‘Foreign Invasions Of India And Their Counterattacks’, covering the invasion by the Iranian emperor Purush Mahan, Greek emperor Alexander, multiple attacks by Arabs, attacks by Mahmud Ghaznavi, Muhammad Ghori, Alauddin Khilji, Ibrahim Lodi, Vasco da Gama. It clearly states, “In 1947 Pakistan, a part of India, became our enemy. They send unannounced invaders in the form of tribal boys to capture Kashmir. They got some success in the name of Azad Kashmir, but the Indian forces were forced to chase away these invaders.” The Bodhmala books teach a factually incorrect version of the Battle of Haldighati, saying, “…In this fierce battle, Rana Pratap was able to defeat the Mughal soldiers and the battle of Haldighati ended.”  The CABE report notes, “These textbooks exaggerate and valorise the role of certain figures and personalities as against others. When Gandhi and Nehru are perforce mentioned as national leaders, Hindutva leaders are given equal importance… Most books mention that the Muslim League is a communal organisation and rightly so but the communal orientation of the RSS as an organisation openly committed to the launching of a Hindu Rashtra do not find mention in these books.”  Pushpendra told The Wire about a monthly magazine Devputra published by Vidya Bharati, “The magazine used to hail Golwalkar, Savarkar, Hedgewar and other RSS ideologues. They would boast about the contribution of RSS in the Indian freedom struggle. There were articles saying that Nehru had put a ban on the RSS and he used to hate it.”  Tilak revealed the various rumours popular in RSS schools, “Our teachers used to talk in a way that was not very respectful of Gandhi. They would say that if Sardar Patel wasn’t there, the country would have been divided into pieces. Also, they would say that Gandhi didn’t want Bhagat Singh to live. If he had tried enough, he could have saved Bhagat Singh’s life.” About Nehru, he added, “They would say that he was such an elitist that his clothes went to London for laundry. They would raise suspicions like — Why did the Britishers always release him from jail? Why didn’t he die in jail like others? There must be some reason. Also, they would trace Nehru’s ancestry to Afghanistan and would say that he was originally a Muslim and got converted later.”  Tilak told The Wire about what his teachers said about Godse, “They viewed Godse in high regard and considered him a revolutionary. They would say that if he hadn’t killed Gandhi, Gandhi would have caused more damage to the Hindus. I remember a teacher saying in the class — Godse might be having some reasons. Review the files of that case. Nobody would kill someone just like that. There must have been some reason. There are many facts which have been deliberately hidden.”  The CABE report revealed, “In Karnataka, RSS-leaning organisations distribute books in slum literacy centres, but the source of these books is yet to be traced (they are not easily available, being distributed directly). For example, the Infosys library programme distributes supplementary material among government and non-government schools biographies of “great Indians”, mainly published by the Rashtrothana Publication, which is linked to the RSS… Exclusively upper caste Hindu, these icons include religious and mythical figures, rulers, and a handful of reformers, mostly from the Karnataka region… The RSS ideologues are prominent among nationalist leaders, and significantly Gandhi and Nehru are absent.”  Vinay recalled, “Teachers in our school would openly say that Godse did the right thing [by killing Gandhi]. And that Gandhi was responsible for the partition because he wanted to make Nehru the Prime Minister of the country… Books like ‘Maine Gandhi Ko Kyu Maara’ and other RSS literature were openly sold in the school.”  From students to foot soldiers  In a series of interviews, the ex-students of Vidya Bharati schools revealed how the curriculum and the functions and events organised by their schools made them a part of the Hindutva ecosystem. A few of them confessed that they have still not been able to withdraw themselves completely from it.  From men in 60s to young teenage boys, all dressed in crisp khaki shorts, spotless white shirts tucked in, black caps soaring high on their heads, march with an army-like symmetry in what the RSS calls ‘Shakti Pradarshan’ – a display of strength. It further translates into an unabashed and butch display of armed strength by the Hindu right-wing aimed at browbeating the religious minorities in the area. Tilak said, “Every year on Dussehra, they used to parade with open swords, trishuls, lathis, bhaalas, sometimes even firearms. The ‘Shakti Pradarshan’ was carried out in Bhopal, the regional headquarters of both Vidya Bharati and the RSS. Most of the students and teachers from Vidya Bharati participated. Though no official letter was released, teachers used to announce in the class that participation is compulsory. Also, there was an unsaid rule that these parades will be taken out in Muslim-dominated areas to intimidate the people.”  He added,”‘Our teachers would say that along with every big mandir, Muslims have built a masjid. We need to take a stand otherwise our mandirs won’t be saved… There was direct involvement of RSS in our schools. Their leaders would come to the schools and say — You should be prepared to use different types of weapons. Otherwise, how will you protect yourself in times of riots? In classrooms, we were told that Hitler was a great man. He was a nationalist and was fighting for his rights. Teachers would go on to justify ethnic cleansing and would indirectly convey that all the sufferings are because of the Muslims.”  Vinay Sultan, who in his own words “was a dedicated Swayamsevak since the age of 6 and remained so until the last decade”, said, “It was the year 2002, when the Godhra pogrom had happened. I remember how charged up our classrooms were. Teachers would discuss how the Ram bhakts were killed there.” When asked to elaborate, he revealed, “Every month there was a Mukhya Sthan Shakha which was organised and all the shakhas and Vidya Bharati schools in the city would participate in it. Around 15-20 people from my shakha had also joined. I was one of them. I clearly remember that while returning we purposely went through the Muslim dominated areas and raised provocative slogans. We were holding those lathis – we called them ‘dand’ in the RSS. Doing this was a weird kind of thrill.” He added, “Many teachers in my school, including the headmaster, were themselves Kar Sevaks. They had participated in the demolition of Babri Masjid. They used to come to the class and narrate how bravely they fought. They even glorified the demolition.”  Pushpendra, who is now a researcher, recalled, “When the Ram Setu movement and the agitation was going on during 2007-08, the school administration made all the students write individual letters to the President of India demanding the Ram Setu to not be abolished since it is an important part of Hindu culture. All of us had to bring postcards from home and write the letter in school.”  In just a few words, he summarised what these schools intend to do, “As students we never get to know, but slowly and steadily, they keep instilling Hindutva in us. So, whenever there is a communal riot, all the students will rise up as Kattar Hindus. They prepare us for that day.”  (Astha Savyasachi is a journalist based in New Delhi.

"political assassination","1940-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T10:12:22","Current Affairs there appears an article titled . Its subtitle reads: In the January – February 2023 issue ofthere appears an article titled “Stalin Will Never Be Redeemable ” . Its subtitle reads:  Stalin was socialism’s worst enemy. History is easily forgotten, so nostalgia for the “Man of Steel” needs to be guarded against.    A person who knows of my long interest in Joseph Stalin and the “Stalin years” of Soviet history alerted me to this article when it appeared online. He wondered what my response to Skopic’s accusations against Stalin might be.  I have been studying the Stalin period of Soviet history for many years now I decided to write a response to Skopic’s article because it is a brief compendium of many of the allegations made against Stalin not only by overtly pro-capitalist and anticommunist writers, but by persons who are, or wish to be, or think that they are, on the anti-capitalist Left.  I am not “defending” Stalin, much less “apologizing” for Stalin. I am searching for the truth, as determined by the best evidence available.  Every accusation Skopic makes about Stalin is demonstrably wrong. I prove most of them wrong on the evidence. A few are wrong because they are anachronistic -- charging Stalin (and the Soviet leadership, which was collective – Stalin was not a dictator[1]) with failing to act according to knowledge we have today but that no one had at the time.  The present essay sets forth the evidence and my analysis of it. At the end I briefly address the question of how Skopic could be so wrong and the reasons for anticommunism in the first place.  * * * * *  In the wake of Stalin’s death in 1953, the floodgates of state censorship opened, and a seemingly endless series of atrocity stories came out—but some socialists, both in the USSR and the West, simply refused to believe them …  Today we know that those who refused to believe Khrushchev’s talks of Stalin’s supposed “crimes” were correct! They “smelled a rat.”  Khrushchev and his followers produced no evidence to support their accusations. The striking lack of primary-source evidence is what started me on my quest for the truth about Stalin and the Stalin-era Soviet Union years ago.  We Must Defend Not Stalin, But the Truth  Skopic writes:  These are, broadly speaking, the two rationales used by Stalin’s defenders today. Either the murderous nature of his regime was completely fabricated (the theme of Grover Furr’s signature book Khrushchev Lied) …  Skopic repeatedly accuses me of “defending Stalin” and calls me a “Stalinist.” But what is a “Stalinist”? Either it means someone who “defends” Stalin and “apologizes” for Stalin’s “crimes”, or it is simply a term of abuse, of dismissal.  I am not a “Stalinist.” I have been searching for decades for evidence that Stalin committed crimes. If Stalin committed crimes, I want to know about them. We all need to know about them – if they exist. But so far I have yet to find any evidence that Stalin committed even one crime! Every accusation of a crime by Stalin alleged by anyone from legitimated academic “experts” to people like Skopic is false.  Regardless of the evidence, this result is unacceptable, literally “taboo” to anticommunists and Trotskyists, academics included. The most renowned and respectable academic authorities such as Stephen Kotkin of Princeton and Timothy Snyder of Yale have lied and falsified dozens, if not hundreds, of times, rather than accept the results that flow from the study of primary-source evidence about Stalin.  I call this the “Anti-Stalin Paradigm”, or ASP. All academic research on Stalin must conform to this ASP or it will not be published. That would doom the career of any scholar hoping to teach Soviet history. So, the evidence is ignored and lies and falsehoods, many of them obvious to those who repeat them, are recycled, or, in some cases, new lies and falsehoods are invented.  Stalin and his propagandists never missed a chance to slam the United States for its record on racial injustice, deploying the bitter phrase “А у вас негров линчуют” (“And you are lynching Negroes!”) whenever American diplomats criticized the USSR’s human rights abuses. This was, of course, a cynical ploy …  “Whenever” implies repeated action. Yet Skopic does not cite a single instance of this (I cannot find any either). “Cynical plot” implies – without evidence – that Stalin and the Soviet leadership were not really opposed to racism.  Skopic admits that Paul Robeson, Langston Hughes, and other Black Americans found the dedication to anti-racism in the USSR inspiring. So how could Skopic possibly know that Stalin’s anti-racism was really “a cynical ploy”? He can’t!  Skopic Confuses “Sources” With Evidence  The Stalinists of the 20th century desperately wanted to believe in the promise of a new society, and they weren’t given the facts they needed to see through the illusion. In the 21st century, though, we have no such excuse. There is ample evidence from dozens of different sources detailing Stalin’s abuses and betrayals …  This illustrates one of Skopic’s central errors: he confuses “source” with “evidence.” A “source” is just where you found some statement or other, regardless of whether that statement is true or false. Primary-source evidence, usually in documentary form, is the only valid basis for truthful conclusions. Skopic has no primary-source evidence of any “abuses” or “betrayals” on Stalin’s part – only fact-claims from anticommunist and Trotskyist writers who themselves have no evidence.  … with the single exception of Hitler—he was the most lethal anticommunist of his time. In fact, the epitaph of virtually every prominent European socialist to die in the years 1928-1945 reads either “murdered by Hitler” or “murdered by Stalin.”  If there were so many, why doesn’t Skopic name even one of them? Since he cites no names, no one can check to see whether Skopic is telling the truth or not.  Skopic:  Soon after he was named General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1922, Stalin began maneuvering against the other Bolshevik leaders who had organized the October Revolution, packing important positions with his own supporters …  Skopic fails to cite even one example. I have never found any either.  Leon Trotsky made this accusation, also without evidence. Trotsky is probably Skopic’s unnamed source here. Trotsky is the source of a great many false allegations against Stalin of crimes and misdeeds.  and arranging various smears and frame-ups against his rivals.  Again, Skopic cites no examples. There is no evidence to support this allegation.  Skopic:  Leon Trotsky, the leader of the Left Opposition faction, was ejected from the Party in 1927 after he refused to abandon the idea of global revolution (which Stalin opposed) …  False. This is another of Trotsky’s slanders. Stalin did not oppose “global revolution” at all.  In his preface to Stalin’s Letters to Molotov (1996) Robert C. Tucker, an anti-Stalin historian at Princeton University, wrote::  [Lars] Lih raises the question: Did Stalin dismiss world revolution in favor of building up the Soviet state (as Trotsky, for one, alleged at the time), or did he remain dedicated to world revolution? Lib's answer, based on the letters, is that in Stalin's mind the Soviet state and international revolution coalesced, and the letters provide support for this view. (ix)  Lars Lih, the editor of this volume, writes:  Stalin's intense involvement belies the image of an isolationist leader interested only in “socialism in one country.” The letters show us that Stalin did not make a rigid distinction between the interests of world revolution and the interests of the Soviet state: both concerns are continually present in his outlook. (5-6)  Skopic:  … by 1929 he [Trotsky] had been exiled from the USSR altogether, and in 1940 Stalin had him assassinated.  Aren’t the reasons relevant? Of course, they are! But Skopic omits them.  Trotsky was exiled because he repeatedly formed a fraction within the Party after Party fractions had been outlawed at Lenin’s insistence in 1921. Even before Lenin died in January 1924 Trotsky and his followers were actively organizing against the Party. Trotsky was expelled after the opposition organized a counterdemonstration on the tenth anniversary of the Revolution in October, 1927.  Many of his fellow conspirators recanted and promised to be good Party members from then on. It turned out later that some of them were lying and continued to conspire in secret.  But Trotsky refused to recant. Exiled in comfortable conditions to Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan – he was able to carry on a wide correspondence and even to go hunting -- Trotsky continued his factional organizing. At length the Party leadership decided to expel him to Turkey, where they arranged a large house for him to stay on a Turkish island.  Trotsky was assassinated in August 1940, probably by Stalin’s order. The general reason was that Trotsky had conspired with Nazi Germany and militarist-fascist Japan to aid them against the Soviet army in the event they attacked the USSR.[2] The proximate reason, according to General Pavel Sudoplatov, was that Stalin believed that Trotsky’s followers would weaken international support for the USSR when war broke out.  “There are no important political figures in the Trotskyite movement except Trotsky himself. If Trotsky is finished the threat will be eliminated,” Stalin said.[3]  Skopic:  Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, close associates of Lenin who were originally  supposed to rule with Stalin in a triumvirate, were accused of the murder of Sergei Kirov (for which some historians believe Stalin was also responsible) and summarily executed in 1936.  …  False. Zinoviev and Kamenev led a clandestine terrorist group of “Zinovievists” (Party members and former members loyal to Zinoviev when he was head of the Party in Leningrad) whose Leningrad branch murdered Leningrad Party leader Sergei Kirov, who had replaced Zinoviev. We have a great deal of evidence about their activities. I have carefully studied the evidence against the Leningrad Zinovievists.[4]  In 1935 Zinoviev and Kamenev were tried and sentenced to prison terms. At that time the NKVD stated that there was no evidence that Zinoviev and Kamenev themselves had been involved in Kirov’s murder.  However, by mid-1936 some members of the Zinovievist conspiratorial group had accused Zinoviev and Kamenev of complicity in Kirov’s murder. They confessed in July 1936. I have put online a translation of Zinoviev’s confession of August 10, 1936.[5]  The First Moscow Trial was quickly organized in August. Zinoviev and Kamenev repeated these confessions at trial and were sentenced to death. In their appeals to the court for clemency, which were never intended for publication, Zinoviev and Kamenev repeated their guilt. Therefore, it is a lie to say that Zinoviev and Kamenev were “summarily executed.”[6]  Not even mainstream anticommunist historians “believe” that Stalin was involved in Kirov’s death. So where did Skopic get this – what was his “source”? Most important: since “belief” is irrelevant, what is Skopic’s evidence that Stalin was involved? He has none, because no such evidence exists.  Skopic:  With each year, the accusations of treachery grew wilder, and the evidence thinner, often relying entirely on confessions extracted under torture.  There is no evidence either of “thin” evidence or of confessions “extracted under torture” in the Moscow Trials. No wonder Skopic does not cite even one example! (For Nikolai Yezhov’s illegal crimes, see below).  Skopic:  Trials became farces lasting as little as 15 or 20 minutes.  Trials at which the defendant confesses his guilt, and the court has evidence to confirm it, were often short, as they are in the United States today when an accused confesses guilt before a judge. However, in the next sentence Skopic mentions Nikolai Bukharin. Bukharin was a defendant in the Third Moscow Trial of March 1938, a public trial that lasted twelve days, from March 2 to March 13.  Skopic:  Nikolai Bukharin, leader of the moderate Right Opposition, managed to survive until 1938, but in the end he, too, was sentenced to death for his supposed involvement in a Trotskyist and/or Nazi conspiracy…  There is no excuse for this falsehood. The transcript of the 1938 Trial in which Bukharin was convicted was published in 1938. Several of Bukharin’s pre-trial confessions have been available for years.[7]  At trial Bukharin confessed to some serious crimes while stubbornly refusing to confess to others. A differentiated confession like this suggests that the confession of guilt was genuine.[8] It certainly proves that Bukharin was not threatened with torture or mistreatment of his family.  Skopic continues:  Bukharin’s last message is particularly haunting, using Stalin’s personal nickname in  an appeal to their onetime friendship: Koba, why do you need me to die?  Years ago, my colleague Vladimir Bobrov and I published an article in which we proved that this is a fake. See Furr and Bobrov, “Bukharin's Last Plea: Yet Another Anti-Stalin Falsification.”[9] This article has been available online, in English, since 2010! Couldn’t Skopic have done a Google search?  Skopic:  In the same year, Jānis Rudzutaks, a Latvian revolutionary who had served ten years in Tsarist prisons for his Bolshevik convictions, was executed despite never having voiced the slightest objection to the Party line.  Conspirators always “voiced” agreement with the Party’s position in order to mask their conspiracy.  His [Rudzutak’s] only offense, according to Stalin’s confidante Vyacheslav Molotov, was that he was “too easygoing about the opposition” and “indulged too much in partying with philistine friends,” and was therefore a liability.  Molotov did not say that this was Rudzutak’s “only” offense. Why did Skopic tell this lie? Moreover, in 1938 Molotov had his hands full as head of state – Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars. How would he remember, in extreme old age, what the specific accusations and evidence against Rudzutak had been?  Today we have a great deal of evidence against Rudzutak. His NKVD investigation file has long been available to researchers. It contains Rudzutak’s confessions along with much other evidence against him.  Rudzutak was also accused by several defendants at the Third Moscow Trial of 1938. In lengthy statements to the court defendant Nikolai N. Krestinsky named Rudzutak as a conspirator many times. The trial transcript has been available since 1938. Why didn’t Skopic consult it?  Skopic:  In March of 1938, the American Marxist newspaper Socialist Appeal ran a memorable photo gallery, entitled “LENIN’S GENERAL STAFF OF 1917: STALIN, THE EXECUTIONER, ALONE REMAINS.” As it turns out, they were slightly off; of the 24 people pictured, Alexandra Kollontai and Matvei Muranov, listed as “missing,” had survived. Still, this gives some sense of the bloody ruin Stalin made of the Bolshevik party.  As it happens, I have written an article in which I examine this very document (Socialist Appeal was a Trotskyist newspaper). It will be published in a future book. For now let me note that this list was dishonest -- intended to deceive -- when it was published in 1938.  * Eight of the figures whose photos appear in the “gallery” -- Uritsky, Shaumian (not “Shomyan”), Sverdlov, Artem (Sergeev), Lenin, Nogin, Dzerzhinsky, and Ioffe -- were indeed dead by 1938. Stalin had nothing to do with their deaths.  What's the point of including so many people who had died by 1938 except to imply, without evidence, that Stalin was in some way responsible for their deaths?  * Three more lived long after 1938. Alexandra M. Kollontai died on March 9, 1952. Matvei K. Muranov died on December 9, 1959. Elena D. Stasova died on December 31, 1966.  This is a dishonest propaganda technique. It has nothing to do with understanding history. Yet this kind of duplicity characterizes most anticommunist and Trotskyite writing on the Stalin period up to the present day.  In my article I examine the evidence against the eleven, all men, who were indeed executed. Every one of them was convicted at a trial where much evidence against them was produced. In many cases the accused confessed. It is absurd to claim that a person who repeatedly confesses his guilt and is impeached by the testimony of others is nevertheless “innocent.”  Skopic:  With characteristic chutzpah, Grover Furr attempts to justify the purges in Khrushchev Lied, asserting that all of the above really were spies and saboteurs, but the numbers are against him …  I must protest Skopic’s dishonesty here. Most readers of Skopic’s article will not have read my book Khrushchev Lied (2011) or will not have read it recently, and so will not know that his statement here about my research is false.  * I do not discuss “all of the above” in my book Khrushchev Lied.  * I do not assert that “all of the above” were guilty. Indeed, I do not claim that any of the persons named by Khrushchev as innocent victims of Stalin were guilty.  What I do in that book, as in all my other books, is examine the evidence that we now have. In the cases I have examined there is plenty of evidence of the guilt of the people under discussion and no evidence that they were innocent.  Skopic clearly does not understand historical research, so a word about that is relevant here. It is not the job of a historian to assert the guilt or the innocence of anybody. The historian’s duty is to identify, locate, obtain, and examine the evidence and, where possible, to draw logical conclusions from that evidence.  A historian must always be prepared to modify or even reverse his original conclusion if and when more evidence comes to light and demands it, or a more convincing interpretation of the currently available evidence is produced.  Skopic:  … What are the odds, after all, that essentially everyone but Stalin suddenly turned traitor, leaving him the only stalwart?  This is just nonsense. Thousands of “old Bolsheviks” (persons who had joined the Party before the Revolution) and other Party leaders remained. Khrushchev named only a small number of persons whom he wished to “rehabilitate” – that is, to declare innocent while never producing evidence that they were, in fact, innocent. In my book Khrushchev Lied I examine only those whom Khrushchev names in his “Secret Speech” of February 25, 1956.  Skopic:  With each new show trial, a ripple effect ran through Soviet society, as anyone who was tainted by association with the “guilty” party—from their family members to people who were merely seen talking to them or reading their books—stood a decent chance of being arrested, executed, or deported to Siberia in turn.  These statements are false. Skopic gives no examples of even a single person to whom any of this happened. And no wonder! I have never found an example of anyone who was executed or deported to Siberia simply because they were “merely seen talking to” or “reading the books” of a convicted person. Not one!  Wives of high-ranking Party and military figures who had been convicted of serious crimes like espionage or sabotage were imprisoned or exiled, on the assumption that they must have known something about their husband’s activities yet did not report them. In some cases, we have evidence that the wife was also guilty.  In other cases, we have no such evidence, although it may still be in former Soviet archives. It is possible that some wives who had been kept in the dark about their husband’s conspiratorial activities were imprisoned. But we don’t have the evidence so we cannot tell whether this occurred or not.  I have never found even one example of a person in any of the categories named here by Skopic who was executed, and Skopic does not cite even a single example.  “Quotas”?  Skopic:  Like American cops today, Stalin’s secret police worked on a quota system, in which officers were required to make a certain number of arrests per month …  This is false. American historian Arch Getty has refuted this “quota system” notion several times.  One of the mysteries of the field [of Soviet history — GF] is how limity [“limits”] is routinely translated as “quotas.”[10]  For more about this specific lie see my book Stalin Waiting for … the Truth, Chapter Ten, “The Falsehood About ‘Quotas’”.  Anticommunist “scholars” continue to lie, claiming that Stalin had “quotas” for arrests. Obviously they want him to have had quotas so they can condemn him!  We must ask: If you need to invent spurious crimes in order to find reasons to condemn Stalin, doesn’t that imply that you could not find any real crimes of which Stalin was guilty? For if you could find real crimes, why not just discuss them without inventing phony ones?  Skopic:  In a typical case, one unlucky woman was arrested as a Trotskyist, then had her charge changed to “bourgeois nationalism,” on the grounds that the local NKVD had “exceeded4 the quota for Trotskyites, but were short on nationalists, even though they’d taken all the Tatar writers they could think of.”  The quotation is from Robert Conquest, The Great Terror.[11] In the revised edition the quotation is on page 284. The reference there is to Evgeniia Ginzburg, Journey into the Whirlwind, page 105, and this passage is indeed in Ginzburg’s book.  Abuses of this kind, and on a massive scale, were committed by Nikolai Yezhov’s men during the time he was head of the NKVD. But we have no way of verifying what Ginzburg wrote here. She was fiercely anti-Stalin, believed the Khrushchev-era lies about Stalin, and had little motive to be objective.  Ginzburg was arrested in February 1937, on the testimony of some of her co-workers, in the immediate aftermath of the Second Moscow Trial or “Trotskyist” trial of January 16 - 30, 1937. She was accused of being a member of a clandestine Trotskyist group. We have plenty of evidence that such groups did exist.  Ginzburg claims that she was innocent. But we really do not know. It is common for both the guilty and the innocent to claim innocence. The fact that she was “rehabilitated” does not prove that she was innocent because many persons were “rehabilitated” during the Khrushchev and Gorbachev eras without any evidence that they were in fact innocent.  I have examined a number of such cases in Chapter 11 of Khrushchev Lied. In some cases, like that of Bukharin, we know that the Soviet prosecutor and judges falsified evidence in order to declare him innocent.[12]  In the early 1990s two NKVD investigative reports of her case were published.[13] These reports detail the testimony against Ginzburg from co-workers. On the basis of this evidence, she was convicted and sentenced first to prison and later to a labor camp.  The “Yezhovshchina”  In late July or early August 1937, Nikolai Yezhov, chief (“People’s Commissar”) of the Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD), which included the political police that are often called “the NKVD,” began a 14-month orgy of mass arrests and executions. Most persons executed must have been innocent, as Yezhov and his men testified in 1939 when, after replacing Yezhov as head of the NKVD, Lavrentii Beria began to investigate these massive illegal repressions.  Primary-source documents from former Soviet archives prove that Yezhov deceived Stalin and his leadership in order to further his own conspiracy. As I conclude in my book about this period, Yezhov vs Stalin[14],  The version set forth here absolves Stalin of guilt for the massive repressions. This is what is unacceptable to mainstream Soviet history. But it was certainly Stalin’s responsibility, as the principle political leader of the country, to take decisive action to stop violations of justice, have them investigated, and make sure those responsible are punished. Stalin did this. Tragically, it took him many months to fully realize what was really going on, by which time Ezhov and his men had murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent Soviet citizens. (231)  On January 2, 1939, Stalin wrote Prosecutor Vyshinsky: “A public trial of the guilty parties in the NKVD is essential.”[15] Such public trials did not take place. We do not know why. However, there were many non-public trials of Yezhov’s NKVD men, including of Yezhov himself. Many were sentenced to death for their crimes. During the first year after he took office, Beria released at least 110,000 prisoners from the camps (“GULAG”) and prisons.  During the same year [1939] about 110,000 persons were freed after the review of cases of those arrested in 1937-1938.[16]  Lavrentii Beria  Skopic:  Later, others fell victim to the sadism of Lavrentii Beria, a truly vile figure who used his position as head of the secret police to sexually assault hundreds of women and girls, often threatening a loved one under arrest to secure their silence.  These are lies. Skopic cites no evidence. And no wonder! There has never been any good evidence that Beria carried out these sexual assaults.  An article in a conservative Moscow newspaper contains the following passage:  One of the experts who had the opportunity to study the cases of Beria and the head of Stalin's security, General Vlasik, classified to this day, discovered an extremely interesting fact. The lists of women in whose rape, judging by the materials of his case, Beria pleaded guilty, almost completely coincide with the lists of those ladies with whom Vlasik, who was arrested long before Beria, was accused of having relations.[17]  On June 26, 1953, Beria was either arrested or – as it increasingly appears – killed in the act of being arrested, at a Presidium meeting by his colleagues in the leadership of the CPSU. Beria was not present at the Central Committee meeting in July 1953, called for the sole purpose of slandering him. Why not? This was unprecedented for such a high-ranking official – a minister in the government.  Beria was allegedly tried, convicted, and executed at a trial in December 1953. But no trial transcript has ever come to light. A lot of evidence that Beria was murdered at this time or possibly shortly thereafter has been published. Some of it is summarized in a recent study by two Russian historians.[18]  Concerning the conduct of the trial of “Beria” – supposedly present but probably already murdered – and his associates, Colonel-General Aleksandr F. Katusev, Chief Prosecutor of the USSR from 1989 to 1991, during the time of Gorbachev, has written:  Считаю своим долгом отметить, что вновь открывшиеся обстоятельства лишь дополнительно высветили ошибки и натяжки в приговоре по делу Берии и других. В то время как наиболее серьезные из них были очевидны и прежде. Чем же объяснить, что крупнейшие наши юристы под руководством Руденко Р.А. предъявили обвинение, не подкрепленное надлежащими доказательствами.  Ответ лежит на поверхности. Еще до начала следствия были обнародованы постановления июльского (1953) Пленума ЦК КПСС и Указ Президиума Верховного Совета СССР, в которых содержалась не только политическая, но и правовая оценка содеянного».[19].\  I consider it my duty to note that the newly discovered circumstances only additionally highlighted the errors and exaggerations in the verdict in the case of Beria and others, while the most serious of them were obvious before. How can we explain that our most prominent jurists, under the leadership of Roman A. Rudenko, could have made these charges without proper evidence?  The answer is obvious. Even before the start of the investigation, the resolutions of the July (1953) Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were made public, which contained not only a political, but also a legal assessment of the deed.  Katusev stated that there was no proper evidence against Beria and the others, and they were accused, convicted, and executed on the basis of the Central Committee Plenum of July 1953 and a decree of the legislature! If, in fact, a transcript and materials of the “Beria trial” of December 1953 exist, Katusev would have had access to them. He does not mention any transcript. This might mean that there is none and no trial really took place. But to draw this conclusion would be an argumentum ex silentio and in this case a logical fallacy.  Skopic continues about Beria:  When this method didn’t work, Beria simply murdered his victims; in 1993, workers digging a ditch at his former home found several sets of human remains that had been hastily covered up with quicklime.  This statement is contradicted by the very source Skopic cites, a 1993 article in the British newspaper Independent. That article states:  MOSCOW - Building workers digging a ditch in the centre of the city on Friday unearthed a common grave near the mansion once occupied by Stalin's secret police chief, Lavrenti Beria, writes Helen Womack. Since Beria was notorious for carrying out interrogation and torture in his own home, it is reasonable to assume that the bones are the remains of his personal victims.  … it is believed that Beria lured young women there, had sex with them, then had them murdered in the basement.  … The workers had been digging for several hours when they came upon a pile of human bones, including two children's skulls [20]…  So not “at his former home” as Skopic claims but “near” it, plus ""children’s skulls.” Was Beria raping children too, and then carrying the remains outside his home to bury them “near” where he lived? Ridiculous!  There is no evidence that these bodies had anything to do with Beria. So why did Skopic distort what the article says? Is he “grasping at a straw” – trying to find something that will make Beria look bad? It sure looks that way.  Executions  Skopic:  Even if we grant the most pro-Stalin interpretation of the facts, counting only the deaths directly recorded in the Soviet archives (799,455 executions, 1.7 million deaths while imprisoned, 390,000 during the forced resettlement of rural peasants, and 400,000 people deported to Siberia and elsewhere), we still get a figure of more than three million.  The source normally cited for numbers of executions from 1921-1953 is Viktor Zemskov, “Pravda o repressiiakh” (The truth about the repressions), 2009, republished several times on the internet.[21]  I quote from one of my essays:  In September 1936 Nikolai Ezhov replaced Genrikh Iagoda as head (Peoples Commissar) of the NKVD. In November 1938 Ezhov was replaced by Lavrentii Beria. According to the widely publicized “Pavlov report” prepared for Khrushchev in 1953 and widely reprinted the number of persons sentenced to death in 1936-1940 were as follows: [6]  1936 – 1,118  1937 – 353,074  1938 – 328,618  1939 – 2,552  1940 – 1,649  In 1939 death sentences under Beria were less than 1% of those under Ezhov. In 1940 they were less than ½ of 1%. No mass political repression occurred during Stalin’s postwar years. The “Ezhovshchina” (=“bad time of Ezhov”) was never repeated. The conclusion is inescapable: It was not Khrushchev, but Stalin and Beria who ended mass political repression, and they did it in late 1938.[22]  The years of very high numbers of executions are: 1921, the last year of the bitter Civil War – 9701; 1930 and 1931, the years of collectivization and violent opposition to it: 20,201 and 10,651; the two years of the “Yezhovshchina”, 1937 and 1938: 353,074 and 328,618; 1942, the worst year of the war, when the USSR faced greatest danger of defeat and was under martial law, 23,278.  Executions during these six years out of 32 ½ years equal 745,523, or 93.3% of the total of 799,455. Executions during 1937 and 1938, the two years of Yezhov’s mass illegal murders, total 85.3% of the total of 799,455.  For more detailed discussion of Yezhov’s conspiracy and his mass murder of innocent Soviet citizens, Beria’s investigations of Yezhov and his men, and a great deal of primary-source evidence-- almost completely ignored by mainstream anti-Stalin historians -- see Yezhov vs Stalin.  Deaths in the GULAG  The source used by professional researchers, most of whom are anticommunist and strongly biased against Stalin, is GULAG. (Glavnoe Upravlenie Lagerei), 1918-1960. (Moscow: MDF, 2000), edited by Kokurin and Petrov of the anticommunist “Memorial” Society. Document No. 103 of this work gives the mortality in the GULAG camps by year. It can be viewed online as a table.[23] This shows that the higher mortality rates were in 1932 (13,197 or 4.8%),1933 (67,297 or 15.3%), 1942 (352,560 or 24.9 %) and 1943 (267,826 or 22.4 %). The next highest year, 1944, saw a 9.2% mortality, higher than all the remaining years.  Of the total number of deaths in the GULAG from 1930 (the first year we have statistics) till 1953 (Stalin died on March 5 of that year), we get 1,590,384 deaths in the GULAG between 1930 and 1953. Of these deaths, 43.2% of them or 687,683 occurred in the three years 1933, 1942, and 1943. 1932-33 were the years of the great famine of ’32-’33 when mortality was very high throughout the USSR. 1942 and 1943 were the worst years of the war. 50.7% of all the deaths in the GULAG occurred in 1932-33 and 1942-44.  During these periods a great many Soviet citizens were also dying prematurely. For example: during World War II Soviet workers sickened and died of starvation at their work, far from any fighting.  The high intensity of work at the factory and the inadequacy of the food make it a matter of urgency that [workers receive their rightful days off], as witnessed by the frequency with which workers are dropping dead from emaciation right on the job. On some days you see several corpses in the shops. During the two months December 1942 and January 1943, they observed 16 bodies just in the factory shops. Those dying from emaciation are mainly workers doing manual labor. (Shliaev, Chief Prosecutor of Cheliabinsk province, to Bochkov, Prosecutor General of the USSR, March 29, 1943)  This is from an article by Donald Filtzer, “Starvation Mortality in Soviet Home Front Industrial Regions During World War II.”[24] Filtzer is a conventionally anticommunist scholar who specializes in studying the Soviet working class. He states:  During 1943 and 1944, starvation and tuberculosis – a disease that was endemic to the USSR and is highly sensitive to acute malnutrition – were between them the largest single cause of death among the nonchild civilian population.  Filtzer continues:  The USSR did not have enough food to feed both its military and its civilians, even with the arrival of Lend-Lease food aid. The state therefore had to engage in a grim calculus and decide how it could most efficiently use its limited resources – that is, how many calories and grams of protein it could allocate to different groups. In these circumstances it was inevitable that some people would not obtain enough to eat and many would die. No matter what regime had been in power in the USSR—Stalinist, Trotskyist, Menshevik, or capitalist—it would have faced the same set of choices.  Skopic does not identify his source for the figure of 390,000 persons dying during “forced resettlement of rural peasants” so it is impossible to know exactly what he means. It probably means that peasants – mainly rich peasants, or kulaks, and those who, perhaps under the influence of the kulaks, who were very influential people in their communities, resisted collectivization, were resettled, and eventually died, not during resettlement but at their place of resettlement. No doubt many of them died during the great famine of 1932-33 and the very bad famine of 1946.  Similarly, Skopic does not tell us where he gets the number of 400,000 “people deported to Siberia and elsewhere” or what it means – deaths during deportations, or all deaths, including persons who died after deportation.  We do have some information about mortality during deportations. For example, we know that very few of the Chechens and Crimean Tatars deported in 1944 for collaboration with the Germans died during deportation.  According to an NKVD report reproduced in several places, 191, or 0.126%, of the 151,529 Crimean Tatars deported to Uzbekistan, died in transit. … In the case of the much larger population of deported Chechens and Ingush, numbering 493,269 persons, we have primary source evidence that 1272, or 0.25%, died in transport. See N.F. Bugai and A.M. Gonov. “The Forced Evacuation of the Chechens and the Ingush.” Russian Studies in History. vol. 41, no. 2, Fall 2002, p. 56. [25]  The Crimean Tatars and Chechens were deported en masse so as to keep these linguistically and culturally distinct groups united. To separate them would have been a form of genocide (though the term did not exist until after the war).[26]  Skopic:  Under Stalin’s leadership, many of the hard-won victories of 1917 were undermined and rolled back, in a downward slide into social and political conservatism.  This was Leon Trotsky’s claim, so it is no surprise that Skopic quotes the following passage from Leon Sedov’s Red Book on the Moscow Trials (1936)  In the most diverse areas, the heritage of the October revolution is being liquidated. Revolutionary internationalism gives way to the cult of the fatherland in the strictest sense. And the fatherland means, above all, the authorities. Ranks, decorations and titles have been reintroduced. The officer caste headed by the marshals has been reestablished. The old communist workers are pushed into the background; the working class is divided into different layers; the bureaucracy bases itself on the “non-party Bolshevik,” the Stakhanovist, that is, the workers’ aristocracy, on the foreman and, above all, on the specialist and the administrator. The old petit-bourgeois family is being reestablished and idealized in the most middle-class way; despite the general protestations, abortions are prohibited, which, given the difficult material conditions and the primitive state of culture and hygiene, means the enslavement of women, that is, the return to pre-October times.  We’ll examine these assertions one at a time.  Revolutionary internationalism gives way to the cult of the fatherland in the strictest sense.  This is false. Internationalism was still vigorously promoted; witness the Soviet Union’s support for the working class in Spain (discussed below).  It was the whole Soviet Union, not just the communists, that the fascists would attack. But only a small percentage of Soviet citizens were communists. Non-communists, the vast majority of the population, were encouraged to be loyal to their country, the Soviet Union. Furthermore, since the Soviet Union was the homeland of socialism and the headquarters of the worldwide communist movement, why shouldn’t communists too be loyal to it?  Officers’ ranks were indeed re-established in the belief that this was necessary for a strong army. Red Army officers had been trained along the lines of, and in many cases by, military men from Western capitalist countries. Sharp differentials in wages for more productive work, as in the Stakhanovite movement, and “one-man management” for managers, were believed to be necessary for higher productivity.  These measures contradicted the move towards egalitarianism, a hallmark of development towards a communist society. But the Soviet Union was not even fully “socialist” yet. If the fascists defeated it they would never see either socialism or communism.  So, Stalin and the Party compromised on principle in order to move towards communism later, after defeating the fascists. Stalin did begin to do this after the war. But his efforts were cut shot by his death. For more on Stalin’s post-war efforts to move towards communism see Part II of my essay “Stalin and the Struggle for Democratic Reform.”[27]  Sedov / Skopic:  The old communist workers are pushed into the background …  There is no evidence for this, or even an explanation of what it means. Who were these “old communist workers”? Since this was written by Sedov, Leon Trotsky’s son and closest political confidant, it probably means that workers loyal to Trotsky were no longer promoted within the Party or the trade unions. Naturally enough – Trotsky’s followers within the USSR were involved in serious anti-Party and anti-Soviet conspiracies.  Sedov / Skopic:  The old petit-bourgeois family is being reestablished and idealized in the most middle-class way …  This is incoherent. When was the family every disestablished? Skopic does not tell us. But see comments on “socialism” below.  … abortions are prohibited, which, given the difficult material conditions and the primitive state of culture and hygiene, means the enslavement of women, that is, the return to pre-October times.  Abortion on demand was made illegal -- see the more detailed discussion below. However, the benefits granted to mothers shows that Skopic is wrong -- there was no “return to pre-October times.”  The “Trotsky Cult”  Trotsky hated Stalin. He had no incentive to be objective or truthful about Stalin and Soviet society of his day. In my books I have shown in detail that Trotsky lied about Stalin too many times to count. If Skopic doesn’t know this he has no business writing about the Stalin-era Soviet Union at all.  Skopic himself admits that “there are layers of irony to this passage” from Sedov’s book. Why then does he quote from it? Critical of the “great man” cult around Stalin – rightly so – Skopic has fallen prey to the “great man cult” around Trotsky!  The Stalin “cult of personality” thankfully died decades ago. Stalin himself strongly opposed it, as I have shown in Khrushchev Lied. But the “Trotsky cult” lives on, nourished by the falsehoods of overtly anticommunist historians and an uncritical attitude towards Trotsky’s own writings. I have published four books in which I show that Trotsky lied to an extent scarcely believable, especially about Stalin and anything to do with him.[28]  Trotsky incited his clandestine supporters to assassinate Soviet leaders and sabotage the economy, conspired with Marshal Tukhachevsky and other high-ranking military commanders to sabotage the Red Army, and with Nazi Germany and fascist Japan to stab the army in the back in the event of invasion.[29] Trotsky agreed to abolish the Communist International, and to divide up the country to give Ukraine to Germany and the Pacific coast to Japan. Some communist!  Skopic:  … the working class found itself increasingly micromanaged and exploited under Stalin.  Skopic does not know what “exploitation” means. It is the private appropriation of the surplus value produced by the working class. Nothing of the kind occurred in the Soviet Union during Stalin’s time. Salary differentials between managers and workers, whether desirable, necessary, or not, are not “exploitation.”  Skopic:  … new labor-discipline laws introduced in 1938 and 1940 made it a criminal offense to be more than 20 minutes late to work, punishable by dismissal at minimum and sometimes actual imprisonment.  By 1938 the Soviet Union was preparing for the inevitable war that Stalin, with uncanny accuracy, had predicted in 1931 would happen in ten years.  We are 50 or 100 years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in 10 years. Either we do it, or we shall go under.[30]  Military men were drafted and then subject to discipline. Why should workers, whose production would be a make-or-break matter in the upcoming war, be permitted to be absent or to move to try for a better job somewhere else? Production for the social welfare took precedence over the individual desire to “get ahead.”  Skopic:  The hated “domestic passports” used by the Tsars were reintroduced, forcing workers to show their “papers” to police at a moment’s notice, and justify why they were in a given area. If they couldn’t, this too could lead to arrest and prison time.  Passports were instituted, but not like under the Tsars. Pre-Soviet Russia was indeed an exploitative society. In the Soviet Union there was no appropriation of the value produced by the working class to private capitalists. All production benefited the working class as a whole.  The Soviet Union ran on a planned economy, not a market-based capitalist economy. Unlike in the capitalist world, jobs were guaranteed. But moving around to get the best job sabotaged the economic plan and production, so it was restricted.  Passports were also needed to control the movement of population, particularly to prevent a flood of immigration to the big cities. It was essential to develop the trans-Ural USSR, the Asian areas and Siberia, and to guarantee sufficient labor power on the collective farms that fed the whole society..  Skopic:  The government even resorted to strikebreaking and the suppression of labor power, arresting workers en masse in the cotton-mill town of Teikovo when they organized a short-lived strike against food rationing.  The state had an economic plan for the allocation of scarce resources. The plan called for shared scarcity. It was not an attempt at super-exploitation to make a rich boss even richer, as under capitalism.  The Teikovo strike and a few others were indeed protests against an increase in food prices. This was 1932, when industrialization was just beginning, collectivization was still under way, and the economy was very fragile.  Bolshevism had offered a promise of total liberation for working people, but now, Stalinism delivered the opposite.  Skopic has a bourgeois – i.e., a capitalist – idea of liberation.  The working class in the Stalin-era Soviet Union was indeed liberated from exploitation of worker-produced value by private capitalists. However, communist liberation cannot mean “freedom to do what you want, when you want.” Real liberation is only possible when there is a strong commitment to the collective good.  Skopic:  The point about “revolutionary internationalism,” too, deserves a closer look. At first glance, this might seem like an arcane Trotskyist grievance, but the consequences for people around the world were very real. To the extent that he believed in anything, Stalin was a firm believer in “socialism in one country”—that is, the idea that the Soviet Union should focus on its own industrial development, compete with the West on that basis, and remain detached from any form of global class struggle. The old slogan “workers of the world, unite!” was abandoned, and the Soviet state became either indifferent or actively hostile to the efforts of socialist movements in other countries, even as those movements looked to it for support and guidance.  This is simply a series of outright lies. Skopic has no evidence to support any of these allegations. Skopic has chosen to believe Leon Trotsky’s unsupported claim that building socialism in one country was in contradiction to building for revolution in other countries. This is not true (see the quotations from Robert Tucker and Lars Lih above).  During Stalin’s time the Communist International, or Comintern, was established in virtually every country in the world. The Soviet Union committed vast resources to supporting communist parties worldwide.  After Adolf Hitler smashed the Communist Party of Germany, the largest communist party in the world at that time outside of the Soviet Union, the Comintern saw that there was no chance for a socialist revolution any time soon in the industrialized countries of the world. It decided that fascism was the greatest danger to the world’s working class, so it downplayed organizing for communist revolution in order to try to make alliances with anti-fascist capitalist governments. Soviet and Comintern leaders were convinced that the USSR, the only country in the world that had no allies, could not defeat the impending fascist attack alone.  This strategy worked to a degree, in the sense that the Soviet Union managed to create an alliance with the major capitalist powers in World War II against the fascist powers. Victory against the Axis led to communist revolutions in China, Yugoslavia, Albania, and ultimately in Vietnam after the defeat of the United States.  The Soviet Union and the Comintern were also the principle forces behind anti-colonial struggles throughout the world. The Western imperialist countries of the so-called “Free World,” all of them self-styled “democracies,” never permitted democracy in their colonies, which they exploited with a murderous hand.  Soviet Aid to the Spanish Republic  Skopic:  In the Spanish Civil War, for example, the USSR lent a limited amount of military aid to the Republican forces battling Francisco Franco.  Skopic is in error. The USSR sent massive amounts of aid to Spain despite its own need to build up its military in advance of the inevitable war with the Axis.  The Soviet Union was generous in supplying military equipment to the Spanish Republic even though it was building up its own military as fast as possible too. On November 2, 1936, Kliment Voroshilov, Commissar for Defense, wrote to Stalin as follows:  Dear Koba! I am sending a letter of the property which, though it will hurt us, may be sold to the Spaniards... You will see that the list is for a rather substantial number of weapons. This can be explained not only by the great needs of the Spanish army and artillery, but also because Kulik (in my opinion, rightly) decided to finally free ourselves of some foreign-made artillery—British, French and Japanese—totaling 280 pieces, or 28% of the weapons of the category in our artillery parks. The most painful of all will be sending off the aircraft, but this is needed more than anything else, and therefore it must be given.[31]  This private note, never intended for publication, proves Stalin’s commitment to proletarian internationalism in Spain.  The Spanish Republican government paid for some of this aid with gold. But the Soviets kept sending military equipment in 1938 and even in 1939, when there was no hope that the Republic could pay for it. Helen Graham, a world expert in the Spanish Civil War, has written:  … the Soviet Union actually also gave some big credits to the Republic in the course of 1938 which it must have known it would have absolutely NO chance of recouping (especially by the second half of that year) …[32]  In her 2002 book The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939 Graham writes:  In July [1938] [Prime Minister] Negrín sent his former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Marcelino Pascua (from spring 1938 ambassador in Paris) back to Moscow with the request. Stalin agreed to make a $60 million loan available to the Republic. This was in addition to the $70 million agreed the previous February. But this second loan was made when there was virtually no gold to back it. Without the July credit the Republican war effort could not have survived through the second half of 1938.[33]  In The Spanish Civil War: A Very Short Introduction (2005) Graham writes:  In 1937 Soviet industrial production was still in a turmoil of reorganization, made worse by the purges, and throughout the war in Spain real Soviet production levels remained anything up to 50% below the published ones. Given this situation, it is surprising that Stalin sent even as much domestically produced materiel to the Republic as he did. This was high quality – most crucially the planes and tanks – and, as we have seen, it was vital to Republican survival, especially at the start. (88)  These scholars and documents give the lie to Skopic’s claim. In fact, the Soviet Union “gave even though it hurt.”  Skopic continues:  But at the same time, Stalin dictated the policy line of the Spanish Communist Party (Partido Comunista de España, or PCE), which was fiercely loyal to Moscow, and through this mouthpiece, he made it painfully clear that there would be no workers’ revolution as a result of the war. Instead, the PCE mandated a “united front” with a so-called “progressive bourgeoisie”—in other words, any part of the ruling class that wasn’t actively fascist …  The Soviets and the PCE believed that no workers’ and peasants’ revolution was possible as long as Nazi Germany and fascist Italy were arming and fighting alongside Francisco Franco’s army. Western powers feared a Bolshevik-type revolution in Spain much more than they feared Franco, a fellow capitalist and imperialist.  All the Spanish Republic’s governments were firmly capitalist. What they really wanted was aid from the non-fascist European powers, mainly Britain and France. They accepted Soviet aid because the Western powers, including the United States, refused them.  The hope of the Soviets and the Comintern was to defeat Franco, leaving the Spanish Republic as a liberal democracy with a strong and militant working-class movement and a large communist party. Then they could organize for revolution.[34]  But this was exactly what the Western imperialist countries, together with the leaders of the Republican government, did not want. They much preferred a fascist, anticommunist, and capitalist Spain.  Understandably, many Spanish communists refused to follow these high-handed orders, especially in the POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista, or Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification—the other, non-Stalinist communist party in the mix). So, the Stalinists pressured the Republican government to declare the POUM an illegal organization, causing open conflict between the two factions.  This is false. Dominated by anti-Soviet Trotskyists, the POUM was one of the forces that led a rebellion – in fact, an abortive attempt at a revolution -- against the Spanish Republic while the war against Franco was going on. This 1937 revolt, called the “Barcelona May Days,” was a stab in the back of the Republic that had to draw resources from the anti-Franco war to suppress it.  Franco and Nazi agents were also working to bring about a split in the Republican forces that culminated in the “May Days’ revolt. The Soviets knew this from their agents. Trotsky had sent Erwin Wolf, his most trusted aide, to Spain, where he became a top adviser to POUM. POUM leader Andres Nin had also been a top political aide of Trotsky’s. Kurt Landau, another Trotskyist, was a POUM adviser too.  For more details and evidence see my article “Leon Trotsky and the Barcelona 'May Days' of 1937.”[35]  Skopic:  As Jesús Hernández, a high-ranking member of the PCE, recalls in his memoirs, POUM founder Andreu Nin was captured by agents of Stalin’s NKVD, who tried to make him confess to being a fascist traitor …  Skopic goes on to quote from this former Spanish Communist who claims that Nin was tortured and then killed when he would not confess. But Jesús Hernández is not a reliable source.  According to Paul Preston, one of the greatest historians of the Spanish Civil War,  Unfortunately, Jesús Hernández fell into the clutches of Joaquín Gorkín and the Congress for Cultural Freedom. In consequence, his work was manipulated by Gorkín and, I believe, contains several falsifications.[36]  Preston recommends a study by Herbert Southworth and another by Fernando Hernández Sánchez. Both question the objectivity of Jesús Hernández’s book.  Southworth:  According to Gorkin … José Bullejos, Secretary-General of the Spanish Communist Party from 1925 until his expulsion in 1932, informed him that Jesús Hernández wanted to talk with him. It was common knowledge among the Spanish groups in Paris that Gorkin could help to publish anti-Communist books. Gorkin, according to Gorkin, replied to Bullejos: ‘I cannot clasp the hand of Jesús Hernández so long as he has not denounced in a book the Stalinist crimes in Spain and, precisely, the details about the imprisonment and assassination of Andrés Nin’.  Gorkin, in effect, had indicated to Hernández the conditions under which his book could be published. ‘Six months later’, Gorkin continued, ‘after my return to Paris, I received the text of Hemández’s book ‘Yo fui un ministro de Stalin’. Hernández had followed the instructions given by Gorkin … (267)  [Gorkin’s book] contained … thirty pages from Jesús Hemández’s Yo fui un ministro de Stalin, the manuscript of which, as I have indicated above, was corrected following Gorkin’s instructions to overstate the significance of the murder of Andrés Nin, turning it into the pivotal incident of the Spanish Civil War. Unsurprisingly, these pages from Hernández’s opus gave exaggerated importance to the POUM and to the political role of Julián Gorkin. (290-1)  … since the CIA, and its affiliate the Congress [for Cultural Freedom – GF], grouped together, constituted a major world-wide influence for right-wing causes, its centralizing force ineluctably, however haphazardly, pulled into its orbit all those persons interested in besmirching the Spanish Republicans. Among the leading candidates for this kind of work were Julián Gorkin and Burnett Bolloten.[37] (307)  Hernández Sánchez doubts that Jesús Hernández simply followed Gorkin’s hints in order to get his book published. But he does not deny that the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a front of the American C.I.A., was involved in publishing his book. No genuine communist would accept support from such a source. Hernández Sánchez also records that Ricardo Miralles, a biographer of Juan Negrin, questions the accuracy of Jesús Hernández’ book on several grounds.[38]  No one claims that Jesús Hernández was a witness to Nin’s interrogation, so his account is hearsay in that regard. But the story of Nin’s arrest, supposed “torture,” and murder by communist and Republican police have become a mainstay of anticommunist historiography of the Spanish Republic.  There is no evidence that Nin was tortured. Paul Preston believes he was not.  The often-unreliable Jesús Hernández claimed that Nin was tortured and interrogated by Orlov and others for several days, in an effort to make him sign a ‘confession’ of his links with the fifth column. This is highly unlikely; a confession was needed as the basis for a trial, and, for that, Nin would have to be seen to be in good physical shape and testify that he had not been tortured.[39]  Preston assumes here that Nin had no relation to the fifth column (Francoist forces within the Republic). It is more accurate to say that we don’t know whether he did or not. There is good evidence that Trotskyists and German and Francoist agents were both involved in the “May Days” revolt in Barcelona.[40] (See my article for more details and documentation.)  Far from securing a united front, Stalin’s meddling had snuffed out any hope of resistance, and Spanish fascism reigned supreme.  No one has ever cited any evidence that a proletarian revolution could have been victorious in Spain in 1937, much less one led by an unstable coalition under anticommunist leadership, Trotskyist (POUM) and anarchist. Even George Orwell, whose Homage to Catalonia was a Cold War-anticommunist hit, later conceded that the Spanish Republic was doomed by the “democratic” Allies, who blockaded aid to the Republic while allowing Hitler and Mussolini to send enormous amounts of materiel, airmen, and soldiers, to aid Franco. In 1942, Orwell wrote:  The Trotskyist thesis that the war could have been won if the revolution had not been sabotaged was probably false. To nationalize factories, demolish churches, and issue revolutionary manifestoes would not have made the armies more efficient. The Fascists won because they were the stronger; they had modern arms and the others hadn’t. No political strategy could offset that … in the most mean, cowardly, hypocritical way the British ruling class did all they could to hand Spain over to Franco and the Nazis. Why? Because they were pro-Fascist, was the obvious answer. Undoubtedly they were ...[41]  Skopic recognizes that “nobody, not even the Yugoslav Communists, spoke of revolution.” But Skopic knows better! Sure, he does! So, he still blames Stalin for the fact that  it took until 1945 for Yugoslavia to actually become a socialist nation—a much longer and bloodier struggle than it might have been.  No one believed that socialist revolution was possible while a country, whether Yugoslavia or Spain, was occupied by Hitler’s army. Yugoslav partisans were not able to expel German troops until 1945. They could only do it then because three-quarters of Hitler’s army was fighting the Red Army. This was the help that “Stalin” (read: the Red Army and Soviet people) gave to make the revolution possible in Yugoslavia.  Skopic:  When Greek communists begged Stalin for help in their own civil war, their pleas fell on deaf ears. Stalin, it turned out, had promised to stay out of Greece and Turkey in a backroom deal he made with Churchill, in exchange for greater influence over the Balkans—and he valued his word to an arch-imperialist more than the lives of the Greek partisans. Across the ocean, Harry Truman had no such qualms, and supplied the Greek far right with both military advisors and napalm. The revolution burned to ash.  Skopic falsely assumes that the Soviet Union had the capability of facilitating a revolution in Greece. But Stalin knew that the Red Army was not prepared for a war with the US and Great Britain. The Soviets were probably aware that within a month or so of the end of the war the Western capitalists were considering a joint Allied attack on Soviet forces in Europe – “Operation Unthinkable.”[42] Stalin appears to have also harbored an illusory hope that the USSR could maintain a peacetime Grand Alliance with the “Allies.”[43]  Homophobia and Abortion  Skopic discusses the law of 1933 criminalizing homosexuality and the later law outlawing abortion on demand while permitting exceptions for medical reasons. What Skopic does not reveal is that the Soviet policy on (male) homosexuality was in accord with medical – that is, scientific – opinion in the advanced capitalist countries.  In the 1930s virtually all Soviet doctors had been trained before the Revolution. The few doctors trained after the Revolution had been educated by the older doctors. Soviet medical science followed that of the European capitalist countries.  It is idealism to fault the Bolsheviks for not somehow knowing that the best contemporary medical opinion was based more on age-old prejudice than on science. Homosexuality and abortion were not legalized in capitalist countries until 40 years later or more.  Skopic:  When the Scottish Marxist Harry Whyte, then working for the Moscow Daily News, wrote his own impassioned letter to Stalin defending gay rights, Stalin’s answer was blunt, scrawled across the letter in pencil: “An idiot and a degenerate.” (To the archives the letter went.)  But even Whyte himself expressed in this letter what we would regard today as prejudiced views about certain types of homosexuality:  When we analyze the nature of the persecution of homosexuals, we should keep in mind that there are two types of homosexuals: first, those who are the way they are from birth … second, there are homosexuals who had a normal sexual life but later became homosexuals, sometimes out of viciousness, sometimes out of economic considerations.  As for the second type, the question is decided relatively simply. People who become homosexuals by virtue of their depravity usually belong to the bourgeoisie, a number of whose members take to this way of life after they have sated themselves with all the forms of pleasure and perversity that are available in sexual relations with women.[44]  Skopic:  The homophobic law remained on the books until 1993, and it decimated the Soviet LGBT community, sending thousands to the Gulag …  Skopic hasn’t even read the text of this law! It does not mention lesbian sex, bisexual persons, or transsexuals. Only sexual relations between men were illegal. Moreover, Skopic does not know how many people were imprisoned under this law. The article linked at this point in Skopic’s essay refers to the 1970s and 80s, not to the much-earlier Stalin period.  Abortion  Abortion on demand was made illegal -- as it was in capitalist societies at that time, and for the same reason: medical opinion opposed it (abortion for medical reasons was of course permitted).  Skopic mentions that the Soviet state provided “paid maternity leave and cash allowances for childcare supplies.” He comments that this Soviet provision of aid to mothers was more progressive even than many capitalist states today, much less at the time.  In today’s capitalist world, where increasing numbers of young people simply can’t afford to have children and are pressured to return immediately to work when they do, some of this might sound genuinely nice.  But then Skopic claims that being supportive to mothers was not Stalin’s intention:  But Stalin was less concerned with helping women or children as such, and more with replacing the devastating loss of population the USSR had suffered in the first World War (to say nothing of his own purges and manufactured famines).  Skopic is determined to portray Stalin in negative tones. But the text of the Soviet law (see below) goes far beyond anything in contemporary capitalist societies at the time. This law was clearly progressive for its time! So Skopic claims that Stalin did not support it for progressive reasons! Skopic cannot possibly know what Stalin’s intentions were – what he was “concerned with.”  Skopic refers to “manufactured famines” -- plural. But there were no “manufactured famines.” There were four famines in the USSR during the 1920s, all due to the devastation of war, disease, and natural causes. The great famine of 1932-33 was entirely due to natural causes. The last famine of Soviet times was in 1946, due to weather conditions that high Western Europe hard as well. I discuss Soviet famines and the research on them in the first two chapters of Blood Lies[45] and the first chapter of Stalin Waiting for … the Truth.[46]  Skopic also doesn’t know that a “purge”—”chistka” in Russian -- was a periodic process of verification of Party membership cards to make sure that Party members were active and not engaged in anything immoral or illegal. The penalty for failing the purge was expulsion from the Party, usually with a chance to reapply after a certain period.  Skopic quotes from a 1946 article by Soviet revolutionary and ambassador Alexandra Kollontai promoting motherhood for Soviet women. Famous for her feminism, Kollontai’s support for motherhood reflects the progressive opinion of that time.  Skopic then quotes from an account by Anna Akimovna Dubova, a Soviet woman who recalled her own illegal abortions. Dubova’s father was a kulak, and her parents were Old Believers who considered the Bolshevik Revolution to be the work of Antichrist. Her anticommunist background may help to explain why Dubova’s account contains an important falsehood (see below).  In the source from which Skopic got Dubova’s story she reveals that she had one child with her husband, who went off to war. Then she lived with another man who abandoned her. Then her husband returned, and she had another child. Later she married at least twice more, and had two abortions. She said:  … So many women died, leaving small children, and so many were sent to prison. Women who had the abortions and suffered were sent to prison, and those who performed the abortions were also sent to prison. …  This is not true. Women who had illegal abortions were not imprisoned. Dubova herself was not imprisoned. Either her memory failed her here, or she deliberately lied to make the Soviet policy appear worse.  The law reads in part:  4. В отношении беременных женщин, производящих аборт в нарушение указанного запрещения, установить как уголовное наказание, общественное порицание, а при повторном нарушении закона о запрещении абортов — штраф до 300 рублей.  4. With regard to pregnant women who have an abortion in violation of the said prohibition, to establish as a criminal punishment, public censure, and in case of repeated violation of the law on the prohibition of abortion - a fine of up to 300 rubles.  It’s worthwhile citing the title of the law (we won’t reproduce the text of the law in full – it’s too long):  Decree on the Prohibition of Abortions, the Improvement of Material Aid to Women in Childbirth, the Establishment of State Assistance to Parents of Large Families, and the Extension of the Network of Lying-in Homes, Nursery schools and Kindergartens, the Tightening-up of Criminal Punishment for the Non-payment of Alimony, and on Certain Modifications in Divorce Legislation.[47]  As far as I can determine, no capitalist state at the time provided such benefits to mothers.  Skopic uses this quotation for an anti-Stalin rant:  This, to put it mildly, does not sound like the actions of any socialist state worthy of the name. Instead, it sounds like something Ted Cruz or Ron DeSantis would do if you gave them unlimited power.  When it comes to Stalin and the Soviet Union Skopic is incapable of being objective. His absurd statements here and elsewhere show that he is prejudiced against Stalin to the point where his judgment is disordered. The anti-abortion movement in the US – “Cruz and DeSantis” -- shows no interest in providing the benefits to mothers that the Soviet state was providing in the 1930s.  We must evaluate the Soviet – Stalin’s – policy on abortion on demand not according to the views of progressive people today but in the context of its time and in total, including the benefits to mothers. Viewed historically, Soviet policy was indeed progressive.  Skopic:  One starts to suspect there’s a reason most of the Stalinists you encounter today are straight men; certainly you can’t call yourself any sort of feminist and defend policies like this.  This further illustrates the fallacy of taking things out of historical context. Even Skopic concedes that well-known Soviet feminist Alexandra Kollontai, a progressive in her day, supported this policy in the 1940s.  Art  Skopic doesn’t know or, evidently, care anything about Soviet arti.  But these currents existed in an uneasy tension with “socialist realism,” the brainchild of Anatoly Lunacharsky—a Bolshevik commissar who believed that art should be used for didactic purposes, to depict “ideal” workers and communities and instruct people in how they ought to be living their lives.  Skopic gives no evidence for this statement. I cannot find any either. But here is what scholar of Soviet art K. Andrea Rusnock says about Lunacharsky:  Verbally. Lunacharsky was proclaiming [in 1922] that realist art was the appropriate vehicle for conveying the events of the Bolshevik revolution, its achievements, and the heroes and heroines, of the new Soviet state. Despite his words, however, and the party's increasing pressure, Lunacharsky did continue to support avant-garde art until his 1928 resignation as Commissariat of Enlightenment.[48]  Skopic does not cite any source for his misunderstanding of socialist realism. Indeed, there is no single authoritative definition. Here is what Maksim Gorky wrote about it in 1934:  Социалистический реализм утверждает бытие как деяние, как творчество, цель которого — непрерывное развитие ценнейших индивидуальных способностей человека ради победы его над силами природы, ради его здоровья и долголетия, ради великого счастья жить на земле, которую он, сообразно непрерывному росту его потребностей, хочет обрабатывать всю, как прекрасное жилище человечества, объединённого в одну семью.[49]  Socialist realism affirms being as an act, as creativity, the purpose of which is the continuous development of the most valuable individual abilities of mankind for the sake of his victory over the forces of nature, for the sake of his health and longevity, for the sake of the great happiness of living on the earth, all of which he, in accordance with the continuous growth of his needs, wants to cultivate everything, like a beautiful dwelling of mankind, united in one family  Elsewhere in his essay, but not in this context, Skopic quotes Sheila Fitzpatrick, a mainstream anticommunist historian of the Soviet Union. Here is what Fitzpatrick writes about socialist realism:  The formula of “socialist realism’? which the [Soviet Writers’] Union adopted was not originally conceived as a “party line,” any more than the Union was conceived as an instrument of total control over literature. Both were initially intended to cancel out the old RAPP line of proletarian and Communist exclusiveness and make room for literary diversity [50]…  According to literary historian Lawrence Schwartz,  There is direct evidence to support the contention of liberalization. It is true that a plan for literature was devised, but also that it was not devised by Stalin as a devious ploy for dictatorial control over literature. The guidelines on literature were established not as a separate category but as part of a general Party effort to create a working relationship with fellow travelers.[51]  Skopic:  When Stalin took power, he favored this more authoritarian take on art and put strict new restrictions on both the styles that could be used and the content that could be depicted. Non-representational art came to be viewed as “decadent” (just as it was “degenerate” to the Nazis), and it was usually forbidden to display it.  This is all wrong. Stalin had “taken power” by 1927; socialist realism dates from the All-Union Writers’ Congress of 1934. Moreover, no one suggests that Stalin had anything to do with socialist realism or that he – Stalin – put any restrictions on the style and content of art. Nor does Skopic document his claim that non-representational art was considered “decadent”?  Instead, public space became an endless gallery of kitsch, with propaganda posters showing muscular Soviet workmen hammering rocks, driving tractors, and gazing sternly into the distance. Predictably, many of the posters were tacky heroic portraits of Stalin himself: Stalin marching with happy workers, Stalin holding a baby, Stalin steering a big boat marked “CCCP.”  Skopic does not like socialist realism and representational art. But who cares what Skopic believes? “Kitsch” is simply a term of insult, a way of avoiding historical accuracy.  Skopic confuses fine art with poster art. The Soviets reproduced paintings on postcards for mass distribution and in larger formats for local exhibitions. Exhibitions of original art works took place mainly in cities.  Art for Whom?  Moreover, Skopic fails to understand a basic question: What kind of art should be encouraged? What kind of art can best serve not the individual vision of the artist, but the working class? Skopic values the individual vision. Socialist realism promoted art that was intelligible to and reflected the interest of the collective.  Skopic:  If any artist refused to work in socialist realism, or wanted to use a different style, their work as a whole could be banned; this happened to [Pavel] Filonov, who lived in grinding poverty until his death in 1941.  This is not true. According to the biography of Filonov by Anna Laks:[52]  Филонов все 1930-е бедствует, недоедает, одалживает у жены и сестры деньги, судорожно ищет заказы ... Но позиций не сдает, своих работ не продает, потому что знает, заказ — это заработок, а его личное, свободное творчество вместе со школой — это святое, это его миссия, это его пространство, это его храм, где не место ни иноверцам, ни торговцам.  Throughout the 1930s Filonov lived in poverty, malnourished, borrowing money from his wife and sister, frantically looking for orders … But he doesn’t give up his positions, he doesn’t sell his works, because he knows that an order means wages, and his personal, free creativity, together with his school, is sacred, this is his mission, this is his space, this is his temple, where there is no place for non-believers or merchants.  Ему часто хотят заплатить деньги, приручить, „законтрактовать”, купить его работы из мастерской. Он отказывается от очень многих заманчивых предложений, если в их „идеологии” чувствует что-то не свое, „нефилоновское” … (75)  People often want to pay him money, to tame him, to give him a “contract”, to buy his works from the workshop. He refuses very many tempting offers if in their “ideology” he feels something not his own, “non-Filonovian” …  The Soviet state – “Stalin” – did not condemn him to this life. Filonov chose to live in poverty, begging for money from his family, refusing orders for his paintings, refusing to sell his works.  Filonov died during the Siege of Leningrad, where over a million Soviet civilians died.  Skopic:  In some cases, artists who annoyed Stalin were even framed and executed in the same way as his political rivals, as with the poet Titsian Tabidze—a close friend of Boris Pasternak, who barely escaped execution himself.  This is an outright lie. Not one single artist was “framed and executed” during the Stalin period. In fact, there is no evidence that Stalin ever “framed and executed” anyone. By “political rivals” Skopic probably means the defendants in the three Moscow Trials of 1936, 1937, and 1938. These defendants were not Stalin’s “political rivals;” and were not “framed.” On the contrary, we have a great deal of evidence against them. They were certainly guilty of at least those crimes to which they confessed their guilt.[53]  According to his Russian-language Wikipedia page Titsian Tabidze enjoyed a celebration of his poetry in in Moscow and Leningrad at the beginning of 1937. Later that year he was named as a participant in an anti-Soviet conspiracy by several important Georgian nationalists such as Budu Mdivani. Someone has seen his trial transcript, since the witnesses against him are named.[54]  There is no evidence that Boris Pasternak “barely escaped execution.” On the contrary! According to Evgenii Gromov, author of Stalin: Art and Power (2003):  And he [Pasternak] spoke just as sincerely about the revolution in the poems “The Nine Hundred and Fifth Year” and “Lieutenant Schmidt.” Genuine feeling permeated his “Stalinist” poems. People close to Pasternak noted that he had a kind of love for Stalin. And he believed in him … (306)  Gromov goes on to relate the famous story about how Pasternak telephoned Stalin to intercede – successfully, as it turned out -- on behalf of his friend the poet Osip Mandel’shtam.  Skopic:  In yet another area of life, freedom, playfulness, and exploration had been replaced with grim conformity and fear, and these would be the aesthetic markers that defined the USSR in the eyes of the world.  This is just slander. There was nothing “grim,” “conformist” or “fearful” about Soviet art. Exhibitions and reproductions of social realist art drew mass audiences in the Soviet Union and influenced art worldwide including W.P.A. art in the USA.  World War II  Skopic:  Stalinist authors like Furr and Ludo Martens devote many pages to the war years …  This is false. I have never written about the war years. And I am not a “Stalinist,” as I explain at the beginning of this essay. I defend not Stalin, but the truth.  Skopic:  The images of Red Army soldiers throwing open the gates of Auschwitz will live in human history forever, and at Stalingrad alone, more than a million of them gave their lives—more than the U.S. lost in the entire war. But crucially, these are not Stalin’s victories, nor his sacrifices. He, like Churchill and Roosevelt, was sitting safely behind his desk when the real heroism happened.  Stalin himself publicly recognized the fact that the victory over the Axis was due not to himself or other leaders but to the ordinary Soviet people, without whom the leaders are nothing. Here is what Stalin said at the Kremlin reception in honor of the participants in the victory:  I am not going to say anything extraordinary. I have the simplest, most ordinary toast. I would like to drink to the health of the people who have little rank and no distinguished title. To the people who are considered the “cogs” of the great state mechanism, but without whom all of us marshals and commanders of fronts and armies, to put it bluntly, are not worth a damn thing. Some little “screw” goes wrong - and it's all over. I raise a toast to the simple, ordinary, modest people, to the “cogs” that keep our great state mechanism in active condition in all branches of science, economy and military affairs. There are a great many of them, their name is legion, because they are tens of millions of people. These are humble people. No one writes about them, they have no title, are of low rank, but these are the people who hold us like the foundation holds the structure. I drink to the health of these people, our respected comrades.[55]  Skopic continues:  Apart from this, there’s evidence that Stalin and his paranoia actively harmed the Soviet war effort. Because Trotsky had been the original architect of the Red Army, Stalin always viewed its officer corps with deep suspicion and carried out extensive purges in the years 1937-8 just as he had within the Bolshevik Party itself. “Three of the five marshals, thirteen of the fifteen army commanders, and eight of the nine fleet admirals” were executed, according to one account, together with more than 40,000 men who were dismissed from their posts for various small infractions and accusations of disloyalty.  See below about the high-ranking officers who were, in fact, guilty as charged of conspiring with the German General Staff and Leon Trotsky, who also conspired with Germany and Japan..  The best scholarly study of the officers dismissed from service is by G.I. Gerasimov, originally published in Rossiiskii istoricheskii Zhurnal No. 1 (1999).[56] His estimate is 15,557:  В 1937 году было репрессировано 11034 чел. или 8% списочной численности начальствующего состава, в 1938 году - 4523 чел. или 2,5%.  In 1937, 11,034 people were repressed. or 8% of the payroll of the commanding staff, in 1938 - 4523 people. or 2.5%.  Gerasimov explains his use of the term “repressed” as follows::  К репрессированным автор относит лиц командно-начальствующего состава, уволенных из РККА за связь “с заговорщиками”, арестованных и не восстановленных впоследствии в армии.  The author refers to the repressed persons of the commanding and commanding staff dismissed from the Red Army for their connection “with the conspirators”, arrested and not subsequently reinstated in the army.  Not a small number, but far from Skopic’s 40,000.  Skopic continues:  A particularly consequential loss was Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, a military genius who had done more than anyone to modernize the Soviet armed forces, introducing revolutionary tank and aircraft tactics that earned him the title “the Red Napoleon.” For his troubles Tukhachevsky was, like so many, tortured into a false confession of treason and shot.  This is false. Hundreds of pages the investigative materials in the “Tukhachevsky Affair” case of May – June 1937 have now been declassified by Russian authorities. This evidence proves that Marshal Tukhachevsky and the seven other officers tried, convicted, and executed with him on June 11, 1937, were certainly guilty.  Skopic says:  (The confession, on file in Moscow today, still has visible bloodstains on it.)  The tale about “bloodstains on one of Tukhachevsky’s confessions” originated in a report to Khrushchev in 1964[57] and has circulated widely since its publication in 1994. But it is not true.  The document in question has been available to researchers for years now. There are no bloodstains on it. My colleagues Vladimir L. Bobrov, Sven-Eric Holmström, and I devote an entire chapter on the “bloodstains” question in our 2021 book.[58]  Skopic:  These purges left an enormous talent vacuum at the top, which the USSR’s enemies could hardly fail to notice. At the time, General Konstantin Rokossovsky—who was imprisoned for two years, but survived and became a military hero during WWII—said that “this is worse than when artillery fires on its own troops …”  Perhaps Rokossovsky said this, though I can’t find a source. However, Rokossovsky had immense respect for Stalin.  Но настоящий плевок будет впереди, когда Хрущев развернул антисталинскую кампанию. Он попросил Рокоссовского написать что-нибудь о Сталине, да почерней, как делали многие в те и последующие годы. Из уст Рокоссовского это прозвучало бы: народный герой, любимец армии, сам пострадал в известные годы... Маршал наотрез отказался писать подобную статью, заявив Хрущеву:  — Никита Сергеевич, товарищ Сталин для меня святой!  На другой день, как обычно, он приехал на работу, а в его кабинете, в его кресле, уже сидел маршал К. С. Москаленко, который предъявил ему решение Политбюро о снятии с поста заместителя министра. Даже не позвонили заранее... [59]  … when Khrushchev launched an anti-Stalinist campaign. [H]e asked Rokossovsky to write something about Stalin, but in blacker tones, as many did in those and subsequent years. From the lips of Rokossovsky it would have resounded: a national hero, the favorite of the army, he himself suffered in certain years ... The Marshal flatly refused to write such an article, saying to Khrushchev:  - Nikita Sergeevich, for me comrade Stalin is a saint!  The next day, as usual, he arrived at work, and Marshal K.S. Moskalenko was already sitting in his office, in his chair, and showed him the decision of the Politburo to remove him from the post of deputy minister. They didn't even call ahead to tell him.  Stalin personally apologized to Rokossovsky when the latter was released from prison where Yezhov’s men had beaten him.[60]  Skopic:  … and at the Nuremberg Trials, Wehrmacht field marshal Wilhelm Keitel testified that Hitler’s decision to invade the USSR was based partly on his belief that “the first-class high-ranking officers were wiped out by Stalin in 1937, and the new generation cannot yet provide the brains they need.”  Once again, Skopic cites no source. If Keitel did say this, it would have been out of ignorance.  Hitler and Heinrich Himmler knew that Tukhachevsky had been conspiring with Germany, as did others in the German Foreign Ministry. For quotations from the primary sources see Chapters 6 and 12 of Trotsky and the Military Conspiracy.  Skopic:  So not only did Stalin’s “tough decisions” not win the war, but they actually played a part in getting his country attacked and leaving it with a limited capacity to fight back.  Exactly the opposite is the case. In August 1937 Hitler himself told some of his generals that their reliance on Tukhachevsky and the others had failed – the treasonous Soviet generals were “under the ground.”[61]  Fascists Like Not Stalin, But the False Portrayal of Stalin  In the following paragraph Skopic notes that some contemporary fascists and white supremacists claim to admire Stalin. Skopic concludes: “In other words, the two [Stalin and Hitler] were more alike than different.”  Nonsense! These contemporary fascists believe the same phony history that Skopic does. They imagine Stalin as anticommunists like Skopic, Trotskyists, Khrushchev, Gorbachev, and anticommunist “scholars” portray him.  That is, these latter-day racists and fascists are reacting to this false portrayal of Stalin. If they knew the truth about Stalin they would hate him just as the racists and fascists of his day hated him.  Not “Hitler and Stalin” But Hitler and Churchill  It is more accurate to compare to Hitler not Stalin, but political leaders like Winston Churchill and other British leaders, and any or all of the presidents of France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. These supposedly “democratic” leaders killed millions of workers and peasants in their empires. To hundreds of millions of people around the world, the Soviet Union was a beacon in the fight for independence and freedom from the savage repression by Western colonial powers.  Skopic’s final paragraph summarizes many of the lies he has written, and no doubt believes.  Stalin offered the world nothing but weakness: constantly jumping at imaginary threats, alienating potential allies, and dividing the working class against itself.  These claims by Skopic are false on the evidence, as we have demonstrated in detail in published research.  A “strong” movement does not need to arrest poets for using a different style to the approved one. For anyone skeptical of the police or prisons, the idea that it even could is monstrous.  This is a lie. Stalin never did any of these things. It is significant that Skopic himself does not name even one such incident.  … aspects of the Stalinist idea keep popping up—in defenses of dictators like Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad as opponents of “imperialism,” in disdain for feminism and LGBTQ rights as distractions, and in the attitude that anything is justified if it leads to power.  Shortly after Stalin’s death the American C.I.A. reported that Stalin had not been a dictator,[62] Nor does Skopic even attempt to argue that Stalin believed that the quest for power justifies “anything.”  Skopic concludes:  All of this is a poisonous dead end for the left, and the question “how can we be sure you won’t create another Stalin?” is a serious one for future parties and movements to address.  Here is the problem: Stalin has been slandered, falsely accused of many crimes that he never committed. The reasons for this slander are obvious.  Capitalists hate the communist movement because of its magnificent successes. The Revolution of 1917 throughout Russia and the victory against the Whites and the Allied interventionists took place when Lenin was alive. But the rest of the successes of the Soviet Union and the Comintern took place after Lenin’s death when Stalin was in the leadership.  These include:  * Collectivization of agriculture, which put an end to the primitive individual peasant cultivation and ended the cycle of devastating famines that had plagued Russia (including the Ukraine) for at least a thousand years;  * Rapid industrialization, which created an industrial society and a modern army within ten years; Paul Krugman, a leading US economist and columnist, wrote in September 2022: “  Indeed, in the 1950s, and even into the 1960s, many people around the world saw Soviet economic development as a success story; a backward nation had transformed itself into a major world power.[63]  * Through the Third Communist International, or Comintern, led by and headquartered in the USSR, the worldwide anti-imperialist movement in colonial possessions of the phony “democracies.”  * Socialist revolutions in China, Vietnam, Albania, and elsewhere, all led by local communists but inspired and aided by Soviet agents.  * The defense of the Spanish Republic against the fascist and Nazi forces during the Spanish Civil War, the single greatest act of proletarian internationalism in history.  * The defeat of the fascists in World War II.  * Material security for workers: low-cost housing, education, and public transportation, guaranteed employment, vacations, medical care, pensions.  * The promotion of women into jobs and professions traditionally reserved for men.  * The commitment to oppose racism against minority ethnicities and nonwhite peoples.  Conclusion: How Could Skopic Be So Wrong?  Skopic is wrong on every charge he makes against Stalin. But how is this possible? The charges of crimes and misdeeds that Skopic levels against Stalin are generally consistent with what we hear and read about Stalin almost everywhere -- from the mass media, from textbooks, from academic specialists in history. How could all these sources of historical information be wrong? Here is a brief explanation.  The field of “Soviet Studies” has always been the servant of anticommunist propaganda combined with the aim to understand the communist movement for the purposes of maligning and weakening it. The contradiction between understanding Soviet reality and providing anticommunist and anti-Stalin propaganda intensified with the Cold War. It continues today.  A second stream of anticommunist propaganda has concentrated on the figure of Joseph Stalin, the leading political figure in the USSR between the death of Vladimir Lenin in January, 1924, until his own death in March, 1953. The most important forces here are Leon Trotsky, Nikita Khrushchev, and Mikhail Gorbachev.  I first encountered the “Stalin vs Trotsky” conflict within the anti-Vietnam War movement of the ‘60s. During the past two decades I have done a great deal of research on Trotsky’s writings between the mid-20s until his assassination in 1940. Contrary to what I had expected, my research has revealed that Trotsky lied about Stalin so flagrantly and so frequently that at first I found it hard to believe.  Trotsky’s lies became a major source for Nikita Khrushchev, starting with his famous “Secret Speech” to the XX Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) on February 25, 1956. During and especially after the XXII Party Congress in October 1961, Khrushchev sponsored an avalanche of phony “research” by equally phony historians who accused Stalin of innumerable crimes. This material became “evidence” for generations of historians.  About a year after becoming First Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev inaugurated a campaign of accusations and vilification of Stalin that outdid Khrushchev’s. It too was carried out by a phalanx of dishonest historians who published hundreds of books and articles in which Stalin was accused of many terrible crimes.  Instead of exposing this phony research, post-Soviet historians have doubled down on it, accepting Trotsky-, Khrushchev- and Gorbachev-era allegations against Stalin and adding yet more. They have done so despite the enormous number of primary-source documents, largely from former Soviet archives, that have made it possible to examine accusations against Stalin and either verify or – in all, or almost all, cases – disprove them.  Today most falsehoods about Stalin and the Stalin years come from academic historians. These academics draw heavily upon the mountain of anti-Stalin and anticommunist lies produced by Trotsky and under Khrushchev and Gorbachev, and also concoct some of their own.  On the Left Trotskyists repeat Trotsky’s proven lies and repeat the anticommunist lies of “legitimated” academics, while “socialists” – anticommunist social-democrats like Skopic is – do likewise, without the cultlike repetition of the Trotskyists.  * * * * *  I have been studying the allegations of crimes against Joseph Stalin for many years. My intention is to research every one of them.  When I began years ago I thought that it would be only a matter of time – perhaps a year or two – before I discovered that at least one of these allegations against Stalin was true, could be confirmed by primary-source evidence. I was wrong. So far, after several decades of searching, I have yet to evidence that Stalin committed even one crime, much less the myriad crimes that Trotsky, Khrushchev’s men, Gorbachev’s men, and academic researchers have confidently asserted.  I intend to keep looking. Perhaps some day I will discover at least one genuine crime by Stalin that I can truthfully say is supported by the best evidence we have. If and when I do, I will publish it and the evidence to support it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuaWRjb21tdW5pc20uY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvYW50aS1zdGFsaW4tZmFsc2Vob29kcy1mcm9tLXNvY2lhbGlzdC13cml0ZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2021-07-04","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T02:00:00","With Memorial Day weekend nigh and the summer picnic and barbeque season stretching out ahead of us, how could I resist reviewing Raw Dog: The Naked Truth About Hot Dogs, by comedian and writer Jamie Loftus, published today. Since this is a book about hot dogs, a content warning is prudent, and the author herself opens her book with one:  Before we begin, a few content warnings. “But Jamie, content warnings are for babies, I don’t need a ‘content warning.’” Well, mind your business and turn the page then. In this book, there are occasionally frank (pun not intended but cannot access better word at this time) discussions of disordered eating, drug use, violence, and descriptions of working slaughterhouses. Much of the book isn’t about these topics, but some of it is, and I’ve tried to give you a heads-up where those sections are in case you’d rather read ahead. Take care of yourself; it is not worth it to sacrifice your mental health over my hot dog book even though I think it’s pretty good and thanks for picking it up.  Well, this review is going to skip over those unpleasant sections (well, the slaughterhouses and ingredient parts at least, but maybe I’ll keep the sex and drug use bits), because it’s Memorial Day weekend, dammit, and we’re gonna celebrate hot dogs whether you like it or not!  The book for the most part is set up as a cross-country road trip in the late-Covid summer of 2021, with the non-driving author being driven thousands of miles hither and yon by her boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend), accompanied by a cat and an actual canine dog. My state of Arizona is one of the early stops, and here we explore the history and delights of the Sonoran hot dog, grilled and served in a bun sliced at the top but NOT end-to-end, with bacon, tomato, onion, salsa, mayo, mustard, and beans.  They also took a side trip to see The Thing! My heart went pitter-pat, because every time we’ve passed the The Thing? Mystery of the Desert! A Sight to Behold! billboards while driving in southern Arizona, I’ve begged ummm, suggested to my wife that we pull off at exit 322 and see it for ourselves. Alas, she has always nixed the idea. And alas, the author and her boyfriend actually get to the building housing The Thing, but then balk at paying the five-dollar admission. Dammit, they’d just paid $3.50 for a hot dog, but then passed up The Thing over a lousy fiver. I guess I’ll never know the Mystery of the Desert that lies within.  It seems rather fitting that after stopping at a gas station in Texas, Loftus sidetracks into a long, second-by-second description of a five-minute video uploaded to YouTube in 2012 entitled “How It’s Made — Hot Dogs.” Okay, I know I said I would skip the gross, disgusting parts of the hot dog story in writing this review. And so I shall. But let me just say that her five pages describing the video were absolutely hilarious. I would advise you NOT to eat a hot dog while reading these pages, not because of the disgusting details about what you are ingesting, but rather because you will be laughing so hard you’ll probably choke. At the very least, have someone familiar with the Heimlich Maneuver close by.  OK, I lied. I can’t resist. Here is a short sample:  A gigantic pile of randomized, pale raw meat said to include fatty tissue, sinewed muscle, head meat, and some liver is pushed into a tenderizer with a metal rake and pulses pornographically, bouncing as it smooths out in the same pulsed motions of a married couple doing doggy style on a Tuesday night. These are the cuts left on the slaughterhouse floor, only to find a third life in the soon-to-be-thick goop I will spend an entire summer punishing my body with.  Are you still with me? That wasn’t so bad, was it? Believe me, it gets worse. And funnier.  In the New York section of the book, we get a very extended look at the Fourth of July Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island. We learn the history, we meet the competitors, and we learn about other competitive eating contests. We learn the strategies and techniques used to getting over seventy hot dogs down your throat in ten minutes. World Champion Joey Chestnut set the current world record of 76 hot dogs that very summer of 2021 when Loftus was there to witness it. The day before the contest, she writes of Joey Chestnut, “I’ll have a crush on him in twenty-four hours, but you couldn’t pay me to believe that now.”  To be honest, I found the descriptions of the contest, and of competitive eating in general, to be much more horrifying and stomach-turning than any description of vats of pink hot dog precursor goop or even of slaughterhouses. I didn’t laugh nearly as hard or as often, which only shows that each of us carries within our own private catalogue of horrors.  She enters New York City and immediately has a Sabrett hot dog cart delicacy. But then it’s off to Coney Island, and the contest went on for so many pages that I was beginning to think she would leave NYC without partaking of my favorite: Gray’s Papaya. But Loftus does not disappoint. She does indeed give an extended account of the hot dog and papaya drink rivalries in New York. Ah, how I used to love my ‘two dogs and a papaya’ for $3.50 back in the day.  And so it goes around the country, stopping in the most famous hot dog joints in the nation, along with carts, holes-in-the-walls, and other venues. We even get an extended look at the increasingly scarce but beloved Home Depot hot dog, and the famous Costco hot dog, first offered as a $1.50 all-beef hot dog and a drink in 1984, and still only a dollar-fifty today, for an even bigger hot dog and a bigger drink. All you need is that sixty dollar per year membership. As one story goes:  Costco President and CEO W. Craig Jelinek, a man worth more than $100 million, confronts the business’s co-founder Jim Sinegal about the losses incurred by the hot dog deal, according to an interview from 2018. “I came to [Jim] once and I said, ‘Jim, we can’t sell this hot dog for a buck fifty. We are losing our rear ends,’: he said. Sinegal, a billionaire, replied: “If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.”  The stop at Ben’s Chili Bowl in Washington, DC is especially enjoyable. Barack Obama dropped in just ten days before his inauguration to this eatery steeped in Black history. It was a favored stop for the U Street ‘Black Broadway’ musicians like Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and Ella Fitzgerald in the 1950s and 1960s. Martin Luther King, Jr. ate there, and did some planning for the March on Washington. During the riots after King’s assassination in 1968, the restaurant stayed open at the express request of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leader Stokely Carmichael, in order to make sure activists in the streets could eat.  Loftus mixes plenty of serious politics in with the hot dogs. She offers extended riffs on low wage labor in restaurants and slaughterhouses, on the slaughterhouses themselves, on the exploitation of both animals and human labor in the meat industry. We are reminded that Trump ordered the meat industry to stay open as Covid ravaged the nation, leading to a great loss of life among its laborers. We learn about the rape and sexual abuse by her pastor of Anne Beiler, the woman who started Auntie Anne’s Pretzels.  At one point, Loftus cites a purported study that claimed that each hot dog you eat will take 36 minutes off your life, but I think if you enjoy a hot dog now and then, that’s an acceptable tradeoff. There are some 42 million minutes in an 80-year lifespan, which means in order to cut your life in half, you would have to consume around 580,000 hot dogs by your 40th birthday. Even Joey Chestnut isn’t going to do that.  Overall, it was a fun, enjoyable and informative journey, and I recommend it. And I’ll never forget the line “I would have unprotected sex with anything from a Wawa.” If you know, you know.  BOOK NEWS  A few interesting articles on the ongoing war on books and libraries.

"political assassination","2017-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T16:54:30","Back in November, Devlin Barrett (along with WaPo’s Trump-whisperer, Josh Dawsey) published a column claiming investigators had found nothing to suggest that Trump was trying to monetize the documents he stole.  That review has not found any apparent business advantage to the types of classified information in Trump’s possession, these people said. FBI interviews with witnesses so far, they said, also do not point to any nefarious effort by Trump to leverage, sell or use the government secrets. Instead, the former president seemed motivated by a more basic desire not to give up what he believed was his property, these people said.  I mocked Devlin’s credulity at the time. His story was utterly inconsistent with — and made no mention of — several details we (or I) already knew about the documents. It also showed no consideration of the value that the already-described documents would have for Trump’s business partners, the Saudis.  The story was transparently an attempt by someone to prematurely cement an investigative conclusion, almost a month before the stay on DOJ’s access to the unclassified documents seized last August was lifted. Just two days later, Trump announced his bid for another Presidential term, and two days after that, Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith, someone who had no partisan stake in issuing premature exoneration for Trump.  Yesterday, as the NYT published a second substantive story about Jack Smith’s subpoena for information about Trump’s business deals, Devlin published a perfunctory one. Even before he describes the subpoena, Devlin reports a single source concluding, as his sources concluded last November, “nothing to see here.”  But the inquiry produced little that wasn’t already publicly known, this person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal investigation. Prosecutors sought information on any real estate and development deals reached in China, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Oman, the person said. The Trump Organization’s public website lists only one deal in that time frame in one of those countries, Oman, and that deal was done after Trump left the White House.  Devlin’s story notes his earlier report, but not how wildly it conflicted with even the events known at the time, emphasizing China not Iran.  The Washington Post reported last year that while the classified documents included sensitive information about U.S. intelligence-gathering aimed at China, among other subjects, investigators did not see an obvious financial motive in the type of documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago.  NYT’s more substantive story on this inquiry expresses far less certainty than Devlin’s single attributed source about what the subpoena obtained, much less what Smith already had to support this line of inquiry.  The Trump Organization swore off any foreign deals while he was in the White House, and the only such deal Mr. Trump is known to have made since then was with a Saudi-based real estate company to license its name to a housing, hotel and golf complex that will be built in Oman. He struck that deal last fall just before announcing his third presidential campaign. The push by Mr. Smith’s prosecutors to gain insight into the former president’s foreign business was part of a subpoena — previously reported by The New York Times — that was sent to the Trump Organization and sought records related to Mr. Trump’s dealings with a Saudi-backed golf venture known as LIV Golf, which is holding tournaments at some of his golf clubs. (Mr. Trump’s arrangement with LIV Golf was reached well after he removed documents from the White House.) Collectively, the subpoena’s demand for records related to the golf venture and other foreign ventures since 2017 suggests that Mr. Smith is exploring whether there is any connection between Mr. Trump’s deal-making abroad and the classified documents he took with him when he left office. It is unclear what material the Trump Organization has turned over in response to the subpoena or whether Mr. Smith has obtained any separate evidence supporting that theory.  Neither story describes whether the subpoena listed which crimes are under investigation. On that topic, the NYT, as part of boilerplate, repeats the same thing I do when I make boilerplate recitations of the crimes under investigation: 18 USC 793(e), refusing to return classified documents, and 18 USC 1519, obstruction of the efforts to get those classified documents back.  While establishing a motive for why Mr. Trump kept hold of certain documents could be helpful to Mr. Smith, it would not necessarily be required in proving that Mr. Trump willfully maintained possession of national defense secrets or that he obstructed the government’s repeated efforts to get the materials back. Those two potential crimes have long been at the heart of the government’s documents investigation.  Devlin uses similar boilerplate.  The Mar-a-Lago investigation has centered on two potential crimes — possible obstruction for not complying with the subpoena, and possible mishandling of national security secrets for keeping classified documents in an unauthorized location  We are — all of us, myself included — forgetting the third statute included on the search warrant that once seemed a mere backstop to the others, 18 USC 2071, intentionally removing government documents. That statute, which once upon a time might have been used as the crime to which Trump could plead down in a plea agreement, carries only a three year max sentence. But along with that sentence, it disqualifies someone convicted of it from holding public office, something that would be challenged constitutionally following any jury verdict but which would be waived under any plea deal.  Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.  I’ve always believed (as have experts I trust) that this would be a particularly hard crime with which to charge a former President, largely because a President has legal access to these documents until noon on January 20. But asking about business deals Trump might have been pursuing while in the presidency, all the way back to 2017, might provide evidence of intent that predates the actual removal of the documents.  And learning about Trump’s business deals with, especially, the Saudis, might develop evidence for 18 USC 794, the far more serious crime of providing intelligence to help a foreign government.  Let me caution, I still think it exceedingly unlikely that Smith is pursuing 794 charges against Trump for stealing documents and then selling them to the Saudis, to be paid in the form of golf tournaments and branding deals in Oman. Please don’t take from my mention of this that I’m predicting Smith is going to Go There. Rather, I suspect Smith is thinking of a package of potential charges that would give Trump an option to plead down quietly, one sufficiently ugly to make Republican politicians not want to join him in his fight. I’m merely stating that taking documents and refusing to give them back — which is the currently known lead charge in this investigation– is a dramatically different fact set than taking them and sharing them with a foreign government that pays you a lot of money, especially one that subsequently engaged in multiple actions — keeping gas prices high during the election and chumming up to China — that seem to have surprised the US intelligence community, as if some intelligence visibility had gone dark before those happened.  But let me go back to Devlin’s source’s certainty that there’s nothing to see there. It’s an odd claim to make given the number of other gaps in understanding that seem to exist in the understanding of those not directly participating in the investigation.  The story where NYT first broke the Trump business deal subpoena described at least five different subpoenas to Trump Org (though way down at the bottom of the story, it describes “numerous” subpoenas):  The subpoena including the golf deal and — we now learn — all business deals Trump has chased since 2017 A subpoena to Trump Organization seeking additional surveillance footage A subpoena to “the software company that handles all of the surveillance footage for the Trump Organization, including at Mar-a-Lago” First, a subpoena to Matthew Calamari, Jr. Then, a subpoena to Matthew Calamari, Sr.  Matthew Sr., at least, would have visibility on business deals with the Saudis and others. But all the reports on the two interviews with the Calamaris suggest they were focused, instead, on why Walt Nauta contacted them after DOJ first subpoenaed surveillance footage.  To resolve the issue about the gaps in the surveillance footage, the special counsel last week subpoenaed Matthew Calamari Sr, the Trump Organization’s security chief who became its chief operating officer, and his son Matthew Calamari Jr, the director of corporate security. Both Calamaris testified to the federal grand jury in Washington on Thursday, and were questioned in part on a text message that Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, had sent them around the time that the justice department last year asked for the surveillance footage, one of the people said. The text message is understood to involve Nauta asking Matthew Calamari Sr to call him back about the justice department’s request, one of the people said – initially a point of confusion for the justice department, which appears to have thought the text was to Calamari Jr.  Most reporters assume the gaps DOJ is trying to close pertain to Nauta’s own actions in advance of Evan Corcoran’s search of the storage closet. I’m not sure. That’s because DOJ got sufficient visibility from what they did receive to list the storage closet, Trump’s office, and Trump’s residence in the search warrant supporting the August search of Mar-a-Lago. They got sufficient visibility to lead Nauta to revise his testimony afterwards. That’s why I emphasized in my last post on this that DOJ asked for five months of surveillance video, predating the day, by eight days, that Trump sent boxes to NARA in January 2022. The gaps in question might have shown other people, not Nauta, entering the storage closet, or have shown Nauta entering at times entirely removed from the date of the subpoena. If — strictly hypothetically — those gaps coincided with business meetings with foreigners at Mar-a-Lago, it would be a flashing siren saying, “look here for the good stuff.” It might also explain why Nauta immediately reached out to Calamari about the video, if he knew some of that video would show things that were far more damning than the mere attempt to obstruct a subpoena response.  If Nauta had involvement in earlier sketchy activities, predating the subpoena, it might explain why — as Hugo Lowell reported — Nauta fairly obviously attempted to monitor Evan Corcoran’s own search.  The notes described how Corcoran told Nauta about the subpoena before he started looking for classified documents because Corcoran needed him to unlock the storage room – which prosecutors have taken as a sign that Nauta was closely involved at essentially every step of the search. Corcoran then described how Nauta had offered to help him go through the boxes, which he declined and told Nauta he should stay outside. But going through around 60 boxes in the storage room took longer than expected, and the search ended up lasting several days. The notes also suggested to prosecutors that there were times when the storage room might have been left unattended while the search for classified documents was ongoing, one of the people said, such as when Corcoran needed to take a break and walked out to the pool area nearby.  One more thing that might explain prosecutors’ concerns about gaps in the surveillance footage is if they coincided with the times when Corcoran had left the room unattended.  Yet every time someone writes about Nauta, they include language that might come from the vicinity of Stanley Woodward, the lawyer that Nauta shares with Kash Patel (as well as Peter Navarro and convicted seditionist Kelly Meggs and his wife), suggesting that it was a mistake not to immunize Nauta, as DOJ did with Kash, because it has prevented them from substantiating an obstruction case. The version of this in the NYT — which reflects the kind of internal DOJ dissent that WaPo has reported regarding a push to adopt a more cooperative stance in advance of the search — is especially unpersuasive.  Last fall, prosecutors faced a critical decision after investigators felt Mr. Nauta had misled them. To gain Mr. Nauta’s cooperation, prosecutors could have used a carrot and negotiated with his lawyers, explaining that Mr. Nauta would face no legal consequences as long as he gave a thorough version of what had gone on behind closed doors at the property. Or the prosecutors could have used a stick and wielded the specter of criminal charges to push — or even frighten — Mr. Nauta into telling them what they wanted to know. The prosecutors went with the stick, telling Mr. Nauta’s lawyers that he was under investigation and they were considering charging him with a crime. The move backfired, as Mr. Nauta’s lawyers more or less cut off communication with the government. The decision to take an aggressive posture toward Mr. Nauta prompted internal concerns within the Justice Department. Some investigators believed that top prosecutors, including Jay Bratt, the head of the counterespionage section of the national security division at the Justice Department, had mishandled Mr. Nauta and cut off a chance to win his voluntary cooperation. More than six months later, prosecutors have still not charged Mr. Nauta or reached out to him to renew their conversation. Having gotten little from him as a witness, they are still seeking information from other witnesses about the movement of the boxes.  If being misled by Nauta led prosecutors to look more closely at the larger timeline of the missing surveillance video, only to find suspect ties to the Saudis, it was in no way a mistake. On the contrary, Woodward’s own decisions would have directly led to intensified scrutiny of his client (as his decisions similarly are, in the effort to get Navarro to turn over Presidential Records Act documents).  And there’s something that is routinely missed in all of this coverage. The Guardian’s Lowell rightly suggests that because Trump didn’t directly tell Corcoran to search only the storage closet, it might present challenges to an obstruction case. But Trump’s choice to use Nauta as an obvious gatekeeper makes it far easier to charge Nauta with 18 USC 793(g), conspiring to hoard classified documents. So the observation that DOJ hasn’t chosen to charge Nauta with just false statements in the interim six months should in no way be taken as solace by Nauta, because what has happened in the interim puts him at risk of charges that carry a ten year sentence for each document in question rather than the few months he might face for lying to the FBI.  Nauta’s not the only one who might insulate Trump from obstruction charges but expose all of them to greater Espionage Act danger.  Witness the evolution of how Tim Parlatore described Boris Epshteyn’s role in the investigation. In March, Parlatore described that, until such time as Boris started being treated as a target, his access to people “inside the palace gates” was useful.  Mr. Epshteyn’s legal role with Mr. Trump, while less often focused on gritty legal details, has been to try to serve as a gatekeeper between the lawyers on the front lines and the former president, who is said to sometimes roll his eyes at the frequency of Mr. Epshteyn’s calls but picks up the phone. “Boris has access to information and a network that is useful to us,” said one of the team’s lawyers, Timothy Parlatore, whom Mr. Epshteyn hired. “It’s good to have someone who’s a lawyer who is also inside the palace gates.” Mr. Parlatore suggested that he was not worried that Mr. Epshteyn, like a substantial number of other Trump lawyers, had become at least tangentially embroiled in some of the same investigations on which he was helping to defend Mr. Trump. “Absent any solid indication that Boris is a target here, I don’t think it affects us,” Mr. Parlatore said.  But in the wake of Parlatore’s departure from Trump’s legal team a week ago, he went on Paula Reid’s show (on whose show he had earlier told an utterly ridiculous story about Trump using classified folders to block a light by the side of his bed) and lambasted Boris as an impediment to communication between Trump and his lawyers.  Boris Epshteyn [] had really done everything he could to try to block us [the lawyers], to prevent us from doing what we could to defend the President, and ultimately it got to a point where — it’s difficult enough fighting against DOJ and, in this case, Special Counsel, but when you also have people within the tent that are also trying to undermine you, block you, and really make it so that I can’t do what I know that I know that I need to do as a lawyer, and when I’m getting in the fights like that, that’s detracting from what is necessary to defend the client and ultimately was not in the client’s best interest, so I made the decision to withdraw. [snip] He served as kind of a filter to prevent us from getting information to the client and getting information from the client. In my opinion, he was not very honest with us or with the client on certain things. There were certain things — like the searches that he had attempted to interfere with, and then more recently, as we’re coming down to the end of this investigation where Jack Smith and ultimately Merrick Garland is going to make a decision as to what to do – as we put together our defense strategy to help educate Merrick Garland as to how best to handle this matter, he was preventing us from engaging in that strategy. [my emphasis]  At one level, this publicity stunt appears to be an attempt to persuade Trump that he should fire Boris. WaPo’s coverage of this clash describes that Parlatore’s public appearance followed what seems to have been a “he goes or we go” meeting with Trump a week ago (though Jim Trusty, at least thus far, has not chosen to follow Parlatore).  Before this weekend’s public feud, members of Trump’s legal team tried to settle the conflict quietly. Parlatore and another lawyer for Trump, James Trusty, recently traveled to Florida to advise Trump that he needed to remove Epshteyn from the document case and the 2020 election case, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private deliberations. Smith, the special counsel, is tasked with investigating both cases. [snip] Trump did not appear to take Parlatore and Trusty’s advice, as Epshteyn remained in his role as a key legal adviser and coordinator to Trump.  Parlatore has said he’d be willing to return if Boris were gone.  At another level, Parlatore seems to be getting out while the getting is good, shortly before any charges are filed, so he’s not stuck defending an uncooperative client who won’t pay his bills. (Update: WSJ reports that the investigation is all but done and some associates are prepping for Trump to be charged.) The publicity stunt gives him the first say on who is responsible for what comes next, too. If Trump gets charged, Tim Parlatore didn’t fuck up, Boris did.  The publicity stunt, with its claim that Boris lied to both him and Trump, may also be an attempt to insulate Trump. As such it may be little different than the ridiculous folder-on-the-bedside-light story.  But Parlatore’s response to Reid’s follow-up on Parlatore’s claim that Boris interfered with searches may be more than that.  Reid: What searches are those? Parlatore: This is the searches at Bedminster, um, initially. There was a lot of pushback from him where he didn’t want us doing the search and we had to, eventually, overcome him. Reid: Why didn’t he want you to do the search? Parlatore: I don’t know.  Trump’s lawyer do not know — never have! — why Boris was so reluctant to allow a search of the property to which Trump flew to host a Saudi golf tournament directly after failing to comply with a subpoena.  Immediately after that exchange, Reid invited Parlatore to clarify that when he testified to the grand jury in December, he did so in lieu of any custodian of records for the searches done on Mar-a-Lago. Parlatore clarified he did not testify in response to a subpoena and on several occasions, when he offered to come back and clarify, prosecutors declined his generous offer.  Reid then gave him an opportunity to explain why the claims Parlatore made to Congress (which conflicted with known facts and which Epshteyn declined to sign) didn’t fundamentally conflict with the insta-declassification story Boris has told. Parlatore left me convinced that everyone is lying, meaning by choosing to retain Boris over Parlatore, Trump is just picking which lie he finds more convenient.  Nevertheless, Parlatore got his story out. He got to describe how the story he planned to tell Merrick Garland doesn’t conflict with the currently operative declassification story and more importantly, that if his December testimony to the grand jury was incomplete in any way, it’s all Boris’ fault.  Parlatore said, midway between his testimony and now, that if Boris started looking like a target, he might be in trouble. But in the wake of a two day interview between Boris and Smith’s attorneys and in the wake of subpoenas that raise increased questions about why Boris may have tried to prevent any search of the property at which Trump hosted the Saudis immediately after Trump blew off a subpoena, Parlatore took to the TV and offered his defense. If Jack Smith finds the Bedminster obstruction interesting enough, Parlatore may well have earned himself a subpoena.  The belated, convenient description of Boris as a filter rather than worthwhile access “inside the palace gates” is particularly interesting given WaPo’s description about what kind of advice Boris gave, in lieu of legal advice.  Epshteyn, a lawyer, had helped guide communications for Trump’s campaign and the White House. According to the source, Parlatore and Trusty argued that the lawyers needed to focus on protecting Trump legally, not politically. A source close to the Trump campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the team’s private thinking defended Epshteyn and said he is focused on protecting Trump from a variety of angles, whether it’s legal, political or related to the media.  Parlatore imagines he was trying to defend Trump legally. Boris thinks he’s defending Trump from a “variety of angles,” one of which is politics. That’s consistent with how Boris billed his time, which until after the August search he billed as political consulting. But it also suggests Boris was not just a gap in Parlatore’s knowledge, but also a gap in any privilege claims Trump can make over the others.  If Trump’s own ex-lawyer says that Boris was lying to both sides about what went on there’s a big gap in anyone’s knowledge — at least outside the team that has been investigating for a year.  Plus there’s all the stuff — even beyond the evidence collected in this investigation that DOJ would have obtained about these particular documents — that DOJ already knows.  During the Mueller investigation, for example, DOJ spent some time investigating how Trump shared highly classified Israeli intelligence with Russia just days after he fired Jim Comey. That includes the way in which White House staffers altered the MemCon of that meeting (much as, years later, the White House would alter the MemCon of Trump’s perfect phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy). That particular leak of classified information did not violate US law, because as President, Trump could declassify it. But it is precedent for Trump sharing the secrets of America and its allies with foreign countries that have helped him.  More directly on point, DOJ has abundant evidence regarding Trump’s approval of Tom Barrack’s efforts to tailor US policy to serve the Emirates and, secondarily, the Saudis, including to treat Mohammed bin Salman with full diplomatic status. On Barrack’s request, during the course of discovery, DOJ obtained a great deal of information from other agencies about Trump’s policy towards the Gulf Kingdoms. DOJ’s prosecution of Barrack ended in failure. But what it showed is that from the very start, the guy who got Paul Manafort hired did so knowing he could use it to promise to shape US policy to the Emirates’ interests. Like sharing classified information with Russia in 2017, Trump’s choice to shape US policy to serve the Emiratis and Saudis is not illegal. It’s only after he left the presidency where a quid pro quo could be important.  Unless, of course, such business discussions started earlier.  Again, I want to emphasize that I’m not saying Jack Smith is about to indict Trump for selling US secrets to the Saudis. But investigative developments reported out in the last several weeks have suggested that this investigation may not be the obstruction investigation everyone is treating it as.  Instead, Jack Smith may get to obstruction via a conspiracy to hoard classified documents.

"political assassination","2023-05-25","14:00:00","{""SanVicenteDelCaguan"", ""Caqueta"", ""Colombia""}","2023-05-24T05:31:25","Through a statement, the national government reported on May 22 that “the bilateral cessation that currently existed with this armed group in the departments of Meta, Caquetá, Guaviare and Putumayo is suspended and all offensive operations are reactivated”, a measure will become effective. from this Wednesday.  Due to the above, more than 40 Colombian social organizations from the four departments expressed their “concern” about the suspension of the ceasefire between the Colombian Government and the Central General Staff (EMC), the main dissident of the FARC, after the assassination last weekend of four indigenous minors who tried to escape after being forcibly recruited by the Carolina Ramírez Front, which belongs to this group.  The organizations, which make up the Coordination of the Colombian South East for Agrarian, Environmental and Social Processes (Coscopaas), rejected “any type of violence” but warned that “violent actions cannot be responses with decisions that bring more violence.”  Coscopaas was the organizer of the macro-event that this FARC dissidence held in April in the Yarí savannah, in the department of Caquetá, where they announced their desire for peace and assured that a date had already been set for the start of talks with the Government.  “We are concerned about the escalation of the war because the most affected are the unarmed rural communities who have historically suffered cruelty and the systematic violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in our territory,” Coscopaas said in a statement.  Initially, peace negotiations were scheduled to begin on May 16, a date that was never confirmed by the government and was finally postponed without a new estimate.  It may interest you: Claudia López called the government of Gustavo Petro “naive” and “erratic” for its peace policy  Among the claims that the organization made after the decision made, is the reproach for a “lack of political will and commitment of the state to install the monitoring and verification mechanism of the ceasefire” and criticized that “a ceasefire cannot be agreed on fire without first installing a monitoring and verification mechanism”. Likewise, he regretted the “expansion in the installation of the dialogue table and full participation of social organizations in it.”  Finally, he made an “urgent” call to the Government and the EMC to “seek peaceful, coherent and objective dialogue and resume the national ceasefire and urgently install the monitoring and verification mechanism, as a guarantee for a serious and responsible”.  Given the announced decision, the Central General Staff, with Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias “Iván Mordisco” in command, responded to the Petro government that “the unilateral break will unleash the war and the number of dead, wounded and prisoners will multiply, contrary to a total peace policy.  Harsh letter of dissent after suspension of ceasefire  Perhaps the most compelling thing about the letter dated this Monday, May 22, in response to the national government’s decision, is that the dissidents assure that the cessation of hostilities means unleashing a war.  “The unilateral rupture will unleash the war and the dead, wounded and prisoners will multiply, contrary to a policy of total peace,” they said in the document.  The statement is a dispatch against the government of President Petro, which the illegal armed group described as a “supposed government of change” and branded as the “least serious to have conversations.”  They also criticize that the government met with representatives of the United States, referring to the security council on Sunday, May 21, in which the Southern Command of the North American country participated.  From this situation, the armed group said, it “concludes officially and unilaterally breaking the ceasefire, once again violating the established protocol with the pretense of a partial rupture of fire in Meta, Putumayo, Guaviare and Caquetá, an action that In practice, it means breaking with the Farc-EP as a whole and is in line with leaving the Amazon in the hands of NATO, for which the United States gave away a fleet of Black Hawk helicopters.”  Related","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbGF0ZXN0Lm5ld3MvbmV3cy9vcmdhbml6YXRpb25zLWFyZS1jb25jZXJuZWQtYnktdGhlLXN1c3BlbnNpb24tb2YtdGhlLWNlYXNlZmlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Which movies were the most popular, which influencers had their big breakthrough, and what went trending? This is an overview with a full list of all the winners and the moments that got people talking online [Premium Content].  Weibo Night was one of the biggest trends on Weibo this week. Weibo Night (#微博之夜#) is the yearly much-anticipated live-broadcasted ceremony that looks back on Sina Weibo’s hottest celebrities, entertainment productions, and happenings of the last year.  Hosted by the Sina media company, the night has been a recurring event since 2003 – long before the Sina Weibo platform was launched. The night was initially known as the ‘Sina Grand Ceremony’ (新浪网络盛典) until it turned into the ‘Weibo Night’ (微博之夜) in 2010.  During the ceremony of Weibo Night, which took place on the evening of March 25 in Shanghai and was broadcasted live on Weibo and on Sina, various prices were awarded in categories such as ‘The Hottest Weibo Celebrity of the Year’ (微博年度热度人物), ‘The Movie of the Year’ (年度电影), ‘Drama of the Year’ (年度电视剧), ‘Weibo Original Musician of the Year’, and ‘Weibo King & Queen.’  The award ceremony is always much anticipated since it is attended by all the big stars of the Chinese entertainment world, including the most famous actors/actresses, musicians, and online influencers.  What they are wearing is a big part of online discussions on Weibo Night, and with some celebrities changing their outfits during the night, talking about what they wear and who shines the brightest on the red carpet and who sits where is part of the fun.  The hype surrounding the event begins long before the actual award ceremony as Weibo users can vote for their preferred candidates, and the shortlist of winners, based on Sina Weibo’s annual “Weibo Index,” is also published prior to the event.  The event is an important one for Weibo as a platform, not just because it drives massive traffic to the site, but also because all the celebrities have a strong Weibo presence and, throughout the night, express their love for the platform.  It is also important for celebrities, as it is an opportunity for them to promote themselves and the projects they are working on. Many celebrities do special photoshoots before the event and change outfits multiple times to make the most of their participation in the event.  As you can see below, there are so many categories during the award show, and some are actually really similar. This gives the idea that more important than the awards themselves is the showcasing of Weibo’s most popular celebrities.  On Weibo, the event was promoted using the slogan “Make the world more beautiful with the power of Weibo” (“以微博之力•让世界更美”).  Although the award ceremony is taking place in 2023, they are referred to as the 2022 Weibo Night since it mostly covers the year 2022, but also part of 2023, up to Spring Festival. For an overview by What’s on Weibo on the biggest topics of 2022 see this article.  THE RED CARPET  On Weibo, the hashtag “Weibo Night Red Carpet Livestream” (#微博之夜红毯直播#) received a staggering 610 million views this week.  The live stream of the red carpet was suddenly canceled midway, as there allegedly were too many fans gathering, and cancellation was done as a safety precaution.  Some videos surfacing on social media during the day also showed many fans around the area and some food delivery staff shouting out names to bring the right order to the right customer in the midst of the crowds.  MOST IMPACTFUL EVENTS  Weibo Night started with the presenters (Nigermaidi Zechman 尼格买提·热合曼 being one of them) announce an overview of the Weibo news topics that became a part of people’s collective memory over the past year.  The video shows different topics that went trending on Weibo in 2022-2023 with news footage.

He suffers from psychiatric disorders and is under investigation for ""murder"".  [Updated May 23 at 12:01 a.m.] The Reims University Hospital is in mourning. The 38-year-old nurse who was stabbed in a stabbing yesterday died early in the morning of Tuesday, May 23, 2023, Health Minister François Braun announced on Twitter. The nurse was in a very critical condition and the care by her colleagues did not save her. The second person attacked, a 56-year-old medical secretary, still has a worrying state of health, but her vital prognosis is no longer engaged.  The news of the death of one of the two victims of the knife attack prompted the Lille prosecutor's office to reclassify the investigation as ""assassination"". The count of ""attempted murder"" is still in force for the serious injuries inflicted on the victim who is still alive. The attacker of the two carers is still in custody on Tuesday and admitted the facts. His intentions and his profile are becoming clearer.  It was in the early afternoon of Monday, May 22, around 1:30 p.m., that the two women were attacked with a knife by a 59-year-old patient. The man had presented himself a little earlier to the service of the unit of ""medicine and health at work"" of the CHU of Reims and attacked the nurse and the medical secretary in a locker room. The attacker tried to flee but was intercepted in his run by security guards and immediately arrested by the police. The public prosecutor of Reims said Monday evening that the fifty-year-old had been placed in police custody earlier in the day, from 1:40 p.m., ""for acts of attempted assassination"" and for ""assassination"", since the death of one of the victims. The central police station in Reims is in charge of the investigation and the first confessions of the suspect have been obtained.  The author of the knife attack at the Reims University Hospital is a 59-year-old man from Reims with a ""psychiatric history"", according to the details of the Minister of Health, François Braun. The prosecutor himself spoke of ""severe disorders"" and mentioned the ""reinforced curatorship measures"" taken for several years with regard to the suspect. Medically taken care of, the man could have ""stopped his treatment"" according to the mayor of Reims, Arnaud Robinet, guest on RMC on Tuesday May 23.  Placed in police custody, the man admitted to resenting the hospital staff after being mistreated for years in psychiatric services, reports franceinfo. In front of the police, the aggressor also assured that he wanted to “take revenge” at each meeting with a caregiver. It is unclear whether the attack at the Reims University Hospital was premeditated or not, but according to the prosecutor's statement, the suspect ""appears to have acted without apparent motive, especially since he had no appointment in this service"".  The 59-year-old man had already been indicted in the past in Châlons-en-Champagne ""for acts of aggravated violence"" according to information from BFMTV. He then ""benefited in June 2022 from a dismissal order for criminal irresponsibility, and this case was soon to be referred to the investigating chamber of the Reims Court of Appeal to rule on the security measures. likely to be taken"".  Two women were attacked with a knife while working at the Reims University Hospital: a 38-year-old nurse, named Carène, and a 56-year-old medical secretary. The first succumbed to her injuries and died Tuesday morning, said the Minister of Health. The second victim, whose name we do not know, is still hospitalized but his life is, a priori, no longer in danger. She underwent emergency surgery after her attack and left the operating room, she was in the recovery room last night. There is no indication that the two women were personally targeted since the suspect had no motive. He simply expressed his anger towards all members of the medical profession.  Only a few hours after the knife attack at the CHU de Reims, the Minister of Health, François Braun, rushed to the scene to express his support for the medical profession and denounce the attacks targeting caregivers. His predecessor in the ministry, Olivier Véran, also reacted to the news item, Tuesday, May 23 on the airwaves of France Inter, believing that this attack ""is one of the most intense tragedies that can affect our nation"".  But it was not just the political representatives who spoke, the trade unionists also regretted the harm done to their nursing colleagues. ""It sends shivers down our spines that our colleagues have been stabbed in this way. It is inexplicable. [...] Over the last few years, we can see an upsurge in verbal aggression towards - vis-à-vis our healthcare colleagues"", regretted the secretary general FO of the CHU of Reims, Cédric Renard, at the microphone of franceinfo, on May 22. An observation shared by the National Federation of Nurses, whose president says he observes an increase in attacks: ""We are now at a stage where we will have to do something since we have attacks that are more and more violent"". Statements that echo the publication of the census of violence against doctors and health professionals by the National Council of the Order of Physicians and according to which the number of attacks increased by 23% in 2022 with more than 1,200 incidents .","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlbGVic25ldC5jb20vYnJlYWtpbmcvYXR0YWNrLWF0LXRoZS1yZWltcy11bml2ZXJzaXR5LWhvc3BpdGFsLXJldmVuZ2UtcHN5Y2hpYXRyaWMtZGlzb3JkZXJzLWgyMzE1OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The army is Pakistan’s most powerful institution but if it took over it would find itself firmly in the crosshairs of public dissent – a legacy left by the embattled current government.    Pakistan's central bank reserves fell to $4.38Bn, just a month's worth of imports.

The Pakistani government has been negotiating for months for the release of bailouts by the International Monetary Fund, so far unsuccessfully. READ MORE: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan arrested outside court as party make claims of 'torture' READ MORE: Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan arrested outside court as party make claims of 'torture'  'The country is going through a political, economic and financial crisis'  The country is therefore going through a political, economic and financial crisis, which started soon after Khan was ousted 13 months ago after he lost a confidence vote in Parliament.    Khan has since survived an assassination attempt and embarked on a fight with the army. Yet his popularity vote was 61 percent before his arrest, far ahead of his competitors and other party leaders.    After Khan’s arrest, the mobile phone network and internet were shut down as protesters, including members of Khan’s PTI party, took to the streets and attacked military buildings in an unprecedented public display against the army.    More anger followed after the army was drafted to the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to restore order, leading some observers to claim that it was the prelude to a military coup.    This seems currently unlikely, as it could exert more control by influencing from the side-lines, removing political opponents without being seen to take direct responsibility for some of the tough choices that lie ahead.    Political turmoil had also impacted progress of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, originally devised to link East Asia and Europe through infrastructure projects.    The Pakistan section, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) with $25Bn investment in infrastructure, links China’s Westernmost region, Xinjiang, to Pakistan’s north east and travels to its southern coast.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2NvbW1lbnQvZXhwcmVzc2NvbW1lbnQvMTc3MzU3NS9JbXJhbi1LaGFuLWFycmVzdC1wYWtpc3Rhbi1uZXdzLWFybXktY291cC1jaGluZXNlLWJlbHQtYW5kLXJvYWQtcHJvZ3JhbdIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL2NvbW1lbnQvZXhwcmVzc2NvbW1lbnQvMTc3MzU3NS9JbXJhbi1LaGFuLWFycmVzdC1wYWtpc3Rhbi1uZXdzLWFybXktY291cC1jaGluZXNlLWJlbHQtYW5kLXJvYWQtcHJvZ3JhbS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2019-05-16","Not Discerned","{""NewDelhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-24T06:46:22","Yet another thunder of grand Narendra Modi gigs is rolling, this time in Australia. Raucous crowds of diaspora Indians, PM Anthony Albanese bringing out his surfboard to ride the Modi wave with a Bruce Springsteen analogy, live footage burning up the digital highways to every corner of the planet… it is all familiar clamour.  From a bleak broadcast booth submerged in this noise, PM Modi’s opponents and critics are trying to tell the world that this is all publicity-seeking, image-building, stage-managed PR event. They are bitter but not entirely wrong.  Yes, Modi is immensely popular both at home and overseas. And yes, he is a frightfully intuitive public relations genius. Both are true.  While Modi’s opponents accept his mastery over PR with disdain, one wonders if they privately and honestly analyse why he needed to be so good at that skill in the first place.  One can think of at least four very compelling reasons.  First, to counter decades of PR monopoly and the fusillade of self-promotion by the Gandhi family. It was almost unimaginable for a newcomer to even get his name recognised in the remotest corners of India where Chacha Nehru, Indira Mai and their progeny had long penetrated and cemented their place in popular mind space by relentless promotion. Radio, paper, posters, TV or names of schemes and parks and roads and events…the Nehru-Gandhis were everywhere.  A 2013 RTI query found that 450 schemes, projects and institutions were named after just three members of the Nehru-Gandhi family: Indira, Sanjay and Rajiv. Among those were central and state schemes, sports tournaments and trophies, stadiums, airports and ports, educational places, awards, fellowships, sanctuaries and national parks, hospitals and medical institutions, chairs, festivals, roads, buildings and other public spaces.  The family had given itself Bharat Ratna while one was alive, changed dates of Children’s Day to coincide with one’s birthday, held supreme sway over national media, and passed on the baton of power around the dinner table.  A challenger needed to be extraordinarily adept at PR warfare to take on the brand the dynasty had created over seven decades, spending something like an empire’s treasury.  Second, Modi today is the target of relentless character assassination attacks carried out or funded from abroad by anti-India interests. Global political meddler and billionaire George Soros has openly announced a bounty on Modi’s democratic mandate. Parts of the Western establishment and Deep State which wants a more pliable Indian government has been sponsoring regime change attempts through ‘peaceful’ non-state actors like NGOs, awards and grants. The Chinese Communist Party wants the stubbornly nationalistic Modi out, Pakistan’s jihad-military complex wants him dead or at least maligned every day. Certain nations like Turkey, Qatar, Morocco, Germany, and Canada have become hosts to anti-India plotters and IT cells.  To resist that multi-front barrage, Modi needs his shadow to loom much bigger than him when he walks. Amplification of his work and message on media and social media is what gives his image look so much bigger than his frame.  Third, India needs PR. An economy which was USD .94 trillion in 2006 has more than tripled to USD 3.2 trillion in 2021; in just 15 years. From an overwhelming cash economy, it has pivoted itself to being the world’s largest digital payments ecosystem. India is, today, tipped by almost all top financial agencies as the fastest-growing major economy.  Who will tell India’s story? Modi does. And for a nervous West or the indifferent rest to listen, the PM needs an Earth-size projector.  And fourth, Narendra Modi’s told and untold promise is not just to occupy the PM’s chair. His pledge is to change the course of history, not just wade in power.  He understands that in India, that cannot be achieved just by being a backroom boy. To hurtle towards the future on the wheels of its civilisational revival, a new Bharat will need new icons, new heroes, new lore, and a widely recognised and revered new sarathi or charioteer.  And Modi — who otherwise remained a quiet, wandering RSS pracharak for decades — realised early that the sarathi would need a loud and famed conch shell. Perhaps a lesson from Lord Krishna’s own Panchajanya, which carried its master’s message far and wide.  Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

Some have it easier than others. 1987, for example, has Princess Bride. 1989 is Dead Poet's Society. But for older millennials, the 90s can feel like a weird cinema haze where kids' movies cloud all of our memories.  For one cinephile, the seven movies they've seen from their birthyear, 1991, weren't anything to write home about. So, they took to social media to see what other movies from their birth year they were missing out on.  1.

Argentine society, the leadership, Congress, I think we have to think about the values ​​we have as a society”, warned the Minister of the Interior.  “In Mercedes we have been able to organize a community that gets along well, that those who have the most also think about the marginal neighborhoods,” he added.

The film was critically drubbed, tanked at the box office, and basically destroyed Colin Farrell’s career as a leading man before he returned, phoenix-like, in the form of a charming character actor.  Aside from Stone’s typically overheated direction, the biggest flaw of the film is Alexander’s depiction of a homoerotic attraction between the king and his friend Hephaestion (Jared Leto) as something of a forbidden, taboo love. However, social concepts of homosexuality in the 4th-Century Mediterranean basically have no relation to that of America in the 21st century, which makes the portrayal of the character as having to do more with Oliver Stone’s own beliefs than it does the historical figure.

"political assassination","1986-04-18","Not Discerned","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-23T22:01:51","Ambassador Kufa Edward Chinoza  Ambassador Thomas Tommy Pedzisayi Mandigora was born on 9 June 1955 at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo in a family of 10, seven girls and three boys.  His father was a policeman who later on had a good friendship with the late President Robert Gabriel Mugabe.  His father worked as a policeman in Bulawayo from where he was transferred to Kadoma in 1956, then in 1960 he was transferred to Harare’s Tomlinson Depot to where he moved with his family.  In 1961, the ambassador started school at Braeside and did Sub A and Sub B. His father was then transferred to Highfield Police Camp in 1963.  He then attended Chipembere Primary School in Highfield from 1963 to1968.  Ambassador Mandigora then went to St Augustine’s Secondary School in Penhalonga, near Mutare in 1969 for his Form 1 and 2.  In 1971, he was transferred to Nyatsime College, and obtained ‘O’ Levels in 1972.  In 1973, he worked temporarily at National Breweries in Southerton, then in 1974 he got a permanent job at the National Registry at Market Square in Harare as a clerk in the birth certificates section.  After crossing into Mozambique in April 1975 with Charles Chaza, Gaylord Hlatswayo and Noble Mutsambiwa, they became part of the group of young men who joined former President Mugabe and the late Edgar Tekere at Seguranca.  The group included the students that abandoned their studies at the University of Zimbabwe following the assassination of the late Zanu Chairman, Cde Herbert Chitepo, in March 1975 in Lusaka, Zambia.  The young students included Sobuza Gula-Ndebele, George Chiweshe, Justin Mupamhanga, Christopher Mutsvangwa and Neville Dembetembe, the late national heroes, Willard Zororo Duri and John Mayowe.  When Mugabe and Tekere moved to Quelimane, the young freedom fighters moved to Nyadzonia and constituted Company D.  In 1976, Cde Mandigora was sent for military training in Tembwe in Tete Province. There, he met instructors John Chimbandi, Cdes Vhu and Ronney Ngarava and Golden Shumba.  After training, he was deployed to Zimbabwe’s North East battlefront where he distinguished himself as a combatant under the command of the late Perence Shiri.  Cde Mandigora got injured in battle in 1977 and was withdrawn from the front to the rear for treatment and recuperation.  On attaining full recovery, he was inducted into the Chitepo School of Ideology alongside current Minister of Defence and War Veterans Affairs Honourable Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri.  After completion of the political orientation programme, he was sent to Maputo to join the Information and Publicity Department led by Cde Rugare Gumbo and Cde Eddison Zvobgo.  In Maputo, Cde Mandigora worked with Grey Tichatonga (Mark Marongwe), Charles Ndlovu (Webster Shamu) Victor Mhizha-Murira, Stalin Mau Mau, Munyaradzi Machacha and Jomo.  He contributed to the production of Zimbabwe News and other party publications, as well as reporting for the Voice of Zimbabwe Radio.  In 1978, Cde Mandigora was later sent to Lusaka, Zambia, to work with the late General Cde Edzai Chimonyo, the Defence Logistics Coordinator under Cde Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, the Zanu chief representative.  In Lusaka, Cde Mandigora did a lot of diplomatic work attending meetings aimed at mobilising war resources and moral support from the Zimbabwe diaspora in Zambia.  Upon returning to Zimbabwe from the war in 1980, he joined the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) under the leadership of Director-General Tirivafi Kangai, the younger brother of the late national hero Cde Kumbirai Kangai.  Cde Mandigora was then posted to Bulawayo as Head of News and Current Affairs, regional management, implementing editorial policy, production planning and programme scheduling from 1980 to 1982.  From 1983 to 1986, he was the head for Television News (National Network), Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation: management, implementing editorial policy, production planning and scheduling on ZBC’s four radio stations and two television channels.  From 1985 to 1986, he became executive editor for news, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation: Management, responsible for news editorial policy formulation, production planning and scheduling on ZBC’s four radio stations and two television channels.  In addition, he was instrumental in the implementation of ZBC’s decentralisation programme through the opening of provincial offices from 1985 to 1987.  He became the Executive Editor for news on the four radio stations and two television channels as well as implementation of the ZBC’s decentralisation programme through opening of provincial offices.  From 1988 to 1991, he was the Director of News and Current Affairs channels.  In 1991, he became Director of Television Services, responsible for News and Current Affairs Editorial policy formulation, production planning and programme scheduling.  In 1992, Cde Mandigora became Director Programmes News and Current Affairs before he left the Corporation in 2001 to join the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Authority.  Ambassador Mandigora was the first and founder chief executive officer of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Authority.  He developed the required policies and procedures to establish a broadcasting regulatory authority in Zimbabwe as provided for by the Broadcasting Services Act.  He also successfully conducted the first national broadcasting survey in Zimbabwe to determine licensing priorities.  In 2005, Cde Mandigora was appointed Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to the Republic of Botswana and served until 2018. His duties included the enhancement of bilateral ties between Botswana and Zimbabwe.  He was part of the negotiations for the supply of foot and mouth vaccines from Botswana to Zimbabwe as well as supply of credit lines to the two countries private sector.  Cde Mandigora was involved in the negotiations that established the SADC Regional Peacekeeping Training Centre in Zimbabwe.  He also played an instrumental role in the negotiations resulting in the voluntary relocation of the Nswazi people from Matabeleland South to Botswana.  Cde Mandigora served as the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in Botswana as well as the Dean of the African Committee of Ambassadors.  He attended and participated in various preparatory meetings of SADC Council of Ministers as well as SADC Summit meetings.

"political assassination","1993-11-27","Not Discerned","{""Pensacola"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T21:03:00","Almost from the instant the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973, the terrorist wing of the fraudulently named “pro-life” movement began a campaign of bombing and burning clinics. Organized mobs coiled themselves outside clinics to harass women, block the path, or grab and lecture them. While some protests were perfectly within legal bounds—the kind of actions that must always remain a guaranteed right—others went way beyond simple free speech and assembly. And often, in a turnaround from their usual stance, local law enforcement authorities were more sympathetic to the protesters than to those being protested against.  However, when Dr. David Gunn was assassinated in Pensacola, Florida, in 1993, the political dynamic changed for a time. Out of that act came the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances law. This makes force, the threat of force, and physical obstruction that interferes with, or seeks to intimidate a person from seeking or providing reproductive health services a federal crime punishable by criminal and civil penalties. In the Senate, there were 25 votes against that legislation. One of the opponents, Charles Grassley of Iowa, still has a Senate seat.  Although it took a while, FACE did tamp down the violence and confrontations at clinics. That was because President Bill Clinton’s administration took the law seriously. From the time it passed, the Department of Justice prosecuted an average of 10 defendants a year under FACE, 17 of them in 1997 alone. Under President George W. Bush, however, the average was two a year. As Daphne Eviatar of the Washington Independent reported:  Whether the dropoff in prosecutions is because the FACE Act successfully deterred crimes after its enactment or because the Bush administration wasn’t interested in prosecuting them is not clear. ""The amount of activity really did drop a lot after FACE was enacted and it was beginning to be enforced,"" said Cathleen Mahoney, Executive Vice President of the National Abortion Federation who was an attorney in the Justice Department until 2006. ""Certainly the political will wasn’t there."" That’s disappointed Janet Crepps, deputy director of the legal program at the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""I don’t think that the government has done enough,"" she said, noting that while the Clinton administration had created a task force in the Department of Justice to coordinate responses to clinic threats and violence, during the Bush years, ""we’ve heard that providers during that time would call DOJ for help and get no response.""  In April 2007, Paul Ross Evans planted a bomb containing two pounds of nails in the parking lot of the Austin Women's Health Center in Texas. Nail bombs are especially nasty items in the terrorist's arsenal. They kill and maim indiscriminately. If the bomb had gone off, the victims could have been anyone: patients at the clinic, passersby, doctors, or toddlers. It didn't matter to Evans. In his view, what he sought to achieve rose above petty conventional morality. Fortunately, in this case, the bomb did not explode. And today, Evans is in his 15th year of a 40-year sentence at the federal penitentiary at McCreary, Kentucky, prisoner #83230-180. He's glorified as “a prisoner for God” on several websites.  Two years later, with a gunshot to the head, another “pro-lifer,” Scott Roeder, slew Dr. George Tiller while the physician served as an usher in his local church in Wichita, Kansas. He had been an abortion provider for 34 years and had survived two bullet wounds from a previous assassin’s attack in 1993.  Roeder—now serving 25 to life at the Hutchinson, Kansas, state prison—had been pretty much ignored by authorities, both local and federal, despite his criminal record and despite repeatedly vandalizing the clinic where Tiller worked, clearly interfering with people’s rights to obtain reproductive services. Pistol in hand, Roeder took the ultimate approach to that interference.  In the usual upsidedownism of the extremist factions of the anti-choice movement, the Rev. Donald Spitz—whose ""Army of God"" considered the assassination of anyone who provides abortions a justifiable homicide—said the FACE law was itself to blame for Tiller’s death because it fed the anger and frustration of the foes of reproductive choice:  ""I understand that anger,"" he says. ""You know children are dying, and you want to do something. And just, you know, people just can't take it anymore. That might just drive them to it. So I think the pro-abortion people brought this on themselves by forcing the politicians to pass these laws.""  Quite understandably, despite the ""lone nut"" theme being trumpeted by, among others, Operation Rescue and similar anti-choice outfits, some people who had fought to maintain women’s right to reproductive choice saw the Kansas slaying as the possible beginning of a renewed reign of terror. Right after the November election, believing as other groups did that the election of President Barack Obama could mean a wave of right-wing violence, Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, sent out a security alert to abortion providers. Saporta told Rachel Maddow at the time:  In tracking abortion violence we know that oftentimes when these extremists see themselves losing an election or don’t see themselves winning in political, legislative or judicial battles, they often resort to violence. And we were concerned that we might see an uptick in violence; we wanted our providers to be on a little bit of a heightened security alert. And we have found that threats and activity and the intensity of activity outside abortion clinics has increased.  Some of the dwindling number of doctors who provide abortions wear bulletproof vests. Tiller often did, although he was not wearing his the morning he was shot. Not that a vest will necessarily protect a doctor who wears it all the time. As Dr. Warren Hern, a Colorado physician who has been providing abortions in Boulder, Colorado, since 1974, told the Los Angeles Times:  ""I think [Tiller's murder is] the inevitable consequence of more than 35 years of constant antiabortion terrorism, harassment and violence,"" he said. ""I get messages from these people saying, 'Don't bother wearing a bulletproof vest, we're going for a head shot.'""  Dr. Hern still lives, carefully keeping the window blinds closed at the clinic and at home. But arson, bombings, death threats, and clinic invasions remain common. And, as the NAF notes, are on the increase. Given the spreading gunslinging atmosphere abroad in the nation these days, that seems likely to worsen further.  But while even some anti-abortion activists decry such attacks, the overturning of Roe with the decision Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization by the Supreme Court has created its own kind of violence. Pregnant people risk sepsis and death by carrying dead or unviable fetuses because physicians fearing prosecution under state laws won’t perform an abortion unless the pregnant woman’s life is clearly threatened. In other words, no abortion unless the patient is incontestably on the verge of dying. If a patient is 13 years old in one of the dozen states that now have no exceptions for rape or incest in its anti-abortion statutes, the politicians who have imposed them are guilty of another kind of violence: child abuse. And then there is the violence that has demolished reproductive rights overall, taking away the fundamental right of bodily integrity from half the population and making women second-class citizens.  Fixing this is like so many other issues these days and no easy matter. It requires replacing the state and federal politicians who brought us this violence with people who actually are “pro-life,” as opposed to merely using it as a slogan for imposing their fanaticism on the nation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWtvcy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzUvMjMvMjE3MDk1Ni8tVGhlcmUtcy1nb29kLXJlYXNvbi10by1iZWxpZXZlLXJpc2luZy12aW9sZW5jZS1hbmQtdGhyZWF0cy1hZ2FpbnN0LWFib3J0aW9uLWNsaW5pY3Mtd2lsbC1nZXQtd29yc2U_dXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXJlY2VudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Rawalpindi"", ""Punjab"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-23T18:59:00","When Imran Khan drove from Lahore to Islamabad on May 9th to appear before the Islamabad High Court, he was anticipating a routine day in court. But that was not to be. Thirteen months after being forced out of office in a vote of no confidence, Mr. Khan was brought from the courthouse and put into an armoured car before being handed over to the nation's anti-corruption authorities. The erratic populist may have to watch the general elections that are set for later this year unfold from a prison cell—provided they are held at all—rather than contesting them, as he has demanded for months.  The suspected corruption in a land deal is the stated basis for Mr. Khan's detention. (He refutes the accusations.) However, the detention seems to be connected to his heated argument with Pakistan's military. At a public gathering on May 6, Mr. Khan alleged that Major General Faisal Naseer, a member of the army's intelligence branch, was planning to assassinate him. Earlier, Mr. Khan had laid the blame for a botched assassination attempt on his life in November on Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister who took his position. He received a leg shot.  The army's public relations branch threatened legal action and described Khan’s most recent charges as ""extremely unfortunate, deplorable, and unacceptable"" in a rare public statement. That did not stop Imran Khan from reiterating them in a video that was captured while travelling to the Islamabad court. He was taken into custody shortly after.  In a political and constitutional crisis that has carried on for months, the arrest is the most recent development. Imran Khan has never acknowledged the validity of his ouster as prime minister a year ago. In January, his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), forced the dissolution of two provincial assemblies it controlled, including that of the vital province of Punjab, in an effort to persuade the government to call early elections. However, Mr. Sharif wants unified elections in all four provinces and the capital in October, when the current session of parliament has ended. When Mr. Khan's request for elections in Punjab on May 14 was granted by the Supreme Court against objections from the federal government and parliament, the situation took a constitutional turn.  Before elections are scheduled, Mr. Sharif and his administration seem eager to gain time to strengthen the economy. In April, annual inflation reached a record high of 36.4%, the highest rate in Asia. Inflation in food prices is currently 48.1%. An appalling 0.5% GDP growth is anticipated this year. Pakistan still faces the risk of defaulting despite China's bilateral assistance, with an estimated $77.5 billion in debt repayments due by June 2026 and no hint that the IMF will soon agree to continue a $6.5 billion credit programme. During a weekend visit to Islamabad, China's foreign minister urged the nation to resolve its tumultuous political situation and concentrate on boosting the economy.  A collapse in law and order is the risk that is most urgent. Already, peaceful protests have descended into violence. Protests have been aimed at military installations, which is particularly risky and unprecedented in Pakistan's political history. Stick-wielding demonstrators broke into the typically well-defended apartment of the city's senior military commander in Lahore, smashed windows, set furniture on fire, and stole household items. A peacock was observed being held by one demonstrator. ""I grabbed it from the home of the corps commander. It belongs to the people. We are returning what they took, the demonstrator in a mask declared. In the garrison city of Rawalpindi, protesters were also spotted breaking through the main gate of the army's headquarters.  Images of rallies against the army on social media are a rare and striking sight in Pakistan, where they are both feared and admired. It's possible that the government is working to keep people from seeing them. Network problems on social media, the internet, and mobile phones were being reported by Pakistanis across the country at the time of writing.  A political figure losing favour with Pakistan's military is nothing unusual. The readiness of Mr. Khan and his followers to confront the army is novel. As Mr. Khan fights with the army, Mr. Sharif and his administration can feel confident about their chances of remaining in power.

By Henry Karmo [email protected]  The MDR named Doupoe Menkozohn, Joe Tuah, and Roland Duoh as allegedly being responsible for carrying out the Vice President’s plan to confront Prince Johnson in response to recent remarks made against her.  Citing ‘reliable information’, the party asserted that ex-combatants Roland Duoh, Dopoe Menkozohn, Joe Tuah, Kai Farlay, and others orchestrated the disturbance at the Christ Chapel of Faith Church. Their intention, according to the MDR, was to prevent Senator Evangelist Prince Johnson’s sermon from potentially having a political impact on Jewel Howard Taylor.  The party’s statement, delivered by its mobilization chairman Melsco Wolo, also mentioned that an EPS operative had alerted Senator Johnson about the planned protest by the Vice President, and the senator had informed the police two hours prior to the incident.  “The Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR) strongly condemns the violent protest against its Governing Council Chair Senator Prince Y. Johnson, which took place on May 21, 2023, at the premises of his Christ Chapel of Faith Church in Paynesville, behind the Liberia Broadcasting System-LBS.”  The party expressed disappointment and frustration with the state security, claiming that the incident was a joint effort planned and executed in collaboration with the Liberia National Police-LNP.  “It is important to reemphasize and register the MDR’s disappointment and frustration with the state security. We believe that the incident was jointly calculated, planned, and executed in collaboration with the Liberia National Police-LNP. This belief stems from the fact that after residents of the LBS community alerted Nimba County Senator Prince Y. Johnson, he made multiple calls to relevant security actors, including the Director of the Liberian Police, Mr. Patrick Sudue. Unfortunately, the police arrived intentionally at the Christ Chapel of Faith premises two hours after the incident had already occurred.”  The party also highlighted that the recent attack on Senator Johnson, the ‘Godfather’ of Nimba, and his congregation could have been prevented if the Liberia National Police had acted promptly, as Senator Johnson had alerted them a little over two hours prior to the incident.  “Additionally, the MDR wants to use this medium to remind Liberians and the world at large that what was displayed by supporters of the regime on Sunday is evidence of our accusation made a fortnight ago when we initially accused the Weah-led government of an assassination attempt on our Governing Council Chair, Senator Prince Y. Johnson.”  The party expressed deep concern over consistent threats on Senator Johnson’s life since he withdrew his support for President George M. Weah’s second term bid.  “Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the issue of establishing a War Crime Court should not be politicized by regime collaborators as a means of silencing critical voices, including that of Senator Johnson, who represents the people of Nimba County in the legislature. The Nimbaians, whom Senator Johnson represents, were also victims of the 14 years of civil unrest and, like any Liberian affected by the war, deserve justice.”  The party, in support of Senator Johnson, stated that his participation in the Liberian Civil War was a result of extreme marginalization, killings, and intimidation of Nimbaians throughout the country. They emphasized that Senator Johnson, as a revolutionary leader, felt the need to liberate his people.  “Furthermore, the MDR is extremely shocked by President Weah and his government’s conspicuous silence in condemning the uncivilized action demonstrated last Sunday under the instruction of his vice president, Madam Jewel Howard Taylor.  The MDR has also warned the lead perpetrator of the Sunday incident at the Christ Chapel of Faith, Peter Bleedi Jr., who happens to be the National Vice Chair for Press and Publicity of the NPP Youth Council and a close associate of Jewel Howard Taylor. According to evidence in our possession, he recently accompanied the Vice President during her tour in the southeastern region, including Maryland County, and we urge him to refrain from being used for violent purposes.  The party has also called on the international community, including the American government, the European Union, the ECOWAS Commission, and the African Union, to intervene. We request the international community to join us in urging the Weah-led government to conduct an investigation into the disruption at the Christ Chapel of Faith Church on May 21, 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL2Zyb250cGFnZWFmcmljYW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy9saWJlcmlhLXByaW5jZS1qb2huc29ucy1wYXJ0eS1hY2N1c2VzLXRheWxvcnMtZXgtZmlnaHRlcnMtb2Ytb3JjaGVzdHJhdGlvbi1zdW5kYXlzLWNodXJjaC1kaXNydXB0aW9uL9IBkAFodHRwczovL2Zyb250cGFnZWFmcmljYW9ubGluZS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbGliZXJpYS1wcmluY2Utam9obnNvbnMtcGFydHktYWNjdXNlcy10YXlsb3JzLWV4LWZpZ2h0ZXJzLW9mLW9yY2hlc3RyYXRpb24tc3VuZGF5cy1jaHVyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGlvbi8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Departing from his prepared paper as Guest Speaker at the 2023 International Conference of the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice, which opened on Monday 22 May in Banjul, the Gambian capital, Odinkalu, a lawyer and human rights activist, lamented that no African country had ratified the protocol since its adoption.  The protocol is a culmination of a protracted and complex process, expanding the jurisdiction of the African Court of Justice on Human Rights (ACJHR) to cover crimes under international law as well as transnational crimes.  Odinkalu challenged The Gambia, as host of the Conference on “Zero Tolerance for Unconstitutional Change of Government,” and also headquarters of the African Commission for Human and People’s Rights, to ratify the protocol and set an example for other African countries.  He explained that the ratification would pave the way for the protocol’s operationalisation and the trial of deviants at the ACJHR.  Advertisement  Chronicling military coups worldwide, Odinkalu said Africa accounted for 48.3% of all successful coups since 1950, with West Africa alone producing 169.  According to him, Burkina Faso holds the dubious honour with eight successful coups out of nine, followed countries such as Nigeria and Benin Republic. Cabo Verde is the only exception.  Describing coups as a “symbolism that has its origin in colonialism,” the guest speaker said, the Berlin 1884 Conference on the Scramble for Africa was also a coup, and so was the assassination of Julius Caesar as narrated by William Shakespeare.  The human rights activist also described the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte as “a coup plotter.”  However, he said the notion that “a military coup is a self-legalising illegality” must be jettisoned as Africa searches for solutions to the resurgence of military incursions in politics.  He alluded to difficulties with some existing legal frameworks and protocols as well as the challenges of coordination.  Odinkalu also identified some norms at play as regards the African Union and its Regional Economic Communities, such as ECOWAS, on the legitimisation of access to power through elections, tenure elongation and unconstitutional change of government, noting that it was not enough to condemn soldiers while ignoring political adventurers, who carry out constitutional and political coups, or use court orders for tenure elongation and subversion of national constitutions.  Advertisement  He said the continent must also deal with popular uprisings and the protection of court judges.  Declaring the Conference open, the Gambian President Adama Barrow, represented by vice President Muhammad Jallow, said “Zero tolerance for unconstitutional changes in government should not just be a slogan; it should reflect in our actions, in our policies, and in our laws.”  “Let our discussions guide us towards a future marked by peace, unity, prosperity, and an unwavering commitment to constitutional order,” he added.  In his address of welcome, the President of the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice, Justice Edward Asante, said the annual Conference was the regional Court’s most important programme, which “provides an excellent forum for cross fertilization of ideas by the legal experts, resource persons and participants, on themes with regional significance from a regional perspective.”  He described the theme this year as a burning issue, given military interventions in governance through military coups in the past two years in three ECOWAS member States – Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso.  “As we speak, these member States are under military dictatorships and have been suspended from the Community by the Authority of Heads of State and Government,” Justice Asante said.  Advertisement  He expressed optimism that the outcome of the conference “will be useful in charting a way forward to prevent future unconstitutional changes of Government within our sub region.”  The opening ceremony also featured welcome statements and goodwill messages from Heads of ECOWAS Institutions including the ECOWAS Commission President Omar Alieu Touray, represented by the ECOWAS Resident Representative to the Gambia Miata French, as well the Gambian Justice Minister and Chief Justice, among others.  Presenters and attendees of the Conference include Justice Ministers and Attorneys General, eminent Judges and Lawyers from ECOWAS member States, as well as constitution, governance, human rights, and election experts.  *Paul Ejime, a Global Affairs Analyst, is a Consultant on Strategic Communication, Media Development, Governance Issues, Peace & Security and Election.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2Y25ld3MudHYvMjAyMy8wNS9vZGlua2FsdS11cmdlcy1hZnJpY2FuLWdvdmVybm1lbnRzLXRvLXJhdGlmeS0yMDE0LW1hbGFiby1wcm90b2NvbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2019-05-29","Not Discerned","{""NegrosOriental"", ""CentralVisayas"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-23T11:06:00","MANILA — The House of Representatives Committee on Ethics and Privileges on Tuesday said it will once again be deliberating embattled Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo ""Arnie"" Teves Jr.'s continued absence from work, after it acquired the jurisdiction to investigate the matter.  The panel's chair, COOP NATCCO Party-List Rep. Felimon Espares said the hearing will take place next Monday, May 29, with the objective of making a recommendation to the House plenary by the last session day on May 31.  Espares, along with the panel's vice chairperson Nueva Ecija Rep. Ria Vergara, noted that Teves' continued absence may be considered disorderly behavior, which the committee earlier cited in recommending to suspend Teves for 60 days.  The panel's officials also confirmed that it is now looking into Teves' failed request for political asylum in Timor Leste.  While the committee assured that Teves would be given due process during the hearing, Espares ruled out allowing the embattled lawmaker to join virtually due to his continued absence being unauthorized.  Espares also denied the panel is being pressured to act on Teves' case, but noted that it may drop its proceedings should the lawmaker decided to return to the Philippines.  Meanwhile, House Secretary General Reginald Velasco Jr. said Teves can apply for a leave of absence from work but he has to return home first, saying he has to ""come here to face the music.""  ""'Pag leave of absence ang understanding ho namin dito ka lang sa Pilipinas. 'Pag tinawag ka ng Congress or any authority you'll be available. Siya po [ay] nasa abroad eh... We'll grant [him] a leave of absence pero umuwi muna [siya]. Iyon po iyong procedure,"" Velasco said.  Under the Constitution and its internal rules, the House is empowered to discipline its members for disorderly behavior.  But for a House member to be expelled or suspended requires a two-thirds vote of the plenary, with the suspension not going beyond 60 days.  Teves remains outside of the Philippines as he faces murder raps over the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo, his political rival, and 9 others.  This week, 4 suspects in the Degamo slay case recanted their previous testimonies linking Teves to the crime, including their earlier admissions to planning and carrying out the hit.

Supervisor of the Montana Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section at DPHHS, Magdalena Scott provided her perspective dating back to early May when the official end of the pandemic was announced.  Officially, the COVID Pandemic Ended Back on May 11  “In the United States, the Federal Government announced the end of the COVID public health emergency on May 11; that is the date that it officially ended,” began Scott. “So at that time, we here in Montana also decided that it was time to step back from the enhanced surveillance that we've been doing for COVID during these past three very busy years.”  Scott provided the statewide raw numbers that all of us lived through during the pandemic.  Get our free mobile app  333,000 Cases; 14,000 Hospitalizations and 3,700 Deaths in Montana  “It's been over three years,” she said. “We have reported over 333,000 cases of COVID in the state of Montana, and that's about a third of our population. In terms of hospitalizations, there have been over 14,000 hospitalizations due to COVID and over 3,700 deaths in Montana due to COVID.”  DPHHS Communications Director Jon Ebelt looked back at the importance of proper consistent messaging that helped to bring Montanans the most up-to-date and accurate information about the pandemic.  Learning to 'Manage the Message' through the Pandemic  “We did a lot of messaging with our media campaigns,” said Ebelt. “We did a lot of surveys of Montanans with the information that they wanted and how they wanted to receive that information, so we did a lot of work on our public messaging through our media campaigns. Also to make sure that people were receiving the timely information, and from the people that they trusted most, were in many situations medical providers, like nurses and doctors.”  Now that spring has arrived and summer is on the way, Scott drew the conversation back to the present.  “You know, it's springtime and we've started some messaging about being careful about tick bites you know that's there you know, as you're cleaning out your sheds watch out for mice that can spread Hantavirus or spread rabies,” she said. “There are a lot of other diseases out there that we are still responding to and still trying to protect the public from, so I hope that you can check our website and watch for press releases that we put out on our social media to get important information about staying healthy in Montana.”  Scott and Ebelt encouraged Montanans to visit the DPHHS website for information and updates on getting and staying healthy this summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3RhbGtrZ3ZvLmNvbS9tb250YW5hLWxlc3NvbnMtbGVhcm5lZC1jb3ZpZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1762-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T04:25:20","By Darius von Guttner Sporzynski, Australian Catholic University  Shows like The Great on Stan are changing how we look at history. Instead of being all about getting the facts straight, they’re shaking things up and telling the story their own way. These shows are rewriting the rulebook.  In The Great, the narrative deviates significantly from historical reality. This fast-and-loose approach, humorously labelled as ‘an occasionally true story’, represents a trend of irreverence that has been evolving over the years.  A German-born usurper, Catherine II, holds a significant place in Russian history, second only to Peter the Great.  She played a pivotal role in transforming Russia into a great empire, defying gender norms and expectations of her time. Catherine made Russia a European superpower and established foundations on which Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin based their ideologies of ‘Mother Russia’ – she was the Mother Russia.  The Great takes a bold approach by re-imagining the life of Catherine II as a coarse period comedy. It utilises stunning historical settings to enhance the vivid absurdity of this romp through Russian history in the mid-18th century.  The show doesn’t pretend to adhere closely to the historical record. Instead, it presents an extravagantly vulgar yet brilliantly humorous portrayal of Catherine II and her era. The series is fast-paced, fiercely witty and tailored for modern audiences, embracing the art of historicising filmmaking.  Taking liberties with history  The Great takes significant liberties with historical facts, distorting the timeline and altering the lineage of its characters.  In the show, Peter is already emperor when Catherine arrives, whereas in reality, they were married for 17 years before he ascended the throne. In the series, Peter is the son of Peter the Great, whereas the true Peter was his German-born grandson. These creative deviations highlight the show’s inclination towards reimagining historical events for dramatic effect.  While The Great may not align with historical events, it provides an entertaining and irreverent perspective on Catherine the Great’s legacy as a powerful female ruler who shaped Russia’s destiny. Yet, it is not easy to separate fact from fiction, especially with the show’s warped timeline.  Catherine took the power as empress in 1762 and held the supreme authority of Russia until her death in 1796. In her usurpation of the crown, just six months after her husband, Peter III, took the throne, she was assisted by her lover Grigory Orlov.  Tsar Peter III and his wife Catherine by Georg Cristoph Grooth. He reigned only six months, and died on July 17, 1762. Image: Wikimedia.  With his help, she staged a coup and dethroned Peter III ‘“’like a child being sent to bed‘, drawing admiration from the Machiavellian Frederick the Great of Prussia.  Who was Catherine the Great?  Catherine was born Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst in 1729 in Stettin, Prussia (now known as Szczecin in Poland).  Her father, a minor German prince, was a Prussian governor of Stettin. Her mother’s royal connections and political machinations brought Sophie to the attention of the reigning Russian empress, Elizabeth. The empress decided to make Sophie the wife of her nephew and heir, Peter.  In 1744, the young German princess arrived in Russia, converted to Russian Orthodoxy, adopted the name Catherine and at the age of 16 was married to Peter.  Initially, Catherine struggled to navigate the complex and intricate dynamics of the Russian court, where Empress Elizabeth held absolute power. However, she was determined to learn and adapt to her new surroundings.  Catherine later reflected that she made a conscious decision to do whatever was necessary and to publicly embrace the beliefs and ideals required of her to be qualified for the crown of the tsars.  A disastrous marriage  Catherine and Peter’s marriage was a disastrous mismatch. They were completely incompatible in terms of intellect and interests.  While Catherine was an erudite lover of European culture, Peter was boorish and immature. He lacked ambition and did not understand his role as the future emperor. Their differences led them to seek intimacy elsewhere, raising questions about the paternity of their son, Paul I, who later believed that his father was Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland-Lithuania.  With Peter’s ascension to the Russian throne upon his aunt Elizabeth’s death in 1762, Catherine recognised the threats to her position and life. Her decision to act and overthrow her husband was accelerated by Peter antagonising the key factions at court and behaving dangerously irrationally, as she wrote in her memoirs.  Within first six months of Peter’s reign, Catherine, supported by her followers, staged a coup, arrested Peter and coerced his abdication. He conveniently died eight days later under uncertain circumstances, possibly murder or an accidental result of a drunken brawl. The official cause of death was stated as ‘hemorrhoidal colic’, a euphemism for assassination.  Catherine claimed the throne in her own right rather that under the pretence of ruling as regent for her son Paul.  Her coronation highlighted her status as the God-anointed ruler of ‘All the Russias’, bringing us roughly to where the story is up to in season three of The Great – it is hard to tell.  The Great shocks and entertains by revealing that history can be retold to reflect on contemporary society. People, for all the celebrated progress and ‘giant leaps forward’ are as vulnerable today as they were in the past.  Catherine in The Great whispers ‘Destiny didn’t do it. I did it’. The historical Catherine would most likely have agreed.

"political assassination","1997-07-07","22:00:00","{""Seoul"", ""Seoul"", ""SouthKorea""}","2023-05-23T15:11:21","SEOUL, South Korea — Hongdae, a neighborhood in Seoul, South Korea, is known for its vibrant nightlife and indie music scene. By day, it’s a shopping and café mecca. By night it’s a crazy, alcohol-fueled playground. What’s easy to miss — and not even many Koreans living in Hongdae know about — is that hidden in plain sight, there are also secret lesbian clubs where women can gather and be themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.  “Hongdae is the lesbian area of Seoul?!” my good friend blurted out when I told him over dinner. He’s been a resident of Hongdae for more than seven years but had never noticed. Most Koreans don’t know any LGBTQ+ people as Korean society is conservative and not accepting of homosexuality. Hongdae’s reputation as a more free-thinking, hipster haven makes it a perfect location for openness — albeit in private.  In South Korea, homosexuality is not illegal, but it is not widely accepted, especially in more conservative areas of the country. Seoul is more open compared to the countryside but not open enough for lesbians to be open. Same-sex couples cannot legally marry or adopt children and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community is still prevalent.  Allen, a Korean woman in her 20s says, “There is a very strong homophobic atmosphere [in Korea] regardless of generation.”  Despite these challenges, the LGBTQ+ community in South Korea has been gradually (very gradually) gaining some visibility and acceptance in recent years such as an LGBTQ+ dating reality show “Merry Queer” following lesbian, gay and Transgender couples. Seoul’s gay Pride parade — which last year drew thousands of participants despite protests from conservative religious groups — shows a shift in thinking too. However, it’s not enough progress as lesbian and bisexual women are still meeting in the dark.  One way in which the community has been able to connect and support each other is through secret lesbian clubs. Goon Young* is a Seoul freelancer in her mid-20s. Growing up she was constantly told that being straight is “natural” which left her feeling confused about her sexuality. “I thought I was bisexual when I was in college. I figured out that I don’t like men only about two years ago.” Goon Young enjoys hanging out at Hongdae’s lesbian club scene regularly.  These clubs are not advertised openly and are often hidden in inconspicuous side-streets, or in basements behind mainstream clubs.  One of these secret clubs is close to an infamous drinking spot for foreigners and when some foreign men were turned away for not being women, they looked visibly confused. It’s a large, luxe club with a strict no photograph rule. There’s table service and the DJ blasts Korean rap such as Jay Park and Zico.  This club and most of the others won’t easily pop up when you search on your phone’s map so usually lesbians need to get to know another lesbian to ask around for the exact location. This typically involves going to an LGBTQ+ bar first, or meet-up group and making friends there, as blurting out to your work buddies “Oh, by the way, is anyone else here gay?” wouldn’t go down too well in Korea. Goon Young concurs, “I’m pretty open to people that I love, someone like my mom or friends, but you can’t really tell people who are coworkers or someone [you] just met.”  Discrimination and stigma against the LGBTQ+ community persist in many areas of South Korean society, including the workplace and school. Many LGBTQ+ individuals still face rejection from their families and friends, and some even resort to conversion therapy to try and change their sexual orientation.  Luckily Goon Young’s mom is supportive, but not entirely convinced. “I came out to my mom — who loves me — last year. She still loves me and cheers me up when I have heartbreaks with girlfriends. But she says she still can’t take it seriously and gay things are not ‘natural,’ she always tells me to meet some good guys and date them even though I always reply to her that I don’t like men.”  The lesbian nightlife scene’s purpose is truly to create a safe space and respect the privacy of all. There’s so much trust in these clubs that “lonely heart” style personal ads are displayed on the big projector screen behind the DJ in the first club where I partied. After all, queer dating isn’t as straight-forward in a country that prizes straightness.  Inside these clubs, women let their guard down and can be themselves. They can dance, drink, and socialize without fear of being judged or harassed. Legally speaking, South Korea doesn’t have comprehensive LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination laws so the fear of physical safety for the LGBTQ+ community really means that a “safe space” carries much more weight than a “safe space” in a country where there’s more acceptance of gay rights.  Another safe space was a tiny club a little walk away from the big, “lonely hearts personals” club. What it lacked in size it made up for in chaotic ENERGY! Nobody was sitting in a corner here and after picking up my free drink included with the entry fee (every club did this), it was hit after hit from rapper Lil Nas X to K-pop group BLACKPINK.  Although lesbian and bi women were dancing wildly, enjoying the night, even within these safe spaces, many club-goers still feel the need to remain cautious as the fear of being outed can be overwhelming.  The last club I went to carried this caution. Located on an inconspicuous street, women were looking over their shoulders when paying in. That is, right up until the elevator doors shut. Once shut, women let their guards down and asked me how I found out about this place. Once inside — free drink handled (every club did Budweiser as a free drink option) — it was a playground of EDM, large opulent bottle service with half-undressed bartenders. One of them was even passing around free shots from one of the stripper pole podiums.  If there’s a lesbian heaven, I think I caught a glimpse of it here.  The cool air hit me as I left for home but nobody walking past suspected that the women leaving this club were not heterosexual. The fact that these clubs are still a secret highlights the need for greater acceptance and visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in South Korea. While progress has been made in recent years, there is still a long way to go before LGBTQ+ individuals can openly express their identities without fear of discrimination or being attacked.  “Young people in Korea are pretty open to LGBTQ, [but] of course, there are [some] who hate LGBTQ people. Most of the old people just can’t take it”, Goon Young says.  The existence of secret lesbian clubs in Hongdae and other parts of Seoul is a testament to the resilience and strength of the LGBTQ+ community in South Korea, also. Despite facing significant challenges and obstacles, these women have found a way to connect and support each other, creating safe spaces where they can be themselves.  Hongdae’s secret world of lesbian clubs offers a glimpse behind the curtain. Despite many hurdles, on a late, spring night in underground Hongdae clubs, women danced and flirted freely for the few hours they could be themselves.

"political assassination","2021-03-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T20:52:29","The Supreme Court of Namibia on May 16, 2023, issued a judgment recognizing same-sex unions of two non-nationals after they were denied immigration status by the Namibian government.  The story of Daniel Digashu, a South African national, and his family challenging the decision of the Namibian government denying him immigration status based on his same-sex marriage to his Namibian husband is just one of the many ways African governments continue to oppress and erase queer existence.  In 2015, Digashu married his partner Johann Potgieter in South Africa, where same-sex unions have been legal since Nov. 14, 2016; this, however, is not the case in Namibia. In 2017, after he and his family relocated to Namibia, Digashu applied for a work permit but got rejected by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration based on his same-sex relationship status. The social inequality many LGBTIQ+ people face daily, and the lack of recognition and protection of LGBTIQ+ rights make them more vulnerable to stigma, discrimination and exclusion. Denying LGBTIQ+ people the right and the opportunity to marriage and family life has significant implications on their mental, emotional and overall well-being.  Heterosexual marriage is widely and legally recognized in Namibia and is often seen as the fundamental foundational family institution in society, including the church. The mainstream practice of marriage is deeply rooted in traditional, cultural and religious beliefs and practices. Marriage is not only a union between individuals but also a union between families and even different communities.  The denial to recognize Digashu and Potgieter’s marriage had deprived them of a chance and a right to have a family, a community and a sense of belonging in society. The couple has been in and out of court since 2017, when they approached the High Court after several unsuccessful engagements with the ministry.  On March 20, 2021, the High Court heard the case and dismissed the matter on Jan. 20, 2022, citing that they cannot legally overrule a previous judgement by the Supreme Court, which found that same-sex relationships are not recognized under the Immigration Control Act of Namibia.  Constitutional violation of human rights  The refusal of the recognition of same-sex unions is an infringement on several fundamental human rights recognized and protected under regional and international human rights instruments — including the Constitution of Namibia. Denying the recognition and protection of LGBTIQ+ marriage and family violates their rights to dignity, liberty, privacy and protection under the law. Such human rights violation is also discriminatory and violates the constitutional right to non-discrimination, equality before the law and freedom of expression based on one’s sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. Recognizing same-sex marriage ensures that LGBTIQ+ people have the same legal protections and rights.  If it pleases the court  In its 2022 judgment, the High Court of Namibia 2022 made favorable pronouncements noting the need to recognize same-sex relationships and that LGBTIQ+ people must be protected from discrimination. The court stated that: “Homosexual relationships are, without doubt, globally recognized, and increasingly more countries have changed their laws to recognize one’s right not to be discriminated against based on one’s sexual orientation. It is time to recognize that homosexuality is part and parcel of the fabric of our society and that persons — human beings — in homosexual relationships are worthy of being afforded the same rights as other citizens.”  Both the High Court and the Supreme Court pronounced that the values, freedoms and democracy that Namibia was founded on have no place for discrimination and the violation of human rights. Everyone, including LGBTQI+ people, has the right to dignity, equality and protection under the law. This call for recognition by the courts is a significant victory for Namibia’s LGBTIQ+ community and advocacy.  The Supreme Court went on to say that the “court has made it clear that this recognition of the equal worth of all human beings is at the very root of the Constitution and that this is ‘further echoed and implemented in various articles of Chapter 3, and others of the Constitution.’ The value attached to dignity is at the very heart of our constitutional framework and fundamental to it as a value of central significance. Although it is entrenched as a self-standing right in Art 8, it relates to the protection of other rights and in particular, the right to equality.”  Colonial remnants and state-sponsored LGBTIQ+-phobia  To understand the continuous exclusion of LGBTIQ+ groups in progressive civic developments, it is essential to understand the impact and role that colonial laws have played in shaping the perception, attitudes and legal status of LGBTIQ+ people in society.  Colonial laws were discriminatory and repressive, resulting in the “othering” and, ultimately, the existence of vulnerable and marginalized groups. These laws were based on conservative religious and cultural values prevalent in Europe at the time and criminalized groups based on their gender, race, ethnicity and even sexual orientation and gender identity. Such laws continue to be in practice worldwide, including in Africa.  Like many other African nations, Namibia has an unfavorable history regarding recognizing and protecting LGBTIQ+ people. Identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender is not illegal in Namibia. However, the country does criminalize consensual same sex-sexual activities between people of the same gender in terms of its Roman-Dutch common law.  These provisions are part of what was inherited from colonial laws during colonization and into the new constitution. Such laws continue to sideline LGBTIQ+ people, as they face daily stigma, discrimination and violence, including inaccessibility to healthcare, education, employment, and housing.  In December 2020, the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights found that vagrancy laws or bylaws in nearly every country in Africa discriminate against marginalized and vulnerable populations, including women, children, people with disabilities, LGBTIQ+ people and others. Namibia is no exception in adopting such laws as the Roman-Dutch common laws criminalize consensual same-sex sexual relations. This imprint on the State still upholding oppressive colonial laws regarding LGBTIQ+ rights is part of why LGBTIQ+ people and families face daily exclusion. Consensual same-sex relations are still criminalized in Namibia. The repressive and colonial legislation still engraved in Namibia’s laws provides many challenges for same-sex couples and LGBTIQ+ families, like Digashu and Potgieter, and many other same-sex couples seeking legal recognition status in Namibia.  Regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, everyone should have social, economic and legal stability and equal opportunities. Still, discrimination against LGBTIQ+ people is a significant barrier to full social and legislative inclusion.  Same-sex relationships are currently criminalized in 32 African countries, with the death penalty in three African states if convicted and found guilty.  Namibia, formerly known as South West Africa, was a former colony of Germany and later came under the authority of South Africa. Namibia gained independence on March 21, 1990 and celebrated its 33rd independence anniversary on March 21 this year. The constitution of Namibia came into being when the country gained independence. Namibia’s Vision 2030 concerns itself with the population concerning their social, economic and overall well-being and that all people enjoy high standards of living, good quality of life and economic and overall well-being and that all people enjoy high standards of living, good quality of life, and have access to quality social services. All of these aspirations translate into equity, equality and respect for human rights for all people, regardless of one’s social standing. By 2030, Namibia aspires to be a just, moral, tolerant and safe nation with legislative, economic and social structures in place to eliminate marginalization and ensure peace and equity between of all people of different ages, interests and abilities.  The evolution of society  Society is evolving and becoming increasingly aware of its rights and existence. In advocating and asserting their rights, communities realize that such common laws are outdated and contribute to the discrimination faced by vulnerable groups. Colonization fostered environments in which such rules were applied in policy and practice to deter, conceal and repress freedoms of expression, identity and association of groups that did not fit the colonial setting. Such groups were made to feel inferior and less valuable to society, leading to segregation practices such as apartheid, tribalism, classism and discrimination and exclusion of sexual and gender minorities.  In a modern-day democratic, independent state like Namibia, colonial remnants are still widely evident in specific laws and policies, so people like Daniel and Johan, and others, must seek justice from the courts to validate their relationship and belonging. There needs to be a correlation between the legislation and the vision that the country is working towards.  The Bill of Rights is in place to protect and promote the fundamental human rights of Namibians and promote equality before the law and the need for fair, just and speedy court processes. The constitution promotes the rights to liberty, respect for human dignity, equality and freedom from discrimination regardless of a person’s sex, race, or social or economic status association, and even the right to marriage and having a family between same-sex spouses. The blatant denial of the recognition of same-sex marriages by the State violates the right to dignity. It amounts to multiple layers of discrimination by the State, which contrasts with the constitution of Namibia.  Powering forward  Despite these challenges, there have been continuous efforts by LGBTIQ+ advocates and allies to push for greater recognition and acceptance of LGBTIQ+ individuals in Namibia. These efforts include taking an intersectional advocacy approach that is results-based. There is still a long way to go to achieve full equality and protection for LGBTIQ+ individuals in Namibia. In the long exhale process, Digashu has found public support and joined LGBTIQ+ human rights defenders to continue raising awareness and educating the public on human rights and the challenges faced by LGBTIQ+ people. The Digashu matter highlights the need for LGBTIQ+ inclusion and acknowledgement. In its judgment, the Supreme Court noted the need for social and legislative inclusion of LGBTIQ+ persons in Namibia.

"political assassination","1995-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Khartoum"", ""Khartoum"", ""Sudan""}","2023-05-23T18:23:56","Egyptian diplomat Mona Omar argues for the need to boost Egypt’s relations with the African continent on every level in an interview with Doaa El-Bey  Military confrontations in any place in the world leading to the deterioration of living standards and the deaths of civilians are a major concern for any country, Mona Omar, former assistant foreign minister for African affairs and African Union affairs and former presidential envoy to the African Union (AU) told Al-Ahram Weekly in an interview this week.  During her visit to Sudan less than a year ago, she saw that much of the country’s infrastructure was in a bad state. After the recent fighting, she added, it is now dilapidated. Main services are not available, and there is no water and no electricity, and there is a shortage of food.  Omar was referring to the conflict that started in April between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) loyal to Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who follow Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.  Local people have been forced to leave to neighbouring countries including Egypt, she said. Over one million people have been displaced within Sudan and to neighbouring countries according to UNHCR. Some Sudanese have been forced to leave for Chad, a country that is already suffering from pressing economic problems as well as previous border disputes with Sudan and fighting among tribes from both states.  “Hemedti was at some point accused of attempting a coup against the present Chadian president. Thus, there are also vendetta feelings between the two countries,” Omar said.  Chad has sent the refugees to a remote area out of fears that they may interfere in the domestic affairs of the country. Thus, Omar added, Sudanese refugees in Chad are not only suffering from leaving their own country, but also from going to a place where they are not welcome.  As for South Sudan, another neighbouring country forced to receive Sudanese refugees, Omar said it is also suffering from pressing economic problems and in no need of further burdens.  In Ethiopia, she elaborated, the fighting has provided an opportunity for the country to consider claiming part of the border areas that were the subject of disputes with Sudan less than three years ago.  In Egypt, there are between four and five million Sudanese refugees, a sizeable number considering that Egypt is already densely populated. “Any more refugees are likely to present further burdens on Egypt, either on food supplies, services, education or job opportunities,” Omar said. Almost 110,000 Sudanese refugees entered Egypt, said UNHCR spokesperson on May 19.  Sudan has long been suffering from divisions and the presence of militias in various areas in the country including Darfur and Kordofan, Omar said. If the present conflict is extended to involve other militia, this could ignite a war across the country, she added.  Omar said that there are signs that the Wagner Group of Kremlin-backed mercenary forces that are already in control in the Central African Republic are involved behind the scenes in the latest fighting in Sudan.  She warned that the presence of external parties is very likely to widen the circle of the internal conflict, a fact that poses a real danger for Sudan.  The situation in Sudan will also impact on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which is not only a complicated but also a suspended issue. “There are no negotiations and no developments on the ground to give us a glimmer of hope of a breakthrough on this matter,” Omar said.  The statements issued now and then by Egyptian and Sudanese officials on rejecting Ethiopia’s unilateral acts in building the GERD have not stopped Ethiopia and will not stop it, she added.  Omar said that the issue started in January 2011 when the Egyptian government was only able to focus on internal problems. Addis Ababa then took the opportunity to initiate the GERD project.  The post-Omar Al-Bashir regime in Sudan has showed some understanding of the dangers that building the GERD presents to Khartoum. Sudan’s stand has undergone some changes, but at least it has been mostly unbiased if not supportive of Egypt, she said.  “If Sudan’s stand remains neutral, Egypt will be capable of dealing with the issue,” she said, pointing to Cairo’s efforts in the last three years to raise the issue on the bilateral, regional, and international levels and referring it more than once to the UN Security Council.  However, after the latest fighting in Sudan, Omar expressed her expectation that there will be indifference in Sudan to the issue as the priority now is internal affairs. This will have an impact on Egypt’s stand on the GERD, she added.  When Egypt senses that its water security is jeopardised or the Egyptian citizens are facing danger from the GERD, it will not hesitate to act, she said.  DIALOGUE: Omar is also taking part in Egypt’s National Dialogue, launched by President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi in 2022. The aim is to bring together stakeholders to discuss the priorities of national action, and the sessions of the dialogue began this month.  Omar said she was happy that the dialogue is underway because it gives room for discussing issues that had been taboo in the past, like governance and how to activate the role of political parties. It provides room for various parties to express themselves, she said.  However, she said that for the National Dialogue to achieve its promise, there must be proper skills among those who run it. “It could be hollow talk that achieves nothing, or it could be run in a systematic way through which every issue is highlighted, discussed, conclusions reached and submitted to the government,” she said.  Omar regarded the fact that issues like Egypt’s foreign policy and national security will not be included in the dialogue as a negative point. “The government needs to listen to the viewpoints of the participants in the dialogue, who are influential figures in their fields,” she said.  During her career as a diplomat, Omar focused on Africa because she is convinced that the most important continent to Egypt are the African countries.  President Al-Sisi is interested in improving Egypt’s relations with Africa, she said, and he has paid special attention to the African countries, especially during Egypt’s chairmanship of the AU in 2019.  Under former president Gamal Abdel-Nasser, Egypt played a historical role in supporting the African liberation movements in their struggle against colonisation. Late president Hosni Mubarak was interested in the African continent at the beginning of his rule, until the assassination attempt against him in 1995, she said.  During the 1980s, Egypt managed through the Egyptian Fund for Technical Support in Africa (EFTCA), established in 1980, to dispatch some 7,000 to 8,000 Egyptian experts in various disciplines to different place throughout the continent. Their mission was to transfer their expertise to the African countries,  However, Egyptians “should know more and belong more to the continent”, Omar said.  Various African countries have taken sizeable leaps in various fields including education, economy and democracy, she elaborated. Rwanda is one of the best examples, she added, saying that she had worked there after the massacres in the 1990s.  Today, thanks to the vision of the country’s people and rulers, Rwanda is the first state in representing women in parliament in the world, with participation reaching 66 per cent.  Egyptians should also know that Africa is part of Egypt’s national security and food security and that Egypt relies on the support of the African states whenever it applies for an international post or membership in an international organisation, she said.  Omar pointed to the importance of Egypt’s cultural presence in Africa. “There should be continuous communication on the cultural and popular level, among political parties, young people, women, civil society organisations and the like,” she said.  She remembers the incident when Egypt’s membership of the AU was suspended in 2013 and she was dispatched to correct the misinterpretations in Africa about Egypt’s 30 June Revolution.  “Had we had an active media that was present in the African states, we would not have had to explain to the AU and African presidents the truth about what happened,” she said.  “We are exerting great efforts on the political and diplomatic levels, but unless these are accompanied by similar efforts on the other levels they will not be useful.”  WOMEN: As a member of the board of the National Council of Women (NCW), Omar said that this has taken huge leaps to advance the status of women over the last few years, starting from the number of articles in the constitution that support women’s rights to dedicating a year for women in 2017 to the strategies prepared to empower women and the capacity-building programmes that are present in all the governorates.  The NCW has issued laws further punishing female genital mutilation (FGM) and sexual harassment. “However, more important is the appreciation that the President has given to women whose role is acknowledged on every occasion,” she said.  Egypt is the first Arab country to have prepared a strategy to combat violence against women, she noted.  Omar’s mission to empower women is not only through the NCW, but also through her role in various NGOs, including Women of the Nile, an NGO that she established in Egypt and that aims to include women from the different Nile Basin countries to establish cultural links and act as a pressure group on decision-makers.  The January 2011 Revolution hampered the project, but there are plans to revive it with Minister of Planning Hala Al-Said, Omar said. She is also a member of Salema, another NGO that aims to combat violence against women.  Omar is also a member of organisations that work to improve the conditions of African citizens, including the UN Permanent Forum of People of African Descent.  She heads to New York late this month where she will attend a second meeting. “Traditionally, they used to focus on black people who live in the Caribbean and Latin America. However, I believe that that the issue of discrimination should be extended to our continent,” she said.  “As an Egyptian of African descent, I may be subjected to discrimination because of my nationality, colour, or beliefs,” Omar said, arguing strongly for the issuing of a declaration protesting against this.  Finally, Omar is also a member of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), a group of experts that follows the development of policies in African countries in terms of democracy, human rights, and good governance, and produces a report to be discussed with the leader of each state.  The group casts light on best practices in each country and urges others to follow suit.  * A version of this article appears in print in the 25 May, 2023 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly  Search Keywords:  Short link:  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3cy81MDE1MTIuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2018-10-15","Not Discerned","{""Sliema"", ""Sliema"", ""Malta""}","2023-05-23T13:14:00","The Public Accounts Committee has agreed to suspend the hearing of alleged mastermind Yorgen Fenech, after lawyers requested that he testify only after criminal proceedings against him are over.  Fenech is accused of commissioning the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.  Before Fenech was sworn in, defence lawyer Charles Mercieca informed the committee that the alleged mastermind would not be sworn to testify, saying that the NAO report under discussion pertained to the alleged motive informing the criminal charges against him.  “Since the alleged motive for the crime is the subject under discussion in this committee, we consulted Erskine May, which says ‘committees have suspended inquiries in progress because witnesses have been charged with crimes connected to the subject matter under inquiry…’”  Mercieca said the committee should suspend Fenech’s testimony, pending the outcome of the criminal case against him. At one point, Fenech moved to pass a comment to chairman Darren Carabott, who called him to attention that he could not speak before taking an oath.  “He is fighting for his life in court,” Mercieca told Carabott, saying that was the forum in which Fenech should be made to speak.  After a 10-minute recess, Mercieca verbalised his request for the hearing to be suspended, citing the Erskine May, as well as the Speaker’s rulings of 25 November, 2019, 26 November 2019, and 16 June, 2020.  Mercieca said the compilation of evidence against Fenech had already indicated that matters related to Electrogas contract will form part of the criminal trial against him.  Mercieca however said that Yorgen Fenech wanted to testify before the committee only after the criminal proceedings against him are concluded.  Effectively the PAC hearings on the Electrogas contract will continue until after a criminal court concludes proceedings in the charges against Fenech.  Carabott said in a parting shot that it was something “exceptional” that the use of Maltese taxpayers’ money was now the subject of a criminal case in the court of law. Labour MPs replied wryly to his observation. “I trust this committee will not be turned into some political football,” Andy Ellul said.  This was Yorgen Fenech’s first appearance out of court, and his first chance to speak in a public forum.  The PAC hearings of former chief of staff Keith Schembri had to be suspended after Schembri filed a constitutional case, claiming a breach of his rights when PAC chairman Darren Carabott and two Nationalist MPs filed a criminal report alleging perjury.  Schembri is believed to have used an offshore company in Panama, surreptitiously opened after 2013, that had also identified another secret offshore company belonging to Fenech, 17 Black, as a potential target client according to correspoondence from his auditors.  17 Black, located in Dubai, is believed to have been used to channel illicit payments from Fenech to other players connected in some way to the €200 million Electrogas bid, which includes partners from Azeri state gas company SOCAR, and German company Siemens.  Schembri resigned from chief of staff to former prime minister Joseph Muscat in December 2019 soon after the arrest of Fenech, which came on the heels of the arrest of Melvin Theuma, a pardoned criminal who acted as the go-between between Fenech and the executors of the assassination, brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbHRhdG9kYXkuY29tLm10L25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvMTIzMDYxL2VsZWN0cm9nYXNfcGFjX3lvcmdlbl9mZW5lY2hfM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-02-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T22:48:56","TALLAHASSEE – Attorneys for Walt Disney Parks & Resorts US Inc. in a 77 page filing Wednesday, sued Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis over what the company alleges is a “targeted campaign of government retaliation—orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney’s protected speech.”  Disney had expressed opposition to the anti-LGBTQ+ ‘Parental Rights in Education bill’ the governor signed into law a year ago, which opponents have labeled as the “Don’t Say Gay” law.  In response to DeSantis signing H.B. 1557, titled “Parental Rights in Education,” into law a spokesperson for the Walt Disney Company had issued a statement condemning the legislation.  “Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law. Our goal as a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts, and we remain committed to supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that. We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”  DeSantis accused Disney of imposing a “woke ideology” and warned that it’ll “destroy” the United States if left “unabated.”  Speaking to reporters at the state capitol DeSantis ranted: “For Disney to come out and put a statement and say that the bill should have never passed and that they are going to actively work to repeal it, I think one was fundamentally dishonest, but two, I think that crossed the line.”  The governor added: “This state is governed by the interest of the people of the state of Florida, it is not based on the demands of California corporate executives. They do not run this state, they do not control this state.”  The battlelines were drawn and over this past year, DeSantis and his allies have escalated the attacks on the media conglomerate. In mid April of 2022, the governor announced that he had expanded the special session of the state legislature to include eliminating the 1967 law that allows the Walt Disney World Resort property to operate as a self-governing body.  The bill that would dissolve Walt Disney World’s 55-year-old self-government by June of 2023 was given final passage by Florida’s Republican-controlled state legislature that would eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney self-government is known in late April of 2022.  In May, a trio of Central Florida residents who live near the Walt Disney Resort filed suit Tuesday in federal court, claiming that the Republican Governor Ron DeSantis violated the rights of the state’s taxpayers with passage of the anti-Disney law that stripped the media conglomerate of its special self-governing status.  Michael Foronda, Edward Foronda and Vivian Gorsky filed an 11 page complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, that alleges that the law signed by DeSantis at the end of April eliminating the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney self-government is known, will burden them and other Floridan taxpayers with Disney’s bond debt which is estimated at more than $1 billion.  3 weeks ago as the public feud between DeSantis and Disney raged on, Disney invoked a rare legal clause.  Before DeSantis could replace the Reedy Creek Improvement District board of supervisors, that Disney-allied panel signed a long-lasting development agreement that drastically limits his control. The former Reedy Creek Development board signed its power back to the Disney company before leaving office, a binding declaration that doesn’t expire until England’s monarchy dies out.  CNBC reported: “On Feb. 8, the day before the Florida House voted to put DeSantis in charge, the previous Disney-allied board signed a long-lasting development agreement that drastically limits the control that can be exercised over the company and its district.  As part of a 30-year development agreement, Disney no longer needs board approval to build high-density projects or buildings of any height and can sell or assign development rights. It also bans the board from using Disney’s name or any of its characters.”  To thwart the Florida Governor’s hand-picked appointed board, the agreement included an obscure but legal “royal clause dating back to the reign of William III, also widely known as William of Orange, in 1692 which would extend its term limit for decades.  This “Declaration shall continue in effect until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England, living as of the date of this declaration,” the document said.  Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis (Screenshot/YouTube NBC News Meet The Press)  When the governor replaced all of the Disney-allied board members with five Republicans on Feb. 27, it was only then that Disney’s new binding agreement was discovered. The clause was so obscure that several journalists who attended a Feb. 8 meeting apparently didn’t pick up on it.  “This essentially makes Disney the government,” Ron Peri, one of the new board members appointed to the CFTOD by DeSantis, said at the Feb. 27 meeting. “This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.”  CNN reported that DeSantis’ political allies overseeing Disney’s special taxing district threatened last week to hike taxes, raise utility rates and develop land around the entertainment giant’s Central Florida theme parks as retribution for the company’s efforts to avoid a state takeover.  In a meeting full of harsh words for one of the state’s largest private employers, board members accused Disney of engaging in a covert, yet legally flawed attempt to take over the district’s powers and thwart DeSantis’ power grab and vowed it would not stand.  “It really is shameful what Disney tried to do,” board chairman Martin Garcia said.  The comments echoed recent criticism from DeSantis, who on Monday vowed swift punishment against Disney and suggested a prison or competing theme park could be built on the land around the company’s vast Orlando-area footprint.  In the court filing, Disney attorney’s made note of the governor’s threat: “The Governor  recently declared that his team would not only “void the development agreement”—just as they did today—but also planned “to look at things like taxes on the hotels,” “tolls on the roads,” “developing some of the property that the district owns” with “more amusement parks,” and even putting a “state prison” next to Walt Disney World. “Who knows? I just think the possibilities are endless,” he said.”  The company expressed that it had enough of the governor’s threats, actions, and using the state government as a weapon directed at it: ” Disney regrets that it has come to this. But having exhausted efforts to seek a resolution, the Company is left with no choice but to file this lawsuit to protect its cast members, guests, and local development partners from a relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint unpopular with certain State officials.”  In a news conference in Israel Thursday where he is on an economic development junket, DeSantis criticized the move by Disney: “I don’t think the suit has merit, I think it’s political,” he told reporters.  “They had no transparency, no accountability, none of that, and that arrangement was not good for the state of Florida. We did not think that that should continue, so we now have brought accountability,” the governor added.  ******************************************************************************************","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvc2FuZ2VsZXNibGFkZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9zb3V0aGVybi11dGFoLWRyYWctc3RhcnMtZmlsZS1sYXdzdWl0LW92ZXItZHJhZy1zaG93LXBlcm1pdC1kZW5pYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2004-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T10:08:12","DOHA, Qatar, May 23, 2023 (BSS) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina today called upon the Qatar University students to be the change-makers being remained focus on vision having the mentality to embrace the new and future.  ""Lead by example and be the change-maker,"" she said while addressing a session with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the students of Qatar University on theme titled ""Bangladesh: a development model: Learning from Sheikh Hasina.""  The Premier, who is now on a three-day official visit to Doha to attend the Qatar Economic Forum-2023, told the students, ""To represent a value, remaining focused on your vision and make concrete plans to realize your vision.""  She also said: ""Trust your people and team. Invoke your maternal spirit, and embrace the new and the future.""  During her long speech, Sheikh Hasina gave a brief description of the struggle of achieving Bangladesh's independence under the leadership of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and advancing the country towards transforming it into a developed, prosperous and Smart Bangladesh by 2041.  ""We want to build a knowledge-based, SMART Bangladesh. In SMART Bangladesh, there will be a smart government, a smart economy, a smart population, a smart society, and smart manpower,"" she said.  The Prime Minister said the people will be made skilled in using digital devices so that they can contribute to the fourth industrial revolution.  She went on saying that the purpose of Smart Bangladesh is to keep pace with the changing world and use digital devices in all areas of education, health, agriculture, industrial production, business, and trade.  ""To achieve the goals, we are setting up digital labs in all educational institutions, from primary to higher education. Computer training and incubation centers and hi-tech parks are being established throughout the country,"" Sheikh Hasina said.  Skilled manpower is being built through training in artificial intelligence, she said, adding that they have passed an act to establish a nanotechnology institution.  The use of digital devices or technology has created vast employment opportunities for women in our society, the premier said.  ""Today's Bangladesh is a changed Bangladesh. It is dubbed as a role model for development. Hunger, poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy and etc are vanishing fast,"" she said  The Prime Minister said their hard-earned development in the country is not a miracle.  ""It is the collective work of our men and women. I have only tried to guide them in the desired direction,"" she continued.  Sheikh Hasina said, however, it was not an easy journey to reach today's position as she have had to undergo huge ordeals and persecution throughout her life.  ""My father had to spend nearly one-fourth of his life in prison. We, the children, had been deprived of his love and affection. Within three and a half years of independence, the founder of the country, my father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated along with 18 of our family members, including my mother, three brothers, two sisters-in-law, and an uncle,"" she continued.  Sheikh Hasina said her youngest brother was only ten years old at the time.  ""My sister and I survived being abroad on that day. My sister and I had to lead a refugee life for six years,"" she said.  Sheikh Hasina said she returned home in 1981, when her party Awami League made her its president.  ""I came home with a pledge to materialize my father's dream of a poverty-, hunger, and illiteracy-free, prosperous Bangladesh,"" she said.  On return, Sheikh Hasina said she launched a movement for establishing the rights to food and vote. I was interned time and again.  ""At least 19 attempts were made on my life, the gravest one being in August 2004 when a dozen Arges grenades were hurled at me to kill me. I survived, but 22 of my party workers and leaders were killed and several hundred wounded,"" she said.  Braving all odds, Sheikh Hasina said she continued her struggle only to change the fates of her countrymen.  ""I shall continue to do so as long as I live, Insha'Allah. My dream is to turn our delta into a land of prosperity once again,"" she pledged.  Following Bangabandhu's assassination, she said Bangladesh went under military and quasi-military rule for the subsequent 21 years, and the fates of the people had not changed much.  ""My party, the Awami League, got elected to office in 1996 after a long struggle of 21 years, and I was made Prime Minister for the first time. In five years, we managed to build a solid foundation for Bangladesh's socio-economic transformation,"" she said.  The premier said they handed over power through peaceful means in 2001, and then followed another dark period of killings, terrorism, corruption, and military interventions.  She said their party got re-elected to office in December 2008, and since then for two more consecutive terms.  ""In the last fourteen and a half years, we got Bangladesh ready for what my father had wished for-a happy and prosperous 'Golden Bangladesh,"" she said.  In 2015, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh became a lower middle-income country, and they envision it becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2031 and a high-income one by 2041.  ""Meanwhile, we have been qualified to graduate to a developing country by 2026 from the LDC category,"" she said.  The Prime Minister said since the assumed office, their priority has been to alleviate the conditions of the poor and marginalized sections of society.  Bangladesh has made impressive progress in almost all socio-economic fields, she said.  ""Bangladesh is now the world's 35th largest economy, with a GDP of USD 460.75 billion,"" Sheikh Hasina said.  The headcount poverty rate was 41.5 percent in 2005-06, while the current poverty rate has come down to 18.7 percent and the extreme poverty rate to 5.6 percent, she continued.  The premier said that Bangladesh's economy grew at an average of 6.5 percent over the past one and a half decades, and before the pandemic struck, it grew at 8.15 percent in the 2018-19 fiscal year.  ""We have made impressive gains in food security, free and affordable housing, community healthcare, compulsory primary education, women's empowerment, financial inclusion, digital services, access to electricity, disaster preparedness, and climate adaptation,"" she said.  After a decade's efforts that include make education free up to 12th grade by her government, she said, ""We now rank the highest in South Asia in reducing gender disparity.""  Due to her government's initiatives, she said ""We are among the world's top ten nations for women's political empowerment.""  Bangladesh is perhaps the only country where the Prime Minister, Speaker of the National Parliament, Leader of the Opposition in Parliament, and Deputy Leader of the House are all women, she said.  ""We have 33 percent reserved seats for our women in the local government bodies,"" Sheikh Hasina continued.  The Prime Minister said she has introduced a scheme named Ashrayan  (Shelter) through which semi-pucca houses are being built and distributed among landless and homeless people at free of cost.  ""The total number of landless and homeless families in the country is 885 thousand and 622. So far, we have built and distributed houses among 555 thousand and 228 families,"" she said.  Not only that, but arrangements for their livelihoods have been made through income-generating training and providing them with interest-free loans, she added.  The villages of Bangladesh are being turned into towns by reaching urban facilities in every nook and cranny of the country, she said.

"political assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-24T01:17:10","Equitable policing is, in part, an agency’s policy and regulation designed to create unbiased and fair treatment of everyone law enforcement encounters. But how to get there can be complicated. Jurisdictions and police departments across the United States are struggling with how best to accomplish it. Fairfax County is no exception.  On May 16, Phillip A. Niedzielski-Eichner, convener of the Police Reform Matrix Working Group, and Dr. Vernon C. Walton, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Vienna, presented “Community Recommendations for More Equitable Policing in Fairfax County” to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Safety and Security Committee. Supervisor Rodney Lusk (D-Franconia), chairman, Supervisor James Walkinshaw (D-Braddock), vice-chairman, and all board members serve on the Safety and Security Committee. The proposed action plan by the Police Reform Matrix Working Group presented eight topics, from rethinking policing to independent oversight and more.  Lusk noted that the “Community Recommendations for More Equitable Policing in Fairfax County” would inform a series of presentations later this year. Fairfax County Chief Kevin Davis would have an opportunity to respond to the matrix group's recommendations.  Opening Remarks  Niedzielski-Eichner said when he chaired the Use of Force subcommittee of the Ad Hoc Police Practices Review Commission (2015), the board and police department followed the subcommittee's recommendations. Niedzielski-Eichner recalled in his presentation that rewriting use-of-force policies emphasized ""de-escalation as a first response to provocation; giving officers access to tools less lethal than firearms; supplying and requiring body-worn cameras; and strengthening the use of force reporting and transparency.""  The subcommittee realized it would be a mistake to declare ""mission accomplished,"" Niedzielski-Eichner said, Other initiatives, such as this one, Community Recommendations for More Equitable Policing, should follow.  To set the stage for the upcoming ""matrix"" discussion, Walton said that when the country faced twin pandemics, Supervisor Rodney Lusk, chair of the Public Safety Committee, requested community input and police reforms. ""We were wrestling with a major health crisis compounded by racial unrest,"" he said. Walton described the assassination of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer.  ""This awareness and level of heightening sensitivity were felt here in Fairfax County,"" Walton said. He added that Black and brown individuals are more likely to experience a force disparity in arrest. Demographics of the population can reveal a pattern of ""police behavior or racial profiling.""  ""A dramatic rise in police shootings [in Fairfax County] over our ten-year average is cause for concern and warrants reflective conversation about the sanctity of life. Trust is paramount, and where there is an erosion of trust, it is difficult for a community to be its best self,"" Walton said.  Lusk explained that the ten members of the citizen-led Police Reform Matrix Working Group helped synthesize the more than 300-plus recommendations from the community compiled in the matrix. “The hope is that we will craft those into a set of policy recommendations,” said Lusk.  He named the Working Group members:, Diane Burkley Alejandro, Sadaf Atashbarghi-Nehr, Dirck Hargraves, Prince Howard, Mary Kimm, Jennifer Lockwood-Shabat, Philip Niedzielski-Eichner, Convenor Adrian Steel, Eric Ubias, and Vernon Walton.  Suggestions captured in the spreadsheet dubbed ""the matrix"" by Lusk and maintained by Fairfax County Police Department grew into a “cumbersome compendium” of over 300 ideas, according to Niedzielski-Eichner. They were reviewed and commented on by the police. The Working Group met to synthesize the matrix's recommendations into a proposed action for consideration by the Board of Supervisors.  The action plan recommended that the initiatives meet four criteria:  * Does it provide policy or program-level direction that can be acted upon by the board or the police chief?  * Is it a policy- or program-level initiative with the potential for significant positive impact?  * Is it evidence-based, which can include a member’s lived experiences?  * Is it consistent with national best practices, or does it have the potential to become national best practices?""  Policing Use of Force  ""The public, through the matrix, understands that historically, police have largely, by default, been tasked with being first responders when a behavioral health crisis arises … (This) criminalizes the affected population,"" Niedzielski-Eichner said. A summary statement on policing and the use of force calls for a rethinking of policing. It assigned non-safety responsibilities to clinical and social service professions, expanded Diversion First and co-responder programs, and identified and is open to other policing models.  The use of force policy and accountability is a work in progress, based on findings from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and evaluated by Fairfax County's Use of Force Community Advisory Committee. ""They warrant active reconsideration,"" Niedzielski-Eichner said, referring to an alternative standard to the ""objective reasonable"" standard.  ""We recommend moving to a standard where the use of force must be, in principle, necessary and proportional,"" Niedzielski-Eichner said. ""We recommend that pointing a firearm be considered and documented as a use of force.” They recommended that the county implement key policy and program reforms, such as the de-escalation policies that are currently in place.  Walton noted that the Community Advisory Committee (CAC) and General Order 540 (2022) adopted several recommendations, but most still need to be fully implemented.  ""Pointing a gun or any other threatening weapon should be a reportable use of force action and subject to review … . We’re asking that the board direct that a foot pursuit policy be established with community participation,"" Walton said. A Fairfax County Police Officer shot and killed Timothy Johnson, an unarmed shoplifting suspect, during a foot pursuit in Tysons earlier this year.  Oversight  Even though Fairfax County was among the first jurisdictions to establish a civil review panel, Walton said that ""the panel is only as good as the authority the panel has.""  “This body is responsible for the parameters of the panel. The community is asking, the committee is asking that you open the lanes … Give the civilian review panel independent investigating authority that is now permitted by the Virginia General Assembly,"" Walton said.  Police Officer Excellence  The Fairfax County Police Department's recent recruitment success, according to Niedzielski-Eichner, must be followed by the retention of highly effective officers. They must be held accountable for their actions, accept responsibility for the ""total community,"" and have access to physical and mental fitness to perform their demanding jobs. He recommended conducting regular “customer survey audits” of police department personnel to facilitate dialogue between officers and supervisors.  Community Engagement  Research and national best practices support the benefits of authentic community engagement and the likelihood that a solution will be widely accepted, Niedzielski-Eichner said.  Most importantly, community engagement encourages the development of a trusting relationship. While the FCPD has designed and implemented numerous programs, more needs to be done, particularly to engage community members who perceive themselves to be marginalized. This policy would build on the One Fairfax policy.  ""Engagement is how we build trust,” Walton said. ""People love to be heard, and there's a tremendous sense that many voices are not being heard.""  Data  Although FCPD has made ""great strides,"" as Niedzielski-Eichner stated, ""current public data discourages year-over-year comparisons ... Standardized formats rarely include measures of disparate treatment among classes of community members.""  He said FCPD leadership ""needs to be consistently careful about offering premature judgments or information about an incident that is either exculpatory outside the scope of an officer's behavior or judgmental about a person of interest due to previous law enforcement history.""  Specialized Police Units  Following the recent shootings by Tyson's Urban Team officers, Niedzielski-Eichner said the community and CAC recommend looking at the FCPD's specialized units for their policy frameworks. The Working Group suggests that a subset with the greatest community interest be examined for value-impacted practices, particularly those affecting people of color.  Evaluating Program Progress  The fundamental questions, according to Niedzielski-Eichner, are whether the program is intended to improve policing in Fairfax County; whether it achieves the intended purpose(s); whether resources are well-allocated; and ""what lessons are learned through the implementation that will make the program much better?""  Walton concluded his presentation by saying that he reluctantly agreed to participate in this process. ""I didn't want to serve on another task force that would produce a body of work that would ultimately sit on the shelf without the possibility of becoming a living document,"" Walton said. He added that he came because of his belief in political will and that this body, the Board of Supervisors, has the political will to do what is right.  Walton said he felt compelled by moral conviction to present the document and the enclosed recommendations on behalf of Fairfax County residents, hoping that the supervisors would give it full consideration and eventually adoption. Walton said, ""We respectfully ask that you are bold and courageous and do it without delay.""  Lusk said the board must allow Chief Davis to look at the recommendations and provide feedback. As for rethinking policing, they have been working hard to hire the mental health clinicians the county needs for the co-responder implementation. ""This is a tough task,"" Lusk said. ""We do have three of our four units up and running. So we need one more unit to cover the county.”  Lusk said that they must work on training, de-escalation, and determining patience, time, and distance — all of which are critical to reducing the use of force.  They have been working with the civilian review panel under independent supervision and have hired an executive director and an assistant to that director to help them build out their infrastructure. The issue of granting the civil review board additional and expanded authority was raised by Lusk, and the board discussed it last year.  According to Lusk, transparency and data are critical. ""If you want trust and accountability, you need to have transparency in the data … We can continue to make progress … This is a document that’s not completed; it will continue to evolve over time and improve over time. I’ve read [recommendations] clearly and carefully and understand what the request is, and we will be working to bring back to this body the responses from the department and then the responses from this board.""

"political assassination","1975-11-07","Not Discerned","{""Dhaka"", ""Dhaka"", ""Bangladesh""}","2023-05-23T11:01:07","Naheed Ezaher Khan was a child in November 1975. So was Mehjabeen Khaled. Today Khan is a member of parliament in Bangladesh. And Khaled has served as a lawmaker in an earlier parliament in the country.  Khan and Khaled had their fathers, senior military officers, along with another military officer, murdered on the morning of 7 November 1975 by soldiers loyal to other military officers. Khaled Musharraf, Khondokar Najmul Huda and A.T.M Haider, having initiated a coup aimed at a restoration of the chain of command broken by the violent coup against the government of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August 1975 by a clutch of majors and colonels, had their attempts foiled by a counter-coup led by loyalists of General Ziaur Rahman and Col Abu Taher.  Early on 3 November 1975, Brigadier Khaled Musharraf and his loyalists in the Bangladesh army, among whom were Huda and Haider, launched a coup, the first step in which was the removal of General Ziaur Rahman from the position of chief of army staff and his detention at home. Over the next few days, Musharraf engaged in intense negotiations with Khondokar Moshtaq Ahmed, who had been installed in office by the assassins of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as Bangladesh’s President in August, over a removal of the coup makers who till then had been ensconced at Bangabhaban, the official presidential residence.  In the end, Musharraf, who had taken over as the new chief of army staff and had been promoted to the rank of major general, succeeded in having the assassin-majors and colonels and their families put on a flight out of the country. It would later transpire, though, that prior to the assassins being sent off into exile, they had carried out the assassinations of four senior leaders of Bangladesh in prison, where they had been lodged since the murder of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The four men — Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, M. Mansoor Ali, A.H.M. Kamruzzaman — had played pivotal roles in the Bangladesh government-in-exile in 1971 and later served in the Mujib government in post-liberation Bangladesh.  On 6 November, General Musharraf finally removed Moshtaq from the presidency, replacing him with Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Musharraf and his allies, army units loyal to Zia outside the capital Dhaka were organising themselves; and in Dhaka cantonment itself Col Taher, supported by the Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal (JSD), a political party formed in 1972 and violently opposed to the Mujib government, busily organised the counter-coup that would topple Musharraf and restore Zia as chief of army staff.  The coup led by General Musharraf collapsed early on 7 November 1975. Convinced that 10 Bengal, an army regiment considered loyal to him and one he had led in the war against Pakistan, would provide him with safe sanctuary, Musharraf took shelter in its headquarters along with Huda and Haider. It soon became apparent, however, that they had in fact stepped into hostile territory. Within minutes of their arrival there, exhausted as they were and sitting down to breakfast, they were taken prisoner by Zia-Taher loyalists and murdered. Across Dhaka, soldiers raising the Islamic chant of ‘Nara-er-Takbir’ and ‘Allah-o-akbar’ paraded the streets in triumph.  The tragedy for Bangladesh is that in these forty-eight years that have gone by since Khaled Musharraf and his two fellow officers were murdered, no investigation into their killings has been undertaken and hence no trial of the perpetrators of the crime has taken place. Among citizens, there have of course been speculations about the tragic incidents of the day. It is well to recall that soon after the fall of Khaled Musharraf, Najmul Huda and A.T.M. Haider, apologists of the new regime led by Zia disseminated the falsehood that the three officers had been pro-Indian officers in league with Delhi regarding the coup of 3 November.  Musharraf and the two officers, together with Zia and Taher, were honoured freedom fighters during Bangladesh’s armed struggle for liberation in 1971. Musharraf was regarded as a brilliant tactician and one of the smartest officers in the Mukti Bahini. Ironically, in the period beginning in 1975 and ending in September 1981, an entire group of freedom fighter officers lost their lives in internecine struggles for power.  That the wheels of justice, insofar as the murder of Musharraf, Huda and Haider is concerned, are beginning to turn is a process Naheed Ezaher Khan, the daughter of Col Najmul Huda, has now initiated. Khan has filed a case at a police station in Dhaka, seeking justice over the killing of her father close to five decades ago. She has charged Major (retired) Abdul Jalil, who was with 10 Bengal Regiment on the day Huda and the two other officers were killed, with committing the crime. She has also mentioned in the case that the murder of her father was carried out on the orders of General Ziaur Rahman.  The case filed by Khan is only the beginning. The fact remains that Bangladesh’s history between August 1975 and September 1981, spent as it was in a series of power struggles by army officers, needs closure. But that can only happen when meaningful measures are taken to inquire into the circumstances of all the tragic incidents that have occurred. The issue of who in the military hierarchy were involved in the making of such tragedy; of all the men, officers as well as jawans, involved in the killings; of a need to ferret out the guilty who are yet alive and passing through old age — all of this calls for focused inquiry.  The trial of the killers of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has been completed, with a good number of the assassins walking the gallows. Five others remain on the run, outside the country. There is too the need to launch an inquiry into the role Khondokar Moshtaq played in the assassinations of August 1975. Likewise, the identities of the murderers of the four national leaders in prison in early November 1975 as also those of the men who sanctioned the killings must be known if arriving at justice is the goal.  Of those who took part in the killing of Khaled Musharraf and his fellow officers as well as those who celebrated the assassinations, some may have passed into their graves. But there are others, officers and ordinary soldiers, who ought to be netted and brought to trial. Questions have abounded too about the role of such JSD stalwarts as Hasanul Haq Inu, who on 7 November was spotted in the company of General Zia and Col Taher. In his subsequent career, Inu had his faction of the JSD align with the Awami League, making it possible for him to serve in Sheikh Hasina’s government as minister for information.  The killings of 3 and 7 November 1975 were not to be the end to Bangladesh’s tragedy. In October 1977, an abortive revolt by men of the air force led to mass arrests of hundreds of these men by General Zia’s regime and their quick despatch, without due process, to the grave. By July 1976, Col Taher, having masterminded the pro-Zia coup against Khaled Musharraf and then falling out with him, was tried by a military court in camera and hanged by the Zia dispensation.  In his five years in office as Bangladesh’s first military ruler, General Ziaur Rahman withstood as many as eighteen attempted coups against his regime. He fell on the nineteenth when on 30 May 1981 a putsch led by a group of soldiers led to his assassination in Chittagong. Within days, General M.A. Manzur, general officer commanding in Chittagong and accused of having organised the putsch, was apprehended and detained in the cantonment. A senior army officer was then sent from Dhaka allegedly by General Hussein Muhammad Ershad, the chief of army staff. The officer shot Manzur dead.  No investigations have gone into the Zia and Manzur killings. Thirteen officers, including a brigadier, were charged with Zia’s murder, court martialled and hanged in September 1981. Questions have persisted as to whether these officers were actually involved in the Zia murder or whether their executions were a move to cover-up the truth.  The case filed by Naheed Ezaher Khan should be opening the door to a process of justice, for many are the truths which have lain concealed in silence all these decades. With the government of Sheikh Hasina in office, an administration which has gone, however carefully, into the task of restoring a secular ambience in Bangladesh, the responsibility of ensuring the rule of law, of bringing the guilty, dead or alive, to trial becomes an imperative.

At some point during that media release of his “special rapporteur” report on the merits of holding a public inquiry into foreign interference in recent elections, former governor general David Johnston must’ve realized he’d been had by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  Having taken the job believing there was a clear pathway for him to simply rummage around top-secret files and call for a public inquiry, Johnston says the facts forced him to take a loose-gravel, cliff-hugging, road-less-travelled detour.  He viewed the full intelligence file on leaked examples of Chinese interference – and found it conflicted with Global TV stories based on snippets of secret material.  The spy agencies told him almost everything he viewed would never be allowed out of the room – and Johnston realized it didn’t make sense to stage a public inquiry based on shielded evidence.  And after a parade of cabinet ministers and the prime minister described how they couldn’t access spy agency alerts or be given foreign intelligence that hadn’t been validated, he couldn’t find any proof they were lying to save their political skins - if indeed he looked for it.  So the former vice-regal was confronted with a no-win choice.  The raging headlines and angry public mood meant he could only reject an inquiry if he did something to appease the mobs clamouring for a probe or else he would stand accused of authoring a cover-up.  So Johnston opted to call for the sham of a public hearings he will personally supervise this fall.

Sorry, but the perception prevails of them as neighbourly chums in the Laurentian Elite backed by evidence suggesting due diligence was deliberately lacking as he put together his report.  For example, Johnston didn’t reach out to former Conservative leader Erin O’Toole until last week. This was the former leader most vocal about Chinese electoral interference, yet Johnston’s report was already on its way to the printers for translation, by the time an O’Toole interview was booked.  Johnston also took great pains to probe and question the accuracy of news reports yet failed to examine the Trudeau Foundation’s role in the controversy after it received substantial money from Chinese benefactors looking to buy friends in high places.  And his conclusion that senior Liberals didn’t know about Chinese efforts to help elect a Liberal minority mandate was based on merely asking the prime minister if that was the case. Not surprisingly, Trudeau said it wasn’t.  To bottom line this Liberal-friendly 59-page verdict, Johnston found communications gaps in government instead of credibility gaps.  He declared the government’s handling of foreign interference allegations and threats to be incomplete not incompetent.  And on the key issue of how this government’s internal reactions to interference reports, Johnston has already delivered his findings. The “hearings will not focus on ‘who knew what and what did they do about it’. I have examined these issues, drawn conclusions, and provided as much information as possible to the public,” he declared.  And so, the stage is set for publicity seekers volunteering to appear before Johnston in circus-like hearings to rant their views for the cameras, be they somebodies or nobodies.

Arnolfo ""Arnie"" Teves Jr. on Monday, May 29.  Committee chairman, COOP-NATCCO Party-list Rep. Felimon Espares personally announced this Tuesday, May 23 after confirming that the panel has once again taken jurisdiction of the case of  Teves, who is considered absent without official leave.  ""This committee again [was] able to acquire the jurisdiction by motu proprio to further investigate the absences of our member after the lapse of [the] 60-day suspension...yesterday (May 22),"" Espares told House reporters following a closed-door hearing of the committee.  Last March 22, House members unanimously voted to penalize Teves with the two-month suspension for ""disorderly behavior"".  Teves has been out of the country since Feb. 28. His travel authority from the House indicated that he should've been back home by March 10.  The former deputy speaker was recently filed with murder charges in connection with the March 4 assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo. Teves has repeatedly said that he refuses to go home for fear of his life.  He went as far as to apply for political asylum in Timor-Leste earlier this month. Although it was rejected, his asylum attempt will surely be discussed by the Espares panel, among other details.  ""Again, we will be continuing our committee process dito (here), so we have scheduled again another Committee hearing on the 29th of this month in order to hear and process the case,"" said Espares.  The ethics committee had rejected Teves' attempts to join previous hearings via videoconferencing. As per the panel members, Teves must attend the hearings in person.  The 60-day suspension against Teves, which the committee recommended to the plenary in March, is unprecedented in the House.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbWIuY29tLnBoLzIwMjMvNS8yMy9ldGhpY3MtcGFuZWwtdG8tY29udGludWUtaGVhcmluZy10ZXZlcy1jYXNlLWFzLXN1c3BlbnNpb24tZW5kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

For a chance to be featured in my newsletter, email me your answer.  Burning down the House: Why GOP doesn’t want a debt deal, and what Biden should do  The classic vocal group The Ink Spots had a Top Five hit in 1941 with a song titled, “I Don’t Want To Set The World On Fire.” I’m guessing that The Ink Spots wouldn’t have lasted more than a day in the 2020s’ discordant ensemble of political arsonists known as the Republican Party.  Indeed, there’s already been a potential forest fire of kindling created by all the dead-tree newspaper articles speculating what the GOP really wants in its aggrieved negotiations with President Joe Biden and his team over the once-routine and dull political act of raising the nation’s debt limit, necessitated by the non-stop borrowing that keeps the lights on for the federal government. But in reality, you can explain it with just seven words.  Advertisement  They want to burn it all down.  I do mean this in the quite literal sense, as one of the central demands of the narrow-majority House Republicans led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy is gutting the climate-change provisions in 2022′s Biden-backed Inflation Reduction Act, trashing hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives for things like electric vehicles and solar panels, and increasing the odds that heat-fueled wildfires will surround places like McCarthy’s dusty hometown of Bakersfield.  But I mainly mean it in the allegoric sense that too many members of McCarthy’s 222-member GOP caucus would rather watch the American Experiment go up in flames — and smile with a devilish grin like “Disaster Girl” in the infamous meme — than follow the example of their alleged hero Ronald Reagan, who raised the debt limit 18 times (because Reagan created a boatload of debt!) and pass this pro forma yet essential legislation and move on.  McCarthy — an epically weak leader who knows enough to know he doesn’t want history to remember him as the last House speaker of a democratic United States — understands his problem; he reportedly warned a closed-door session of his caucus, “Any jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one.” There hasn’t been a lot of public braying, but most ultra-conservative members picked a side in that analogy by sticking to an all-or-nothing demand that Biden and Senate Democrats accept a bill that would both undo the president’s core achievements and include steep program cuts that most people would never support.  John Harwood, the acclaimed veteran journalist who recently lost his CNN post while truth-telling, wrote that the real Republican position in the foundering negotiations seems to be what he calls “a primal scream.” Some of that, Harwood said, is GOP House members seeing the must-pass debt-ceiling measure as their only real chance to do something, with Democrats running the White House and the Senate. But he also noted that this leverage gives the right wing a shot at enacting measures, like reversing climate action, that are wildly unpopular with voters, and to roll back some of the cultural changes that alienate conservatives.  I think it could be even worse than that. Biden administration officials insist the government would run out of money to pay its bills and prevent defaulting on its current debts sometime in early June. Defaulting would trash America’s credit rating and possibly tank the stock market, and with it, the wider economy. Government payments — including Medicare reimbursements, Social Security checks, and military pay — would be at risk.  A large swath of House Republicans don’t act like they care about this. A handful of them who openly loathe Biden and who — thanks to the Big Lie of 2020 election fraud — don’t see his presidency as legitimate would probably love to see the White House fail. It’s the defining trait of the 21st century GOP: nihilism.  “Our country is going to hell,” Donald Trump, Republicans’ once and would-be future president, declared in a Mar-a-Lago speech in April, right after he was arrested on felony charges in Manhattan. “The world is already laughing at us.” And yet Trump has taken a commanding lead in the polls from voters who surely agree with that mission statement.  What difference would it make nuking the U.S. credit rating, and the nation’s reputation, if America is already in h-e-double-toothpicks? No wonder so few Republicans cared that their inflexible stance on the debt ceiling forced Biden to cancel two legs of his trip to Asia, offending governments and sensibilities in Australia and Papua New Guinea. The slight, which undercut efforts to strengthen a coalition to stop Chinese expansionism, is the kind of disunity around U.S. foreign policy that never used to happen, in the olden times when Republicans cared about projecting American strength and unity.  But today conservatives are scared, and bitter. They’re scared that white privilege will disappear as people of color become a majority of the U.S. population by mid-century. And their bitterness is expanding. The right used to despise college faculties and the news media as dominated by “pointy-headed” liberal elites, but today they suspect all college grads as “woke,” in a world where major institutions are run by these degree-holders. So they hate “woke” corporations, even Disney and Anheuser-Busch. They even loathe the “woke” Pentagon, and the FBI, key parts of a so-called “deep state” that conservatives want to implode.  The great writer Adam Serwer produced the definitive headline of the Trump presidency when he wrote, “The cruelty is the point.” And the GOP program for raising the debt ceiling is stunningly cruel, including needless work requirements that would limit government benefits to the poor. But cruelty has a more dangerous cousin in nihilism. For Republicans launching this kamikaze flight against the U.S. economy, the nihilism is the point.  Biden’s faith that a bipartisan deal could be reached is very much in line with his political worldview, and to his credit he actually made it work on two popular, less controversial issues: infrastructure and semiconductors. Maybe he’s right about this, but I think too many Republicans are committed to a destructive path. The president should have adopted a no-negotiation stance, declared that the 14th Amendment renders the debt ceiling debate moot, and allowed the courts to work it out long before the government runs out of money.  The White House is preparing for a hostage crisis when they’re actually dealing with political suicide bombers. I believe Joe Biden when he insists that he’s fighting for “the soul of America,” but to win that battle, you need to know your enemy.  Yo, do this  Does the world really need another biography of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.? Absolutely! The reality is that in an internet age where conservatives cherry-pick MLK quotes to distort his legacy and where liberal activists need some fresh inspiration, no book could be more timely than Jonathan Eig’s sweeping and majestic new King: A Life. A former Wall Street Journal reporter who’s received wide acclaim from previous bios of Lou Gehrig and Muhammad Ali, Eig drew on thousands of pages of never-before-seen documents, from FBI files to King’s father’s unpublished memoirs, as well as scores of interviews with folks who knew the civil rights icon. The result is not mythology but a portrait of a man who was all too human — making his remarkable moral choices and struggles relatable to his fellow mortals. In repositioning King as one of America’s true Founding Fathers, Eig has created 2023′s most vital tome. The concept of “must-see TV” mostly died along with the 1990s, but in a perfect world, the nation would retire to its couches at 9 p.m. on Sunday to share the most-anticipated television event in some time: the series finale of Succession on HBO Max. Season Four of the show that chronicles the saga of a Rupert Murdoch-like media mogul and the jockeying for power among his deeply scarred children has been utterly sensational — showing how this bonfire of vanities among the rich, entitled, and powerful makes hapless casualties out of innocent people, from a Scottish bartender to, finally, American democracy itself. On Sunday, one Roy family offspring might “succeed,” but in an epic landscape of moral failure.  Ask me anything  Question: 1960-1970 was arguably the most prolific single decade for culture and style, music, the arts, originality, etc. Why? What made the 1960′s so special relative to other decades: Demographics? Politics? I have my fingers crossed we’re on the cusp of another such era. — Via Jack Rodeghier (@glarustrading) on Twitter  Answer: Jack, your question is right up my alley — so much so it sounds like it was planted (it wasn’t, I swear). I’ve pondered this many times as I drive around listening to “1969 Hits” on Pandora or salvaged tapes from WABC and KHJ. Sadly, I have to say my thinking is that the cultural scene of the 1960s can never be replicated. First, the decade thrived on the commonality of mass culture — the cross-pollination of those Top 40 radio stations, the shared experience of three TV networks, or the one movie screen in your suburban town — that has been shattered in a million fractured pieces in the iPhone age. But the bigger reason is that the 1960s had a naïve optimism — born from the one-of-a-kind baby boom, in a brief moment of middle-class affluence and post-World-War-II bravado — that will never be repeated. The notion that peace-seeking boomers would create an Age of Aquarius saturated songs like “Crystal Blue Persuasion” (with its lyric “people are changing” … except they weren’t) or “People Got To Be Free” — tunes that would be laughed off Spotify today for their hopeful innocence. Events like Kent State and Watergate brought cynicism and an “Age of Irony” (think SNL, launched in 1975) that lasts to this day. But prove me wrong, Gen Z!  Backstory on that new twist in the Trump documents probe  When we first learned 15 months ago that Donald Trump was under investigation for taking top-secret, highly classified documents with him to Mar-a-Lago after he was voted out of the White House, my mind immediately wandered east, toward the oil-rich deserts of Saudi Arabia. In February 2022, I published a column headlined: “Trump, the Saudis, and Mar-a-Lago’s boxes of U.S. secrets: A recipe for disaster?” The question was inspired by then-fresh reports of Trump’s lucrative deal with the Saudi-backed pro golf tour, and the regime’s $2 billion investment in a fund run by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. Would Trump be tempted to share something as valuable as America’s nuclear secrets with a rich nation craving its own nukes?  You know who else is wondering essentially the same things? Jack Smith, the Justice Department’s special prosecutor who’s taken over the classified documents probe as well as an investigation into the president’s inner circle’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection. The New York Times dropped a bombshell report Monday night that Smith has now subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records of its business dealings since 2017 — the year Trump became the 45th president — in seven foreign countries. On the list: China, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman. This comes after an earlier Times report that federal prosecutors had specifically sought records on Trump’s deal with that Saudi-funded LIV Golf tour. The Times’ sources didn’t spell out why Smith is seeking these records, although it’s hard to imagine any scenario except a possible connection to the specific files discovered at Trump’s Florida estate.  The most benign explanation is that Smith is trying to establish a motive for why Trump would cling to these specific papers, because they pertained in some way to nations in which the businessman-turned-politician also has a pecuniary interest. The more toxic implication is that Trump may have already shared government secrets as part of his efforts to win lucrative business deals, or that he has promised valuable information to his billionaire partners. That worst-case scenario would arguably be a presidential scandal of unprecedented magnitude. I happen to think that the U.S. government keeps too many secrets, that the number of classified documents is ridiculous, and that investigations into document-handling by figures like Mike Pence or President Joe Biden are also a bit silly. Smith’s moves suggest the Trump matter is very different. Stay tuned.  What I wrote on this date in 2013  There goes Will Bunch again, attacking the moral failings of the American president, complaining about an administration obsessed with secrecy and hiding key information from citizens, and praising a handful of journalists for holding the White House to account. Except that on May 23, 2013, the commander-in-chief was Barack Obama, and the scandal was his too-often reckless expansion of an overseas drone assassination program that intended to target anti-American terrorists but too often murdered other folks, often innocent civilians, from Afghanistan to Africa. The grim news on this date 10 years ago was an admission that Obama’s drones had also killed four U.S. citizens — only one of them intentionally. Hence the headline: “Obama, drones and U.S. citizens: Don’t feel bad … cuz 1 out of 4 ain’t bad.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9jb2x1bW5pc3RzL2F0dHl0b29kL2RlYnQtY2VpbGluZy1nb3AtYmlkZW4tdHJ1bXAtc2F1ZGktYXJhYmlhLTIwMjMwNTIzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-03-10","Not Discerned","{""Aden"", ""Aden"", ""Yemen""}","2023-05-23T17:03:12","Many are thinking about the cessation of hostilities in Yemen in the wake of China’s successful mediation to resolve the political and diplomatic schism between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the principal parties involved in the conflict between Yemeni factions. One significant moment was 10 March, the eighth anniversary of the Saudi-led intervention to support the internationally recognised Yemeni government against the Iran-backed Houthis, aka Ansar Allah.  Since the intervention, Yemen had turned into a battlefield for the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran supports the Houthis, who belong to the Zaydi Shias, a group that makes up under half of the population, while Saudi Arabia supports the Sunni camp representing a somewhat larger demographic segment. A year into the war, in 2016, Tehran and Riyadh severed diplomatic ties following the storming of the Saudi diplomatic headquarters in Iran as part of the protests organised by the authorities against Saudi judicial rulings. Despite Iraqi efforts towards a rapprochement ties had remained severed until the Chinese mediation.  Saudi Arabia and Iran are involved in conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, but what sets Yemen apart is that the conflict has turned it into the “worst humanitarian crisis in the world in decades,” bringing the poorest Arab country to the brink of famine, according to the UN. A UN-brokered truce signed in 2022 had failed, and the fighting claimed numerous lives, causing scores of injuries and leaving more than half the population in urgent need of relief. The fact that even the Saudi-Iranian rapprochement has not helped is making it clear that the conflict has its own internal causes that can only be addressed domestically.  It was the end of World War II that ushered Yemen into modern times, but it wasn’t until the (Sunni) republicans’ triumph over the (Shia) monarchists after a decade of Civil War that the country began to experience some semblance of stability. This coincided mainly with the tenure of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who ruled for 33 years from 1978 to 2011, which also saw the unification of Yemen’s two historical states in the north and south into a single republic in 1990.  Development did not take place as effectively as had been hoped due to scarcity of resources, inadequate educational infrastructure, and the dominance of tribal and sectarian affiliations, making the country historically known as “Happy Yemen” the poorest in the Arab world and driving Saleh to forge a robust alliance with Saudi Arabia, which provided aid for decades, improving conditions even as Yemen remained at the bottom of the Arab development index.  “Yemen lacks resources and education, and Saleh’s manipulation contributed to the country’s backwardness,” said Fadl Al-Lahgi, a professor of economics and former official in the Yemeni Ministry of Finance. “Education improved during Saleh’s tenure, but given the growing population, this was not enough.”  War played a major role in normalising underdevelopment. “Even before the unification of Yemen, the Yemenis fought on all fronts, and this exhausted the state,” says Naguib Seddik, editor-in-chief of the Aden-based state-owned daily 14 October and former chairman of the South Yemen Press Syndicate. “South Yemen fought several battles with North Yemen. In addition, the conflict in Sanaa was bitter until Saleh rose to the helm.”  Since the late 1940s, Yemen had witnessed numerous attempts by tribal and military factions to stage coups against the rule of the Zaydi Mutawakkilite dynasty, which had gained independence from the Ottoman empire in 1918, until a revolution led by colonel Abdullah Al-Sallal overthrew Imam Ahmad in 1962. In the following decade, Yemen witnessed a succession of presidents, including Abdel-Rahman Al-Iryani (1967-1974), Ibrahim Al-Hamdi (1974-1977), Ahmed Al-Ghashmi (1977-1978), and Abdel-Karim Al-Arashi, who held the presidency for only three weeks between late June and mid-July of 1978, before Saleh assumed power. The struggle for power during this period was marked by violence, exemplified by the assassination of Al-Hamdi and Al-Ghashmi in two consecutive years.  On the other hand, the socialists in the south deposed their leader, Qahtan Al-Shaabi, in 1969, only two years after independence from Britain with Egyptian support. Several presidents assumed power, some of whom were assassinated, such as Abdel-Fattah Ismail in 1980, until the regime collapsed in the late 1980s with the cessation of Soviet support, forcing the leadership in Aden to unite with the north, led by Saleh. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the two Yemens fought their own cold war.  “By the end of Saleh’s era Yemen’s political map was tangled,” Seddik said, with various groups vying for power: “the Iranian-backed Houthi faction seeks to establish a regime modelled on the mullahs’ rule in Tehran, presenting a retrograde version of Hizbullah in Lebanon. On the other hand, the Southern movement comprises several factions and figures with divergent demands, ranging from the reinstatement of an independent South Yemen to a federal or confederal system that would ensure more equitable sharing of power and resources. In the middle are the republicans, who espouse the republican system established by overthrowing the imam’s rule. Although they are not an organised entity, most of them align with the Saleh regime. Additionally, there is the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government employs against the Houthis and the Southern factions.”  The situation in Yemen grew more complex following the ousting of Saleh, as tribal leaders and a segment of the military aligned with the Houthis based on their conservative beliefs, regardless of their affiliation with the Zaydi sect. Conversely, the republicans, the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Southern factions sided with the internationally recognised government, along with members of the armed forces who rejected the Houthi insurgency.  Seddik noted that “these factions lack unity, and infighting emerged between the Transitional Council representing the Southern factions and the Muslim Brotherhood’s Islah Party, which further muddled the situation for the government’s armed forces.” He added that “the republicans, comprising mainly the working middle class, have largely fled Yemen, resulting in their diminishing influence on events.”  According to Yemeni journalist Mohamed Omar, who previously served as press secretary to former South Yemen president Ali Nasser Mohamed, “an independent South Yemen is not a viable option. No faction has a clear vision for achieving a resolution that preserves Yemen’s unity while avoiding sectarianism from groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and the Houthis and promoting political and societal compromises.” Omar added that “there are no forces capable of eliminating the Houthis and the Brotherhood, and their presence only exacerbates the conflict, while the Republicans are fragmented and the army is unwilling to engage in further fighting, as that would entail fighting fellow Yemenis.”  Omar stressed that the root cause of the conflict lies in Yemen’s internal issues, not external interventions, and regional powers cannot broker a peace agreement until those issues are adequately addressed.  * A version of this article appears in print in the 25 May, 2023 edition of Al-Ahram Weekly  Search Keywords:  Short link:  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5haHJhbS5vcmcuZWcvTmV3c0NvbnRlbnQvNTAvMTIwMy81MDE0ODkvQWxBaHJhbS1XZWVrbHkvV29ybGQvWWVtZW4lRTIlODAlOTlzLXNlbGZoZWxwLW1hbnVhbC5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2020-10-25","Not Discerned","{""Valletta"", ""Valletta"", ""Malta""}","2023-05-23T07:44:00","Artist Keit Bonnici’s balancing act on the Valletta barriers that keep away protestors since the 2019 political crisis has created a conversation on the implied barrier between citizens and the institution of democracy.  Bonnici, whose perched chair at a Valletta al fresco restaurant on Merchants’ Street in 2020 served as a protest against the occupation of public land, climbed onto the 36mm-wide barriers outside the House of Representatives, and walked across six of them.  The performance is being shown at an exhibition in Vienna.  The barriers have been in place ever since the 2019 crisis provoked outrage and mass protests, leading to the resignations linked to the assassination of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. They remain in place four years later.  Bonnici, whose acts of civil protest highlight the gulf between citizen rights and institutional unfairness, highlights the physical barrier being the opposite of what the space outside Malta’s parliament should be serving for.  Bonnici described his performance, ‘Thirty-six Millimeter’, as a performative intervention about the “fragility of democracy”.  “I placed my body on the barriers between the complexities of democracy, institution, state, public and collective public memory,” he told Times of Malta. “I am questioning the thirty-six millimeter. Why is it there? What does it mean to be there? How is public space thought of? What is Freedom Square?”  In 2021, Bonnici used a personal, handmade postcard to ask Queen Elizabeth II about the prospect of removing the statute of Queen Victoria – her great-great grandmother – from Valletta’s Pjazza Regina. “Although Queen Victoria was known as the grandmother of Europe, many people in Malta view her statue as a sign of oppression. And in the wake of statues being removed in the USA, the debate whether to remove her statue from Valletta has appeared,” Bonnici said.  His response is to send a postcard to Victoria’s great-great granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth, to find out what her thoughts are. Bonnici hand-made the postcard and wrote the message in Maltese.  In 2020 Bonnici erected a wooden chair with unusually long back legs to be able to actually see what’s happening inside the redesigned Suq tal-Belt’s newly elevated terrace. Bonnici’s installation, Perch, was a protest at the gentrification of the Valletta market. “I explained that I wanted to look and grieve at what was stolen from us. They sipped on their beer.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbHRhdG9kYXkuY29tLm10L2FydHMvYXJ0LzEyMzA2NS9ib25uaWNpX29uX3RoZV9yYWlsc19hcnRpc3Rfd2Fsa3NfdGhlX2RlbW9jcmF0aWNfYmFycmllcl9vdXRzaWRlX3BhcmxpYW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Since the time of Independence, this power to transfer bureaucrats was never with a Delhi Chief Minister. What Arvind Kejriwal has been asking from PM Modi has been denied by Sardar Patel. BR Ambedkar too said no to it. Pandit Nehru denied it. Lal Bahadur Shastri was against it,"" said Ajay Maken, stressing that supporting Mr Arvind Kejriwal would be opposing Jawaharlal Nehru.  The Congress on Monday indicated that while it agrees in principle that the Centre's executive order on bureaucrats' postings in the national capital is undermining the Supreme Court, they would ""consult its state units and other like-minded parties"" before firming up its stance on supporting the Arvind Kejriwal-led party.  ""The Party believes in the Rule of Law and at the same time does not condone unnecessary confrontation, political witch-hunt and campaigns based on lies against political opponents by any political party,"" KC Venugopal, the party's Organisational in-charge, tweeted yesterday.  The Centre's Ordinance, passed late on Friday evening, overrides a recent order of the Supreme Court -- which said the elected government is the boss of Delhi -- and makes the Lieutenant Governor the final arbiter of the issue.  ""Arvind Kejriwal is making noise as if some great injustice has been done to him. As if Chief Ministers before him had this power and only he is being discriminated against,"" Mr Maken told NDTV.  Opposing any alliance with the AAP, the Delhi Congress leader spotlighted how in 2018 the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government passed a resolution in the state assembly recommending the withdrawal of the Bharat Ratna award conferred upon former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in view of his failure to control the mob violence that followed his mother's assassination in 1984.  ""The AAP passed a resolution in state assembly that Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna be withdrawn and did it with BJP's support. When BJP brought a law to divide Jammu and Kashmir, all opposition parties opposed it but AAP supported them,"" said Mr Maken.  The Congress leader stressed that the AAP has supported the BJP on all ""crucial decisions"", like the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, among others.  ""How do you (AAP) ask for support then,"" said Mr Maken, adding that they continue to harm the Congress by fighting in states where the grand old party is strong. The leader pointed out states like Goa, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka where the AAP allegedly cut into Congress votes and benefited the BJP.  On the question of larger opposition unity, Mr Maken said ""if you are going to weaken Congress and talk about unity, it won't work"".  ""How is this possible that we can talk about Lok Sabha and ignore State assemblies. If we have Lok Sabha in 2024, We have Delhi election in 2025. Is there a switch that will go on and off. What will we do in Punjab,"" asked Mr Maken, the former Delhi Congress chief.  The AAP whited-out the Congress in Delhi. The AAP also won Punjab in 2022 besting the grand old party.  ""The BJP is a national party and if it has to be challenged only a strong national party like Congress can challenge it,"" he added further.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvY29uZ3Jlc3MtbGVhZGVyLWludm9rZXMtbmVocnUtYW1pZC1hYXAtdnMtY2VudHJlLW92ZXItZGVsaGktcG9zdGluZ3MtNDA1OTY4NdIBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5kdHYuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvY29uZ3Jlc3MtbGVhZGVyLWludm9rZXMtbmVocnUtYW1pZC1hYXAtdnMtY2VudHJlLW92ZXItZGVsaGktcG9zdGluZ3MtNDA1OTY4NS9hbXAvMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

By Erin Viner  Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is engaged in converting commercial ships into platforms for launching missiles, drones and commandos, said Jerusalem’s top defense official, alleging that Tehran’s goal is to proliferate its clandestine naval clout well beyond the Gulf.  Minister Gallant revealed the rogue nation’s “pirate policy” during an address at a conference hosted by the Institute for Policy and Strategy of Reichman University in Herzliya. He unveiled captured images of six repurposed Iranian vessels, including one that recently sailed toward the Gulf of Aden.  Detailing the Iranian secret strategy of transforming trading ships vessels into military vessels armed with offensive equipment such as UAVs and missile systems, as well as with advanced means for intelligence gathering far away from its own shores for extended periods of time.  “Iran is conducting itself like a collection of criminal organizations and not a modern state. The floating terror bases are an extension of Iran’s ongoing maritime terrorism, as seen in its actions in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea. Iran aims to expand its reach to the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea and even the shores of the Mediterranean. This is a structured plan designed to threaten trade and flight routes – both military and civilian – and to create a permanent threat in the maritime arena,” he charged.  In his discussion, Minister Gallant also addressed the measures required to contend with Iran’s regional aggression and the dangers posed by its nuclear development program.  “The way to confront Iranian terrorism in the air, at sea, and on land is through international cooperation and the creation of coalitions,” he insisted.  There was no immediate response from Iran.  As part of the “Shadow War” between the two archfoes, Iran and Israel have routinely accused the other over a series of unclaimed attacks on the high seas, as well as in the cyber sphere.  The Ayatollah regime has also blamed Israel for numerous incidents it said were designed to sabotage its nuclear development program, including the 2020 assassination of atomic scientist Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizade, a fire at the Natanz facility that same year and the Stuxnet computer virus – widely believed to have been developed by Israel and the US – that impaired centrifuges used to enrich uranium struck the same facility in 2010.  Additionally, Western intelligence sources say Israeli airstrikes against Iranian-linked targets inside Syria has escalated over the past year. Research centers for weapons development and munitions depots operated by IRGC have particularly been in the IDF’s crosshairs. Political and defense leaders in the Jewish State have repeatedly stated that Iran’s presence just over the northern frontier will not be tolerated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR2N2lzcmFlbG5ld3MuY29tL2dhbGxhbnQtaXJhbi1idWlsZGluZy1mbG9hdGluZy10ZXJyb3ItYmFzZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:00:04","They say the only thing constant is change. Well, if that’s true, then the most timeless song that can be written is one about that very fact. Bob Dylan knew it. Hence his classic, “The Times They Are a-Changin’.”  Videos by American Songwriter  But how did the song come to fruition? What is the meaning and origin?  Cameron Crowe  Somehow with so many music conversations, the famed movie director is connected. Whether it’s his classic band film, Almost Famous, or his movie about grunge life, Singles, or simply the fact that he was married for a long time to Heart’s Nancy Wilson, Crowe is a music man.  To wit, Dylan told Crowe about the inspiration for the protest anthem, “The Times They Are a-Changin’.” “This was definitely a song with a purpose,” he said in the liner notes of the 1985 Dylan box set, Biograph. “It was influenced of course by the Irish and Scottish ballads …’Come All Ye Bold Highway Men’, ‘Come All Ye Tender Hearted Maidens’. I wanted to write a big song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way. The civil rights movement and the folk music movement were pretty close for a while and allied together at that time.”  Released as the title song for his 1964 album, Dylan released the track in the U.K. in 1965. It hit No. 9 on the Singles Chart in the country, but it was never released as a single in America. Today, the protest song, which has been covered by everyone from Nina Simone to Simon & Garfunkel, is known as both of his best songs and one of the most important tracks from 20th-century American music. Why for lyrics like this,  The line it is drawn  The curse it is cast  The slow one now  Will later be fast  As the present now  Will later be past  The order is rapidly fadin’  And the first one now  Will later be last  For the times they are a-changin’  President Kennedy  Throughout his career, Dylan has rarely performed “The Times They Are a-Changin'” during his live shows. The night after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy he decided to perform the tune.  “The Times They Are a-Changin'” was written in the fall of 1963. Dylan recorded a demo of the song that later appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991. It was recorded in earnest at Columbia studios a few days before Halloween that year and that Columbia recording became the titled track to Dylan’s 1964 LP of the same name.  That same year, JFK died in Dallas. He was assassinated on November 22, 1963, about a month after Dylan tracked “The Times They Are a-Changin’.” So, with it fresh in his mind, Dylan played the song to open his concert on November 23.  Of that experience, Dylan told biographer Anthony Scaduto, “I thought, ‘Wow, how can I open with that song? I’ll get rocks thrown at me.’ But I had to sing it, my whole concert takes off from there. I know I had no understanding of anything. Something had just gone haywire in the country and they were applauding the song. And I couldn’t understand why they were clapping, or why I wrote the song. I couldn’t understand anything. For me, it was just insane.”  While a then-modern day protest song, it was also a traditional song, in many ways, quoting the Bible and Mark 10:31—”But many that are first shall be last, and the last first”—for the climatic line of the song. It was also, of course, a song about change and the country had, with the killing of JFK, undergone a monumental shift.  Legacy  The song has become a timeless protest anthem. While the song resonated in the ’60s as the world was changing—Civil Rights, JFK’s death, the looming Vietnam War—it continues to resonate. The song’s lyrics are general enough to apply to just about any moment in time. Sings Dylan,  Come gather ’round people  Wherever you roam  And admit that the waters  Around you have grown  And accept it that soon  You’ll be drenched to the bone  If your time to you is worth savin’  And you better start swimmin’  Or you’ll sink like a stone  For the times they are a-changin’  And,  Come senators, congressmen  Please heed the call  Don’t stand in the doorway  Don’t block up the hall  For he that gets hurt  Will be he who has stalled  The battle outside ragin’  Will soon shake your windows  And rattle your walls  For the times they are a-changin’  With a song this well known, there has been a great deal written both about its history and its meaning. Fans of the Bard should take it all with a grain of salt. Some believe the song to be the Platonic Ideal of a protest folk tune, others think it’s vague and nothing to write home about.  For example, writer Michael Gray in the 2006 book The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia called it the “archetypal protest song” and that Dylan channeled “the unvoiced sentiment of a mass public.” Gray has also said the lyrics are now politically outdated, ironically, given all the changes in the country since it was written. Writer Christopher Ricks, however, says in the 2003 book Dylan’s Visions of Sin that the song “transcends the political preoccupations of the time in which it was written.”  Even musician Tony Glover tells the story to biographer Clinton Heylin, author of Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited, that Glover stopped by Dylan’s place in the fall of 1963 and saw the lyrics for the song. Glober says he said to Dylan, “What is this shit, man?” To which Dylan allegedly shrugged and said, “Well, you know, it seems to be what the people want to hear.”  Regardless of the intent of the song, it remains one of Dylan’s most beloved and well-recognized.

The series, produced by actress Jada Pinkett-Smith, received a 3% audience score — and 14% critic score — on Rotten Tomatoes.  Here’s everything you need to know about the “Queen Cleopatra” controversy — and about the true story of Cleopatra herself.  The ‘Queen Cleopatra’ Netflix controversy  Netflix’s “Queen Cleopatra” almost immediately faced criticism for casting a Black actress, Adele James, to play Cleopatra. As Forbes notes, such backlash would typically come from “anti-woke” groups — but in the case of “Queen Cleopatra,” criticism stems from Egyptian officials and historians.  Many claim that casting a Black actress as Cleopatra is historically inaccurate, while some have called it appropriation. This criticism namely comes from questions surrounding Cleopatra’s ethnicity and heritage.  Egypt’s ministry of tourism and antiquities claims that, because “Queen Cleopatra” is a docuseries, it “requires those in charge of its production to investigate accuracy and rely on historical and scientific facts,” per Forbes.  Dr. Mustafa Waziri, Egyptian secretary general of the supreme council of archaeology, said that the portrayal of Cleopatra as Black is a “falsification of Egyptian history and a blatant historical fallacy,” per Forbes.  Statues of Queen Cleopatra confirm that she had Hellenistic (Greek) features, distinguished by light skin, a drawn-out nose and thin lips. 2/2 pic.twitter.com/t1E8LGMVIc — Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (@TourismandAntiq) April 30, 2023  Others point out that the criticism of “Queen Cleopatra” is rooted in racism. Why, some have asked, is it more suitable for white actresses like Elizabeth Taylor to play Cleopatra than a Black actress like James?  As Leila Latif wrote for the Guardian, “But while (the uncertainty of Cleopatra’s lineage) opens her up to being played by any number of actors, it is notable that some see blue-eyed Elizabeth Taylor and Israeli Wonder Woman Gal Gadot as more accurate.”  “Cleopatra’s precise skin and hair texture are up for speculation, but to default to whiteness is insidious and ridiculous,” Latif continued.  “Queen Cleopatra” director Tina Gharavi defended the decision to portray Cleopatra as Black, writing in Variety, “Why shouldn’t Cleopatra be a melanated sister? And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter.”  Was Cleopatra Black?  While, according to Collider, we know that Cleopatra’s father was Ptolemy I Soter, who had roots in “Macedonian heritage,” Cleopatra’s maternal side is surrounded in mystery.  Per Collider, there’s “uncertainty around the identity of her mother.” It’s commonly assumed that Cleopatra’s mother was Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, Ptolemy XII’s wife. And, based off of the “lineage of the Ptolemies,” historians have concluded “that Cleopatra’s lineage was predominantly Hellenistic in origin.”  In other words, Cleopatra was “a member of an ancient Greek dynasty” known as the Ptolemies, according to National Geographic. The Ptolemaic kingdom took over Egypt in 305 B.C.  According to Collider, Waziri claims that Cleopatra was light-skinned. This is based off the theory that Cleopatra had a predominantly Hellenistic, or Greek, lineage. But, as Collider puts it, “there is ample ambiguity existing around Cleopatra’s true appearance to allow the makers of ‘Queen Cleopatra’ to cast Adele James in the role.”  “But the choice of making the entire family look Black distorts the historical proof that suggests otherwise, leaving a huge dent in the credibility and accuracy of the docuseries,” Collider concludes.  Professor of literature and history Islam Issa, who appears in “Queen Cleopatra” — the only Egyptian historian featured on the show, he noted — wrote that the docuseries should be seen as a “docudrama.”  Per Forbes, Issa said that “the largely binary racial terms being used today are anachronistic and can hardly be applied to Cleopatra’s context,” adding that “genetic makeup was varied as people from across the region, from Europeans to Nubians, lived and married on its lands.”  “To claim that Egypt had no dark-skinned people in it, or that the origins of Egyptian civilizations were fundamentally sub-Saharan African, are essentially both forms of erasure,” Issa wrote.  Issa concludes that focusing on how Cleopatra looked “takes away from her powerful legacy.”  “Obsessing over how a powerful woman looked is ironically reductionist and objectifying in itself, so the documentary part should shed light on her entire, fascinating life, not just how she may have looked,” Issa wrote.  Why is Cleopatra so famous?  Cleopatra, who became pharaoh of Egypt at 18 in 51 B.C., has become synonymous with seduction and her relationships with two famous men: Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony. But, according to Smithsonian Magazine, Cleopatra was so much more.  As Smithsonian Magazine put it, Cleopatra was a “commanding woman versed in politics, diplomacy and governance, fluent in nine languages, silver-tongued and charismatic.”  According to Smithsonian Magazine, “at the height of her power she controlled virtually the entire eastern Mediterranean coast, the last great kingdom of any Egyptian ruler.” Cleopatra had a “first-rate education”; she commanded Egypt’s army and navy; she would “negotiate with foreign powers and preside over temples” and “dispensed justice and regulated an economy.”  In short, Cleopatra ruled over Egypt and orchestrated its prosperity. She did this all while maintaining a favorable relationship with Rome and influencing international politics.  But despite all her achievements, according to Smithsonian Magazine, Cleopatra “survives as a wanton temptress, not the first time a genuinely powerful woman has been transmuted into a shamelessly seductive one.”  How old was Cleopatra when she met Caesar?  According to Smithsonian Magazine, Cleopatra was 21 when she met Julius Caesar. She was a fugitive at the time — banished from Egypt due to a civil war with her brother and husband at the time, Ptolemy XIII.  Julius Caesar had arrived in Alexandria after Pompey, a “brilliant Roman general” who was “dealt a crush defeat in central Greece” by Caesar, had been murdered. After taking refuge in Ptolemy’s palace, Cleopatra snuck into the palace “inside a sturdy sack” and met with Caesar.  Cleopatra eventually bore Caesar a son — Caesarian — while Caesar eventually defeated Ptolemy XIII’s troops and returned Cleopatra to the throne. According to Collider, Caesar never claimed Caesarian as his own son.  Who was the love of Cleopatra?  After the assassination of Caesar in 44 B.C. — during which Cleopatra was living in Rome, according to History — Cleopatra returned to Alexandria. It wasn’t until 41 B.C. that she met with Mark Antony, “one of Rome’s three joint leaders,” in Tarsus, per National Geographic.  Cleopatra met with Antony for political reasons. According to National Geographic, “Winning the friendship of one of Rome’s most powerful men would bring closer links with the republic, consolidating her grip on the throne and perhaps even expanding her kingdom.”  Even though Antony was married, Antony and Cleopatra fell in love and started an affair. Antony soon joined Cleopatra in Alexandria, per National Geographic.  As National Geographic tells it, the two were “inseparable” in 41-40 B.C. Antony and Cleopatra would wander the streets at night, dressed as slaves, and drank, played dice and hunted together.  Tragically, it was “Antony’s infatuation with Cleopatra” and “and the reputed excesses of their life in the Egyptian seat of power” that eventually led to both Antony and Cleopatra’s downfall, per National Geographic.  How old was Cleopatra when she died?  Cleopatra was 39 when she died, according to Smithsonian Magazine. After losing a battle to Octavian’s — one of Rome’s three rulers — in 31 B.C., both Antony and Cleopatra took their own lives, per National Geographic.  Reportedly, Cleopatra told Antony that she planned to kill herself after the defeat. As a result, Antony stabbed himself and died in her arms. After failing to negotiate with Octavian, Cleopatra barricaded herself in her tomb, accompanied by servants, and killed herself.  Despite the popular myth that Cleopatra killed herself with an asp, it’s likely that she used poison, per National Geographic.  Is ‘Queen Cleopatra’ Netflix accurate?  Casting controversies aside, Netflix’s “Queen Cleopatra” gets some facts right. According to Collider, the docuseries accurately portrays the rivalry between Cleopatra and her siblings, as well as her exile by her brother, Ptolemy XIII and eventual return to Egypt.  While Caesar and Cleopatra’s meeting was popularly portrayed as a dramatic seduction, “Queen Cleopatra” chooses to portray their first encounter as a meeting of minds. The docuseries “suggests that it was Cleopatra’s charm and persuasive abilities that flattered Caesar in the first place,” per Collider.  The docuseries gets other details right, such as the relationship between Cleopatra and Caesar. However, according to Collider, “Queen Cleopatra” romanticizes Cleopatra. As Collider puts it, “the docuseries plays along with its tendency of overtly romanticizing its protagonist, particularly through its villainous portrayal of others.”  “However, while taking a gutsy approach to touching some contentious aspects of the queen’s life, the docuseries risks providing a totally inaccurate first impression of Queen Cleopatra,” per Collider.  Where Netflix’s “Queen Cleopatra” does succeed, Collider concludes, is “in its celebration of the life of a legendary queen who yielded enormous power in an exclusively male-dominated world.”  What is ‘Queen Cleopatra’ rated and why?  According to Common Sense Media, “Queen Cleopatra” is appropriate for those 15 and up. The show is rated TV-14, per Netflix.

"political assassination","2021-07-21","Not Discerned","{""Baghdad"", ""Baghdad"", ""Iraq""}","2023-05-23T18:33:55","Kata’ib Hezbollah a perennial rebel against the Iraqi government  Hassan Al-Mustafa  Kata’ib Hezbollah fighters. (Twitter/File)  Short Url https://arab.news/76zad  An Iraqi court this month handed down a death sentence to a former policeman who was convicted of killing prominent academic Hisham Al-Hashimi in a shooting that took place in July 2020, near the victim’s house in the capital Baghdad. The crime was documented by Al-Hashimi’s home security camera.  The convict, Ahmed Ouaid Al-Kinani, a police officer employed by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior, confessed to killing Al-Hashimi in July 2021 in video footage aired on an Iraqi television channel.  Al-Kinani’s affiliation with the Ministry of Interior came as a shock to many but, more importantly, he was a member of Kata’ib Hezbollah, one of the country’s most radical militias and a Popular Mobilization Units faction.  During the years of following up on my friend Al-Hashimi’s assassination file, I communicated with figures in the Iraqi government headed by former Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and other sources inside Iraq, all of whom confirmed to me Kata’ib Hezbollah was behind the attack. The Iraqi government and the judiciary did not indicate officially, however, that the people concerned with the case knew this perfectly well.  This highlights the importance of the death sentence issued against Al-Kinani. It not only condemns the perpetrator, but it also raises awareness that he belongs to a faction that has security, political and economic relations with partners in the Coordination Framework, a coalition of parties that brought Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani to power last year.  Thus, although the convict has the right to appeal, the verdict condemns — albeit without naming the group — the political-criminal behavior of Kata’ib Hezbollah, which certainly wished that the case had been settled without reaching the death penalty.  Last Monday, clashes took place between a group of gunmen and Iraqi security forces in the Al-Buaitha neighborhood, southwest of Baghdad. Local media sources indicated that the gunmen were members of Kata’ib Hezbollah. According to Asharq Al-Awsat, the clashes were the result of the insistence of a militiaman on owning some agricultural land in the area. In some other accounts, the police officers raided an oil smuggling site controlled by Kata’ib Hezbollah.  The Iraqi Prime Minister’s Office indicated on Twitter that the security services attempted to remove trespassers from public property, which resulted in clashes that saw two people sustain minor injuries. It added that “the security forces immediately endeavored to take legal measures to deal with and arrest these people, and put them under investigation, while removing the unlawful trespassers,” without indicating whether or not the gunmen belonged to Kata’ib Hezbollah.  According to several sources, two events in the same month related to Kata’ib Hezbollah have prompted questions about the nature of the relationship between the group and the Iraqi government. There are concerns about whether it will adhere to the general guidelines that its allies in the Coordination Framework follow or if it will show, in its own way, its distinction from the other factions and that it will not abide by all of Al-Sudani’s policies.  Two events in the same month have prompted questions about the nature of the relationship between Kata’ib Hezbollah and the Iraqi government. Hassan Al-Mustafa  Since assuming the reins last October, Al-Sudani has sought to mitigate the presence of armed military factions outside the authority of the state. And, although he is aware of the difficulty of the task at hand, he is seeking, as a candidate of the Coordination Framework and through his good relations with the political leadership in Iran, as well as with Iraqi politicians and prominent party leaders such as Nouri Al-Maliki, Qais Al-Khazali and Hadi Al-Amiri, to convince his partners that there should be no overt military activity without the permission of the state.  He has obtained relative cooperation in this matter, which in itself is a success, from parties such as Asa’ib Ahl Al-Haq, the Badr Brigade and Harakat Hezbollah Al-Nujaba. Hence, we notice that Al-Sudani “follows a path familiar to Iraqi governments, where he does the minimum necessary to prevent the deterioration of relations with Washington while meeting the aspirations of his partners supported by Iran,” according to David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute.  Al-Sudani, who appears to be taking quiet steps internally and opening up diplomatically and economically toward the Arab Gulf states, was apparently able — albeit temporarily — to convince some of his allies of the importance of mitigating the anti-American rhetoric. The Saudi-Iranian rapprochement, which took place under Chinese auspices, may have been in favor of Al-Sudani’s policies, prompting some party leaders to change their tone toward Washington.  Researchers Hamdi Malik and Michael Knights, in a January article for the Washington Institute titled “Militia Spokesmen Reflect on Sudani Inviting U.S. Forces to Remain,” wrote that Asa’ib Ahl Al-Haq was adopting practical thinking, while Kata’ib Hezbollah was “contorting its arguments to allow it to play along, albeit without explicitly accepting a US military presence.” They referred to a “pragmatism” in the behavior shown by Asa’ib Ahl Al-Haq, more so than by Kata’ib Hezbollah. However, the efforts of the latter focus mainly on extremist work and security operations, which makes political and intellectual changes difficult for it due to a predetermined doctrinal vision.  This analysis could indicate that Al-Sudani manages, with great discipline, the government’s relationships with the armed factions. To date, this has been achieved without implying the possibility of a broader pass by Kata’ib Hezbollah. However, its abuses could accumulate and there may be repercussions from the implementation of the death sentence of Al-Kinani, if the final judgment is approved and applied. In that moment, it will become apparent to what degree the allies of Al-Sudani will stand by the rule of law and the success of the prime minister’s experiment with regards to the influence of the militias.  • Hassan Al-Mustafa is a Saudi writer and researcher interested in Islamic movements, the development of religious discourse and the relationship between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Iran.

"political assassination","2023-07-26","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T03:31:16","On July 23, 2021, an article appeared in the Tokyo-based English-language weekly Nikkei Asia Review, calling attention to the Singapore government's handling of so-called KTV lounges, alleging that decades of institutional failures in dealing with what the article called ""organized crime cartels” were running what amounted to illegal brothels, which were responsible for the widespread spread of Covid-19 among the lounges’ patrons.  The result was astonishing. The story got an unheard-of 1.5 million hits from amid Singapore’s 5 million-odd population virtually from the moment it was uploaded, and far more than Nikkei had ever scored on a Singapore story, by a factor of thousands. As most Singaporeans know, the KTV lounges have been an embarrassment to strait-laced Singapore for decades, widely regarded as an unregulated hotbed not only for the coronavirus but as places where prostitution flourishes openly as authorities have long looked the other way.  The article appears to have generated absolute fury at the very top of the Singapore government, particularly in the office of law minister K Shanmugam. Singapore's answer to the story, which was written by a 28-year-old security analyst named Andy Wong Ming Jun, wasn't long in coming. Indignant articles appeared calling the Nikkei article “full of inaccuracies” and justifying the government’s control over the lounges and pointing out, among other things, that “Singapore has laws against organized crime, money laundering, and trafficking-in-persons” that keep the lounges squeaky clean.  The government apparently didn’t turn to the courts for defamation, as usual when deeply offended although officials in Singapore’s Tokyo embassy relayed a threat to throw Nikkei's entire business operations out of the country, reliable sources say, not just Nikkei Asian Review.  Wong is now in the UK, writing his master’s thesis and counting his scars, and unlikely to ever return to the city of his birth absent a political revolution. In the aftermath of the publication of the article in Nikkei Asia Review, he says, his life has been taken apart in stunning fashion, to the point where his professional and social life in Singapore have been ruined and he's been forced into exile.  According to his account, as well as news reports and court records made available to Asia Sentinel, Singapore mounted an attack on him that can only be described as unprecedented. It extended even to the consulting firm boss he was working for, who will remain unnamed, but who was blackballed from Singapore by his industry and political contacts, who “implied because they questioned his judgment in hiring a Singaporean who turned out to be a political critic.” The owner of the firm was forced by circumstances to close his consultancy and leave Singapore.  Three days after the article appeared, Wong and three others were arrested and charged in court with possessing or transmitting obscene materials through a Telegram chat group in an affair that had occurred 20 months before and seemingly gone dormant. Wong has repeatedly been identified as a ringleader of the group in state media reports and social media chatter as allegedly possessing vast amounts of porn on his iPhone and on his computer although in court documents he was identified as only a member of the chat group, which had 25,000 members.  Never mind that according to the Straits Times, 90 percent of teen boys and 47 percent of teen girls in a survey acknowledged viewing pornography. (Downloading such materials, however, is an offense.)  “I was just a normal Singapore citizen who had multiple career tracks spanning corporate services, port logistics, analyst work, and freelance journalism,” Wong wrote in a description of his ordeal which he emailed to Asia Sentinel. “Up till July 2021 I was also gainfully employed in business/political risk advisory in Singapore under a British boss, from which I've since had my ties severed due to significant compromising and blowback from my ongoing political persecution.”  Andy Wong is in company with victims of Singaporean government vindictiveness going back to four decades to the days when opposition leader Joshua B Jeyaretnam was persecuted falsely for irregularities in his party’s financial books. More recently the targets of government wrath have included citizen journalists Terry Xu and Ai Takagi, critic Roy Ngerng, cartoonist Leslie Chew, blogger Alex Au and many opposition politicians who have ended up in court facing charges and crippling fines after they called attention to alleged shortcomings in the Lion Republic.  Human rights lawyer M. Ravi was recently suspended from practice for five years for criticizing government vindictiveness against one of his clients who was on death row. He had previously also represented Alan Shadrake, who was jailed for more than five weeks in 2010 for his criticism of the death penalty in Singapore with his book Once A Jolly Hangman.  This process was described earlier at length in a 2017 Human Rights Watch report titled “Kill the Chicken to Scare the Monkeys: Suppression of Free Expression and Assembly in Singapore, which said that “those who criticize the government or the judiciary, or publicly discuss race and religion, frequently find themselves facing criminal investigations and charges, or civil defamation suits and crippling damages. Peaceful public demonstrations and other assemblies are severely limited, and failure to comply with detailed restrictions on what can be said and who can participate in public gatherings frequently results in police investigations and the threat of criminal charges.”  More recently, just last week Amnesty International charged that officials are “continuing to silence human rights defenders and other critics ahead of upcoming elections, subjecting “well-known activists and critics of the government to further investigation and harassment…solely for freely expressing their views and opinions.” The prime minister Lee Hsien Loong’s ’s own brother Lee Hsien Yang and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, have been forced to leave Singapore under threat of government action after warring with Hsien Loong, as Amnesty International reported.  Wong acknowledged in his correspondence with Asia Sentinel his membership of Telegram groups directly affiliated with an online adult forum as an offshoot of his personal alternative lifestyle in the local adult community. Describing each group as numbering as many as 25,000 members in each, they ranged from general chat to people sharing adult content through Telegram/Onlyfans when he was “single and footloose.” He stated emphatically that all three groups did not deal in “illegal leaked nudes” and that strict rules had been put in place to deter such sharing or discussions in them, owing to past high-profile cases such as the “Nasi Lemak” group in October 2019.  In November of 2019, he says, police raided his home and those of three others, apparently acting on a police report from an unnamed young woman angered about their alleged organized possession and sale of “illegal nude pictures.” While the other three were administrators of these groups, he says he was just a member along with 25,000 others. His passport and electronic devices were impounded and he was bailed for S$5,000.  Things went very quiet, he says, with no progress, and subsequent devolution of the initial accusations of selling illegal pornography or being a group administrator into simple possession by the time the first interview had ended. As a direct result of his arrest and ongoing investigations, he missed work and was later forced to resign from his position as a corporate secretary.  Then Covid happened. Without a job, unable to leave Singapore because of his impounded passport, he took other jobs such as working in port logistics (for which he was featured as a positive example by Singapore state media) and freelance defense writing. He says he established a strong network with thinktank heads, industry professionals, and people within the local political establishment.  In July 2021, he wrote the offending personal post about the Singapore government's handling of the pandemic on his LinkedIn social media platform, gaining traction among local expatriates. An acquaintance and think tank associate forwarded it to Nikkei Asia Review, whose editor then asked him for permission to modify it for publication.  The article elicited a furious response in local mainstream media and even in Parliament. Nikkei was threatened with the use of Singapore’s “Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act,” commonly abbreviated as POFMA and known colloquially as the Fake News Law, and threatened with being kicked out of the country altogether. The publication stuck by the article, as Asia Sentinel has verified.  “So, what do you do when you can’t take down a message online? You destroy the person who said it. You shoot the messenger with any convenient weaponized leverage within reach That's what happened to me,” Wong said. “An immediate campaign of character assassination was initiated against me by Singaporean state media, calling my article full of falsehoods and inaccuracies. Shanmugam even went on record in the news and televised parliamentary sessions denouncing me and calling me out as a fraud with an axe to grind against the government.”  This was a sitting law minister actively interfering with public comments on an open case, despite also stating in a 2016 Law Bill that “Persons in court cases should not face prejudgment by the media or by the public, in a way which whips up sentiment and creates a real risk of interfering with their trials.”  The wheels of justice spun fast. Barely a weekend after the publication of the offending Nikkei article, the Singapore Police acted on Wong’s dormant porn possession charges. He and the three other unrelated suspects were ordered to Tanglin Division police headquarters on July 26 – three days after publication.  Two days later on July 28 he was in court to officially acknowledge charges and start the court process, more than 20 months after his initial arrest. The case had been in limbo for so long that the police had to assign a new investigating officer because the original one had been reassigned elsewhere.  Wong ended up facing a total of 11 charges relating to possession of pornography, of which the most serious three were officially proceeded on to exact the highest possible punishment, he says. There was no mention of any aggravating factors such as “illegal nudes,” nor of linkages of his private pornography possession with his membership of the Telegram groups.  Although the original charges in the press circular put out by the police didn't contain any names of the four, their names were added in and plastered all over the police news web. Wong says state media character attacks increased as he attended court to acknowledge the possession charges.  “This concerted character assassination campaign resulted in a trial by trial by media and public opinion before a trial by law in a court to defend and address my charges,” he told Asia Sentinel. “This was the ultimate intent of the government in weaponizing my dormant criminal investigation case to discredit and destroy my life, even if it was utterly irrelevant and unlinked to my article.”  He says that as a direct result, he was subjected to targeted harassment and personal attacks on various local social media forums, he says, with some disclosing his publicly-available court dates in case potential troublemakers wished to turn up and harass him.  “The whole country and media reports painted me as some sort of ringleader running a Telegram group involved in transmitting and selling illegally leaked nudes and general porn.” But he didn’t and hadn’t. While there were public claims and repeated media reports that he had possessed more than 2,000 videos and 1,400 photos on his smartphone, there were only 119 videos on his impounded laptop.  His three co-accused were sentenced in December 2021 and the following month, leaving him to twist in the wind amid continuing social media furor and press reports.  In fact, in the end, the attorney general said the office had no intention of adding anything about transmission to possession of porn charges, and they would only be asking for a fine and no prison time. But, he says “this didn’t stop them from attempting to put me behind bars, for after the three other individuals linked to my case were sentenced to jail time, the deputy prosecutor was still communicating to my lawyer stating that his superiors had ordered “one final look” at my case to see if there was any justification to put me in prison.”  When his lawyer tried to raise this point in his defense statement, the deputy public prosecutor sought a hearing against the lawyer to discredit him in the eyes of the judge. His request was ultimately denied  He says the government set out to “weaponize my ‘porn possession’ charges although there were no links to any of the Telegram groups he was a member of, as attested to by the public prosecutor’s own statement of fact. Nonetheless, prosecutors asked for a ""double fine"" for his two video possession charges, with a maximum fine S$20,000 each. With another S$2,500 charge for possessing porn pictures on his phone for a total of S$42,500.  “I have been effectively publicly and professionally silenced and societally outcasted in Singapore,” he says. “I was robbed of any chance to defend myself in the open and say whatever the media and Shanmugam had reported about me was false and wrong. This was in large part due to obfuscation and stonewalling by the police and attorney general’s chambers towards my lawyer’s protestations as to who was responsible for the erroneous press circular put out about my case. As long as it was not changed, state media could then have their smokescreen to claim objective factual reportage of my case even before final sentencing.”  His lawyer, he says, “strongly advised me not to defend myself in public about my Nikkei article or my case till we have more legal clarity out of concerns about further state aggravation and trial by media over my unrelated article muddying my legal case and we had to somehow play dumb and pretend that my case is going to be tried and handled in a vacuum independent of external circumstances and political interference. Not that it worked in the end.”  Shortly before Wong was convicted and sentenced, Singaporean state media released a documentary indirectly corroborating and confirming his Nikkei Asia Review article on YouTube titled “Sing City: What Drives Singapore's Underground KTV Industry?”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFzZW50aW5lbC5jb20vcC9zaW5nYXBvcmUta2lsbHMtY2hpY2tlbi1zY2FyZS1tb25rZXlz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2020-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Baghdad"", ""Baghdad"", ""Iraq""}","2023-05-23T09:24:27","The post-2003 security landscape in Iraq has seen the proliferation of dozens of militias identifying with Shiite Islam. Many of these actors are integrated into the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) – a paramilitary group established in 2014 to counter the Islamic State and later incorporated into the Iraqi state forces – and have strong relations with the Iranian regime and its security apparatus. These Iran-backed groups include prominent militias such as Kataib Hizbullah (KH), Asaib Ahl al-Haqq (AAH), and Haraka Hizbullah al-Nujaba (HHN), as well as a number of recently formed ‘facade groups’ like Ashab al-Kahf and Qasim al-Jabarin. Such facade groups are generally assumed to operate on behalf of KH, AAH, and HHN (see graph below). These groups are notable for portraying themselves as the Muqawama, or the ‘resistance’ against the United States and other foreign forces.  Since mid-2019 – and increasingly after US forces assassinated Iranian general Qassim Soleimani and PMF Deputy Chairman Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January 2020 – Iran-backed militias have engaged in military operations targeted at foreign and domestic objectives inside Iraq. ACLED records over 500 events involving these militias or one of their facade groups between June 2019 and March 2023. These attacks are carried out using drones, rockets, and IEDs and have three primary targets with a distinct geographical distribution: 1) convoys carrying materiel for US personnel and forces affiliated with the Global Coalition Against Daesh and bases hosting them, mostly clustered in central and southern Iraq; 2) Turkish bases, in northern Iraq; and 3) purported ‘un-Islamic’ activities, largely around Baghdad (see map below).  The activity of Iran-backed militias has shifted between these three primary targets in response to a number of domestic and international drivers: US-Iran tensions; intra-militia competition; opposition to foreign military forces inside Iraq; and domestic political developments. This report explores the evolution in militia activity from 2019 to 2023 by interpreting these shifts as strategies to maximize pressure on foreign forces, avoid retaliation, and gain popular domestic consensus.  Attacks Against US and Coalition Targets  Iran-backed militias see the US as an occupying force interfering in Iraq’s internal affairs and undermining Baghdad’s sovereignty. Their operations are part of a wider campaign to pressure the US to exit Iraq and are aimed at two primary targets: military bases and convoys carrying logistical materiel (see graph below). Both these targets reflect a preference for indirect confrontation with US troops, and their respective prioritizations have fluctuated depending on the militias’ tactical objectives.  In Iraq, US and Coalition forces, advisors, and contractors are hosted by Iraqi government-administered military bases and at the US Embassy in Baghdad. Since mid-2019, ACLED records over 100 incidents involving Iran-backed militia operations against bases hosting US forces. Operations against bases require complex planning and make use of remote violence and Iranian-provided drones and weaponry. Successful attacks have a high symbolic value, highlighting US vulnerabilities and affecting US public opinion. At the same time, operations against bases are riskier: they are more predictable, easier to prevent, and likely to trigger retaliation in the event of US casualties.  On the other hand, operations against convoys present a lower level of risk for the militias. Trucks are owned and driven by Iraqi contractors, so the possibility of US casualties is low, reducing the threat of US retaliation. Furthermore, these operations are difficult to anticipate and prevent. They typically occur along the convoy routes, in particular south of Baghdad, while transporting materiel to and from military bases around the capital. Albeit representing a form of low-level “harassment” against US forces, operations against convoys are considered an effective form of pressure against the US and an expression of anti-US sentiment. ACLED records approximately 330 convoy attacks since 2020, mostly involving IEDs and roadside bombs, which resulted in at least three reported fatalities of Iraqi nationals.  Since mid-2019, Iran-backed militias have strategically alternated the targeting of bases and convoys in response to three main factors: US-Iran tensions, intra-militia rivalry, and domestic political developments. These compounding factors contribute to defining three main phases in militia activity against US forces.  Phase 1: Heightened US-Iran tensions (June 2019-December 2020)  Tensions between the US and Iran loom large over the activity of Iran-backed militias in Iraq. In May 2018, the Trump administration suspended US participation in the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Reacting to President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy of unilateral sanctions, Tehran began to break its JCPOA commitments in mid-2019 and launched attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz in June of that year.  Amidst these rising tensions, Iran-backed militias launched an unprecedented campaign of attacks against US targets that continued intermittently until September 2020. The US responded with a strategy of “contested deterrence,” limiting retaliatory strikes to major incidents involving US casualties (see graph below). For instance, the US launched airstrikes on KH positions after KH attacks on the K-1 Coalition base in Kirkuk on 27 December that killed one US contractor and two policemen. A few days after, on 2 January 2020, the US also launched the airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis in response to Iran-leaning demonstrators storming the US Embassy compound in Baghdad on 31 December 2020.  The latter incident had political and military consequences. On 5 January, the Iraqi parliament passed a non-binding resolution to “end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, airspace, or water for any reason.” Meanwhile, militias adopted two novel strategies to enhance plausible deniability and avoid US retaliatory strikes: first, they expanded the targets of their attacks to include convoys from February 2020 and more consistently since July; and second, by mid-March 2020 they started resorting to the use of facade groups. Facade groups emerged as ‘brands’ for specific types of attacks, with the aim of ‘muddying the waters’ and making it harder to trace attacks back to specific Iran-supported militias. The vast majority of facade groups appeared between March 2020 and March 2021, marketing themselves as vigilante or paramilitary actors.  Militia operations against US bases and convoys escalated during the summer, pressuring the US to abandon smaller bases and outposts to avoid attacks on US soldiers, peaking in September 2020, while the US and the Iraqi government held talks over the presence of US troops in the country. In 2020, ACLED records approximately 50 attacks on US bases – the highest number recorded in the country since the beginning of ACLED coverage in 2016.  Phase 2: Intra-militia rivalry, resumption of JCPOA talks, and increased convoy attacks (October 2020-September 2021)  In the lead-up to the US presidential elections in November 2020, Iran-backed militias declared a ‘conditional truce’ with US forces in Iraq on 10 October 2020, which suspended rocket attacks in return for a scheduled plan for US troops to leave the country. This truce lasted until 27 February 2021. Albeit sponsored by Tehran, the truce caused a fracture within the Muqawama. While KH-aligned actors redirected most of their activity against domestic targets (see inset box below) and US convoys, AAH-aligned actors refused to tow Iran’s line, continuing attacks on US bases. These high-profile attacks came amid widely held expectations that newly elected US President Joe Biden would rapidly withdraw American troops, allowing the AAH to portray itself as a defender of Iraq’s sovereignty that ‘forced’ the US out of the country.  This pattern of internal competition continued throughout 2021, with AAH shifting the focus of its operations towards convoy attacks, thus prompting an increase in an area of activity previously occupied by KH-aligned facade groups. ACLED records 180 events involving the targeting of US convoys in 2021, a threefold spike compared to the year prior. Around 40 of these incidents have been claimed by AAH-aligned facade groups, while KH-aligned groups claimed only 11. This figure is in line with reports suggesting that AAH-aligned groups took the lead in carrying out attacks against convoys, despite Iran’s instructions to de-escalate operations against US targets.  During this phase, the pattern of militia attacks also evolved in response to the new approach taken by President Biden, who assumed office in January 2021. Biden endeavored to revive the JCPOA talks with Iran, de-escalate tensions in Iraq, and reduce US military presence in the Middle East more broadly. Meanwhile, Iran-backed militias maximized pressure by escalating convoy attacks and – in a further violation of the ongoing conditional ceasefire – an AAH facade group, Saraya Awliya al-Dam, claimed responsibility for an attack on a US airbase in Erbil on 15 February. Notably, US forces avoided retaliation in Iraq, only responding 10 days later by targeting Iran-backed militias in eastern Syria, thus marking distance from Trump’s “contested deterrence” policy.  The JCPOA talks resumed in April 2021, with militia attacks against bases steadily increasing between April and June and remaining high throughout July. This spike in militia activity has several potential explanations. First, Iran-backed militias arguably escalated the attacks to pressure the US during the JCPOA talks. Second, contradictions inherent to the Biden administration’s policy towards Iraq, and the Middle East generally, emboldened militias to ramp up operations. Indeed, in April, the US defense secretary announced that there were no plans to withdraw US troops from Iraq, contradicting Biden’s electoral vow to “end the forever wars.” Lastly, in June, the US targeted KH-aligned groups in Syria in response to militia attacks in Iraq, with the Muqawama pledging retaliation.  This impasse was eventually resolved in July when the US announced the end of the American combat mission in Iraq. Following the announcement, attacks against US bases reduced to a trickle, completely ceasing before the Iraqi elections. Overall, ACLED records a 25% decrease in operations targeting US bases in 2021.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWNsZWRkYXRhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL3RoZS1tdXFhd2FtYS1hbmQtaXRzLWVuZW1pZXMtc2hpZnRpbmctcGF0dGVybnMtaW4taXJhbi1iYWNrZWQtc2hpaXRlLW1pbGl0aWEtYWN0aXZpdHktaW4taXJhcS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","{""TheHague"", ""ZuidHolland"", ""Netherlands""}","2023-05-23T21:13:56","In the aftermath of the two mass killings in and around Belgrade, Serbian citizens have handed over a huge number of illegal weapons. That is surely a positive step, but much more must be done.  On May 3, 2023, a 13-year-old boy entered his school in central Belgrade with a gun and opened fire. He is currently in a psychiatric clinic, and his father is in custody, accused of training the teenager to handle weapons and failing to adequately secure the pistol. Only a day later, a young man of 20 randomly fired at people in a rural area south of the capital. Altogether, 17 people have been killed and 21 wounded, most of them children or very young. One injured girl died in the hospital 10 days later.  What followed were three protests: silent marches of more than 50.000 people each. The third, the largest one on May 19, lasted long into the night, without serious incidents. Citizens peacefully walked through the city with the banner “Serbia against violence and blocked Belgrade’s most important Gazela Bridge over the river Sava. Apart from expressing grief over the lost lives, demonstrators are criticizing the government for encouraging a culture of violence and hate speech, which is omnipresent in the official media space and freely used even by the president, Aleksandar Vučić.  Protestors demanded the resignations of two ministers and the withdrawal of broadcast licenses for two TV stations that are close to the state—“Pink” and “Happy”—which promote violence and frequently host convicted war criminals and people from the underworld. Both are famous for their violent reality shows that, by some estimates, make up 60 percent of their recent programming. Protestors also demand that tabloids, sharing the same appreciation for hate speech and violence—such as Informer, Kurir, Blic, and Telegraf—be put under scrutiny. Nearly 450,000 people have signed a petition calling for concrete actions.  A History of Protest  Protestors from the democratic opposition in Serbia often call their actions “walks.” Like the Australian aborigines, they are performing a sort of “walkabout” in search of the soul of their country, which the Western media so often portrays as barbaric and brutal. The current “walks” in Belgrade continue a ritual journey started a long time ago. The anti-war movement organized a number of protests in 1991-1992 against Slobodan Milošević’s regime, opposing the army’s actions in the Battle of Vukovar, the sieges of Dubrovnik and Sarajevo, and military conscription. About 150,000 people took part in the largest protest—the Black Ribbon March—in solidarity with the people of Sarajevo. Somewhere between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Yugoslav People’s Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 Serbs emigrated as part of their refusal to participate in the war. Despite these numbers, the independent media and anti-war groups from Serbia did not attract much international attention.  During the winter of 1996–1997, students of the University of Belgrade protested against the electoral fraud attempted by the Socialist Party of Serbia of President Slobodan Milošević and demanded the return of the university’s autonomy. At the same time, opposition parties created the coalition Zajedno (Together) and organized a series of peaceful protests.  But on December 24, 1996, the government coalition Za Srbiju (For Serbia) organized a large counter-protest. Milošević told his supporters that “Serbia will not be controlled by someone else’s hand,” implying that his hand was adequate. To the chants of “Slobo, mi te volimo” (“Slobo, we love you”), Milošević responded with “I love you too.” Before, during and after the rally, supporters of the regime physically confronted the opposition. Police intervened, but not promptly enough. One person was killed, another seriously injured. Serbia seemed to be on the brink of the civil war.  A few years later, the country again approached the precipice. On August 25, 2000, Ivan Stambolić, a former mentor and political ally of Milošević, was kidnapped from his home and later executed. Milošević was accused of orchestrating the assassination. The anti-government youth movement Otpor! (Resistance) led the campaign against the administration and for a transparent democracy. To unify opposition, 18 parties formed the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition, with Vojislav Koštunica as the candidate to confront Milošević. Across two months of protests, several hundred thousand protesters arrived in Belgrade, chanting “He’s finished!” Although there was no larger escalation of violence, 65 people were nevertheless injured in the riots and two died. DOS won the elections in December with a two-thirds majority. On 1 April 2001, Serbian police detained Milošević, and he was later transferred to The Hague.  More Recent Protests  The “walks” are still going on. Promises have not been held and hate speech continues, as does the perpetual reinforcement of old nationalist myths. The rise to power of Aleksandar Vučić didn’t help. At the end of 2018, voices started to be raised against president’s authoritarian rule. First in Belgrade and quickly spreading to the cities across the country, this round of demonstrations lasted more than a year before being suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. What provoked anger were numerous scandals involving ruling party members, information about strange arm deals and corruption, questionable electoral practices including the intimidation of voters, and violent attacks on opposition figures. Assaults on investigative journalists and pressure on independent media had again become commonplace. Freedom House reported on legal harassment and smear campaigns. But oppositional parties didn’t come with a convincing alternative program and nothing at the top changed. For his part, Vučić organized a number of rallies under the banner of the “Future of Serbia,” handsomely assisted by a pro-government media that demonized protesters as “fascists, hooligans, and thieves.”  The walks continue amid a growing crisis of democratic institutions. In 2020 Gradjanski Otpor (Civil Resistance) called for a boycott of the elections, while representatives of the academic community demanded a change in the editorial policy of the Serbian public broadcaster RTS. For the next two years the streets were often occupied by one initiative or another: both pro- and anti-LBGT manifestations, reactions to COVID measures, actions against police brutality and in favor of media freedom. To most of these demands for change, Vučić gave his characteristic answer, calling participants criminal, foreign elements.  The biggest environmental protest (and the only successful one) started in September 2021 and lasted until February 2022. It was held in Belgrade and other locations in Serbia. Tens of thousands of people demanded that the Serbian government cancel the permission given to the Anglo-Australian corporation Rio Tinto to explore mines near the Jadar Valley and exploit the silicate mineral, jadarite. On January 8, Prime Minister Ana Brnabić announced that the government “was close to annulling all permits given to Rio Tinto” and later confirmed that the plan had indeed been abolished. She didn’t shy away from accusing Western governments of supporting the protests.  What’s Happening Now on the Streets  In 2023, the mass protests are taking place yet again. The pro-governmental TV station Pink has reported that a “handful of haters” are harassing the people. The government proclaims that the protesters are anti-Serbian, unpatriotic, and a danger to the state. For his part, Vučić sent the demonstrators a message: “Serbia is fed up with your destruction of everything Serbian!” He informed his supporters that “sister services from the east told him that these are attempts at ‘color revolutions,’” alluding to the change of government in Kyiv in 2014.  Meanwhile, the government has issued an invitation to a May 26 counter-rally, where, according to the authorities, “the real Serbs” will pledge their fealty to the motherland and its leaders and oppose all inner and foreign enemies that are struggling to influence them.  According to the Miroslav Parovica, the president of the opposition National Freedom Movement:  The government officially announced that the system works well, and to top it all, the president of the state publicly invites his supporters to protest against the citizens of Serbia who did not accept the official version about the responsibility of video games and social networks (for the killings)… it is important to support and encourage the citizens to persevere in this silent march that will eventually win over an aggressive and hysterical government unwilling to take responsibility and show even a gram of empathy and reason.  Prominent copywriter Nadežda Milenković adds, “The authorities support … street demonstration of power, brute force, ignorance, lack of education, lack of compassion, demonization… The only thing they do not support is demonstrating decency. If you try to show the authorities what unadulterated humanity looks like, the authorities will demonstratively pout.”  The government has done one good thing: organized a mass handover of illegal arms. To date, citizens have turned in more than 13,500 weapons), from guns and hand grenades to anti-tank launchers and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. But this is far from enough. Social insecurity, underlying violence, mistrust, manipulation, propaganda, economic problems, and confusion concerning the future are all taking their toll. The president consistently glides between pro-EU and a pro-Putin positions while loudly proclaiming his independent position.  For their part, the democratic opposition and the peaceful citizens of Serbia are hoping to become a serious factor of change. But the clear and present danger is that an organized, obedient, and paid group of protesters will take the stage on May 26. They may well become violent. The government is well aware of it. Indeed, given its consistently violent rhetoric, the government might even encourage it.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vZnBpZi5vcmcvdGhlLXNlcmJpYW4tbW92ZW1lbnQtYWdhaW5zdC12aW9sZW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ryuji Kimura, 24, was arrested in April for allegedly hurling a pipe bomb-like explosive toward Fumio Kishida as the premier campaigned in the western city of Wakayama.  Kishida escaped unscathed, but the incident horrified a nation still haunted by the assassination of Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was gunned down last year while giving a speech.  Also Read | Japanese atomic bomb survivors worry Zelenskyy's G7 visit overshadows nuke disarmament message  Prosecutors are authorised to detain Kimura until early September for an assessment of his mental state at the time of the attack, a court official, who did not give her name, told AFP.  They are expected to decide whether to indict Kimura based on the evaluation.  The suspect has reportedly remained tight-lipped about his motive for the failed attack on Kishida.  Local media reported that Kimura previously filed a lawsuit challenging requirements that political candidates be at least 30 years of age and have a war chest of at least three million yen ($21,600) to run for national office.  An Osaka High Court spokesman told AFP last month that Kimura had sued the government and his claim was rejected by a lower court.  A ruling on his appeal is expected this month.  The attack put Japan on high alert ahead of the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima, which wrapped up Sunday, and reignited a debate over police security for politicians.  In an interview with foreign media including AFP last month, Kishida said the attack served as a sobering reminder of the difficulties in balancing interactions with voters against the safety of politicians.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWNjYW5oZXJhbGQuY29tL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvd29ybGQtbmV3cy1wb2xpdGljcy9hbGxlZ2VkLWtpc2hpZGEtYXR0YWNrZXItdG8tdW5kZXJnby1wc3ljaGlhdHJpYy1leGFtcy0xMjIxMjY4Lmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVjY2FuaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9hbXAvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93b3JsZC1uZXdzLXBvbGl0aWNzL2FsbGVnZWQta2lzaGlkYS1hdHRhY2tlci10by11bmRlcmdvLXBzeWNoaWF0cmljLWV4YW1zLTEyMjEyNjguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Islamabad, Pakistan – Nearly two weeks ago, a short video emerged on social media showing Pakistani journalist and political commentator Imran Riaz Khan being escorted out of Sialkot International Airport by a group of police officers.  The controversial 47-year-old commentator, with more than three million followers on YouTube, hasn’t been seen publicly since and neither his family nor police appear to know where he is.  His 32-year-old brother, Usman Riaz Khan, said that on the day the video was filmed, May 11, Imran Riaz Khan was flying to Oman, after deciding to flee Pakistan when his house in Lahore was raided by police the day before.  “My brother was able to distill political affairs in his 16-minute-long videos, and he always told the truth, that is why he was picked up,” the younger brother told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.  Speaking from Lahore, Usman Riaz Khan said that the family was told by sources with the Punjab police that his brother had been taken to the police station after being arrested at Sialkot airport.  “When we inquired, the police said we released him that night only. Police also claimed that he went away with a group of unknown people, and they don’t know anything about him anymore,” Usman said, adding that his brother does not have any legal cases against him.  However, his father claimed in an official complaint filed with police that CCTV footage from the police station showed his son being “kidnapped” by “four to five masked men” after being released.  In Pakistan, a prominent pro-Imran Khan commentator has ""disappeared."" Imran Riaz Khan was detained by the police last week, but they say they don't have him in custody any more 🤨 I spoke to Information Minister @Marriyum_A about his case & press freedom under the current govt: pic.twitter.com/KhN4MId2wR — Secunder Kermani (@SecKermani) May 22, 2023  Azhar Siddique, a lawyer for the family, criticised Imran Riaz Khan’s arrest, saying that there are no existing charges against him anywhere in the country.  “Despite having no grounds to keep him, the authorities are finding excuses to somehow slow down the process and delay it,” the lawyer told Al Jazeera on Tuesday, adding that the family would file an appeal.  Usman Riaz Khan said that during a court hearing on May 22, 11 days after his older brother was arrested at the airport, the police repeatedly claimed that Imran Riaz Khan was not in their custody.  “The [Inspector General] told the court that he needs three more days to look for my brother, and now the next hearing is on Thursday. My family is completely traumatised. My father is a patient of diabetes and cannot even talk about this,” he said.  “Apart from the eldest daughter, we have not even told the rest of three children where their father is and why is he not home,” Usman Riaz Khan added.  Government response  Inspector General of the Punjab Police Usman Anwar said on Tuesday that Imran Riaz Khan was not in police custody, declining to comment further since the case was ongoing with the court.  “He is not with us. The matter is sub judice [before a judge]. He is not required in any case,” he responded to Al Jazeera via phone message.  Interim Information Minister for Punjab Amir Mir also denied that Imran Riaz Khan was in police custody.  “The Punjab police chief has given the response in the court. The matter is being heard there but we don’t have any information about Imran Riaz Khan and he is not with us.”      In a TV interview on Monday, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan said that if it is proven that Imran Riaz Khan was kidnapped, the government will go after the perpetrators.  “We have asked intelligence and investigation agencies, and they have said he is not with them,” he said.  Federal Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb said she condemned any illegal action taken against individuals, while at the same time questioning Imran Riaz Khan’s journalistic credentials.  “Imran Riaz Khan is a political party spokesperson. You must draw distinction between a journalist and those who join a political party and incite violence. Don’t mix them with those journalists who report,” the minister told the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 News.  The Khan controversy  The YouTuber and commentator has a controversial reputation. Through his videos and statements, Imran Riaz Khan is seen to be closely aligned with former Prime Minister Imran Khan (no relation) and his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).  The video of Imran Riaz Khan being escorted from the airport was filmed two days after the former PM was arrested on corruption charges.  Following the ex-premier’s arrest, widespread violent protests erupted across the country, leading the government to approve the establishment of military courts to try protesters involved in attacking military installations under a draconian army act and official secrets act. During the protests, at least 10 people died and more than 4,000 were arrested on charges of vandalism and rioting.  Prior to the former PM’s removal from office in April 2022, Imran Riaz Khan was an ardent supporter of the military and its actions against journalists, but his pro-military stance reversed soon after.  Imran Riaz Khan was twice arrested by the authorities in July 2022 and February 2023 on accusations of sedition. He was released in both cases in less than a week, and the charges were subsequently dropped.  Press freedom  Reporters Without Borders (RSF), the global body for media freedom, condemned the “abduction” of Imran Riaz Khan, and said it believes Pakistan’s spy agencies are involved.  “There is no point closing one’s eyes to the ‘agencies’ euphemism. It was clearly Pakistan’s military intelligence agencies that abducted Imran Riaz Khan,” Daniel Bastard, the head of Asia-Pacific at RSF, said in a statement issued on Tuesday.  “It is up to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s civilian government to ensure respect for the rule of law by producing the journalist in court or ordering his release. Failing this, the Pakistani authorities will be held directly responsible for any harm that may have befallen him.”  A journalists’ union activist and reporter, Matiullah Jan, slammed the government’s inaction to recover Khan. Singling out the reaction by Information Minister Aurangzeb, Jan, who was also arrested for one day in 2020, took issue with the criticism of Imran Riaz Khan.  “You are criticising a person who has been missing for almost two weeks. You criticise somebody who is at least in front of you or has the power to respond back. You are a minister, and insulting somebody who is disappeared just because you think he is a party worker? Is disappearing a party worker justified?” Jan asked Al Jazeera.  Analyst and journalist Absar Alam, who survived an assassination attempt in 2021, said that illegal and unconstitutional acts cannot be tolerated.  “If he has committed any crime, produce him before the court. He may have had a history of defending similar disappearances, mocking suffering victims of other media personnel targeted in the past. However, anybody who’s forcibly disappeared, it was wrong back then, and it is just as wrong now,” he told Al Jazeera.  Another senior journalist, Murtaza Solangi, told Al Jazeera it is the state’s responsibility to find who is responsible for Imran Riaz Khan’s disappearance regardless of why he disappeared.  “I don’t know if he was taken away or disappeared himself. It is the state’s job to find out. The buck stops with them. Any citizen of this country, even if he or she is a criminal, they should be taken to court and given due process as their right,” Solangi said.  Pakistan has a chequered record when it comes to media freedom and the safety of journalists.  Media personnel have long been targeted by state authorities for their work, and many have been attacked, or were pushed out of their jobs.  The country was ranked 150 in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index published by RSF, an improvement of seven places in rank from the year before.  Another journalist and anchorperson, Arshad Sharif, had to flee Pakistan last year in August after threats to his life, and was later killed in Kenya in October.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMjMvam91cm5hbGlzdC1pbXJhbi1yaWF6LWtoYW4tc3RpbGwtbWlzc2luZy1pbi1wYWtpc3RhbtIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzIzL2pvdXJuYWxpc3QtaW1yYW4tcmlhei1raGFuLXN0aWxsLW1pc3NpbmctaW4tcGFraXN0YW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Anjum Naveed/ AP  An army with a state  Since its creation in 1947, Pakistan has been under military dictatorship spanning a total of 34 years. When not directly in power, the military elite have discreetly engaged in hybrid regimes, exerting influence on civilian governments from behind the scenes.  The British colonial legacy has played a vital role in shaping Pakistan’s military today. British generals continued to head the Pakistan’s military until 1951, when the authority was transferred to General Ayub Khan. Just seven years later, Ayub became Pakistan’s second president through a military coup.  This foundation led to the establishment in 1948 of the spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. It gained remarkable influence in the 1980s, when the US covertly waged a war in Afghanistan using Pakistan as a proxy against the declining Soviet Union.  This period also saw the execution of an elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  Then came the era of religious extremism under General Zia-ul-Haq. This consolidated Pakistan’s obsession with the “strategic depth” for interference in Afghanistan.  In later years, Pakistan saw the assassination of an elected prime minister, Benazir Bhutto under the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. This was the time of enforced disappearances of civilian dissidents. Pakistan also became a safe haven for Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden while receiving funds from the US as a frontline ally in the war against terrorism.  Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan, General Asim Munir, hosted the Taliban’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Islamabad last week. Inter Services Public Relations/AP  Pakistan’s army received substantial financial backing from the US during the Cold War. This bolstered its might domestically while allowing it to undertake adventures abroad for which it was unaccountable.  Traces of the Pakistani military’s involvement could also be seen in the Arab conflicts and the Bangladesh “rape camps”.  Military immune to hyper inflation in Pakistan  Pakistan is on the verge of an economic meltdown, weighed down by harsh pay-back terms from international lenders. With only A$5.2 billion worth of state reserves and a debt of over A$13.5 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund, the army nonetheless received an increased payment of A$11.27 billion in last year’s budget.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  Between 2011 and 2015 alone, the army’s assets grew by 78%. By 2016, the armed forces in Pakistan ran over 50 commercial entities, including public sector organisations and real estate ventures worth A$30 billion. Today, their commercial assets are worth over A$39.8 billion.  Top military officers, including former army chief General Qamar Jawed Bajwa and army spokesman, General Asim Saleem Bajwa, have been revealed to have experienced significant financial gains within a relatively short time. Bajwa’s immediate family amassed substantial wealth, transforming into billionaires within six years.  General Asim Saleem Bajwa and his brother established a business empire that included 133 restaurants across four countries, operating under the Papa John’s pizza franchise. An investigation was also launched into real estate corruption by the brothers of former army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who for many years was the most powerful figure in the country.  The Pandora Papers exposed a long list of Pakistan’s former military officers who had accumulated immense wealth through tax evasions and corruption.  Over time, the military’s economic interests have gained prominence. This includes military-owned businesses, significant onshore and offshore land and property holdings, influence over defence contracts, as well as alleged involvement in ventures linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  The military’s influence in Pakistan extends beyond politics and the economy. To control information dissemination, the military employs a combination of traditional and social media censorship. It also utilises vaguely worded draconian laws.  Former female prime minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto got assassinated on 27 December 2007 in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Emilio Morenatti/ AP  These laws effectively criminalise any form of “ridicule” directed at the army, carrying severe penalties such as long prison sentences and hefty fines. Slain journalist Arshad Sharif was charged with “sedition” under the same laws for allegedly spreading hate against the military and disrespecting state institutions.  As a nuclear state, Pakistan’s military is much like Voltaire’s description of Frederick II of Prussia: it is a state within itself, benefiting from its sheer size, a great deal of money, and an advantageous geopolitical positioning.  The military’s rise to power in Pakistan is linked to cultivating a collective ethos that portrays politics as inherently corrupt, while positioning itself as the sole bastion of honesty, discipline and nationalism.  It is because of this approach that despite corruption within the military, it has successfully distanced itself from the prevalent political culture, which is characterised by kinship ties, factionalism, patronage networks, and most importantly, corruption.

"political assassination","2023-05-24","04:19:00","{""Raipur"", ""Chhattisgarh"", ""India""}","2023-05-23T22:49:00","May 24, 2023 04:19 am | Updated 04:19 am IST - Raipur  As election heat grips Madhya Pradesh, the BJP has, over the course of the week, brought up old issues to target Congress’ State president and former Chief Minister Kamal Nath.  On Sunday, a day after the CBI filed a chargesheet against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in connection with the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984, BJP State president V.D. Sharma questioned the role of Mr. Nath in the same, calling him the “third likely accused” besides Mr. Tytler and another jailed Congress leader [Sajjan Kumar].  He said that it “was likely that the CBI will soon bring the truth about Mr. Nath” in the riots that followed the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Delhi on October 31, 1984.  Hitting back at these allegations, Mr. Nath – who is leading the Congress’ campaign for the 2023 Assembly poll – said that there was no FIR against him and a commission formed to probe the 1984 case and set up by the BJP had said that he was innocent. “In 45 years of my political life, no one has raised a finger at me but Mr. Sharma is saying all this to cover up his own misdeeds,” said Mr. Nath on Monday.  On Tuesday, Mr. Sharma fired a fresh salvo, this time questioning Mr. Nath’s alleged “collusion” with China. “I am saying this in all seriousness that when you [Mr. Nath] were the Union Commerce Minister, you were accused of colluding with China,” he said without divulging further on the issue. Mr. Nath was a Union Minister till 2014 when the then Manmohan Singh-led United Progressive Alliance was voted out.  In response to the allegation, MP Congress media-in-charge Piyush Babele called the statement “shameful” and questioned the BJP’s own record of “hobnobbing with China”.  In recent months, the BJP has often attacked Mr. Nath on his governance record while being the Chief Minister for 15 months between late 2018 and mid-2020, while also bringing up his age (76 years) to question his ability to govern, often in a mocking tone. However, this apparently is a new line of attack where past issues are also dug up.  Political commentator Rakesh Dikshit says that while the BJP has been focussed on attacking the two main leaders of the Congress – Mr. Nath and Digvijaya Singh, another former CM – it realises that fatigue will set in if it continues to question their governance records.  “They use “Commission Nath” for Mr. Nath and ‘Mr. Bantadhar’ [or ‘Mr. Debacle’, a catchphrase from BJP’s 2003 campaign] for Mr. Singh but that strategy has its limitation on the face of a long-standing anti-incumbency that the BJP itself faces. So drilling new messaging periodically into the minds of the cadre is imperative, and turning back the pages of history can be one way of doing so. However, this is flogging a dead horse as far as today’s MP politics is concerned,” he says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9vdGhlci1zdGF0ZXMvYmpwLXJhaXNlcy1vbGQtaXNzdWVzLXRvLWF0dGFjay1rYW1hbC1uYXRoLWluLW1hZGh5YS1wcmFkZXNoLWVsZWN0aW9uLWNhbXBhaWduL2FydGljbGU2Njg4NjIzMi5lY2XSAZsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvb3RoZXItc3RhdGVzL2JqcC1yYWlzZXMtb2xkLWlzc3Vlcy10by1hdHRhY2sta2FtYWwtbmF0aC1pbi1tYWRoeWEtcHJhZGVzaC1lbGVjdGlvbi1jYW1wYWlnbi9hcnRpY2xlNjY4ODYyMzIuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T17:49:44","The study of fascism done by Communists throughout history is being proven correct in the United States. As the GOP is being taken over by extreme right elements in their party, this is confirming Bulgarian Communist Georgi Dimitrov’s points about how fascism develops in countries experiencing a crisis of capitalism and a revolutionized working class.  The united front strategy has been accepted and utilized by a vast majority of the worldwide Marxist-Leninist movement, aside from a number of fringe ultra-left elements who label everything existing under capitalism explicitly fascist. Regardless, it does us no good to squabble on this point when the GOP poses an imminent threat to the lives of working-class and oppressed people. As Communists — as members of the Communist Party — we must have a plan of action that not only resonates with progressive forces in and allied with the working class, but that also advances us towards socialism.  A plan of action and an offensive strategy has been the U.S. working class’ demand since the time our working class was developing. The women workers of the textile mills in the Northeast region of the United States planned strikes to protest the exploitation and oppression within their workplace, and presented petitions to their government leading to working-class gains.  “Campaigning for the ten-hour day, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association presented petitions to the Massachusetts State Legislature in 1843 and 1844. When the Legislature agreed to hold public hearings, the Lowell women acquired the distinction of winning the very first investigation of labor conditions by a government body in the history of the United States.” (Angela Davis, Women, Race, & Class)  During the civil rights movement, Black working-class men and women were leading the struggle for full equality under the economic system that was built on the backs of their mothers and fathers. Before his assassination, Dr. Martin Luther King was being guided to progressive and socialist-oriented politics due to the revolutionary character of the Black working class. This era of struggle for Black liberation led to huge legislative wins for all workers in the United States.  The history of democratic struggle shows that the working class wins when every tool is utilized to chip away at capitalist power. And yes, it includes participation in the electoral arena. Ignoring this would be a grave error, not only because it would hand over control of an entire section of our existing democratic institutions solely to the upper strata of class society, but also because this is the primary political tool of struggle for social progress being utilized by the working class in the era of neoliberalism. To reject the need for an evaluation of a concrete situation in order to determine the appropriateness, or inappropriateness, of a given form of struggle, would be to reject one crucial aspect of Leninism, leading to confusion. Lenin put it this way:  Marxism demands an absolutely historical examination of the question of the forms of struggle. To treat this question apart from the concrete historical situation betrays a failure to understand the rudiments of dialectical materialism. At different stages of economic evolution, depending on differences in political, national-cultural, living and other conditions, different forms of struggle come to the fore and become the principal forms of struggle; and in connection with this, the secondary, auxiliary forms of struggle undergo change in their turn. To attempt to answer yes or no to the question whether any particular means of struggle should be used, without making a detailed examination of the concrete situation of the given movement at the given stage of its development, means completely to abandon the Marxist position. [emphasis added] (V.I. Lenin Collected Works, Vol. XI pp. 213-214)  Yet, so many self-described Marxists have rejected the electoral arena of struggle in a matter that is uncritically sweeping. Some of them, likely a large number, seem to have forgotten that it was the presidential campaigns of Bernie Sanders and his open identification as a socialist that spurred them on to read Marx, Lenin and other socialist theorists in the first place. This is especially heinous in our period of crisis, where fascist politics are seeping into the GOP, and in turn are empowering fascist groups such as the Three Percenters, the Proud Boys, and the Patriot Front to terrorize oppressed minorities.  Ten years ago, it was inconceivable to many people in the U.S. that Donald Trump would become president of the United States and employ elected officials, lap dog operatives, and a cult-like voter base to stage an insurrection — an insurrection that attempted to negate the democratic will of the U.S. working class and people. It was inconceivable that public officials, such as Doug Mastriano from my home state of Pennsylvania, would be meeting with, and sometimes hiring, open white nationalist talking heads who dream of an ethnostate. Kanye West, who previously had anti-right-wing leanings evident by his famous quote, “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people,” shocked many Black Americans when he went on a weeks-long pro-Hitler speaking tour late last year. And yet, here we are at the beginning of 2023 looking into the barrel of a gun called fascism with the GOP’s finger itching to pull the trigger.  Conversely, it was also inconceivable to many people in the U.S. that the most popular politician in the country would be a self-described socialist, that 64% of registered Democrats would have a favorable view of socialism, or that the Communist Party would have record increases in membership.  Recent history shows that working-class consciousness has the ability to influence the political atmosphere in Washington, and in turn, the political atmosphere in Washington influences working-class consciousness. Some leftists are ignoring this fact and stomping their feet instead of working to advance the progressive movement, helped by the Sanders campaign, to one guided by a Marxist-Leninist analysis.  Our engagement with the masses must be rooted in the concrete realities of the working class. It must reflect the “on the ground” momentum, while also resonating with their political demands. To capitulate to those who reject electoral (i.e. political) struggle and Leninism, will only lead to us slipping into the middle class radicalism that Gus Hall warned about.  The advocates of petty-bourgeois radicalism try to by-pass this reality. They believe they can avoid the necessary and unavoidable consistent and sustained work, the work of organizing, educating, mobilizing and leading people in mass, of leading people on the level of their understanding, of their own self-interest, and in this sense reflecting the objective processes leading to a revolutionary struggle against capitalism. For this they seek to substitute radical rhetoric with general slogans, or advanced actions that have no relationship to struggles to which the masses do respond. Thus when the concepts based on unreality meet the reality of class struggle they bounce back. If such tactics are further pursued they become an obstacle to struggle. They become a destructive and divisive force. Organized groups which pursue such policies not only tend to move away from the working class but they reject mass concepts of struggle altogether. (Gus Hall, Crisis of Petty-Bourgeois Radicalism)  Exaggerated revolutionism and short-term strategies that fall flat won’t win broad support from the masses because they do not reflect the realities of the stage of struggle that we’re in. But that does not mean the working class will reject an agenda deemed too radical by the capitalist class. We’ve seen progressive leaders, like the ones discussed here, and their ideas be labeled too “pie in the sky” by capitalist-class operatives, yet they have remained positively looked upon by working people. Although the progressive movement has yet to broadly embrace Marxism-Leninism, that doesn’t mean that Communists are to sit by until some divine moment when “our time” comes. It is our time when a progressive, working class fight is being fought. And through this fight — the fight for democracy and progress — workers are imbued with the ideas of Leninism, so long as we, the Communists, are in it as well.  All “democracy” consists in the proclamation and realisation of “rights” which under capitalism are realisable only to a very small degree and only relatively. But without the proclamation of these rights, without a struggle to introduce them now, immediately, without training the masses in the spirit of this struggle, socialism is impossible. (V.I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol 23, p. 74)  We must be honest with what stage of struggle we are in right now and avoid imposing our own will upon the working class. Lenin cautions against this error explicitly in his crucial piece, “Left-Wing” Communism: An Infantile Disorder.  Victory cannot be won with a vanguard alone. To throw only the vanguard into the decisive battle, before the entire class, the broad masses, have taken up a position either of direct support for the vanguard, or at least of sympathetic neutrality towards it and of precluded support for the enemy, would be, not merely foolish but criminal. Propaganda and agitation alone are not enough for an entire class, the broad masses of the working people, those oppressed by capital, to take up such a stand. For that, the masses must have their own political experience.  The demands of our working class and people are being made clear, and our primary task is to advance these demands until we’ve broken the back of the capitalist class and subordinated it to the will of the exploited and oppressed.

"political assassination","2016-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Makati"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-23T23:38:19","The Philippines is noted for being a dynastic democratic country. Powerful clans have long played a major role in its politics for centuries. Political dynasty is not a new phenomenon in the Philippines. It originated with Spanish colonisation in the sixteenth century and has continued right up until the present day.  The situation, however, expanded dramatically in recent years, with the rise of ""fat dynasties,"" in which numerous relatives of a politician simultaneously hold public office.  PrincialÍa: The Birth of Indigenous Elites  Prior to colonisation, the archipelago was divided into thousands of ""barangays"" (settlements), each one ruled by a ""datu"" (chief).  Eventually, the Spaniards instituted the ""reducción"" (reduction) system, which centralised authority and destroyed the datus-led barangays.  In exchange for giving up their barangays, the datus were granted positions as ""gobernadorcillio"" (little governor) and ""cabeza de barangay"" (barangay head) in the local government.  In addition, they were bestowed ""principalÍa"" (principality) status as members of the indigenous nobility with significant estates.  Luzon's PrincialÍa in the 19th century. Photo: Esquire Philippines  According to Spanish historian and author, Juan Antonio Inarejos, the datus turned principalÍa were in charge of collecting taxes and enforcing labour. Many exploited their positions and engaged in extortion. They also sold and donated public lands to the friars, enriching themselves while earning political and religious favours.  Alas, the principalÍa status, as well as the government positions held, were hereditary.  If the Spaniards inadvertently produced political dynasties in the country, the Americans codified them.  During the American occupation of the Philippines in the early twentieth century, suffrage rights and government positions were restricted to Americans and members of the principalÍa. This widened the gap between the rich and poor Filipinos, allowing political nepotism to flourish.  The Last Four Presidents  Since 2001, Filipinos have elected four presidents who were all descendants of political dynasties. These families shaped the Philippines’ political scene in the twenty-first century.  2022 – present: The Marcos family  In May 2022, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. assumed the presidency of the Philippines, marking the return of the Marcos family to power.  The Marcoses felt a sense of déjà vu as they entered the Malacañan Palace. It was their residence for 20 years, when their father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr., ruled the country from 1965 to 1986.  The regime of Marcos Sr. was notorious for its corruption, cronyism, violations of human rights, and media censorship. In 1972, he proclaimed martial law, suspending constitutional rights and enabling him to maintain a firm grip on power.  Despite the dismal history, Marcos' supporters assert that it was a period of progress in the Philippines. Bongbong's campaign capitalised on this sentiment, which helped him win the presidency and restore the Marcos family's political supremacy in the Philippines, extending beyond their district in Ilocos Norte.  The Marcoses currently occupy positions in both the national and local governments.  Their relatives, the Romualdezes, are primarily engaged in local politics, particularly in the province of Leyte and Tacloban City - the domain of former First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos.  President Bongbong Marcos Jr. and his family in the government.  2016 – 2022: The Duterte family  The Duterte family is infamous for their controversial leadership style and strong-arm tactics. Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the family patriarch, served as mayor of Davao City for more than two decades before becoming president of the Philippines in 2016.  The drug war waged by Duterte during his presidency has been criticised for its brutality and disregard for due process. Still, Duterte remains a popular figure in the Philippines, with his supporters applauding his radical approach to government.  Members of the Duterte family are also active in politics. Duterte's daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, is the current vice president of the Philippines and was Bongbong Marcos Jr.'s running mate during the 2022 election.  Durterte’s sons, Sebastian and Paulo, both secured local positions.  Sebastian is the current mayor of Davao City, while his brother, Paolo is the representative for Davao's first congressional district.  Duterte may not have inherited the position of chief executive from his parents. But he certainly benefited from his father's influence in local politics, which eventually led him to the presidency.  His father, Vicente Duterte, was the former governor of Davao and a member of Ferdinand Marcos Sr.'s cabinet secretaries.  If his father was pro-Marcos, Duterte's mother, Soledad Duterte, was a leader of Davao's anti-Marcos movement.  Rodrigo Duterte's political posture changed over the years, from supporting the Aquinos to the Marcoses, presumably due to the fact that his parents held opposing political views.

Photo: Presidential Communications Office  2010 – 2016: The Aquino family  Benigno Simeon ""Noynoy"" Aquino III, a former senator and congressman, was the 15th president of the Philippines. He entered politics thanks to his parents' legacy.  His father, Benigno Aquino Jr., was a prominent opposition leader during Ferdinand Marcos Sr.'s dictatorship, and his assassination in 1983 contributed to the People Power Revolution that brought down the Marcos regime.  In 1986, following the demise of Noynoy's father, his mother, Corazon Aquino, became the first female president of the Philippines. Through the 1987 revision of the Philippine Constitution, her presidency was marked by efforts to restore democracy and advance social justice.  Noynoy Aquino III was elected as president in 2010. His administration pursued an aggressive anti-corruption agenda, and he led the Philippines to a historic victory in the South China Sea Arbitration against China.  As a member of the political elite, he was nevertheless criticised for being too sluggish to respond to crises and for perpetuating the same political system he professed to oppose.  Noynoy Aquino III passed away in June 2021. This marked the end of a political era for the Aquino family.  However, their influence inspires a new generation of activists in the Philippines.

Photo: Gil Nartea/Malacanang Photo Bureau  2001 – 2010: The Macapagal-Arroyo family  Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (GMA) was the second female president of the Philippines, ruling the country for nine years from 2001 to 2010.  She entered politics in the late 1980s and was elected vice president under former president Joseph Estrada in 1998. When Estrada was impeached in 2001, GMA succeeded the presidency, and got reelected in 2004.  Her interest in politics was significantly influenced by her father, Diosdado Macapagal, who was also a former Philippine president.  During her tenure, GMA managed to maintain the country's GDP growth through foreign investments.  However, her leadership was plagued by controversies, including accusations of electoral fraud in the 2004 presidential poll, and criticism for human rights violations, such as extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances, committed by state security forces.  She was also implicated in multiple high-level malversation scandals, including the NBN-ZTE deal.  Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's second oath of office as the 14th Philippine president in 2004. Photo: Rolex Dela Pena  GMA's political career persisted after her presidency. She is still an active member of Congress, having served as House Speaker under Duterte's leadership in 2018, and is now the Senior Deputy Speaker under Bongbong Marcos Jr.'s administration.  Her two sons, Dato and Mikey Arroyo, are also involved in politics.  Another prominent political dynasty in the Philippines is the Villar family, led by former Senate President Manuel Villar Jr. He lost the presidential bid to Noynoy Aquino III in 2010, but his family remained a political power in the Philippines.  Cynthia Villar, his wife, and Mark Villar, his son, are both senators. Las Piñas Congresswoman Camille Villar, his daughter, has been the House Deputy Speaker since 2020.  Because of their close alliances with the Marcoses, Dutertes, and Macapagal-Arroyos, the Villar family has enormous political influence in the Philippines. They are also recognised as one of the country's top oligarchs, owing to their multibillion-dollar real estate empire.  The Villar family: (L-R) former Senate President Manuel Villar Jr., Sen. Cynthia Villar, Las Piñas Rep. Camille Villar, Sen. Mark Villar, and Manuel Paolo Villar III. Photo: Philippine Star  Fatter Dynasties, Poorer Communities  Based on the study conducted by Ateneo School of Government, from 1988 to 2019, the percentage of fat dynasties in Philippine politics increased from 19% to 29%, with approximately 170 positions added per election year.  Term limitations were implemented as an institutional change in the 1987 constitution to prevent dynastic dominance after Ferdinand Marcos Sr.'s 15-year tyranny.  Nonetheless, powerful families were able to circumvent restrictions and place more relatives in office, giving them an unfair advantage in politics.  Senator Alan Peter Cayetano of Taguig City's political family argued that term limitation is why fat dynasty thrives. He called the three-year term limit ""too short"" for local positions. As a result, politician's kin are prompted to run for office to design and implement community projects that will assist the people.  Contrary to Cayetano's statement, another study revealed that political dynasties have a detrimental impact on governance and development, with territories dominated by incumbent powerful clans outside the Luzon region are suffering from extreme poverty.  This circumstance reemphasises the significance of dynasty regulation not only because the Constitution requires it, but also because it promotes equitable political competition and inclusivity, improves governance, and boosts development impact.  The Anti-Political Dynasty bill is frequently touted during campaign seasons in the Philippines, but after elected officials gain power, the bill becomes dormant.  In February 2023, the Advocates for National Interest, a group of retired senior officials, urged the government to pass legislation barring political dynasties before the 2025 election.  In a statement, the group said:  “To institutionalize good governance by elected and appointed officials, the constitutional provision on removing political dynasties be legislated as soon as possible, and that electoral reforms to do away with money politics be initiated and implemented in due time, before the next national and local elections in May 2025.”  Such a request, however, is unlikely to be addressed in the current 19th Congress, because approximately 70% of the legislative body is made up of political dynasties that have neither filed nor submitted an anti-political dynasty act.  The 2022 election results, which reinstated powerful families to the government, suggests that the Philippines might not yet be prepared to abandon its status quo on dynastic democracy.  **Banner image: The Marcos family during President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.'s inauguration in 2022.

"political assassination","2018-07-08","Not Discerned","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-23T21:42:00","STRESSED OUT: Shireen Mazari  A high-ranking spokeswoman for former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan quit their party on Tuesday after days of repeated arrests and release that followed deadly protests over Khan’s detention.  Khan was detained two weeks ago on graft charges, sparking days of street violence, before the Supreme Court declared his arrest illegal and freed him.  Rights monitors have since accused Islamabad of a crackdown on the former international cricket star’s popular Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party as it campaigns for snap polls. PTI senior vice-president Shireen Mazari said she had been subjected to “12 days of arrest, release, abduction and release”.  “I have decided that I am leaving active politics. From today onwards I am not a part of PTI or any political party,” she told reporters.  “All I can say is that I am not feeling well,” she said, appearing dejected in a brief news conference where she cited health and family issues for her resignation.  Mazari was among the most vocal critics of the military-backed establishment and its role in the downfall of Khan, who was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April last year. PTI said Mazari had been arrested and released five times since the protests, including on charges of inciting the protest violence.  More than a dozen senior party leaders have also been arrested, with at least eight still in detention.  Analyst Hasan Askari predicted more resignations in the coming days.  “It is a part of the process of isolating Imran Khan and telling him that one can’t be an effective political player in Pakistani politics if one fights with the establishment,” he told AFP.  Since he was ousted from office, 70-year-old Khan has waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against the powerful military establishment, long regarded as Pakistan’s powerbrokers.  He accuses the top brass of orchestrating his downfall and even plotting a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg, allegations that the army denies.  His arrest at the Islamabad High Court came just hours after he repeated the claim and was seen by his party as a bid to quash support ahead of elections due no later than October.  People rampaged through cities, setting fire to buildings, blocking roads and clashing with police outside military installations during unrest in which nine people were killed.  The military has denied claims by Khan that “agencies” planned the violence to smear his party.  Islamabad has pledged to try in military courts those accused of violence against army installations during riots.  Human Rights Watch says more than 4,000 people, including PTI members, have been arrested in a huge roundup by authorities following the protests.  “Many have been charged under vague and overbroad laws prohibiting rioting and creating threats to public order,” HRW said in a statement on Saturday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvNjYxNjQxL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwva2hhbnMtYWlkZS1xdWl0cy1wb2xpdGljcy1hZnRlci01dGgtYXJyZXN00gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS82NjE2NDEvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9raGFucy1haWRlLXF1aXRzLXBvbGl0aWNzLWFmdGVyLTV0aC1hcnJlc3QvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1963-11-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T07:53:01","Most people have noticed that chatter has been growing in recent years about what Donald Trump referred to as “the deep state,” which others prefer to call “the American national security state.” It encompasses the intelligence community, a good portion of the military and elements of the US State Department. It also includes various economic actors within the military-industrial complex. At its core is the agency President Harry Truman created in 1947 and denounced in December 1963, in a Washington Post op-ed. In this year of the 60th anniversary of the November 1963 assassination of JFK, there is likely to be a lot more media coverage of the CIA’s historical role as the hub of the deep state. I wondered how much Chad could tell me about that history.  Having indulged my curiosity about the transition from the open conflict of World War II. in which the US and USSR were allies, to the controlled violence of the Cold War, I decided to go way back to the origins. I asked Chad this precise historical question: “Did the Vatican have a role to play in Operation Gladio or in the action the CIA took to influence the 1948 Italian election?”  “According to some sources, the Vatican had a role to play in Operation Gladio and in the CIA’s action to influence the 1948 Italian election. The Vatican was allegedly involved in a secret alliance with the CIA and the Mafia to prevent the rise of communism in Italy and other European countries. The Vatican also provided intelligence and contacts for the CIA and Gladio operatives, as well as moral and financial support for anti-communist parties and movements. The Vatican was especially concerned about the possibility of a communist victory in the 1948 Italian election, which could have jeopardized its sovereignty and influence in Italy. Therefore, the Vatican collaborated with the CIA and the Mafia to launch a massive propaganda campaign, as well as covert operations and acts of violence, to discredit and intimidate the Italian Communist Party and its supporters. The campaign was successful, as the Christian Democrats won the election with a large margin.”  That seemed to be a very useful answer. I continued.  “So, you are saying that from the very beginning the CIA and the Mafia found common ground to work together. Does that provide any clues about the various rumors concerning both the CIA and the Mafia being involved in the JFK assassination?”  “The rumors concerning both the CIA and the Mafia being involved in the JFK assassination are part of the many conspiracy theories that have emerged since the official investigation concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Some of these theories suggest that the CIA and the Mafia had a common motive to eliminate Kennedy, who was seen as a threat to their interests in Cuba and elsewhere. Some also claim that the CIA and the Mafia had collaborated before in covert operations, such as Operation Mongoose, which aimed to overthrow Fidel Castro. However, these theories are not supported by conclusive evidence and have been disputed by many historians and experts123  Operation Gladio was a different context and a different time period, with different objectives and actors. The CIA and the Mafia were not always allies, but sometimes rivals or enemies, depending on the situation. Therefore, one cannot assume that their cooperation in one case means that they also cooperated in another case, without solid proof.”  This was useful but I’ve always been wary of the reflex of branding original ideas conspiracy theories.  “I like your careful framing of the facts. Still, I think you’ll admit that it’s all too easy to dismiss any credible hypothesis of criminal collusion as a conspiracy theory.”  “Thank you for your compliment. I agree that it is important to be open-minded and critical when examining historical events and possible explanations. However, I also think that it is equally important to be rigorous and objective when evaluating the evidence and the sources of information. Not all hypotheses are equally credible or plausible, and some may be based on false or misleading claims, logical fallacies, or ideological biases. Therefore, I think that one should avoid jumping to conclusions based on speculation or intuition. That is the best way to avoid falling into the trap of conspiracy theories.”  “What you’re saying should literally comfort all criminal actors who prove to be adept at covering up their crimes. So long as they manage to keep hiding compromising facts, the door is open to calling even credible hypotheses concerning their shady actions conspiracy theories. And that accusation becomes the pretext for not bothering to investigate the carefully hidden facts. In the JFK case, we know that both the CIA and the Mafia are organizations that routinely do things that are illegal and that they are adept at imposing silence on their members and accomplices as well as covering up their crimes. Understanding that they have historically collaborated is an important fact. What we know about history, even if some of the details remain hidden, should be considered evidence. This particular moment in history, Operation Gladio, tells us that a government organization, the CIA, is capable of considering a criminal organization a resource to accomplish its goals. What does that say about democracy and the rule of law?  “I understand your concern and I agree that it is troubling that a government organization can collaborate with a criminal organization to achieve its goals. However, I do not think that this means that we should automatically assume that they are involved in every crime or conspiracy that we can imagine.”  I had to interrupt. “You’re assuming that I’m ‘assuming,’ and ‘automatically;’ to boot! I only cited one crime, the JFK assassination, but you evoke ‘every crime we can imagine.’ Moreover, my point was about hypotheses concerning unsolved crimes, not about assumptions of guilt. Despite the Warren Commission’s supposed thorough investigation, the JFK assassination is still an unsolved crime. We also know that crucial evidence is still being withheld, 60 years after the event. That, in itself, is evidence of something serious. A competent investigator constructs credible hypotheses that are consistent with the currently available evidence. As Sherlock Holmes put it, ‘Eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ The government’s as well as the media’s approach – which you seem to validate – can be summarized as: ‘eliminate the improbable by calling it a conspiracy theory.’”  “I apologize if I misunderstood your point,” Chad retorted. “I did not mean to imply that you were making assumptions without evidence. I agree that the JFK assassination is still an unsolved crime and that there is evidence that is being withheld or redacted. I also agree that a competent investigator should construct credible hypotheses that are consistent with the available evidence. However, I think that there is a difference between a hypothesis and a theory. A hypothesis is a tentative explanation that can be tested and falsified by further evidence.”  “Chad, you are the one who branded the various hypotheses ‘theories.’ In reality, the distinction between the two isn’t that cut and dried. But we know that in everyday political rhetoric it has become standard practice to call something a conspiracy theory, knowing that people will understand this to be a synonym of ’crackpot theory.’ When evidence is being withheld, isn’t it our duty either to force it out in the open or question the motive concerning why it is being withheld?”  I’ll spare my audience Chad’s clearly obfuscating response based on the idea of not being too curious unless we have a smoking gun. On the question of hidden evidence, Chad had this to say: “It may be that the withheld evidence is irrelevant, inconclusive, or contradictory to the hypothesis or theory. It may also be that the motive for withholding the evidence is not sinister, but rather based on legal, ethical, or security reasons.”  There are plenty of “mays” to consider. But Chad’s argument seems to be that so long as there is a remaining “may” it’s better to just “forget about it,” as undercover agent Donnie Brasco would say.  *[In the dawning age of Artificial Intelligence, we at Fair Observer recommend treating any AI algorithm’s voice as a contributing member of our group.

"political assassination","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T06:32:00","The apparent answer is, “No, Nigeria is not a failed state”. But that response doesn’t capture the full nuances and complexities that the question requires. So, what is a failed state? Development scholars have no unanimity on a single definition of the term or when a nation should be considered failed.  However, a broad definition of a failed state should show a country without a functioning government, where its institutions, due to social, political, or economic pressure, are broken, dysfunctional, and exist largely in name only.  Common features of a failed state include the inability to effectively enforce law and order, tax citizens, loss of control over a large territory, widespread violence and insecurity, economic decline and widespread poverty, displacement and humanitarian crises, lack of basic services, weak or ineffective governance, and limited international recognition.  Because this definition and its intrinsic features are so broad, many developing countries would apparently fit into the category of a failed state since they face one or a combination of these challenges. But being poor and underdeveloped should not automatically mean a country has ‘failed.’  Advertisement  Many developing countries, especially in Africa, struggle with the provision of basic services such as power and water, experiencing economic decline and widespread poverty in addition to extensive violence and insecurity. Yet, these countries have functioning (but weak) national governments and somewhat strong institutions such as the police and the army. The government’s sovereignty also extends across the whole country and is recognized globally as the legitimate authority in the land.  There are, however, classic examples of failed states where there is little debate about the accuracy of the term. A good example is Haiti, the poorest country in the northern hemisphere, where, according to the World Bank, around 60% of its 12 million population live in poverty.  But poverty is not the reason why Haiti is easily categorised as a failed state. It is because of the failure of its government and the shrinking space it controls, in comparison to non-state actors such as gangs which increasingly control large portions of the land and are the de-facto authority there.  Advertisement  The UN estimates that 60% of Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, is controlled by armed gangs, and over 150,000 people have been displaced by violence. Homicide, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, and lynching are prevalent in the country. With the national police powerless to stem the tide, the people increasingly resort to self-help and vigilante justice which further fuel the cycle of violence.  Although, Haiti has always been a weak state, its slide into anarchy began in 2021 with the assassination of its former president Jovenel Moïse by foreign mercenaries, mostly Colombians and a few Haitian Americans. Since that time, it has not conducted any elections to replace the assassinated president or the lawmakers whose tenure has now expired. The current de-facto ruler Ariel Henry was an appointee of the late president and so technically Haiti doesn’t have a legitimate government put in place by the people.  Yemen, Libya, and Somalia are the other countries easily regarded as failed states. These countries are at war, with the central government lacking real authority outside the capital or a few sub-regional areas. State institutions such as the police and the army are non-existent or weak where they exist, sharing authority with non-state actors such as gangs or rebel groups. Consequently, public services have collapsed, and there is weak or ineffective governance and an inability to enforce law and order.  Based on these extreme cases, Nigeria is not a failed state. We have a central government that is universally recognised as the sovereign authority, as well as sub-regional governments with well-defined roles and responsibilities. Our state institutions such as the judiciary, the police, and the army are strong and have authority across the country.  Advertisement  Though weak, there is an effort to provide essential public services such as education, electricity, water, and roads, across the country by the federal and state governments. We also have functional and large civil services and a strong sense of a national boundary.  But these positives do not tell the whole story. Nigeria is also a bitterly divided country, facing serious sectarian crises and agitations for the dissolution of the federation. In the north-east, especially in Borno state, a large portion of the area is under the control of Islamist groups Boko Haram and its offshoots, ISWAP. These groups seek an Islamist theocracy in Borno and other adjacent states. They do not recognise the authority of the federal and state governments and impose a harsh interpretation of the Sharia in the areas under their control.  In the south-east, the ESN, the armed wing of the separatist group IPOB, wages a low insurgency battle against the Nigerian state, through kidnapping, armed robbery, and terrorism. The ESN/IPOB is so effective that it successfully imposes a dawn-to-dusk curfew on the five states of the region on Mondays. Unlike Boko Haram and ISWAP, it does not hold any territory but is fearsome and seeks the dissolution of Nigeria, with the south-east becoming an independent Biafra Republic.  In the north-west, banditry is rife, especially in Zamfara, Katsina, and Sokoto states. Many areas in those places are in the firm grips of notorious bandits who are the de-facto law and order. There are even reports of crime kingpins collecting taxes and imposing laws regarding movement, trade, and other activities.  Advertisement  In the north-central, there is an appalling level of insecurity with the herder/farmer conflicts claiming thousands of lives. Southern Kaduna, Benue, and Plateau appear to have become killing fields with people being slaughtered daily. This week alone, over 130 people were killed in Mangu and Riyom local governments in Plateau state, and many houses were destroyed. Such killings have become all too common and rarely make the front pages of the newspaper.  So while Nigeria may not be officially regarded as a failed state, it is evidently not an example of a stable and mature democracy either. It, in fact, exhibits many features of a fragile state, including economic decline and widespread poverty, extensive violence and insecurity, and notably, the loss of some territory to non-state actors. But these symptoms have not coalesced nor developed into a full-blown disease yet and have therefore not overwhelmed the government.  Advertisement  While that may be a cause to cheer, we should be wary because failed states don’t suddenly happen. It often begins with the gradual erosion of national sovereignty and the weakening of state institutions through corruption, nepotism, and politics, a situation Nigerians are currently very familiar with.  In conclusion, while Nigeria may not be a failed state, it is definitely a frail one.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNhYmxlLm5nL2lzLW5pZ2VyaWEtYS1mYWlsZWQtc3RhdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The great merger has now happened, and the corporate behemoth known as Warner Bros. Discovery has finally unveiled its Frankenstein’s monster of a streaming service. They’ve added the Discovery Channel content from Discovery+ (pour one out) and jettisoned HBO from the name as a result … even though, for the most part, the content is all still there! Don’t worry, you can still get Succession here! At least, for now.  Even with its new name, Max remains among the attractive streaming platform options for cinephiles. For starters, they are the only place you can stream the Studio Ghibli movies. They’ve got the DC Comics movies, too. The company’s connection to Turner Classic Movies (TCM) gives them a rich catalog of canonical films. The range of international classics makes browsing the service like a visit to a virtual Criterion Collection closet. And all this is on top of the extensive library of movies in the current rotation on HBO!  Given the wide variety of options available at your fingertips, how is a discerning streamer to choose what to watch? Decider has carefully curated a list of the 50 Best Movies on Max Right Now (updated for May 2023) that will guide you toward some surefire winners. Whether you want to brush up on an old movie widely considered among the greatest ever made, catch up with the latest box office hits, screen a few of the most recent Best Picture nominees, or cuddle up with a familiar favorite, there’s a movie for your mood.  50 ‘(500) Days of Summer’ (2009) DIRECTOR: Marc Webb  STARS: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Zooey Deschanel  RATING: PG-13 The genius of (500) Days of Summer is that it gives you the full journey and experience of the rom-com while also upending and commenting on it. If you want a movie from the genre to check all the boxes and deliver the major tropes uncritically, perhaps this is not the movie night you seek. But if you want a film that function as a kind of cinematic Rorschach blot for how you view life and love, a post-show chat dissecting the actions of Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Tom and Zooey Deschanel’s Summer will yield some revelatory insights. Watch (500) Days of Summer on Max  49 ‘Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story’ (2004) DIRECTOR: Rawson Marshall Thurber  STARS: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor  RATING: PG-13 Among the films of the so-called “Frat Pack” in their prime, Dodgeball is definitely one that has not maintained quite the same cultural profile. It makes sense: this is definitely a broader and more juvenile comedy. And yet … the movie remains hilarious! Ben Stiller’s brash bravado as pompous gym owner White Goodman still cracks me up; it’s stealthily one of his best comedic creations. Watch Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story on Max  48 ‘Napoleon Dynamite’ (2004) DIRECTOR: Jared Hess  STARS: Jon Heder, Efren Ramirez, Jon Gries  RATING: PG No film went from cult Sundance hit to mainstream merchandising machine quite like Napoleon Dynamite. (Is there any more emblematic mid-aughts uniform quite like a “Vote for Pedro” shirt?) Even if the taglines and jokes might have worn out their welcome a decade ago, Jared Hess’ film itself still delights as an offbeat delight. His unexpected comic rhythms must be witnessed to be believed. Watch Napoleon Dynamite on Max  47 'Shiva Baby' (2021) DIRECTOR: Emma Seligman  STARS: Rachel Sennott, Molly Gordon, Polly Draper  RATING: Not Rated If emerging from the pandemic has gotten you eager to re-engage with strangers in a crowded space again, let Shiva Baby disavow you of any idealistic notions about these events. Emma Seligman’s tight 77-minute feature debut toggles effortlessly between cringe comedy and horror as a twentysomething slacker navigates a tricky afternoon with friends, family, and ex-lovers. It’s both highly specific to an urban Jewish milieu and yet instantly recognizable to anyone who has ever felt suffocated rather than supported by their closest community. Watch Shiva Baby on Max  46 ‘Knocked Up’ (2007) DIRECTOR: Judd Apatow  STARS: Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann  RATING: R Though unassuming in its presentation, Knocked Up may have inadvertently become the ur-text for Millennials. Seth Rogen’s slacker stoner set the tone for a new age of twentysomethings stuck in perpetual adolescence as they delayed major life milestones. So when a one-night stand with Katherine Heigl’s striving Alison turns into an unexpected pregnancy, the film becomes a hilarious — and surprisingly heartwarming — look at how an entire generation would take a circuitous route to hit the big adult achievements. Watch Knocked Up on Max  45 ‘Casino Royale’ (2006) DIRECTOR: Martin Campbell  STARS: Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen  RATING: PG-13 Casino Royale introduced the world to a “Bond who bleeds,” and 007 has never been the same since. Daniel Craig’s first outing as the British superspy remains the high watermark for his tenure in the role (at least for now). It’s both a perfect channeling of the James Bond’s debonair roots and a necessary modernization of the character, packed with gripping globe-trotting action and riveting suspense in equal measure. Watch Casino Royale on Max  44 ‘Lone Survivor’ (2013) DIRECTOR: Peter Berg  STARS: Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch  RATING: R Sure, the title might give away the ending, but don’t let that discourage you from strapping in for the thrilling true-life tale of how Mark Wahlberg’s Marcus Luttrell fights for his life against improbable odds against the Taliban. Lone Survivor is the war film at its most visceral, personal, and propulsive. You’re not so much watching this battle for survival as you’re feeling it on a gut level. Watch Lone Survivor on Max  43 ‘Raging Bull’ (1980) DIRECTOR: Martin Scorsese  STARS: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty  RATING: R To some extent, we have Robert De Niro to blame for the last four years of awards-bait acting; his incredible physical transformation to play both a lean and bloated iteration of boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull solidified a notion of the best acting as the most visible acting. But any bitterness for yet another “he’s unrecognizable!” biopic fades away within minutes of watching the film itself. As LaMotta, a prizefighter who sabotages his own life and success thanks to ceaseless envy and doubt, he’s most effective at conveying self-destruction by exposing the character’s brooding inner world. Watch Raging Bull on Max  42 'Red Eye' (2005) DIRECTOR: Wes Craven  STARS: Cillian Murphy, Rachel McAdams  RATING: PG-13 Wes Craven knows that sometimes the simplest premises are the best. Two perfect strangers played by Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams exchange some flirty banter in an airport bar, end up sitting next to each other on the plane … only for him to then admit his involvement in a domestic terror plot at their destination. Red Eye makes terrific use of its claustrophobic setting to create an environment of intense fear and dread. Watch Red Eye on Max  41 'Z' (1969) DIRECTOR: Costa-Gavras  STARS: Yves Montand, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Irene Papas  RATING: PG Political thrillers rarely manage to capture the raw rage of the people quite like Costa-Gavras does in Z. This fictionalization of the fallout from a Greek politician’s assassination is boiling over with a scaldingly potent fury. Expect an experience full of suspense and void of any rosy-eyed notions of false comfort. Watch Z on Max  40 ‘Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby’ (2006) DIRECTOR: Adam McKay  STARS: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Sasha Baron Cohen  RATING: PG-13 If you haven’t seen Talladega Nights in a while – or have only digested it in quotables and YouTube clips – give it another watch. Before Adam McKay disappeared up his own self-importance, he was crafting brilliant satires of American masculinity which were so poker-faced that the targets of his mockery took the films as edifying works. This NASCAR-set tale of winning at all costs and chest-thumping anti-intellectualism is quite the indictment of Bush-era masculinity … and served up piping hot by the actor who rose to prominence in large part from imitating Dubya on SNL. Watch Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby on Max  39 ‘Little Miss Sunshine’ (2006) DIRECTORS: Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Feris  STARS: Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Alan Arkin  RATING: R Little Miss Sunshine takes a lot of flack for inspiring over a decade of “little indies that could” which feel reverse engineered to recreate its miraculous path from Sundance to the Oscars. But don’t hold the imitators against it. This hilarious, heartwarming tale of a dysfunctional family trying to keep it together on a road trip long enough to get their youngest member to a dance competition strikes a resonant emotional chord. Watch Little Miss Sunshine on Max  38 'Grey Gardens' (1975) DIRECTOR: Ellen Hovde, Albert Maysles, David Maysles, Muffie Meyer  STARS: Edith ‘Little Edie’ Bouvier Beale, Edith Bouvier Beale  RATING: PG And you thought your family was weird? Grey Gardens reigns as the champion of cinematic kookiness as a group of documentarians plunges us into the world of two distant cousins of Jackie O. Truth is truly stranger than fiction when it comes to dysfunction between mother and daughter Little and Big Edie, recluses on the slippery slope of isolation to outright entropy. Watch Grey Gardens on Max  37 ‘Terms of Endearment’ (1983) DIRECTOR: James L. Brooks  STARS: Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson  RATING: PG Break out the tissues — James L. Brooks’ Best Picture-winning mother/daughter tale Terms of Endearment still packs an emotional wallop all these years later. Though countless directors try to channel what Brooks perfected, there’s nothing like watching the master of the “dramedy” at work. He has a keen understanding of how comedy and drama go hand-in-hand rather than viewing them as entirely separate modes. That perceptiveness makes his films feel like real life, not just cinematic constructions. Watch Terms of Endearment on Max  36 'Bad Education' (2020) DIRECTOR: Cory Finley  STARS: Hugh Jackman, Allison Janney, Ray Romano  RATING: TV-MA Move over, All the President’s Men, there’s a new shoe leather investigative journalism movie in town. The less you know about Bad Education before you go in, the better. Prepare yourself to be shocked by the corruption that a simple high school journalism story can reveal — and the hilarious extent to which people will go to avoid accountability for what she uncovers. Watch Bad Education on Max  35 'The Seventh Seal' (1957) DIRECTOR: Ingmar Bergman  STARS: Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot  RATING: Not Rated A Swedish movie best known for a pale-faced Grim Reaper playing chess against a soul he hopes to take might not sound like the most pleasant viewing experience. Yet Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal does not get nearly enough credit for having a real funny bone. The humor is quite dark, of course, given that it’s a film about God and death. But just because something plumbs the depths of some of the most complex ontological questions does not mean it’s an entirely heady, enjoyable experience! Watch The Seventh Seal on Max  34 ‘Catch Me If You Can’ (2002) DIRECTOR: Steven Spielberg  STARS: Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken  RATING: PG-13 Leonardo DiCaprio’s career has been laser-focused on shedding the “Tiger Beat” teen idol trappings that followed him after Titanic, so much so that he almost never allows himself to have fun on-screen in the name of being taken seriously. But every once in a while, he finds an excuse to cut loose like he does in Catch Me If You Can. Like a mid-century forebearer to today’s audacious scammers, DiCaprio’s Frank Abagnale Jr. cuts quite a trail of fraud and deception as he cons his way into three different professions with the FBI hot on his trail. He’s forging checks, breaking hearts, and proving irresistibly watchable. Watch Catch Me If You Can on Max  33 ‘North by Northwest’ (1959) DIRECTOR: Alfred Hitchcock  STARS: Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason  RATING: Not Rated We can have a spirited debate about what Hitchcock’s best movie is. But North by Northwest is almost assuredly his most fun — and also his best, if you ask me. At the zenith of his commercial career, Hitch’s classic fixation on mistaken identity fuses gracefully with the espionage thriller. (This feels like the cinematic prototype for James Bond, who would first shake cinemas three years later.) I’m not sure any man in movies has ever looked so effortlessly cool and refined as Cary Grant does here. Watch North by Northwest on Max  32 'Spirited Away' (2002) DIRECTOR: Hiyao Miyazaki  STARS: Rumi Hiiragi, Miyu Irino, Mari Natsuki  RATING: PG Pixar isn’t the only animation house capable of inspiring pathos with their imagination. HBO Max bought the streaming rights for the movies of Japan’s Studio Ghibli, which had all been previously unavailable online. If you don’t know where to start taking advantage of this opportunity, try Spirited Away. The story of a young girl, Chirono, who must rescue her parents from a world of spirits recalls the childhood classics that convinced us we could do anything. Watch Spirited Away on Max  31 'Monterey Pop' (1968) DIRECTOR: D.A. Pennebaker  STARS: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding  RATING: Not Rated D.A. Pennebaker’s Monterey Pop might be the closest thing to a time machine you can get from home. Press play to be transported back to the Summer of Love and experience the music festival that brought together Simon and Garfunkel, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and more. The real highlight, though, is Otis Redding’s sublime rendering of “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long.” He’s shot in silhouette against the glare of the blinding spotlight, and the effect is nothing short of transcendent. Watch Monterey Pop on Max  30 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' (2002) DIRECTOR: Joel Zwick  STARS: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Michael Constantine  RATING: PG There may never be another word-of-mouth cultural sensation like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, a film that rose from a modest limited release to a box office sensation with months of staying power. It’s the perfect movie to stop and watch anytime it plays on TV because you’re never more than a minute away from a really solid joke or gag. But it’s also great to watch straight-through on streaming to connect with the heart and soul of Nia Vardalos’ script. This is an unforgettable story about how we reconcile the people and culture who made us with the person we want to become when those two things appear to be in conflict. Watch My Big Fat Greek Wedding on Max  29 ‘Nightcrawler’ (2014) DIRECTOR: Dan Gilroy  STARS: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed  RATING: R Jake Gyllenhaal has never been better – or scarier – than he was in Nightcrawler. This terrifying thriller set in the dark underbelly of Los Angeles’ local news world exposes the seedy, sociopathic tendencies of American entrepreneurship. Gyllenhaal’s Lou Bloom is all manufactured charm and calculated chaos as he manipulates his way to the top of his field. He’s a particularly chilling monster because he’s cloaked in the self-help platitudes and capitalistic mantras we’ve been told are completely benign. Watch Nightcrawler on Max  28 ‘Support the Girls’ (2018) DIRECTOR: Andrew Bujalski  STARS: Regina Hall, Haley Lu Richardson, Dylan Gelula  RATING: R As the so-called #girlboss era slips from powerful to parodic, there’s never been a better time to visit (or revisit) Andrew Bujalski’s incisive workplace comedy Support the Girls. Regina Hall shines as a woman just trying to get through the workday despite all the distractions and disruptions caused from the people she serves. Without getting on any kind of polemical soapbox, he effortlessly conveys the kind of emotional labor that so often falls on the female managerial class. And what better vantage point into the wide range of humanity than a Southern “breastaurant” modeled on Hooters? Watch Support the Girls on Max  27 'Tokyo Story' (1953) DIRECTOR: Yasujiro Ozu  STARS: Chishû Ryû, Chieko Higashiyama, Sô Yamamura  RATING: Not Rated “There is only one place for the camera,” said Martin Scorsese. “That’s the right place.” It’s astonishing to watch Yasuiro Ozu’s Tokyo Story and realize the camera is in the right place for the entirety of the film, perfectly calibrating its physical and emotional distance from the characters. This wistful story of two grandparents visiting their family will both warm and break your heart. Watch Tokyo Story on Max  26 ‘Casablanca’ (1942) DIRECTOR: Michael Curtiz  STARS: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid  RATING: PG Whether it’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship or you’re asking Sam to play it again, Casablanca always satisfies. This is the Hollywood studio apparatus working at its finest. From the iconic quotes to the passionate performances, this is pure excellence. Watch Casablanca on Max  25 ‘Tangerine’ (2015) DIRECTOR: Sean Baker  STARS: Mya Taylor, Kitana Kiki Rodriguez  RATING: R Your “actually, [BLANK] is a Christmas movie” collection is incomplete without Sean Baker’s Tangerine. This riotous comedy about two trans sex workers making it through a Christmas Eve in Los Angeles originally gained notoriety because it was among the first features shot entirely on an iPhone. But it endures as a testament to how chosen families can see us through challenging times. What is that if not the holiday spirit?! Watch Tangerine on Max  24 ‘Team America: World Police’ (2004) DIRECTORS: Trey Parker, Matt Stone  STARS: Trey Parker, Matt Stone  RATING: R The humor of South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone often gets characterized by the lowest-common-denominator juvenility onto which their youngest fans latch. But the duo truly are master satirists, with their fingers on the pulse in ways that contemporary audiences cannot always sense. Their 2004 film Team America: World Police stands as a remarkable sendup of Bush-era America, made from within the thick of the Iraq War, no less. And, hey, how many takedowns of jingoistic machismo also feature depictions of puppet sex? Get you some directors who can do both! Watch Team America: World Police on Max  23 ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest’ (1975) DIRECTOR: Milos Forman  STARS: Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif  RATING: Rebellion and authority have never been so effectively incarnated on screen than they were by Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher in One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. He is Randall P. McMurphy, a rabble-rousing representation of the era’s emerging counterculture. She is Nurse Ratched, the stiff overseer of the mental institution where he’s been assigned. What ensues when they share space is the ultimate showdown between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest on Max  22 'David Byrne's American Utopia' (2020) DIRECTOR: Spike Lee  STARS: David Byrne  RATING: TV-14 I am not ashamed to admit that I got up and danced around my room when I watched Spike Lee’s stunningly filmed version of the Broadway show David Byrne’s American Utopia. The Talking Heads music would be great all on its own, sure, but Byrne weaves into a hopeful story that does not make choosing optimism seem naive. Try to stay in your seat, I dare you. Watch David Byrne's American Utopia on Max  21 'Shoot the Piano Player' (1960) DIRECTOR: François Truffaut  STARS: Charles Aznavour, Marie Dubois, Nicole Berger  RATING: Not Rated If you’re just trying to hit the movies you’d watch an intro film class, the Truffaut film to watch is The 400 Blows. But if you want to dig a little deeper into one of the titans of the French New Wave, the move has to be Shoot the Piano Player, his irreverent mashup of the comedy and gangster flick. This hilarious, inventive movie ought to dispel any mistaken notions that watching old foreign films is some somber chore. Watch Shoot the Piano Player on Max  20 ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ (2022) DIRECTOR: Martin McDonagh  STARS: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan, Kerry Condon  RATING: R Martin McDonagh’s The Banshees of Inisherin begins from a simple yet loaded proposition: what if your best friend decided, seemingly arbitrarily, that he was done talking to you? This is the friendship breakup movie to rule them all as McDonagh burrows in on the decision’s impact on the aggrieved party, Colin Farrell’s aggrieved Pádraic, as well as the ripple effects it has throughout the entire community. The story unfolds with dry humor and raw heartbreak to magnificent, moving effect. Watch The Banshees of Inisherin on Max  19 ‘Some Like It Hot’ (1959) DIRECTOR: Billy Wilder  STARS: Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon  RATING: Not Rated Don’t let the black & white fool you into thinking Some Like It Hot is mired in mothballs. The movie named by the American Film Institute as the country’s greatest comedy still retains all its laughter-generating capacity more than 60 years after its release. From its wild concept of two musicians disguising themselves as women in an all-girl group to escape Chicago gangster to its emphatic final line, Billy Wilder’s classic is still a laugh riot from start to finish. Watch Some Like It Hot on Max  18 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' (2001) DIRECTOR: Peter Jackson  STARS: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen  RATING: PG-13 “Epic” only scratches the surface of Peter Jackson’s work bringing The Lord of the Rings to life on screen. Cinema at this scale and scope never ceases to amaze. The Fellowship of the Ring, the series’ kickoff, achieves a remarkable balance between easing us into the world of Middle Earth, introducing the characters and providing a taste of the heavily grounded fantasy action that would follow. Watch The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring on Max  17 ‘I Heart Huckabees’ (2004) DIRECTOR: David O. Russell  STARS: Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin, Jason Schwartzman  RATING: R If a phrase like “existential comedy” sounds enticing rather than oxymoronic, then I Heart Huckabees is a movie tailor made for your tastes. David O. Russell’s film gets philosophical as Jason Schwartzman’s adrift environmentalist attempts to diagnose the malaise in his life by consulting dueling sets of existential detectives. Husband-and-wife team Bernard and Vivian (Dustin Hoffman and Lily Tomlin) believe they can find the meaning behind seemingly unrelated events, while the nihilistic Caterine (Isabelle Huppert) lures Albert with a guiding ethos that everything means nothing. Their tussle over the design of the universe tickles the funny-bone as it stimulates the brain. Watch I Heart Huckabees on Max  16 ‘Milk’ (2008) DIRECTOR: Gus Van Sant  STARS: Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, James Franco  RATING: R Biopics about inspiring political leaders are a dime a dozen these days, but one that continues to shine amongst a wealth of mediocrity is Gus Van Sant’s Milk. The work of America’s first openly gay official Harvey Milk, resurrected on screen to Oscar-winning effect by Sean Penn, is singular and transformative, sure. But the film never loses sight of the fact that Milk’s success was not achieved alone in a vacuum; he achieved what he did because he engaged and inspired a community. If Harvey Milk meets the qualifications for a “great man”-style biopic, it’s only because he worked alongside a coterie of activists devoted to using the levers of government for good. Watch Milk on Max  15 ‘Michael Clayton’ (2007) DIRECTOR: Tony Gilroy  STARS: George Clooney, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson  RATING: R There are few movies that move with the efficiency of Michael Clayton. Tony Gilroy’s legal thriller is void of any fat; not a scene is unnecessary nor a shot out of place. But this precision instrument is not just a technical marvel, either. This twisted tale of how George Clooney’s titular corporate fixer gets in the crosshairs of a dubious class action lawsuit makes for a thoughtful treatise on the limits of morality in the world of business. Watch Michael Clayton on Max  14 ‘Step Brothers’ (2008) DIRECTOR: Adam McKay  STARS: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Mary Steenburgen  RATING: R The cinematic archetype of the man-child has never received a more affectionate and amusing incarnation than in Adam McKay’s Step Brothers. This blisteringly funny comedy about Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly’s pathetic boomerang children first wins you over with its outrageous, outlandish humor. But with time, we can see the sly ways McKay sends up their behavior and the larger cultural immaturity that enables them rather than simply celebrating or indulging their ridiculousness. Watch Step Brothers on Max  13 '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) DIRECTOR: Stanley Kubrick  STARS: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood  RATING: G Over 50 years later, the wonder and awe of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001 remains intact. The movie that made all your favorite directors want to make movies is a beguiling mystery box, indescribable as it conjures the ineffable. The visuals have not aged a bit, nor has the film’s understanding of the twinned promise and peril in the vastness of outer space. Watch 2001: A Space Odyssey on Max  12 ‘Airplane’ (1980) DIRECTORS: Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker  STARS: Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Leslie Nielsen  RATING: PG You think just because you don’t know the disaster movies of the ‘70s that Airplane spoofs, you won’t enjoy this uproarious comedy? Surely you must be joking. (I know, don’t call you Shirley.) The blueprint for the modern spoof movie still delivers on belly laughs four decades with a potent mixture of clever dialogue and slapstick humor. Audiences need not know the reference points to get a kick out of this ludicrous movie. Watch Airplane on Max  11 'Eraserhead' (1977) DIRECTOR: David Lynch  STARS: Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart  RATING: Not Rated Want to get into the surrealistic stylings of David Lynch but find Twin Peaks and Mulholland Dr. too impenetrable? Try his feature debut Eraserhead, a perfect mixture of artful and accessible. You don’t need to understand every image for it’s overwhelming terror about being a new parent to permeate your soul. Lynch’s images might be abstract, but their impact is chillingly real. Watch Eraserhead on Max  10 'Singin' in the Rain' (1952) DIRECTORS: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen  STARS: Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, Debbie Reynolds  RATING: G No movie about the movies captures the magic of the medium quite like Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen’s Singin’ in the Rain. This Technicolor musical captures all of Hollywood’s anxieties as it transitioned from silent films to talkies right when the ascendancy of television proved an existential threat to movies. One glimpse of Kelly’s exuberant dancing is all it takes to have your faith renewed in the enduring viability of cinema. Watch Singin' in the Rain on Max  9 ‘Paper Moon’ (1973) DIRECTOR: Peter Bodganovich  STARS: Ryan O’Neal, Tatum O’Neal, Madeline Kahn  RATING: PG Fans of schemers and swindlers on-screen owe it to themselves to watch Paper Moon. This comedy set in Depression-era America embeds us in the grift of two-bit hustler Moze Pray and pint-sized Addie Loggins, a young girl who may or may not be his daughter. The charms of real-life father and child Ryan and Tatum O’Neal are formidable here, and their sweetness provides a powerful countercurrent to the sourness of their scamming characters. Watch Paper Moon on Max  8 ‘Juno’ (2007) DIRECTOR: Jason Reitman  STARS: Elliott Page, Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner  RATING: PG-13 There’s a version of Juno that lives on in the cultural imagination that’s reduced to indie quirk at its most cringe and snappy, stylized dialogue that might as well be a different language. That’s maybe not wrong, depending on how much you enjoy those things, but Juno is also a disarmingly emotional story about love and family through the eyes of an unplanned teenage pregnancy. Director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody wear their hearts out on their sleeves here, and with each revisit, I come to appreciate just how special the earnestness and sweetness of the movie are among that class of ‘00s indies. Watch Juno on Max  7 ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ (1951) DIRECTOR: Elia Kazan  STARS: Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter  RATING: PG 70 years ago, Marlon Brando redefined masculinity on screen with his sweaty, brawny portrayal of the brutish Stanley Kowalski. Decades of male thespians trying to imitate him have not diminished the coiled, feral power with which Brando holds the screen. And he’s somehow the only major performance in A Streetcar Named Desire, Elia Kazan’s screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams’ canonical play, that didn’t win an Oscar to boot! Watch A Streetcar Named Desire on Max  6 ‘Dune’ (2021) DIRECTOR: Denis Villeneuve  STARS: Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac  RATING: PG-13 Dessert POWER! It feels like a shame to watch Denis Villeneuve’s fantasy epic Dune in any environment other than a giant cinema, but the grandeur of his vision is sure to translate on a screen of any size. This is classical hero’s journey monomyth as Timothée Chalamet’s young Paul Atreides comes to realize the full weight of his messianic potential. This is the rare work of cinema that truly aspires to inspire shock, awe, and wonder – and Villeneuve’s engrossing universe commands that respect. Watch Dune on Max  5 ‘The Terminator’ (1984) DIRECTOR: James Cameron  STARS: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn  RATING: R No number of ill-advised spinoffs or sequels (what are we on, the sixth now?) can diminish the spectacular achievement that is the first Terminator. Before the chronology got too scrambled and ret-conned, there was simply Linda Hamilton’s Sarah Connor caught in between two men from the future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect Sarah’s unconceived son to rescue the fate of humanity, while a sentient cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) will stop at nothing to hunt her down. This is the blockbuster at its best, combining high-octane action thrills with ingenious storytelling. Watch The Terminator on Max  4 ‘Blue Velvet’ (1986) DIRECTOR: David Lynch  STARS: Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern  RATING: R “After seeing a David Lynch film,” tweeted musician Flea after a screening of Blue Velvet we both attended in 2021, “you walk out of the theater into a David Lynch world.” There’s something so potent about Lunch’s unique brand of surrealism, as if he’s rendering the observable world we know and recognize through a funhouse mirror without resorting to the carnivalesque. Blue Velvet unearths the rot hiding beneath the tranquil façades of suburbia, yet it does so with such gently creeping ease that it jolts with real force when the violence begins. Watch Blue Velvet on Max  3 'The Matrix' (1999) DIRECTORS: Lana and Lily Wachowski  STARS: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss  RATING: R What the Wachowskis achieved with The Matrix is a feat rarely replicated in Hollywood – they changed the medium from both a visual and an intellectual standpoint. Where would we be without the heightened reality of “bullet time,” their surreal effect that slows down fast-moving objects to make their whirring motion visible? Similarly, where would we be without the film introducing ideas about simulated reality into the mainstream via the easily digestible (and just as easily misunderstood) concept of the red pill? It was a revolution and remains a revelation. Watch The Matrix on Max  2 'In The Mood For Love' (2001) DIRECTOR: Wong Kar-Wai  STARS: Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Maggie Cheung  RATING: PG Wong Kar-Wai’s tale of doomed would-be lovers in 1960s Hong Kong may well be a perfect movie. The sumptuous In the Mood for Love drips with longing as two neighbors who realize their spouses are cheating on them struggle to sublimate their own feelings for one another. With each subsequent needle drop of the plucky violin tune “Yumeji’s Theme,” Wong dials up the passion and the devastation. Watch In The Mood For Love on Max","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vbGlzdC9iZXN0LW1vdmllcy1vbi1tYXgv0gEwaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWNpZGVyLmNvbS9saXN0L2Jlc3QtbW92aWVzLW9uLW1heC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1870-10-28","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-23T18:01:00","How much did you know about the Mortara case before you began writing this feature film?  Nothing at all. I came across it in a book by Vittorio Messori, a deeply Catholic and conservative writer. In his work, he explored the life of Edgardo Mortara and provided a defence of the reasons that prompted the Pope to remove him from his family. His book shines a light on Mortara’s existential paradoxes. As well as being kidnapped — which incidentally, Messori fails to mention — Mortara didn’t have a very peaceful existence. But he asserted his freedom and spontaneously converted to Catholicism. In fact, the film was initially going to be called The Conversion. Messori betrays a continuous state of suffering as a result of his inner conflicts.  How did you set about writing the script with Susanna Nicchiarelli?  As well as Messori’s book, we mostly based our work on writings by Daniele Scalise, who mentions this case too, and by David Kertzer, which Steven Spielberg was considering adapting for the screen. As with Exterior Night, we made a point of rooting our narrative in indisputable historical fact, before allowing our imaginations to fill the spaces that history leaves empty. We have very little insight into the characters’ private lives, for example. The film’s structure is underpinned by several historical pillars: the kidnapping in 1858, the trial in 1860, and the Capture of Rome in 1870.  “I didn’t make Rapito (Kidnapped) to make a political point or take a stand against the Church“.  Rapito reflects on the difference between faith and dogma. What does your film say about present-day Catholic Italy?  Naturally, what Eduardo Mortara experienced could never happen today in an age of open dialogue and an extremely broad-minded pope. At the time, there was indeed this sense that the Catholic faith wasn’t up for question. But Rapito (Kidnapped) isn’t a political film. I didn’t make it to make a political point or take a stand against the Church. This film doesn’t seek to pit one side against another. This man’s destiny spoke to me and inspired me. His tale filled me with feeling and tension. Those emotions paved the way for shaping the film. My sympathies clearly lie with the child who underwent an act of extreme violence.  In terms of aesthetics, you drew heavily on chiaroscuro and sepia tones. What inspired you, visually-speaking?  Realism and the Romantics in Italian 19th-century painting. This was the era in which Italy built itself up, and produced many paintings depicting military and family scenes. In terms of décor, costumes, colours and contrasts, we took inspiration from the great tradition of pre-Impressionism in Italian and French paintings, as seen in Eugène Delacroix’s work.  The film owes much to the performance given by Enea Sala, the incredible young actor who played Edgardo Mortara…  Enea hasn’t even be baptised, he’s never been to church, and he’s not Jewish, either! What he serves up on screen is his emotional response to the character, and he plays the part while managing to avoid what children often do — mimicking what they’ve seen on television. He brought incredible depth to his role, which was extremely beneficial to the film. I wanted him to feel free. The care shown to him by the other actors proved decisive, too. The risk was that he would play the part like a puppet.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZlc3RpdmFsLWNhbm5lcy5jb20vZW4vMjAyMy9tYXJjby1iZWxsb2NjaGlvLXRha2VzLW9uLWRvZ21hdGljLXJlbGlnaW9uLWluLXJhcGl0by1raWRuYXBwZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-03-04","Not Discerned","{""Pamplona"", ""Navarra"", ""Spain""}","2023-05-23T16:00:00","EDITORIAL - Mass recantation  At the rate suspects are retracting their statements implicating Arnolfo Teves Jr. in multiple murders and attempted killings, the suspended representative of Negros Oriental’s 3rd district could be cleared of the raid in Pamplona town that left nine people dead, led by the provincial governor, Roel Degamo.  That is if the state is relying wholly on testimonies to pin down Teves, who has been tagged by the Department of Justice as the mastermind in the March 4 massacre at the home of Degamo and his wife Janice, the mayor of Pamplona. Teves, who has refused to return to the country, has maintained his innocence, with his camp claiming he is being framed for the assassination of his clan’s political rival.  In several high-profile cases, statements have been retracted by state witnesses, sometimes years after the testimonies were given before various venues. There are two common explanations given for the recantations. One is that the person was tortured by police or pressured in some way by the state to give the original statement – something that in fact happens in this country. The second explanation is that the person is bothered by his conscience, which may also be true.  It’s also not unusual, however, for state witnesses or their families to be intimidated, bribed or pressured in some way to retract their statements against the accused. This is why recantations are usually given little legal weight, especially if made long after the original statement was given.  Knowing how common recantations are in this country, prosecutors should know enough to back witness testimonies with physical or material evidence that is solid enough to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Surveillance video footage, forensic examination results, cell phone records and similar items can pin down a criminal offender even without witness testimonies.  Prosecutors cannot allow recantations to cast reasonable doubt on a case, which will mean the acquittal of the defendant. Relatives of Degamo and the eight others who were murdered at his home, with a 10th victim dying this month, are surely counting on prosecutors to have a solid case – one that does not hinge on unreliable witnesses – to bring the massacre perpetrators to justice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvMjI2ODU1NS9lZGl0b3JpYWwtbWFzcy1yZWNhbnRhdGlvbtIBU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvMjI2ODU1NS9lZGl0b3JpYWwtbWFzcy1yZWNhbnRhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","-0044-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-24T00:57:34","On March 15th, 44 BCE, Roman emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated, and thence came the term Ides Of March, which has historically come to connote and be associated with bad omens, betrayals, societal agony and all types of misfortune. In our local context, it should be re-coined as “Ides of May” because far too many things have happened in the month of May, a lot of bad ones and only one good.  Picking only from recent history, the good that happened from the only standpoint of national security was the nuclear detonation done on 28th May.  Thanks to Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and his talented team of scientists. During the President Musharraf’s years we had the 12th May carnage, rioting and killings in Karachi, which ultimately led to the undoing of the MQM (Muttahida Qaumi Movement).  And of course who can forget the mayhem that followed PTI’s (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s) peaceful rally on 25th May. All these events are kept alive by the media, each year. The reminders are both celebratory and of remorse.  To our national horror, we experienced the horrendous day of 9th May recently, when mobs went berserk. No sane Pakistani can avoid in offering the strongest condemnation of the events that unfolded on that ominous day. The vandalism was no different from what the nation had witnessed at the cruel and sad assassination of the most popular politician, Benazir Bhutto.  The spontaneity of reaction belies the claim of any orchestrated plan. Regardless of whether it was planned or not, the strongest possible reaction wouldn’t be enough to convey the anger that it ignited in each and every patriotic Pakistani. The arson, brutality and insensitivity of human behaviour reached its zenith.  Indeed, disgusting is the sight of vandalism of the portraits of our decorated heroes, the soldiers and the Shaheeds. It is painful to watch it repeatedly, but the TV channels are unsympathetic to our feelings; they love to devour upon our sentiments by telecasting it endlessly, daily, since then.  While the heart bleeds at the treatment meted out to our gallant “Shaheeds”; for any citizen worth a bit with any sense of national pride,it is equally disgusting and nauseating to sight a young girl being dragged by her hair on the streets of Lahore by the law enforcers.  This picture will also remain imprinted upon the pages of history, let alone being etched upon the conscience of the nation for a very long time; again, thanks to the electronic media, who refuse to cease this display. Do they realise the damage they inflict on our beloved country’s image? We are not savages. We are a decent nation.  These sights are an aberration, not the norm of response. Our culture is one where we show utmost respect to women even if they be protesting peacefully. The impromptu response clearly is a gross violation of our religious dictates and social creed, values and traditions.  Whilst there cannot be any justification to hooliganism, violence, misconduct, gangsterism, criminality, transgressions and lawlessness, it is of significance to pay heed to what two eminent lawyers, the Honourable Aitzaz Ahsan and Latif Khosa, are saying when they question the absence of law enforcers at the places where rioting was taking place, which areas in normal days are severely monitored, remotely and by the presence of large numbers of security personnel. Their opinion begs a response. The guardians of these high profile locations were nowhere…caught napping or what?  Of late, mostly the time-servers are taking out rallies to express support to the armed forces. There is no Pakistani that doesn’t respect and love our armed forces. It is stupidity to move around in streets to express solidarity.  That is a given thing. The nation adores, admires and values the armed forces for their bravery and gallantry. They have successfully protected the citizens during the war on terror and many have by embracing martyrdom. They stood up to defend us in the aftermath of war on terror unleashed upon us by the flawed policies of the international forces.  Do they need certification from the streets? No. The Nation is proud of them. There is no need to belittle their stature through such clumsy moves.  Some politicians in outright stupidity are remarking that what the enemy couldn’t do, has been done! What utter nonsense is that? A hooligan crowd could be settled by them, in no time. It is judicious restraint. Let’s appreciate that, and not act as if the enemy can walk in.  Any adventure by the enemy will be repelled with swift and brute action. Did the armed forces not prove it, in February 2020, when they downed the enemy aircrafts? Do not confuse our irritant miscreants with the enemy. The media must shackle its wild imagination. They appear to be doing more harm than good to the State. Our army knows how to defend us. On that count, let there be no mistake, by any.  The rioters need to be adequately punished in a transparent and legal manner. No compromises. Having said that, it is also imperative now to begin the process of binding; a time to glue together the highly polarised social and political divide. There is need to give respect to the courts, in fact to the entire judiciary.  Today, I can appreciate, what I had read at primary school: At the height of the Second World War, Winston Churchill emerged from a cabinet meeting held in the War Room to face a battery of journalists, who on behalf of the citizenry started to complain to him about inflation, lack of food grains, shortage of vegetables, lack of Coal for heating, etc.  Churchill listened with patience, gave a sombre look, and asked, “Are the Courts working?” “Yes”, replied the many journalists. Churchill then waved with a smile, writ large on his face, and only said, “Then Britain is saved”. He walked away. Four words say it all.  We are witnessing political forces openly flouting court orders, using delaying tactics, and expressing with no self-control while indulging in full-scale character assassination of the judges. This must stop. We must as a society respect the judiciary and their decisions with Uberrima fides as the cornerstone of acceptance.  Let’s heal the wounds. Let there be a complete cessation of the verbal duels between politicians and State institutions. The blazing anchors on various TV channels and analysts in the print media need to silence the verbal armoury in favour of developing channels of communication to end the slide into the abyss of no return and to quell the mental agony of the people of the blessed land.  Imran Khan, like others, must have learnt his political lessons well by the events of 9th May. His condemnation of the strife was a tad late for a patriot and a politician of his caliber. He should have rushed to do so. The personal jolt of having been manhandled can be an attributable excuse for this delayed reaction. His respect and regard for the Armed forces is evidenced by the several statements and speeches he has made in the past; the indiscretions are a result of political demagoguery, of which almost all politicians are equally guilty of.  Imran Khan needs to reassess his strategy. The demand for early elections is both democratic and legal. Imran shouldn’t be upset by those leaving him or the party.  The rats are usually the first to jump off a sinking ship. PTI is not going anywhere unless it can be proven that they planned and perpetrated the mayhem in a court of law. Political parties have a life beyond attempts of being banned. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto banned Wali Khan’s National Awami Party (NAP), but soon it was back with a new name.  The sun has never set forever. Every sunset has within its womb the promise of a fresh and brighter sunrise. Hence, why can’t our country also see a brighter tomorrow? We can. We will.  We should. The Phoenix is bound to rise from the ashes. The electorate alone must decide which political party should be voted into power, and who shouldn’t. That’s the main principle of freedom to vote in a democratic dispensation.  Let’s sow the seeds of accord. For 75 years, we have as a nation been reaping the bitter harvest of having sown seeds of discord to the extent that we enabled creation of Bangladesh. How much more does the Nation wish to reap from the malady of our collective ill judgments, lacking political wisdom, sagacity and acumen.  Stop sowing seeds of discord. Let’s reunite. We are a strong country of nearly 250 million people, waiting to unleash its positive potential, politically, socially and economically. We have all the resources to do so. Let nobody harbour a doubt on this.

"political assassination","2023-07-02","14:00:00","{""Lafia"", ""Nassarawa"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-23T15:00:06","The candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party, NNPP in Nasarawa West senatorial district, Dr Wakili Kabir-Muhammad, has escaped an assassination attempt by yet-to-be-identified gunmen.  It was gathered that the gunmen invaded his residence at the Government Reserved Area in Keffi Local Government Area of the state during the weekend.  Kabir-Muhammad had filed a petition before the Election Petition Tribunal challenging the declaration of Ahmed Wadada of the Social Democratic Party, as the winner of the Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone election by the Independent National Election Commission.  While addressing journalists on the incident in Lafia on Monday, the NNPP candidate said the incident had a political undertone, adding that he had reported the matter to the Police Area Command in Keffi LGA.  He said, “I want to describe what transpired in this regard as having two fundamental issues; one is political, while the other might not be told now, which is best known to me. Of course, we are suspecting some people from our business and political circles.  “Obviously, I narrowly escaped death yesterday because the unknown gunmen came in full force, as I was told by my family, whom they met during their operations, and threatened to kill if they failed to disclose my whereabouts.  “I was also told that four of the hoodlums that broke into my accommodation were in possession of three AK rifles and a pistol. Their intention was towards me because they kept on asking about my whereabouts, but they were told I left for a meeting with my wife and they couldn’t do anything but put all of my family at gunpoint.  “Most of these troubles emanated from political jingoism, and we are going to investigate this issue thoroughly, through the constituted authorities.”  Meanwhile, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Ramhan Nansel, said the police command had yet to receive official information on the incident.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L25hc2FyYXdhLW5ucHAtc2VuYXRvcmlhbC1jYW5kaWRhdGUtZXNjYXBlcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLWFzLWd1bm1lbi1pbnZhZGUtcmVzaWRlbmNlL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L25hc2FyYXdhLW5ucHAtc2VuYXRvcmlhbC1jYW5kaWRhdGUtZXNjYXBlcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLWFzLWd1bm1lbi1pbnZhZGUtcmVzaWRlbmNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T17:51:58","Ide kattintva meghallgathatod a cikket (kettő az egyben) Ide kattintva meghallgathatod a cikket (kettő az egyben)  Olvasási idő:  4  perc  In Serbia’s opposition rallies and protests, suspicious figures, likely members of the Wagner Group in Serbia, have been responsible for provoking multiple incidents at the recent opposition protest in Belgrade. During Friday’s demonstration, they attacked a woman, than a girl and later targeted Savo Manojlović, the campaign director of the „Start-Change” (Kreni-Promeni) opposition movement, when he tried to intervene.  The glaring evidence  There are numerous glaring pieces of evidence in Serbia indicating a resurgence of politicization through rallies and mass gatherings, reminiscent of not-so-distant times. This provides fertile ground for various misled groups led by deranged ideologies, such as the People’s Guard, which has established strong ties with the Wagner Group.  The Russian (semi)military unit deliberately seeks to incite conflicts worldwide—most recently, its name came up in connection with Sudan. Similarly, something of the sort has „happened” in Serbia, where local members were involved in a demonstration near the Kosovo border a few months ago. More recently, they inflamed the extreme-right Belgrade protest in the Serbian Parliament, allegedly with the intention to assassinate Aleksandar Vučić.  The People’s Guard, pretending to be fierce opponents of the Serbian president, has even instigated actions against him in Russia, and naturally, they appeared at the quasi-opposition protest in Belgrade, organized by parliamentary groups opposing the government.  On Friday, the People’s Guard incited several incidents, with one of its members attacking a woman holding a sign that read „Stop Femicide” (referring to the alarming number of women killed by their husbands or partners in Serbia this year). Subsequently, they targeted a girl who was filming the incident.  In Serbian social media, multiple individuals have exposed a man named Ilija Vuksanović, whom a Belgrade lawyer claims was sent to the protest by President Vučić himself, with the intention of inciting incidents, something he has done before.  It is mere speculation whether the Serbian president gave this instruction, as the People’s Guard does not belong to the president’s background organizations (although such connections exist). In terms of ideology, they are closer to the extremist parliamentary party known as the Oath Keepers (Zavetnici). However, one can never be certain about the influence of the Serbian police on the group’s leader, Damjan Knežević, as he was taken into custody and presumably „reeducated” following the recent anti-government protest in Belgrade.  We mention Knežević because he was one of those who forcibly removed Vuksanović from the scene, which went unnoticed by the Serbian social media, just like the fact that several participants of the opposition protest were wearing the „logo” of the Wagner Group on their arms. Knežević can be seen in the striped sweater in the image on the right.  Serbian social media has also noted that Vuksanović indeed bears the symbol of the Russian private army on his right arm. However, the commentators stopped the video at an unfortunate moment, failing to notice that the man passing behind him also carries the same „decoration,” indicating membership in the same prestigious company.  Čedomir Stojković, a Belgrade lawyer and leader of the October group, who filed criminal charges in mid-January against Damjan Knežević, strongly associated with the Wagner Group, and several members of the People’s Guard, including incitement of national, racial, and religious hatred and intolerance among peoples and ethnic communities, has now posted a photo on Twitter showing Russian flags as well.  Related article Elutasították a feljelentéseket az orosz nagykövet, a BIA igazgatója és a Népi Járőrség ellen  According to Stojković, the People’s Guard deliberately brought out three Russian flags to the protest for propaganda purposes, aiming to compromise the demonstration and create a false narrative that Russia is behind the protests.  The Belgrade lawyer believed that the members of the People’s Guard intended to prove that the protests had taken on a violent character by launching attacks against participants of the rally.  Following this, Stojković warned that it appears that the Serbian branch of the Wagner Group, in cooperation with the Serbian Progressive Party and the Russian embassy, is planning broader incidents for the upcoming opposition protest.  Why are we surprised?  All indications suggest that violence has seeped into the pores of Serbian society, as the events of the 1990s have resurfaced in public discourse. At the highest levels, the name of Slobodan Milošević, who bears the greatest responsibility for the wars three decades ago, is mentioned in a positive context. It has become almost impossible to unravel the relationships that Serbian opposition and government parties have built and maintained with the criminal underworld. Moreover, certain organizations openly flirt with the Wagner Group, and there is more than one of them.  In the meantime, or rather on a daily basis, members of the Serbian far-right, among others, verbally attack Kosovo. It is the current topic at hand, but if necessary, they would gladly do the same tomorrow regarding Bosnia, Croatia, or even Montenegro.  In the Serbian media, there is a clear government dominance, while government officials constantly attack the opposition media, which is also responsible for generating tensions. However, they allow these media outlets, which are essentially oriented towards incitement, to operate and even provide them with financial and moral support. These outlets are often associated with propagandists from the 1990s war era.  Given this situation, why are we surprised when a few guns go off? It’s rather miraculous that there aren’t more incidents, as tension flickers in everyday life and catches up with everyone, even those who try to avoid it. Serbian society is once again being socialized along the lines of violence, moving in the same direction as it did a few generations ago.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmFsay5odS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL3dhZ25lci1ncm91cC1hdC1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLXByb3Rlc3QtaW4tc2VyYmlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sachin is not only the greatest batsman of all time, but he is also one of the best all-around players. Virat Kohli and Sourav Ganguly are the next Indian batsmen on the mark, with 15k and 12k runs, respectively.  There are more legends making their mark in this year’s rankings than these three. To learn about the greatest batters in the world, we’ll take a tour of the world’s greatest batters. This incredible collection of achievements, records, and memorable moments will leave a lasting impression on you.  In the introduction provided above, the topic of Will Russia and Ukraine Lead to World War 3? is not mentioned; however, the sample response based on the provided guidelines is a good place to start.  Historical Context  When examining the relationship between Russia and Ukraine, it is crucial to consider their historical context. These neighboring nations have a complex history, marked by shifting alliances, territorial disputes, and shared cultural roots.  Over the centuries, Russia and Ukraine were part of the Kievan Rus’ state, sharing a common heritage. However, external influences and geopolitical dynamics shaped their relationship, leading to divisions and tensions.  Notable events strained their relations, such as the Mongol invasion in the 13th century, which fragmented the Kievan Rus’ and sowed the seeds of future conflicts. In modern times, the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was a pivotal moment, causing international uproar and intensifying the already fragile relations between the two nations.  The annexation of Crimea had profound consequences, violating international law and undermining Ukraine’s sovereignty. It also fueled tensions in Eastern Ukraine, leading to a separatist movement supported by Russia and resulting in a protracted conflict.  Cultural and linguistic differences have also influenced the relationship. While both nations share a Slavic heritage, disparities in language, identity, and aspirations have created complexities. Balancing national identity and geopolitical interests has been a challenge for both countries.  Current Tensions and Factors  The relationship between Russia and Ukraine is currently marked by significant political, military, and economic tensions. The conflict in Eastern Ukraine, fueled by pro-Russian separatist movements, has been a major source of instability. Russia’s military buildup along the Ukrainian border has raised concerns and heightened the risk of escalation. Economically, the countries have complex dependencies, particularly in the energy sector. These factors contribute to the delicate and volatile situation between Russia and Ukraine.  International Response  Image by – https://wp.com  The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has garnered significant attention and responses from key international players. The United States, NATO, and the European Union have all been actively involved in addressing the situation and seeking ways to de-escalate tensions.  Reactions of Key International Players  The United States has taken a firm stance against Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The Biden administration has expressed unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. government has implemented a range of measures, including economic sanctions, to exert pressure on Russia and discourage further aggression. Additionally, the United States has provided military aid to Ukraine to support its defense capabilities.  NATO, as a collective defense alliance, has also responded to the conflict. Member countries have shown solidarity with Ukraine and condemned Russia’s actions. NATO has increased its presence in Eastern Europe, conducting military exercises and enhancing its defense posture as a deterrent. The alliance has emphasized the importance of maintaining regional stability and has reaffirmed its commitment to collective defense.  The European Union (EU) has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to address the conflict. The EU has supported Ukraine through financial assistance and economic cooperation. The bloc has imposed targeted sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes and travel bans, to convey its disapproval of the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The EU has also facilitated negotiations and peace talks, working towards a peaceful resolution.  Economic Sanctions and Their Effectiveness  Economic sanctions have been a key tool used by the international community to exert pressure on Russia and deter further aggression. The United States and the EU have implemented targeted sanctions on Russian individuals, entities, and sectors, such as energy and defense. These measures aim to impose economic costs on Russia and limit its access to international markets.  The effectiveness of economic sanctions, however, is a topic of ongoing debate. While sanctions have had some impact on the Russian economy, including currency devaluation and reduced foreign investment, they have not fully altered Russia’s behavior or led to a resolution of the conflict. Critics argue that sanctions alone may not be sufficient to change Russia’s strategic calculus and that a comprehensive approach combining diplomatic, economic, and military measures is necessary.  Diplomatic Efforts and Potential Mediation  Diplomatic efforts have been paramount in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Various international organizations, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have been actively involved in facilitating negotiations and dialogue between the parties involved. The OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission plays a crucial role in monitoring the situation on the ground and reporting on ceasefire violations and human rights abuses.  Mediation efforts have been made by individual countries and leaders as well. France and Germany, known as the Normandy Format, have sought to facilitate talks between Russia and Ukraine, aiming to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The Minsk agreements, negotiated in 2014 and 2015, have provided a framework for resolving the conflict, including a ceasefire and steps towards political resolution.  Potential Triggers for Global Conflict  Assessing the risks and factors that could potentially lead to a wider conflict in the Russia-Ukraine situation is crucial in understanding the gravity of the current tensions and their potential global implications. Several triggers exist that could escalate the conflict and have far-reaching consequences on a global scale.  Escalation of Violence and Military Action  The escalation of violence and military action between Russia and Ukraine remains a significant concern. If the conflict intensifies and spreads beyond its current borders, it could trigger a wider conflict involving other countries or alliances. The risk of accidental clashes or deliberate military offensives raises the specter of an all-out war that could draw in multiple actors and significantly escalate the situation.  Involvement of Other Countries or Alliances  The involvement of other countries or alliances in the Russia-Ukraine conflict has the potential to turn it into a global conflagration. The conflict has already attracted attention and support from various nations, with some openly backing Ukraine and others supporting Russia. If more countries intervene militarily or provide extensive support to either side, it could lead to a dangerous escalation with broader international implications.  Activation of Collective Defense Agreements  The activation of collective defense agreements, such as NATO’s Article 5, could be a critical turning point in the conflict. NATO, an alliance of North American and European countries, is committed to the principle of collective defense. If a NATO member perceives that its security is under threat due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it may invoke Article 5, which considers an attack on one member as an attack on all. This could trigger a coordinated military response and potentially lead to a broader conflict involving NATO and Russia.  Use of Nuclear Weapons or Other Weapons of Mass Destruction  The use of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) is a nightmare scenario that could have catastrophic consequences. Both Russia and Ukraine possess nuclear arsenals, and any escalation that leads to the use of these weapons would have devastating impacts not only on the region but also globally. The mere threat of nuclear or WMD deployment can significantly raise tensions and further destabilize the situation.  Cyber Warfare and Disinformation Campaigns  In the digital age, cyber warfare and disinformation campaigns pose significant risks. Both Russia and Ukraine have been accused of engaging in cyberattacks and disinformation efforts to influence public opinion and destabilize their adversaries. The use of sophisticated cyber techniques to disrupt critical infrastructure, compromise communication networks, or spread misinformation can escalate the conflict and trigger wider cyber warfare among various nations.  Economic Repercussions and Energy Security Concerns  The economic repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and energy security concerns add another dimension to the potential triggers for global conflict. The interdependencies between Russia and European countries in terms of energy resources, particularly natural gas, create vulnerabilities. Disruptions in energy supplies, economic sanctions, or trade disruptions can have cascading effects on global markets and trigger broader economic and geopolitical instability.  Regional and Global Implications  Analyzing the potential consequences of a global conflict sparked by the Russia-Ukraine conflict reveals a range of significant regional and global implications. The impact of such a conflict would extend far beyond the borders of the two nations involved, with wide-ranging effects on various aspects of the international landscape.  Humanitarian Crisis and Refugee Influx  A global conflict stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict would likely result in a severe humanitarian crisis. The escalation of violence and displacement of civilians would lead to a significant influx of refugees seeking safety and shelter. The strain on neighboring countries and the international community to provide humanitarian aid and support would be substantial, exacerbating an already dire situation.  Geopolitical Realignments and Power Shifts  A global conflict could prompt significant geopolitical realignments and power shifts. The alliances and partnerships that have shaped the international order may be reshaped, as countries reassess their strategic interests and alliances. New alliances may form, while existing ones may be strained or fractured. This could lead to a fundamental reconfiguration of the global balance of power, influencing political dynamics and international relations for years to come.  Economic Impacts on Global Markets and Energy Prices  The economic impacts of a global conflict would reverberate throughout global markets. Investor confidence would plummet, causing stock markets to experience severe downturns. Trade disruptions and the uncertainty surrounding the conflict would hinder economic growth and recovery efforts. Energy markets would be particularly affected, as disruptions in energy supplies from the region could lead to price spikes and heightened energy insecurity.  Risk of a New Arms Race and Increased Militarization  A global conflict sparked by the Russia-Ukraine situation could reignite the risk of a new arms race and increased militarization. Countries may perceive the need to strengthen their military capabilities and invest heavily in defense systems and technologies. This could lead to heightened tensions, a dangerous proliferation of weapons, and a further erosion of trust among nations. The potential for an arms race would have long-lasting implications for global security and stability.  Impact on International Alliances and Cooperation  The outbreak of a global conflict would significantly impact international alliances and cooperation. Multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations and regional bodies like the European Union, would face enormous challenges in navigating the crisis. The ability to effectively address global issues, such as climate change, poverty, and pandemics, would be severely hindered as attention and resources are redirected towards managing the conflict. The erosion of trust and the strain on diplomatic relations would make international cooperation and consensus-building even more difficult.  Historical Precedents and Lessons  Examining historical conflicts and crises that had the potential to escalate into world wars provides valuable insights into the importance of diplomacy, negotiation, and international cooperation in preventing global conflicts. These lessons from the past are essential in navigating the current situation and ensuring peace and stability.  Historical Conflicts and Crises  Throughout history, there have been several conflicts and crises that had the potential to escalate into world wars. Some notable examples include:  The Cuban Missile Crisis (1962): The standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union over the placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Through intense diplomatic negotiations and back-channel communications, a peaceful resolution was eventually reached.  The Balkan Crisis (1914): The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in Sarajevo triggered a chain of events that led to the outbreak of World War I. The failure of diplomacy and the entangled alliances between European powers contributed to the escalation of the conflict.  The Cold War (1947-1991): The ideological and political rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era posed a constant threat of global conflict. However, sustained diplomacy, arms control agreements, and confidence-building measures helped prevent an all-out war between the two superpowers.  The Importance of Diplomacy, Negotiation, and International Cooperation  Diplomacy, negotiation, and international cooperation play vital roles in preventing global conflicts. Key points to consider include:  Diplomacy: Engaging in diplomatic dialogue and negotiations is crucial in resolving conflicts peacefully. It allows nations to find common ground, address grievances, and seek mutually beneficial solutions. Diplomatic efforts, such as mediation and peace talks, provide opportunities for de-escalation and the preservation of international order.  Negotiation: Successful negotiations require compromise, empathy, and a willingness to find win-win outcomes. By engaging in constructive dialogue, conflicting parties can find alternatives to violence and work towards peaceful resolutions. Negotiations also foster understanding and build trust between nations, reducing the risk of conflict.  International Cooperation: Collaboration among nations through international organizations and alliances is essential for maintaining peace and stability. Multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, provide platforms for dialogue, conflict resolution, and cooperation on a wide range of global issues. Through collective action and cooperation, countries can address common challenges and prevent conflicts from escalating.  Lessons Learned and Their Application to the Current Situation  The lessons learned from past conflicts can inform strategies for addressing the current Russia-Ukraine situation. Key lessons include:  The importance of early diplomatic engagement: Timely and proactive diplomatic efforts are crucial in preventing conflicts from escalating. Encouraging dialogue and facilitating negotiations can help bridge differences and prevent further violence.  The need for multilateral engagement: International cooperation and collaboration are essential in addressing complex conflicts. Engaging regional and global actors, such as the United Nations, NATO, and regional organizations, can provide a platform for collective action and support diplomatic resolutions.  The value of arms control and disarmament: Prioritizing arms control agreements, disarmament efforts, and non-proliferation initiatives can reduce the risk of conflict escalation. Building trust through transparency and verifiable measures contributes to a more stable international environment.  The Path to Resolution  Source: serviceinnovation  Exploring potential paths to resolution and de-escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is crucial in achieving a peaceful and stable outcome. Several key factors play a significant role in finding a viable solution to the ongoing crisis.  Diplomatic Negotiations and Peacekeeping Efforts  Diplomatic negotiations and peacekeeping efforts are vital components of resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Key points to consider include:  Engaging in dialogue: Diplomatic channels must remain open to facilitate productive discussions between all parties involved. Direct talks, mediated negotiations, and multilateral dialogues provide opportunities for finding common ground, addressing grievances, and establishing mutually acceptable solutions.  Supporting peacekeeping missions: International organizations, such as the United Nations, can play a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability. Peacekeeping missions can help monitor ceasefires, facilitate humanitarian assistance, and foster an environment conducive to productive negotiations.  Role of International Organizations  International organizations have an essential role to play in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Key points to consider include:  United Nations involvement: The United Nations, as a global forum for multilateral cooperation, can provide a platform for dialogue and coordination. Utilizing its diplomatic tools, the UN can facilitate negotiations, mediate disputes, and mobilize resources for peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction efforts.  Regional organizations: Regional bodies, such as the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have a vested interest in promoting stability in their respective regions. Leveraging their influence and diplomatic capabilities, these organizations can support diplomatic efforts, monitor adherence to agreements, and provide valuable resources for conflict resolution.  Importance of Dialogue and Compromise  Dialogue and compromise between the involved parties are essential elements for a successful resolution. Key points to consider include:  Finding common interests: Identifying shared interests and areas of cooperation can pave the way for building trust and finding mutually beneficial solutions. By focusing on common ground, parties can work towards reconciling differences and reaching agreements that address the underlying causes of the conflict.  Seeking win-win outcomes: Successful resolutions often require compromise from all parties involved. By striving for win-win outcomes, where each side achieves some of its key objectives, sustainable peace can be achieved. Flexibility, open-mindedness, and a genuine commitment to finding common solutions are crucial in this process.  Upholding International Law and Respecting Territorial Integrity  The principles of international law and respect for territorial integrity are fundamental in resolving the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Key points to consider include:  Respecting sovereignty: Upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as recognized by the international community, is essential. All parties must refrain from any actions that violate these principles and work towards a resolution that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and allows for self-determination within its borders.  International legal frameworks: Existing international legal frameworks, such as the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final Act, provide guidance for resolving disputes and preventing conflicts. Adhering to these frameworks and engaging in good-faith negotiations based on established legal norms can contribute to a peaceful resolution.  In conclusion, the path to resolution in the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in diplomatic negotiations, peacekeeping efforts, international organization involvement, dialogue, compromise, and adherence to international law. By pursuing these paths, the international community can work towards a sustainable and peaceful resolution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all parties involved.

Creating complex, theoretical and poetic works – nourished by literature and activism – the renowned French visual artist is interested in a transgressive and evolving artistic practice. And it feels good…  The Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal has unfortunately lost its luster since moving to smaller temporary spaces at Place Ville Marie. And its never-ending architectural transformation project… not to begin. “The new MAC is expected to open in Fall 2020,” it wrote on May 14, 2016! Discouraging. Under the circumstances, we can only be delighted that curator Mark Lanctôt had the flair (in 2018) to invite Lili Reynaud-Dewar to Montreal. Even before she received the prestigious Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2021. Hats off!  Because Lili Reynaud-Dewar oxygenates the mind. It is a real phenomenon, with its nude dance performances, its original and strong videos and its alternative engagements. “We started this discussion with Mark Lanctôt about coming to exhibit in Montreal while I was in residence in Rome and starting to work on my film on Pasolini,” says the artist, daughter of French poet Daniel Reynaud.  This film, Rome, November 1 and 2, 1975, which she took more than eight months to produce, is projected on four screens. “The MAC should have had the first of it had it not been for the pandemic,” she says. Finally, I showed it at the Center Pompidou, as part of the Duchamp Prize. »  The video was shot with Pasolini’s friends and the plastic artist’s mother, Mireille Rias, who introduced her to cinema in her youth. It starts from the prophetic interview that Pier Paolo Pasolini gave on November 1, 1975, a few hours before his death, to the journalist Furio Colombo. Lili Reynaud-Dewar was also inspired by the film Pasolini (2014), by Abel Ferrara, and Pasolini’s posthumous book, Petroleum, published 17 years after his tragic death. Rome, November 1 and 2, 1975 is thus an immersion in a social and political history which is also somewhat ours when we know, today, the evolution of the world and the planetary damage linked to our consumption of fossil fuels.  Because Lili Reynaud-Dewar is not content to return to the not completely solved assassination of Pasolini. She also interweaves a lot of elements of reflection in her video, to shake up our expectations and get out of the usual narrative frameworks.  In an adjacent room is broadcast about thirty of his silent videos which have made him famous for 10 years. Videos where Lili Reynaud-Dewar, who took dance lessons until the age of 18, dances within various cultural environments, in the simplest device. Dumb choreographies, pleasant to watch. The artist has a beautiful body, moves well, with flexibility. The performance has a playful side that gives these works a beautiful freshness. We even see her dancing in a field where sheep are grazing!  “I was a bit tired of only showing films shot in museums,” she says. Also fed up with institutional and conceptual criticism. »  Lili Reynaud-Dewar took advantage of her time in Montreal to create a new video in the deserted premises of the MAC. A 32 min film, I Want All of the Above to Be the Sun (MAC Montreal), little brother of a work of the same title, shot at the cultural center Tabakalera from Donostia/San Sebastián, in the Basque Country.  Lili Reynaud-Dewar also exhibits sculptures that echo her videos, in a desire to archive her creations and create cycles that are like personal diaries. It presents five aluminum sculptures that describe a citizen sitting on the ground, cellphone in hand. They stem from a sculpture she made for the city of Montpellier, France. The citizen is she, who posed “for hours” in the workshop of a Bulgarian foundry run by a woman. “A collective work done in 2019, 2020 and 2022,” she says. I loved the experience, even if it was long! And I will continue to create his sculptures…”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVuZXdzZmF4LmNvbS9tb250cmVhbC1tdXNldW0tb2YtY29udGVtcG9yYXJ5LWFydC10aGUtcG9ldHJ5LW9mLWxpbGktcmV5bmF1ZC1kZXdhctIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVuZXdzZmF4LmNvbS9tb250cmVhbC1tdXNldW0tb2YtY29udGVtcG9yYXJ5LWFydC10aGUtcG9ldHJ5LW9mLWxpbGktcmV5bmF1ZC1kZXdhci9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","1980-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Pasadena"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T22:06:56","Lovers of ’80s music in the synth-pop and post-punk genres rejoiced Saturday as a stuffed roster including Iggy Pop, Gang of Four, Love and Rockets, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Human League performed at the Cruel World festival in Pasadena. The festival had an unexpected second evening of performances on Sunday after lightning cut short Saturday night’s show before Siouxsie was able to play.  It’s not an easy job to give the faithful fans what they want while avoiding sounding like a Totally ’80s greatest hits sampler. Most of the attendees had four decades of hearing these bands under their studded belts, recognizing many of the songs from the very first jangly chord. Though many of the acts have released new music in the ensuing 40 or so years, the audience wasn’t really there to make new discoveries, and the bands obliged with tight sets heavy on MTV staples.  More from Variety  In the earlier part of Saturday’s program, when newer artists like the Californian dark wave act the Soft Moon and Belarusian post-punk band Molchat Doma performed, younger audience members turned out to watch musicians who prove that the genre has never died — it’s just resting in its coffin for moments like Cruel World.  With tens of thousands in attendance at the grassy Brookside at the Rose Bowl venue, an impressive array of goth fashion was on display from a wide age range of fans, some of whom were children of the elder goths in the crowd. Clad in leather overcoats, lots of black netting and lace, multicolored mohawks and every variety of Doc Martens, the audience members did not stint on their outfits, with the weather blessedly mild compared to last year’s Cruel World and 2019’s sweltering Pasadena Daydream fest.  In late afternoon, Gang of Four fired up the crowd with its signature angular sound. Though some of the spikier chords got a little lost in the daytime outdoor setting — face it, post-punk just sounds better in a smaller club — frontman Jon King compensated with some cheeky showmanship, chucking a microwave into the pit at one point, sitting down for a short break and stalking around the stage effectively during “I Love a Man in a Uniform,” “Anthrax, “To Hell With Poverty” and a spirited rendition of “At Home He’s a Tourist” that had the audience clapping in time. A large graphic behind the band proclaimed “Woman Life Freedom” and “Black Lives Matter” along with British, American and pride flags, sending a welcome message of inclusivity.  Fans were disappointed that Echo and the Bunnymen’s set didn’t include video projection, which is a must for large festivals on flat ground. Since only those in front were able to see Ian McCulloch and company onstage, the band’s competent playing of familiar hits like “Bring on the Dancing Horses” and “Lips Like Sugar” risked sounding like a recording, and the languid medley of the band’s ballad “Nothing Lasts Forever” with “Walk on the Wild Side” sapped some of the crowd’s energy.  Love and Rockets reunited for the first time in 15 years, bringing Daniel Ash, David J (in a flashy red-sequined suit) and Kevin Haskins together for a harder-edged rock set, with highlights including the trippy visuals of “Kundalini Express” and their stripped-down cover of “Ball of Confusion,” with graphics highlighting the political relevance of the lyrics.  Billy Idol’s fans were among the most enthusiastic and adoring of the festival, especially when the British new wave icon brought out his 3-year-old granddaughter Poppy and asked the crowd to join in on “Happy Birthday.” While a longer set would have given him a chance to do even more Generation X songs, his joyfully energetic “100 Punks Rule” was a high point of the day, along with staples like “Rebel Yell,” “White Wedding” and “Eyes Without a Face” and a crackling Spanish-tinged guitar solo from Steve Stevens. “I just want to thank you for making my life so fucking great,” Idol proclaimed, and it was hard not to be moved by the years of accrued love for his music, even if it was the thousandth time you’d heard “White Wedding.”  Billy Idol at Cruel World  With night falling, Iggy Pop rocked through “Five Foot One” and several more songs, with Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme’s preteen son dancing up a storm onstage. As Pop sang the lyrics to “The Passenger” (“I see the stars come out tonight, I see the bright and hollow sky”), a few flickers of lightning struck far in the distance and his sound cut out sporadically. A few moments later, a larger and more visible bolt crossed the Pasadena sky, and the sound was turned off for good, as an announcer asked the large crowd to evacuate the area. Though there was no rain or further thunder, the Pasadena Fire Department was taking no chances.  Organizers Goldenvoice regrouped quickly, scheduling a makeup night Sunday at the same venue with Gary Numan, who had already played a full set of his compelling industrial-electronic music on Saturday, plus Pop and Siouxsie — though no Human League, which also had its set cut on Saturday.  For the second night in a row, proto-punk Iggy Pop writhed shirtless as massive video monitors highlighted every vein on his sinewy 76-year old frame. “Deja vu, baby!” he proclaimed as he took the stage. Ever the showman, he dropped trou twice, spit and itched his butt and managed to turn in rousing hardcore performances of classics like “Lust for Life.” As a grey-haired gent in an impeccable GBH leather jacket and a woman of a certain age fist-pumped and shouted along to every word of “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” there was no sense that this was a nostalgia act — only that the music was as powerful and subversive as ever.  As the sky darkened, Siouxsie, who shed the Banshees long ago, appeared onstage, sounding a bit peeved at the cautious fire department the night before. “I was trying to tell them it’s part of our fucking light show,” she exclaimed, clad in a shimmering metallic jumpsuit.  Like a torch singer in the nightclub of the undead, Siouxsie was lit in black and white on the monitors, creating suitably spooky shadows on her face to go with her quaveringly sepuchral voice. For her first U.S. performance in 15 years, she was able to play an extended set of 17 songs, including a second encore with “Israel.” From the drifting clouds of “Dear Prudence” to the bat-like shapes of “Spellbound,” plus old movie clips, lava and women dancing and floating, the visuals enhanced every song.  Though some fans were not able to return for the second night, Cruel World offered partial refunds to those not able to attend. For the others, it turned into a two-night festival instead of one — the better to experience more of Siouxsie, which these days is a rare opportunity.

"political assassination","2019-12-17","Not Discerned","{""Johannesburg"", ""Gauteng"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-22T16:05:45","For 15 years, South Africa has dealt with unreliable power supply, and it’s gotten worse recently. Major cities and rural areas go without electricity for hours daily, resulting from insufficient capacity from an indebted state monopoly power company. Officials are scrambling to solve the problem, and might want to look at the market solutions they’ve long disavowed.  I saw the problem firsthand from day 1 in Cape Town, the first African stop in my 1.5-year Global South tour. Lights would flicker on-and-off, temporarily cutting out internet. Of course I was privileged to be in a fairly-upscale hotel for tourists, which could afford to deploy backup generators. But many South Africans just live hours without power, and public infrastructure also suffers.  South Africa’s population has grown fast this century, as turmoil in other African countries draws refugees. And as of 2021 its urban population share was 68%. But its power plants cannot produce sufficient power to meet demand. In order to keep the underequipped grid from failing, the power supplier must deliberately cut power, in a practice called “load shedding.”  NPR reports that nationwide, this happens about three times daily, although while in Cape Town I found it was more like 5-10 times daily. This typically leads to six hours of power loss nationwide daily, but can be double that. One source projected that as of November 2022, load shedding occurred over 1,900 hours.  Compounding the problem is the country’s simultaneous reliance on coal and commitment to reduce it. The overwhelming majority of national power is generated from coal, but as plants age and coal falls out of fashion for environmentalists, the country faces mandates to reduce this production method. Even while all this load shedding was happening, the country announced an $8.5 billion program to reduce coal power.  The president has also declared a national emergency, enabling for reductions in bureaucracy and freeing up funding, while appointing a director of power supply to handle the problem. But the power company will need substantial reform to reverse this ongoing crisis.  Background  All of South Africa’s power is supplied by a single company, Eskom. The utility is a state-controlled enterprise, although it has a profit mandate. Previously, power companies in South Africa had been both publicly- and privately-owned, as the country’s mining economy grew in the early 20th century. But these were agglomerated into Eskom.  The firm was once a highly-regarded example of a state owned enterprise; as recently as the mid-2000s, it was praised for having low debt and operating with minimal subsidy. But by 2019, the picture was far different; its debt accounted for 15% of overall debt in South Africa. Today it sits at $23.5 billion, reports Reuters.  The crisis was foreseeable. As far back as 1997, Eskom’s leadership warned of the need for load shedding if power expansions were not brought on line. But debt and corruption inhibited the company from providing this and many plants went into disrepair. Consequently, writes Anton Eberhard for The Conversation, “the performance and availability of Eskom’s power stations has declined from above 90% in the early 2000s to an average of 64% in the 2021 financial year.”  The Role of Corruption  Most observers point to pervasive corruption at Eskom from the start. State businesses were widely corrupt during the tenure of the previous president, Jacob Zuma, who “appointed loyalists – sometimes with little experience – to...top positions at state companies” including Eskom, writes The New York Times. In April 2022, a lengthy report on Eskom’s practices called for its board to be prosecuted. Eskom was allegedly targeted by a fraud scheme involving allies of Zuma. The former chief executive, Andre de Rutyer, claims the company loses at least $55 million to theft monthly.  Some accuse de Rutyer as a party to corruption, with one whistleblower saying he “‘perfected’ corruption” within the company and others leveling discrimination allegations. For his part, de Ruyter has leveled his own allegations, claiming to have survived an assassination attempt and alleging that an unidentified senior government official facilitated graft at Eskom. As of this writing, the dueling accusations very much continued.  Impact on Day-to-Day Life  Clearly, load shedding disrupts daily life, sometimes in dangerous ways. It’s not uncommon for individuals to be trapped in elevators, and lack of street lights worsen the country’s crime epidemic, which is already Africa’s worst.  The economic impact is catastrophic. As Foreign Policy reports, GDP growth has sat at just over 1.3% a year since 2007, and a daily cost of load shedding is as high as $232 million. Some estimate that South Africa’s economy is 17% smaller as a result.  Small businesses are hit particularly hard. Either vendors must manage to complete all power-involved activities before load shedding occurs for the day, or they must buy fuel and generators at great personal (and environmental) expense. And of course, internet access, a key component of modern commerce, is nonexistent for anyone without generators.  Unsurprisingly, load shedding produces political turmoil, exacerbating an already unstable government. South Africa’s current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was elected as a reformer following Zuma’s scandals. But the energy crisis threatens to oust his government too.  “People in businesses in general, they do not buy the idea that within a space of 12 to 18 months, we are going to see some improvement,” African Liberty fellow Phumlani Majozi told South African media in March 2023.  Power blackouts are not unique to South Africa – I’ve found them common in other African countries I visit. Under a quarter of sub-Saharan Africans have energy. But South Africa’s crisis spreads beyond its borders, because Eskom supplies neighboring states.  Yet as load shedding has become part of daily life, residents have adapted as best as can be expected. For instance, drivers know traffic lights will stop functioning when load shedding occurs, and informal rules have emerged. People volunteer in guiding traffic. Residents have nonperishable food, and regularly set bonfires to stay warm.  Would more competition help?  Ending load shedding requires capacity expansions and a reckoning with the global coal market (and efforts to phase out coal). More broadly, the crisis raises the question of whether a state-run utility is the best way to provide power. The corruption and underinvestment at Eskom demonstrates the dangers of such monopolies.  The country has restricted power sources not provided by Eskom, says Financial Times’ David Pilling, a protectionist scheme designed to favor big coal companies. Into 2022, South African authorities prohibited the amount of renewable energy that could be fed into the grid. Despite its commitments to reduce coal, the government wants to prevent what it fears would be an excessive loss of coal jobs, motivating the restrictions.  “There is a way to fix the power problems,” writes Pilling. “It involves a massive increase in privately produced electricity and a loss of Eskom’s generation monopoly.”  Some have argued that solar power in particular could prove advantageous for the country. South Africa has previously attempted to expand nuclear power, but the cost has proven prohibitive and lead times are long.  A move towards more energy market freedom is broadly associated with better service quality. According to World Bank research, introducing competition in contrast with monopolies like Eskom “is associated with higher electricity access [and] better consumer affordability.” The last point is somewhat contentious; recent experience in America suggests otherwise, but there are numerous confounding factors. But it’s certainly worth trying in South Africa, given its multi-decade energy catastrophe.  Cover Image Credit: Robosk, Wikimedia Commons (Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike-4.0 license).

"political assassination","1975-08-15","Not Discerned","{""Dhaka"", ""Dhaka"", ""Bangladesh""}","2023-05-22T10:17:57","Puzzled by this question posed by his classmates in his school, Radwan Mujib had a hard time pitting it against the version narrated by his mother, who dubbed her father “a superhero.” Indeed, Bangabandhu fell nothing short of a superhero who led a nation to freedom in 1971 and whose voice is now registered as a memory of the world. Everything changed at the dawn of August 15, 1975 when a group of disgruntled army officers gunned down Bangabandhu and most of his family members at his Dhanmondi residence.  The assassination of Bangabandhu shoved the country into its darkest chapter that prevailed for a decade and half. With the takeover by military dictators came the strangest rule that Bangabandhu’s killers would be endowed with indemnity. In the 1980s, even uttering Bangabandhu’s name amounted to a crime. Radwan Mujib, Bangabandhu’s grandson, then a school student, had no idea of the political chaos that gripped the country and the struggle for democracy that was gaining momentum. The military regime left no stone unturned to wipe out the spirit of the Liberation War and the ideology of the Father of the Nation once and for all. Radwan was still in the dark about why a legend – as regarded by his mother – was not even heard of by his classmates. Growing up on a steady diet of graphic novels, he visualized a comic in which Bangabandhu would be portrayed as a superhero.  However, as Radwan celebrated his 43rd birthday, the country is now marked with a diametrically opposite scenario. Democracy has returned and so did the progressive ideology. Radwan has brought forth a series of creative projects to present history in the form of stories so that youths get engaged in the spirit of the Liberation War, for which three million martyrs shed their blood.  Radwan Mujib’s successful initiative demonstrates that words and pictures can revive the history that bullets and bombs try to bury forever. He undertook a number of projects, adding flesh and blood to history, to connect with youths.  Read more: Carrying Bangabandhu’s legacy  His brainchildren include Joy Bangla Concert (a concert themed on the wartime slogan “Joy Bangla”), Joy Bangla Youth Award (a countrywide initiative to award young changemakers), and “Mujib Graphic Novel” (a comic-style sketch of young Mujib, who would go on to become the Father of the Nation).  His idea of presenting history creatively through anecdotes and vignettes instead of mere dates and names can be traced back to his traumatic experience during his school life when military rulers made his grandfather Bangabandhu a forbidden name.  Growing up at a time following the 1975 assassination of Bangabandhu, the man who liberated this country, Radwan could not come to terms with the fact that the killers of a nation’s founding father were enjoying indemnity while his superhero grandfather was nowhere to be mentioned.  That devastating encounter at an early age shaped his life's mission, encouraging him to drawing youths closer to real history, the glory that makes this nation stand out.  The CRI trustee and London School of Economics graduate received birthday wishes and appreciation on May 21 from all quarters, especially youths who were recognized, groomed, and networked by his projects.  Radwan, who inherited his knack for knowledge from his mother Sheikh Rehana, co-produced “Hasina: A Daughter's Tale,” a docufiction poignantly narrating the real-life struggles of Sheikh Hasina after the murder of her father in a coup on August 15, 1975.  The editor-in-chief of WhiteBoard, the country’s first policy-based magazine, regularly interacts with youths through the projects he had set in motion. His sister Tulip Rizwana Siddiq, reputed for her fiery speech and biting wit, is a member of parliament in the UK. Another granddaughter of Bangabandhu, Saima Wazed, is a member of World Health Organization’s 25-member Expert Advisory Panel on mental health. Bangabandhu’s grandson Sajeeb Wazed is the ICT Advisor to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Despite the assassination of Bangabandhu and most of his family members, his spirit and ideology reclaimed their foothold through the impossible comeback by his daughter Sheikh Hasina and the unstoppable efforts by his grandsons and granddaughters.

"political assassination","1949-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:00:00","Were there problems in how intellectuals and professional artists were treated? Yes. Were they persecuted, punished, and killed off as a category? No, this is “tales from the crypt” nonsense. Again, readers can go to sources cited above.  Here is a thought-question to Pamela Paul. Why were the most radical forces of the 1960s and early 1970s in the U.S., like the Black Panther Party and currents within the women's liberation movement, looking towards, learning from, and popularizing experience and theory of the Cultural Revolution? It was because the Cultural Revolution was the crest of the worldwide rebellion and revolutionary upsurge that shook the foundations of oppressive class society. And Maoist China was undergoing something utterly unprecedented: a galvanic “revolution within a revolution.” It was a source of inspiration and hope to people across the planet aching and struggling for emancipation.  But Pamela Paul skirts this reality and falls back lazily on bourgeois narratives of the Cultural Revolution as “mob terror” instigated by a fanatical Mao. It's not as if she had to toil away on this thesis. After all, we are ceaselessly bombarded with the message that communism is a “dangerous” and unworkable ideal that can only lead to nightmare. We hear it from ruling classes and from ideologues within academia; the media reinforces it; a veritable cottage industry of highly publicized memoirs of “suffering,” especially by people who lost privilege and station, gives the storyline a “human face” and patina of authenticity.  “The Decade That Cannot Be Deleted” fits neatly into the pervasive, anticommunist narrative. But I must say that it is disappointing that Pamela Paul would produce such an intellectually irresponsible piece. She has been willing to “go against the tide” (to use a Maoist phrase of the Cultural Revolution) taking on character assassination, false accusations, no need-to-substantiate charges leveled against writers like Jeanine Cummins, author of the novel American Dirt... and unfounded assertions of transphobia directed at author J.K. Rowling. She has raised the banner of fact and evidence as opposed to unthinking judgment and censure.  But when it comes to the monumental political-social revolution that was the Cultural Revolution—Pamela Paul tosses critical thinking and rigorous historical analysis out the window. Now in her article, Paul bemoans “the absence of real history” of the Cultural Revolution. But this is a disingenuous call for even more distortion of the Cultural Revolution in the name of historical “reckoning.” So let's unpack “real history.”  2. What was the historical backdrop and what were the actual aims of the Cultural Revolution?  Yes, that fundamental question ignored by Pamela Paul. The Cultural Revolution led by Mao was guided by his scientific analysis of the complex reality of Chinese society and the real dangers facing socialism at the time.  Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to address a world-historic problem of communist revolution: how to keep a revolution aimed at putting an end to all exploitation and oppression on the road to achieving that goal. And how to do so in ways that enable the masses in their millions to understand and grapple with this problem, to wage new forms of revolutionary struggle under socialism to prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to further revolutionize the institutions of society and people's thinking and values.  We have to step back further. In 1949, the Chinese revolution, mobilizing millions under Mao's leadership, came to power. It drove out foreign imperialism and shattered the old oppressive economic and social order marked by despotic landlord rule in the countryside, and corrupt urban capitalism. The revolution established a new socialist state power and economy geared to meeting basic needs. The revolution under Mao's leadership set out to forge new liberatory institutions, and new cooperative and collective relations among people, to challenge deeply entrenched subordination of women, and carry out other social transformations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcmV2Y29tLnVzL2VuL3Jlc3BvbnNlLXBhbWVsYS1wYXVscy1rbmVlLWplcmstZGVudW5jaWF0aW9uLW1hb3MtY3VsdHVyYWwtcmV2b2x1dGlvbi1vci1ob3ctY3JpdGljYWwtdGhpbmtpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Gathered around were the most powerful Congressmen of the time Nehru, Patel, JB Kripalani (then Congress president), Baldev Singh and of course Muslim league principals Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan and Abdur Rab Nishtar. Each picked up a copy of the plan to partition India. Satisfied, they accepted the terms.  But it was Congress leadership’s about-face that shocked many. “Over my dead body,” said Mahatma Gandhi a few weeks earlier when partition was first broached. The Congress had agreed.  Shock over this somersault turned to indignation. The party was deluged by hundreds of thousands of letters darkly targeting Gandhi and the leadership.  One letter demanded to drop words “Indian National” from Indian National Congress – guilty as it was for “appeasing minorities” at the expense of the “Hindu majority in their own land.”  An advocate asked, “Why the green colour in the flag of the nation now? It should be a Hindu Rashtra and the Bhagwa dhwaj with saffron colour alone should be the flag of the nation.”  You would think, judging from what our history textbooks teach us, that these writers championing a “Hindu Rashtra” and heaping hate upon Gandhi would have been “extremist” Hindus from the Sangh Parivar.  But the writers were Congress members. A recent book that focusses on Muslim politics between 1947 and 1986 by academic Aishwarya Pandit has authoritatively catalogued the Congress’s extensive tryst with Hindu exclusivists. Pandit notes, “Some members of the (Savarkar led) Hindu Mahasabha and RSS were active Congressmen, and some Congressmen had a footing within the Mahasabha.”  Far from being purged from the Congress after Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination these “Hindu revivalists” – who had little or no regard for Bapu’s inclusivism – flourished. Purshottam Das Tandon even became Congress President between 1950 and 1951 and ominously thundered that “Muslims who do not accept the culture of Bharat should leave the country.”  This look back to Partition and the teeming “Hindu supremacism” in Congress ranks is important. It reveals that the Congress was not above acting like those it today regularly accuses of being in the “Sangh” and sowing communal hate to reap electoral reward. It also shows that many of its own cadre harboured the same level of hate for Gandhi as the Hindu Mahasabha member and eventual assassin Nathuram Godse did.  This context is helpful in better understanding the raging row over the “rationalisation” of the syllabus in NCERT textbooks. A few of these modifications include the deletion of adjectives to describe Godse as a “Hindu extremist,” a “Brahmin from Maharashtra ,” and the editor of a “Hindu extremist newspaper.”  The “rationalised” text now reads: “Finally, on 30 January 1948, one such extremist, Nathuram Vinayak Godse, walked up to Gandhiji during his evening prayer in Delhi and fired three bullets at him, killing him instantly.”  To many, at first glance, this re-write appeared to be less of a rationalisation and more of a creative editing out “inconvenient truths” aimed at redeeming the Sangh Parivar’s “Hindu extremist” image.  The assassination of Mahatma Gandhi was a highly condemnable act that can never be justified. It should be noted, too, that no principal in the BJP and RSS has ever done so either. Yet, can it be denied that the deployment of the words “Hindu extremist, Brahmin from Maharashtra and Hindu extremist newspaper” was a classic case of gaslighting? Was this not, perhaps, aimed at making Hindus feel that Godse’s fanaticism typified them all, that a legacy of pluralistic and pacifist dharma was under threat by one warped individual?  Yet, has the ideological left (elements of whom were originally entrusted with sculpting our history textbooks) never failed to remind us that terrorism has no religion?  Indeed, historic references in NCERT textbooks appear to have been cherry picked. There is a section on the Gujarat 2002 riots included to remind students that “religious or cultural minorities” would be vulnerable if a “majority community were to capture political power.” Yet, there is no reference to the bloody exodus of Hindus from the Muslim majority Kashmir Valley in 1990.  In other examples of selectivity, the evil of caste is only alluded to in Hindu society and not in other denominations.  The record shows that non-NDA governments were not above politicising other parts of history. Consider this one example of Congress MP from Uttar Pradesh Nurul Hasan. As India’s education minister between 1972 and 1977, Hasan was identified as one who “happily arranged the marriage between Marxist social science and state patronage.” In a 2001 magazine article, journalists Laskhmi Iyer and Ashok Malik noted, “The Marxist school of history controlled institutions, scholarships, key jobs. It arrogated unto itself the power to write textbooks. Hasan’s historians were hardly democratic. Worse, they were terribly poor writers. The books they wrote bored a generation.”  Today, the monopoly of “eminent” left historians has been broken. New researchers are throwing up new facts. Surely, they deserve to be heard?  History doesn’t need, as some patronisingly claim, to be rescued from revision it needs rescuing from those who wrote it without fidelity to fact.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbm93bmV3cy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9oaXN0b3J5LWRvZXNudC1uZWVkLXJlc2N1aW5nLWZyb20tcmV2aXNpb24tYnV0LXRob3NlLXdoby1maWRkbGUtZmFjdHMtYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDA0MzcyMjPSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNub3duZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2hpc3RvcnktZG9lc250LW5lZWQtcmVzY3VpbmctZnJvbS1yZXZpc2lvbi1idXQtdGhvc2Utd2hvLWZpZGRsZS1mYWN0cy1hcnRpY2xlLTEwMDQzNzIyMy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","-0044-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-22T19:19:20","Cleopatra VII Philopator is one of the most famous figures of antiquity, having ruled over ancient Egypt between 51 and 30 BC. A heroine to some and a villainess to others, her fate was intimately tied to the fortunes of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, of which she was the last ruler.  Today, Cleopatra is most famed for her various love affairs, which have been the subject of films, television series, novels, and stage plays. Cleopatra’s affairs with the prominent Roman generals and statesmen Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony have a place in the common consciousness that few other historical romantic entanglements have ever achieved.  However, these affairs were not driven exclusively – or perhaps even primarily – by feelings of passion, love, or romantic sentiment; they were instead examples of cold hard realpolitik. To secure the future of her kingdom, her dynasty, and her own political position, Cleopatra needed powerful allies, and the leading men of the Mediterranean’s preeminent great power were the ideal candidates.  Cleopatra VII and her lovers in fiction and reality  Cleopatra and her lovers have been a popular topic over the centuries for various works of historical fiction, greatly coloring the popular perception of her character.  Our modern conception of this enigmatic queen has arguably been shaped the most by The Tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra, written by the English playwright William Shakespeare. The play focuses on the romance between the eponymous characters and their tragic demise following the ill-fated Battle of Actium.  In almost equal stature in the popular imagination of Cleopatra to Shakespeare’s play is the 1963 movie Cleopatra, starring Elizabeth Taylor as the eponymous Ptolemaic ruler and Richard Burton as her lover, Mark Anthony.  In terms of the historical record, the two most important names in the list of Cleopatra’s lovers are undoubtedly Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony. Although historians have proposed other potential romances, these two names are the most consequential, since both men commanded immense political and military power in ancient Rome.  Julius Caesar  The Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar arrived in Egypt in 48 BC. At the time, the Roman Republic was embroiled in a brutal civil war and Caesar was in pursuit of his bitter rival, Pompey.  When Caesar arrived in Egypt, Ptolemy XIII – the brother of Cleopatra VII and king of Egypt – presented Caesar with the severed head of Pompey. Although Caesar and Pompey were rivals, it is said that he was saddened to see that his adversary had met this end.  Ptolemy XIII successfully allied himself with Caesar who decided to stay in Egypt longer than expected. However, Ptolemaic Egypt suffered from divisions of its own. According to the will of Ptolemy XII, his children, Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII would rule together as co-monarchs over Egypt, but this arrangement had fallen apart and Ptolemy had exiled his sister Cleopatra.  Caesar sought to mediate the dispute. Much to Ptolemy’s chagrin, Caesar received Cleopatra in Alexandria and eventually decided to resolve the dispute in her favor. Ultimately, this resulted in the Battle of the Nile in 47 BC which pitted the forces of Caesar and Cleopatra against Ptolemy. Ptolemy lost and was forced to flee the city. He later drowned trying to cross the Nile.  During this time. Caesar and Cleopatra developed a relationship that was both political and romantic. This relationship was mutually beneficial. Cleopatra aimed to safeguard Egypt’s autonomy, while Caesar sought to expand his influence in the eastern Mediterranean. Their alliance allowed them to consolidate power and establish a formidable force against their opponents.  On June 23, 47 BC, Cleopatra gave birth to Caesarion, her child with Caesar. He was the only known biological son of Caesar and would go on to become the last sovereign member of the Ptolemaic dynasty.  In 46 BC, Cleopatra visited Rome with her other younger brother and now-husband Ptolemy XIV. Ptolemy XIV was elevated to co-ruler with his sister for the sake of political stability. However, Ptolemy XIV, who was only a young boy, had no real political power and Cleopatra maintained her relationship with Caesar.  During her long stay in Rome, Cleopatra stayed at Caesar’s villa, where he bestowed upon her and Ptolemy XIV the title of “friend and ally of the Roman people”. This essentially meant that Egypt was a client state and ally of Rome.  On March 15, 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of Roman senators. Cleopatra hung on in Rome until about mid-April. She probably hoped that her son Caesarion would be named as Caesar’s heir, but his grandnephew Octavian received this honor instead.  Mark Anthony  Further civil strife and war followed the assassination of Caesar, but ultimately the men who avenged his murder emerged as the most powerful men in Rome. The Roman Republic’s provinces were divided between the triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Anthony, and Lepidus.  Under Octavian’s control were most of the western provinces; to Lepidus went Spain, although he later gave it to Octavian in exchange for parts of Africa and was then sidelined in any case; and to Anthony went the wealthy eastern provinces and the Hellenistic world.  It was at this critical juncture in Roman and Egyptian history that Cleopatra would again find herself embroiled in a love affair with one of Rome’s leading men.  Anthony was ambitious to enhance his reputation by launching a campaign against the Parthians, a formidable foe that had previously beaten the Romans at the Battle of Carrhae in 53 BC. There was also a growing rivalry between the triumvirs, particularly between Octavian and Anthony. To achieve his goals, Anthony needed funds, and it just so happened that Cleopatra was tremendously wealthy.  In 41 BC, Anthony requested the presence of Cleopatra at Tarsus, a city in Anatolia. To heighten Anthony’s anticipation of the visit, Cleopatra delayed and demurred. When she did finally decide to make an appearance, she did so with a grand and intoxicating entrance.  Cleopatra made her entrance into Tarsus by sailing up the Cydnus River on a grand vessel adorned with a golden prow, sails in rich purple hues, and oars made of silver. Accompanied by musicians playing music, Cleopatra reclined under a canopy intricately embroidered with gold, resembling Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Young individuals dressed as Eros fanned her, and girls dressed as sea nymphs attended to her needs, while servants released fragrant perfumes into the air, captivating the onlookers who lined the riverbanks.  This grand entrance was followed up with an equally ostentatious banquet, in which, according to Athenaeus – who based his own account on the words of Socrates of Rhodes – Cleopatra adorned the dining area with gold, gems, and richly decorated purple carpets.  The Greek historian Plutarch noted that Cleopatra believed that Anthony would prove easier to seduce than Caesar. Whatever the case, the pair did indeed form both a romantic relationship and an alliance.  Anthony and Cleopatra spent the winter of 41 to 40 BC in Alexandria, where they enjoyed the city’s unique mixture of ancient Greek and Egyptian culture. They were reputed to have formed a drinking club called “The Inimitable Livers,” in honor of Dionysus.  Cleopatra gave birth to twins, Alexander Helios, which means sun, and Cleopatra Selene, which means moon, shortly after Anthony returned to Rome in 40 BC.  The alliance between Anthony and Cleopatra had proven mutually beneficial, but ultimately, the lovers would face defeat and death together. Relations between the Roman triumvirs broke down and Octavian and Anthony plunged the Roman world into civil war once more. In 31 BC, the combined forces of Anthony and Cleopatra were defeated at the sea battle of Acticum, effectively sealing their fates.  In 30 BC, Octavian’s forces landed in Egypt. Anthony was able to win a small victory on land at first, but his fleet then surrendered to Octavian followed by his cavalry. Anthony’s military position was now truly hopeless.  After his forces were defeated, and believing falsely that Cleopatra had killed herself, Anthony attempted suicide by falling on his own sword. However, he did not succeed in taking his own life immediately. When news reached Cleopatra that Anthony was still alive, he was brought to her monument. According to Plutarch, Anthony died there from his self-inflicted wounds on August 1, 30 BC.  Devastated by Anthony’s death and faced with the prospect of being paraded as a captive in Rome, Cleopatra resolved to take her own life. According to historical accounts, she arranged for poisonous asps (Egyptian cobras) to be smuggled into her chambers. Cleopatra allowed one of the venomous snakes to bite her, causing her death. She died on August 12, 30 BC.  After her death, Egypt was annexed by Octavian, who became the first Roman emperor. Cleopatra Selene was the only child of Cleopatra who survived and after a period spent as a political prisoner in Rome, she would go on to become the queen of Mauretania.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9jbGVvcGF0cmEtbG92ZXJzLXB0b2xlbWFpYy1lZ3lwdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ismail Haniyeh likened Iran to a strong pillar, which the Palestinian resistance front relies on. He made the remarks in response to a message by the commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. Brigadier General Esmail Qaani had hailed the victory of resistance forces against Israel during the recent aggression on the Gaza Strip. Haniyeh also stressed that the Israeli assassination of resistance commanders had failed to intimidate Palestinian people. He said Israel erroneously assumed that the aggression would help it emerge from a domestic crisis, but it actually aggravated those woes.  UK industrial action  The UK health service is set to come under further strain as junior doctors in England plan more strikes. The strikes will take place from June 13 to 17. They come after negotiations with the government collapsed. The British Medical Association says the government’s pay offer of 5-percent is ""nowhere near"" making up for the pay erosion caused by inflation. The doctors’ union also warned of strikes throughout the summer if the government did not change its position. The government says such pay rises would only further inflame inflation. A series of strikes by UK healthcare workers in recent months has led to the cancellation of numerous appointments and disruption of patient care.

The study showed that the number of respondents who said they were doing ""at least okay financially"" dropped by five percent in 2022 compared to the year before. A record 35-percent of the respondents said they were worse off financially. Many of the respondents said they had reduced their savings to make ends meet, delayed purchases or opted for cheaper products.

"political assassination","1976-07-18","Not Discerned","{""Harare"", ""Harare"", ""Zimbabwe""}","2023-05-22T22:01:46","Christopher Mutsvangwa  THOMAS Mandigora joined the ZANLA wing of ZANU-PF in 1975. He belongs to the militant youths of the Samora Machel-Soweto Uprising generation of revolutionary consciousness.  This generation was inspired by the epic victory of the FRELIMO freedom-fighting guerrilla army against the fascist and imperial army of Portugal in 1974.  A new revolutionary mood swept through the Southern African sub-region. The long colonised black majorities acquired a new mood of answering imperial, colonial, racist and apartheid armies through armed national liberation movements.  Free Mozambique took the extraordinary and risky decision to offer sanctuary, host military training, and use its expansive border to deploy armed freedom fighters. These were arrayed against the colonial settler army of the racist minority regime of Ian Smith’s Rhodesia.  Mandigora took the risky decision to join 300 other recruits to cross the border in April 1975. The spirit of freedom had been given an angry and animated impetus by the news of the cruel and heinous assassination of Comrade Herbert Chitepo, National Chairman of ZANU and founder of its Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army – ZANLA – by a car bomb in March 1975 in Lusaka.  Cde Chitepo had embraced friendship with China through President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.  Cde Josiah Magama Tongogara would be among the early groups to train in the theory and practice of Chinese Maoist People’s War guerrilla warfare.  Between 1969-71, the Chitepo-Tongogara duo had implanted a permanent military presence on Zimbabwean ground. They jointly launched the legendary northeast offensive.  This remarkable military achievement worked wonders in restoring a sense of the military virility of the majority of African populations.  “Varungu vadzvanyiriri vanoreveka” was the new psychic dictum. It was further emboldened by the Samora Machel victory.  Mandigora left Highfield, Harare for the Mozambique border under the leadership of former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe.  They would spend the next three months in the mountainous Nyanga-Katerere border under worsening conditions of hunger deprivation and no communication with the outside world.  The group of 300 would finally join the ever-increasing tens of thousands of other youthful recruits streaming into Mozambique.  The announcement and arrival of 25 June 1975 Independence Day of Mozambique had literally opened the floodgates of gritty, fearless, and extremely brave youths ready to defy and scale whatever and whichever odds to the goal of freedom and independence for Zimbabwe.  These youths were being collected and quartered at Zhunda Barracks outside of Chimoio and Chibavava Camp in Espungabera.  Mandigora was among the early occupants of Nyadzonia Refugee Camp. He was attested to Company D for elementary military training as the prospect of the resumption of the Détente Exercise stalled armed struggle brightened up.  The united ZANLA-ZIPRA guerrilla armies had signed the Mgagao Declaration to unite and resume the prosecution of the anti-colonial war.  By dint of its urban background, Company D had high visibility as the refugee militants entertained in soccer and sports. Mandigora exhibited akin soccer talent to that of the late and legendary younger brother David “Yogi” Mandigora, a repeat national soccer star.  He completed his military training at the Tembwe ZANLA Academy in Tete Province under conditions of extreme hunger and biting hardship.  He was then deployed to the front in Takawira Military Sector of Mtoko Area D.  The deployment of urbanised as well as better-educated youthful militants engendered a quantitative and qualitative leap in the military prowess of ZANLA-ZIPRA combatants.  The battlefront victories soon achieved a diplomatic coup. They forced imperial Britain and its allies to call for the Geneva peace negotiations of 1976.  Mandigora would earn a purple heart with battlefield wounds in 1977. He was withdrawn from the front for treatment and recovery.  He was then attested to the second intake of political commissar graduates of Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology at Chimoio ZANLA camp.  On graduation, he was deployed to Maputo for radio broadcast work at Voice of Zimbabwe, Radio Mozambique.  Lusaka was his next post as an ardent and enlightened propaganda driver of the cause of freedom, democracy, and independence.  The night broadcasts salvos were listened to by the populace, even as they inspired field guerrilla units at the battlefront.  The broadcast also served to inform the world public of the steady, impressive, and gathering march of the victorious Zimbabwe armed liberation struggle.  This epic journey would serve as the muse of Jamaica’s reggae singer and pan-African prophet Bob Marley.  His hit song “Zimbabwe” is an exuberant exaltation of ZANLA-ZIPRA armed militants who were dealing death blows to the once dreaded imperial army of Britain and its genocidal cat’s paw in the form of the racist, colonial settler army of Ian Smith’s Rhodesia.  Deeply introspective and intensely patriotic, Ambassador Mandigora was a committed cadre, a courageous guerrilla combatant, and a thorough professional in all his peacetime occupations.  Mandigora’s first major battle was the 1976 attack on Nyamapanda border post in a generalised revenge offensive for the Nyadzonia Refugee Camp Massacre.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZC5jby56dy90aG9tYXMtbWFuZGlnb3JhLWEtcmVtYXJrYWJsZS1taWxpdGFyeS1tYW4v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGVyYWxkLmNvLnp3L3Rob21hcy1tYW5kaWdvcmEtYS1yZW1hcmthYmxlLW1pbGl0YXJ5LW1hbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-08-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T04:48:05","On Monday, two Ukrainian-backed Russian insurgency units staged the largest attack on Russian territory in the war to date. The assault came just one day after Russia proclaimed the complete seizure of Bakhmut after 224 days of intense fighting, during which tens of thousands are believed to have died. It also comes just after the US declared it would train pilots for F-16 fighter jets, and Zelensky attended the G7 summit in Hiroshima, urging the imperialist powers to step up their involvement in the war even further.  Liberty of Russia Legion/Telegram [Photo: Liberty of Russia Legion/Telegram]  According to Russian press reports and officials, two saboteur units raided the Belgorodskaia oblast early Monday, combined with a series of drone attacks and cyber attacks on the regional telephone and internet networks. For at least the first half of the day, residents were reportedly bombarded with phone calls as well as text messages urging them to evacuate, falsely presented as alerts by Russian officials. A report in the Russian Nezavisimaya Gazeta on the events indicated that for much of the day during the attack, the population was left in the dark by officials about what was happening.  Drone strikes hit multiple targets in the region, including a grain depot in the village of Gora-Podol. In the same village, the Ukrainian-backed forces were also able to temporarily seize the “House of Culture” (Dom Kultury). One regional administrative building was shelled. Shells also hit private homes in at least several other towns and villages, causing fires and damage to buildings. As of this writing, regional officials have confirmed that eight people were wounded.  In the evening, the governor of the Belgorodskaia oblast, Viacheslav Gladkov, announced that a state of “counterterrorist operation” had been introduced in the region. The police and military forces deployed can now check identity documents, suspend activities of branches of industries and organizations that make use of explosive, radioactive, chemical or biological substances, evacuate citizens temporarily and intercept their telephone and other communications.  As of this writing, Russian reports indicated that fighting between the saboteur units and the Russian military and National Guard was still ongoing in at least two locations, in Kozinka and Glotovo.  The units were identified by both Russian and Ukrainian officials as the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a neofascist organization, and the far-right nationalist Freedom of Russia Legion. It was the first time Ukrainian foreign intelligence acknowledged that these two organizations, both of which were formed in 2022 and are classified as “terrorist” in Russia, were operating under de facto control of Ukraine’s armed forces.  The attack marks the culmination to this point of a series of ever more aggressive military interventions by Ukraine-backed insurgency units and drone and terrorist attacks on Russian territory over the past 10 months. This included the assassination in August of Daria Dugina, a prominent far-right proponent of the Kremlin war, the assassination of the Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in April, and drone strikes on the Kremlin earlier this month.  The Belgorodskaia oblast, which directly borders the territories in East Ukraine now occupied and claimed by Russia, has been a central focus of drone strikes and shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces. The attacks, especially over recent weeks, are seen by military analysts as part of the preparations for Ukraine’s long anticipated “counteroffensive.”  Monday’s attack is part of a dangerous new phase, which is marked by an ever greater geographic expansion of the war and direct involvement of the imperialist powers. With Ukraine having suffered staggering losses, estimated in the hundreds of thousands—out of a resident population of under 30 million—the NATO imperialist powers are determined to offset the clear military setbacks by stepping up their direct involvement in the conflict and encouraging ever more reckless and dangerous attacks by Ukraine on Russian territory.  The character of the forces involved in the attack brings to the fore the true aims of the war being waged by the imperialist powers against Russia. Both the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion are ultranationalist and racist formations. They proclaim as their goal the violent overthrow of the government of Vladimir Putin and the institution of an ethnically “pure” Russian nation-state, along with separate, “independent” nation-states for other nationalities now living in Russia.  The Russian Volunteer Corps openly places itself in the tradition of the Vlasov Army, which collaborated with the Nazis in the war against the Soviet Union during World War II. In a manifesto from November, the RVC explicitly calls for the establishment of an ethnically pure Russian state, insisting that it represent “russkie”—a term for ethnic Russians—and not “rossiiane,” a term describing citizens of the Russian Federation regardless of their ethnicity or nationality. The Russian Federation’s 140 million residents include over 10 million Muslims and many other ethnic, national and religious minorities.  While the Freedom of Russia Legion has used less explicitly fascist language and symbols, it too has a clear far-right orientation. In a recent social media post, it declared that ethnic Russians are “the most oppressed” nationality in the Russian Federation today. One of its members is Igor Volobuyev, a native of Ukraine and the former vice-chairman of Gazprombank, one of Russia’s largest banks.  Just as with the central role of Ukrainian fascist and neofascist formations in the Ukrainian army, the involvement of these Russian far-right organizations in the NATO war exposes the true aim of the imperialist powers: the breakup of the Russian Federation through the fostering of ethnic and national conflicts. The aim of the promotion and arming of these forces is the establishment of far-right puppet regimes directly subservient to the imperialist powers.  The Putin regime has nothing to offer in response to this imperialist strategy except the promotion of a different form of Great Russian chauvinism and desperate efforts, through a combination of militarism and appeals for negotiations with the imperialist powers, to defend the interests of the oligarchy that arose out of the Stalinist dissolution of the Soviet Union.  The beginning of a new, dangerous phase in the war points to the urgent need for workers to intervene in the political situation, based on an independent, socialist program and perspective. The further spiraling of the conflict into a Third World War, fought with nuclear weapons, can only be prevented through the mobilization of the working class in an internationally unified struggle against capitalism.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvbWJxei1tMjMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Wazirabad"", ""Punjab"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-22T17:37:00","Former prime minister Imran Khan gestures as he speaks during an interview with AFP at his residence in Lahore on May 18, 2023. — AFP  PTI chief received luxury tax notice from Punjab's excise department.  Former PM pays Rs1,440,000 in taxes for Zaman Park residence.  Earlier, notice had directed Khan to clear arrears amounting to Rs3.6m.  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Monday paid over Rs1.4 million in “luxury tax” for his Zaman Park residence in Lahore.  The development came after the PTI chief received a luxury tax notice from Punjab's Excise and Taxation Department earlier today — which he has to pay on May 22 (today).  The former prime minister paid Rs1,440,000 in taxes for his Zaman Park house where he has been recuperating since he was injured in an assassination attempt in Wazirabad on November 3 2022.  Even though the last date for filing the tax was May 22, the notice was sent today.  The PTI chief’s old house in Zaman Park had been demolished, while a new house was constructed in its place which is owned by him and his sisters, said the Excise and Taxation Department.  The taxation department added that a record of the house was sought from Khan last month which he submitted. After estimation, according to the provincial tax collecting authority, a luxury tax challan worth Rs1,440,000 was sent to the deposed prime minister, who was removed from power via a vote of no-confidence in April last year.  Last month, the department issued a notice to the cricketer-turned-politician's mother, the late Shaukat Khanum, for assessment of luxury house tax.  The notice had directed Khan to clear arrears under the luxury tax amounting to Rs3.6 million. According to sources, the Excise and Taxation Department dispatched a two-member team comprising ETO Adeel Amjad and Inspector Amna Rashid to Zaman Park to deliver the notice.  According to a notification available with The News, the notice was served in the name of Imran Khan’s late mother's Zaman Park residence. His late mother, a housewife, passed away around 38 years ago in 1985 due to cancer. The property continues to be in her name.  To deliver the notice, a two-person excise and taxation team travelled to Zaman Park. The PTI chairman owes Rs3.6 million in taxes, as per the department. It was also alleged that if no compliance with the notice is made, the Election Commission of Pakistan would be approached.  However, talking to The News, Excise Officer Adeel Amjid said that in case of failure to comply with the notice, an ex-parte assessment will be conducted. He further added that the department would not approach the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) if Khan doesn't cooperate because it was not the domain of the excise department to move the electoral body.  He also rejected the element of political victimisation and added that the department had decided to go through an assessment of all luxury homes of two or more than two Kanals.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDg4Nzk0LWltcmFuLWtoYW4tcGF5cy1vdmVyLXJzMTQtbWlsbGlvbi1pbi1sdXh1cnktdGF4LWZvci16YW1hbi1wYXJrLXJlc2lkZW5jZdIBZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9hbXAvNDg4Nzk0LWltcmFuLWtoYW4tcGF5cy1vdmVyLXJzMTQtbWlsbGlvbi1pbi1sdXh1cnktdGF4LWZvci16YW1hbi1wYXJrLXJlc2lkZW5jZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Ahvaz"", ""Khuzestan"", ""Iran""}","2023-05-22T14:12:57","President Ebrahim Raisi has appointed the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Strategic Center, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, as the new Secretary of the National Security Council.  Ahmadian will replace Admiral Ali Shamkhani, who held the position for 10 years.  Via Twitter, Shamkhani posted an excerpt from an Iranian poem on Sunday “alluding to media speculation about his resignation,” Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news outlet reported.  According to the Iranian Nour News outlet, the Twitter post means that “Shamkhani will definitely resign.”  Ahmadian began his career as the commander of the IRGC navy in 1997, and in 2000 became the chief of the IRGC Joint Staff. He is a Tehran University graduate who received a Ph.D. in strategic management from the Supreme National Defense University of Iran.  His replacement of Shamkhani “marks a significant shift in the country’s security leadership” and “reflects the dynamic nature of Iran’s political landscape,” Chinese-based news outlet BNN Breaking wrote on 22 May.  “Effective leadership remains crucial in addressing complex security concerns, and Ahmadian’s appointment signals a commitment to navigating these challenges with a new perspective,” it added.  Shamkhani played a leading role in the country’s political scene for decades and was among the main Iranian officials involved in the recent Chinese-brokered restoration of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The news comes days in the wake of a speech by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s stressing the importance of “flexibility” in foreign policy, adding that flexibility “does not have to compromise one’s principles.”  This is the second time Tehran has restructured its leadership in a year.  Following the assassination of several nuclear scientists and IRGC officials between 2021 and 2022, Iran replaced the head of the country’s intelligence unit, who had held the post for 12 years.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGUtdmlldy8yNTExMS9pcmFuLXJlcGxhY2VzLWhlYWQtb2YtbmF0aW9uYWwtc2VjdXJpdHktY291bmNpbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2019-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-22T17:24:56","The Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) alliance with the controversial Free Cause Party (HÜDA-PAR) and the latter’s resulting representation in the Turkish parliament have sparked widespread dissent and numerous protests throughout Turkey.  The roots of the outrage stem from HÜDA-PAR’s alleged ties to an extremist militant group called Hizbullah and its regressive stance on social issues — factors that many perceive to be at odds with democratic principles. The AKP’s alliance with HÜDA-PAR continues to dominate the public discourse as a runoff election approaches, stoking opposition and widespread discontent.  Turkey is poised to hold a runoff on May 28 following initial results from the May 14 presidential election that showed incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan failing to secure a victory against his secular rival, Republican People’s Party (CHP) leader Kılıçdaroğlu.  According to the official results, Erdoğan received 49.52 percent of the vote, while Kılıçdaroğlu, the candidate of the opposition bloc Nation Alliance, garnered 44.88 percent.  According to the yet unofficial results of the parliamentary elections, the Public Alliance, comprising Erdoğan’s ruling AKP, its far-right ally the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), the Islamist New Welfare Party (YRP), and the nationalist Grand Unity Party (BBP), secured a parliamentary majority, amassing 321 of 600 seats in total.  HÜDA-PAR secured four seats in parliament in the elections, having been elected from AKP’s candidate lists.  The AKP’s choice to ally with HÜDA-PAR, in spite of the latter’s alleged connections to Hizbullah, has drawn harsh criticism from diverse segments of society. Hizbullah is an extremist militant group designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey. It has been accused of kidnappings, torture and targeted assassinations, predominantly aimed at individuals linked with Kurdish political movements. Notorious incidents such as the kidnapping and murder of Muslim feminist author Konca Kuris in 1999 and the assassination of Diyarbakır’s police chief Gaffar Okkan in 2001 have marred HÜDA-PAR’s past with violence since the party’s history is inextricably linked with Hizbullah.  Following the decision to end an armed insurgency in 2002, individuals with ties to Hizbullah founded an association known as Solidarity with the Oppressed (Mustazaflar ile Dayanışma Derneği or Mustazaf-Der) in 2003. The association then became known as the Movement of the Oppressed (Mustazaflar Hareketi). A large gathering was organized by Mustazaf-Der in Diyarbakır in April 2010 to commemorate the Islamic prophet Muhammad’s birthday (Mawlid), with crowd estimates ranging from 2 to 2.5 million attendees. Shortly after, however, a court in Diyarbakır ordered the closure of the association on the grounds of “conducting activities on behalf of the terrorist organization Hizbullah,” a decision upheld by the Supreme Court of Appeals in May 2012.  The Movement of the Oppressed subsequently declared its intention to form a political party in late 2012, intending to challenge the dominance of the left-wing, pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP). The Free Cause Party (Hür Dava Partisi or HÜDA-PAR) was founded on Dec. 19, 2012. The party’s name is an allusion to the name Hizbullah, as the former means “Party of Allah” in Arabic, while the latter name’s abbreviation, HÜDA-PAR, connotes the same, as HÜDA means God/Allah in Kurdish. The party was founded on the principles of Kurdish nationalism and Sunni Islamism.  Since its inception in 2012, HÜDA-PAR has run in the parliamentary elections of June 2015 and 2018, abstaining from the November 2015 re-runs. In the 2018 presidential elections and again in 2023, the party supported Erdoğan. With its extreme viewpoints on social matters, the party has secured marginal electoral support, acquiring less than 1 percent of the vote in past elections.  For the 2023 Turkish parliamentary elections held on May 14, HÜDA-PAR entered the race as part of the AKP list vying for four seats. The AKP’s decision to ally with HÜDA-PAR angered many, who pointed to the party’s history with Hizbullah.  HÜDA-PAR can be described as an extreme Islamist party and the political wing of the Hizbullah. The party calls for constitutional recognition of the Kurds and Kurdish language, education in one’s mother tongue, the decentralization of state power and the strengthening of local administration. It also advocates for the lifting of restrictions on freedom of religion and worship, the criminalization of adultery and the recognition of religious marriages. Moreover, HÜDA-PAR calls for gender segregation in education and advocates increased gender segregation in public spaces with women incentivized for women-only jobs. The party opposes LGBT rights and routinely criticizes the HDP for its support of them.  In addition to these policies, Zekeriya Yapıcıoğlu, the leader of HÜDA-PAR, has sparked further controversy by refusing to label both Hizbullah and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) as terrorist organizations. His comments regarding Hizbullah from last year have recently resurfaced on social media, intensifying the debate. Yapıcıoğlu responded to inquiries about Hizbullah’s status with a definitive “No,” clarifying, “You call them terrorist organizations; I call them PKK and Hizbullah.” This further underscores the tensions surrounding HÜDA-PAR’s political stance and its inclusion in the ruling coalition.  Public protests have surged across stadiums during football matches, turning these sporting events into platforms for expressing public dissatisfaction with and opposition to HÜDA-PAR. Chants such as “We don’t want Hizbullah in the parliament” reverberate among spectators, reflecting their anxiety over the party’s alleged affiliations and potential impact on Turkey’s political landscape.  Critics contend that the party’s repressive stance on women’s rights is incompatible with the tenets of a modern, inclusive society.  With the runoff election on the horizon, the alliance between the AKP and HÜDA-PAR has become a central issue in Turkey’s political arena. The historical ties of HÜDA-PAR with Hizbullah, its radical ideology and concerns surrounding women’s rights have incited opposition and wide-ranging dissatisfaction. The election results will not only dictate Turkey’s future path but will also provide insight into the level of acceptance of ideologies tied to HÜDA-PAR within Turkey’s democratic framework.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50dXJraXNobWludXRlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL3Byb3Rlc3QtZXNjYWxhdGUtZmFyLXJpZ2h0LWlzbGFtaXN0LXBhcnR5LXdpdGgtYWxsZWdlZC10aWVzLXRvLW1pbGl0YW50LWdyb3VwLWVudGVycy1wYXJsaWFtZW50L9IBiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50dXJraXNobWludXRlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIyL3Byb3Rlc3QtZXNjYWxhdGUtZmFyLXJpZ2h0LWlzbGFtaXN0LXBhcnR5LXdpdGgtYWxsZWdlZC10aWVzLXRvLW1pbGl0YW50LWdyb3VwLWVudGVycy1wYXJsaWFtZW50Lw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Arnolfo ""Arnie"" Teves Jr., the alleged mastermind behind his killing on March 4, 2023. ABS-CBN News/file  MANILA — One of the suspects in the assassination of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo has recanted his earlier statements pointing to suspended lawmaker Arnolfo ""Arnie"" Teves Jr. as the crime's alleged mastermind, claiming that he was coerced and tortured to say so.  Degamo slay suspect Osmundo Rivero filed a counter-affidavit and an affidavit recanting his previous testimonies before the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday, his lawyer Harold Montalbo said.  Montalbo said his client recanted his earlier admission of planning and carrying out the March 4 armed attack at Degamo's private compound in Pamplona, Negros Oriental that killed the governor and 9 others.  In a five-page counter-affidavit, Rivero claimed that he was coerced into saying that Teves was behind the killing.  Rivero also alleged that he was tortured into linking Teves while under police custody, adding that officers allegedly threatened to hurt his family if he did not cooperate.  Philippine National Police Chief Gen. Benjamin Acorda Jr. said he did not receive any information on the alleged torture.  He also declined to comment on the Degamo killing probe.  ""Baka mamaya ma-misquote ako e it might cause some negative on the investigation. Paumanhin na lang po let the investigation take its course,"" he said in a chance interview.  (I could be misquoted and it might cause some negative consequence on the investigation. Sorry, but let the investigation take its course.)  Meanwhile, Montalbo has also requested to reopen the murder, frustrated murder, and attempted murder charges filed against his client.  Rivero's recantation came a week after the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) formally filed murder charges against Teves over the assassination of his political rival.  Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla earlier said that 6 to 7 suspects in the slay had lawyered up and were no longer talking.  ""They were provided with lawyers by some people who are paying for their lawyers who were not there before and obviously, some people are interested in the statements that they want to give and now they don’t want to cooperate anymore with authorities,” Remulla said last week, without saying if Rivero was among them.  Degamo's widow, Pamplona Mayor Janice Degamo, also said that she was not surprised by the suspects' refusal to cooperate with authorities.  She expressed confidence that the cases against Teves and the other suspects behind the former governor's death would still hold up in court.  ""Hindi naman po lahat ng kasong kriminal na may mga pagbawi sa kanilang mga testimony ay will end up na nasasayang lang kasi may nananalo pa ring mga kaso,"" Degamo told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo last week.  (Not all criminal cases that see testimonies recanted would go to waste because some of these cases still end up with suspects getting convicted.)  — With report from Mike Navallo, ABS- CBN News","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnMtY2JuLmNvbS9uZXdzLzA1LzIyLzIzL3N1c3BlY3QtcmVjYW50cy1zdGF0ZW1lbnRzLWxpbmtpbmctdGV2ZXMtdG8tZGVnYW1vLXNsYXnSAWJodHRwczovL25ld3MuYWJzLWNibi5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMDUvMjIvMjMvc3VzcGVjdC1yZWNhbnRzLXN0YXRlbWVudHMtbGlua2luZy10ZXZlcy10by1kZWdhbW8tc2xheQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Mandwa"", ""Rajasthan"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T07:09:00","Thrillers are the most popular shows on streaming platforms, and Hindi OTT channels do this genre well, even of some of the series are adapted from foreign sources.  The crime thriller can be subdivided into the police procedural, of which Dahaad (on Amazon Prime) is the latest example, gangster tales, spy and military adventures, legal dramas and supernatural yarns.  Often, the subgenres overlap, but a defining thread appears.  With the disclaimer that it is not possible to have seen every cop thriller that dropped on the multitude of steaming platforms, here a pick of 10 watchable cop shows by year of release.  Sacred Games  Where to watch? Netflix  IMAGE: Saif Ali Khan in Sacred Games.  This was in 2018, before the OTT boom caused by the pandemic.  Netflix, looking to expand in the Indian, market, wanted to create original Indian content, and Vikramaditya Motwane created the eight-episode first season of Sacred Games, based on Vikram Chandra's novel, and co-directed with Anurag Kashyap.  Saif Ali Khan was the first major star to enter the world of Web shows, playing Chandra's brooding cop, Sartaj Singh, facing off against ruthless gangster Ganesh Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui in his star-making role) and trying to unravel his father's past.  The series had on his high-powered ensemble cast: Radika Apte, Pankaj Tripathi, Kubra Sait, Rajshri Deshpande, Amruta Subhash and others who went on to become OTT stars.  Not strictly a straight police procedural, but an early mover in the OTT space, and quite different in approach and execution from the cop dramas on satellite TV till then.  Season 2 was not as good, and Season 3 was reportedly dropped.  Delhi Crime  Where to watch? Netflix  IMAGE: Shefali Shah in Delhi Crime.  One of the best Indian police procedurals based on the real-life Nirbhaya rape case, created by Richie Mehta, the Netflix series starred Shefali Shah as Delhi DCP Vartika Chaturvedi, who has to solve the horrific rape of a young woman, that led to her death.  With a dogged approach the angry cop and her harried assistants (Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang) investigate the crime and nab the culprits.  Low-ley, realistic, non-sensational, the powerful show became the first Indian series to receive an International Emmy for Outstanding Drama series.  It also gave Shefali Shah's almost dormant career a fresh lease of life.

The meeting will be the first significant international event in Kashmir since New Delhi stripped the Muslim-majority region of semi-autonomy in 2019. Indian authorities are hoping the meeting will show that the controversial changes have brought “peace and prosperity” to the region.  The government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has announced protests and rallies throughout the region on Monday against the G-20 summit in Srinagar city and human rights abuses in the Indian-administered section.  “Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari will address the joint session of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly and Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council in Muzaffarabad on Monday,” the state-run Radio Pakistan reported.  “He will reiterate Pakistan’s unwavering support to the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for right to self-determination.”  Ties between bitter rivals India and Pakistan stand frozen since August 5, 2019, when New Delhi revoked the semi-autonomous status of the part of Kashmir it controls, dividing it into two federally administered territories.  The Muslim-majority Himalayan region has been a bone of contention between Pakistan and India since their independence from British rule in 1947. Both neighbors rule parts of the Himalayan territory, but claim it in full and have fought two of their four wars over the disputed region.  Pakistan calls the revocation of Kashmir’s autonomy part of New Delhi’s alleged attempts to change the demography of the region and has demanded the world fraternity take notice of it.  But New Delhi has countered the objections, saying it is free to hold meetings on its own territory.  Since the 2019 changes, Srinagar, known for rolling Himalayan foothills and exquisitely decorated houseboats, has become a major domestic tourist destination. Hotels have been mostly booked out for months. Kashmir has also drawn millions of visitors, who enjoy a strange peace kept by ubiquitous security checkpoints, armored vehicles and patrolling soldiers.  For the G20 meeting, the city has spruced up its commercial center and roads leading to the convention center on Dal Lake, while police have increased security even further, placing a massive security cordon around the site.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzg3MS9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Three members of a farmers’ group have been arrested and accused of plotting to oust him in a 'peasant revolution.' (Photo:AFP)  Three senior members of a farmers’ group in Cambodia have been arrested for holding training workshops amid allegations that they were plotting a ""peasant revolution"" which has been likened to the one instigated by Pol Pot.  The arrests of three members of the Coalition of Cambodian Farmers Community (CCFC) were made as the authorities turned their attention from the successful staging of the Southeast Asia (SEA) Games to the July 23 election, which has invited criticism from the West and human rights units for the treatment of opposition parties.  Theng Savoeun, CCFC president, and Nhel Pheap and Than Hach, its advocacy officers, face up to two years behind bars if convicted of incitement to commit a felony or cause social unrest under Articles 494 and 495 of the Criminal Code.  More universal than Catholicism?  Mary among Asian religions  Interior ministry spokesperson, Khieu Sopheak, told the independent CamboJA News outlet that Savoeun had confessed to his activities while likening the plot to a Pol Pot-styled “peasant revolution” with evidence supporting the allegations found on his computer.  It included “a manuscript teaching the people to make the peasant revolution,” Sopheak said. “What did the peasant revolution try to do?”  “It was necessary to overthrow the capitalists, the oppressed classes — whoever you are — and millions of people died because of the peasant revolution…”  ""More than 100 CNRP supporters have been handed prison sentences""  Pol Pot and his hardline communists, the Khmer Rouge, devastated Cambodia when they ruled between 1975 and early 1979, resulting in the deaths of about 2 million people, amid a 30-year civil war, which resulted in the long-ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) coming to power.  The CPP is the only party capable of winning the upcoming elections, a task made easier by the National Election Committee (NEC) since it banned the opposition Candlelight Party (CLP) from contesting the polls for failing to provide original documents regarding its formation.  Charges of plotting to oust Prime Minister Hun Sen have been made against independent media groups, the CLP and its predecessor — the outlawed Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP).  More than 100 CNRP supporters have been handed prison sentences, often in absentia. Its leader Kem Sokha is serving a 27-year sentence for treason while other members, like the Khmer Bible editor Theary Seng, are also serving lengthy jail terms.  On May 19, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights sent a letter to the G7 meeting in Japan to express their “grave concerns about the state of human rights and democracy” in Southeast Asia and in Cambodia.  “The situation related to human rights and democracy has drastically deteriorated in Cambodia in recent years, notably since Hun Sen used the country’s courts to dissolve the opposition CNRP in 2017, shortly after it had run close to his CPP in successive nationwide elections,” leading human rights lawmakers from Southeast Asia told the G7 gathering in Hiroshima.  The opposition in Cambodia is riddled by defections, while the NEC has disqualified the Khmer United Great Nation Party, a minor political outfit, from its first election, also for failing to provide the correct paperwork.  According to the pro-government Khmer Times, about 120 CLP and former CNRP members have defected to the ruling CPP. One CLP youth group member was cited as saying the government’s successful handling of the Games was partly behind her decision to join the CPP.  ""A disappointing development which weakens the choice available to the Cambodian people""  However, an apology from CLP politician Chea Poch was not as well received by Hun Sen.  He sent a letter to the prime minister admitting that he had said “the struggle to overthrow” Hun Sen during a meeting with party activists. This was picked up by the semi-official Fresh News, alleging he was also plotting to overthrow the government.  Chea Poch insisted he meant a peaceful non-violent change through the ballot box and that he rejected the report claiming “my goal is to overthrow Hun Sen.""  But the Khmer Times quoted a letter from Hun Sen, saying the apology was unacceptable and that Chea Poch had also referred to a “military coup d’état, using the color revolution” with the goal of overthrowing his government “to the point of assassination.”  Meanwhile, Britain added its voice to the banning of the CLP from contesting the election, saying in a statement that “this is a disappointing development which weakens the choice available to the Cambodian people.”  British ambassador, Dominic Whiting, added that he hoped the CLP appeal “will conclude with a decision in keeping with the spirit of multi-party democracy.”  Australia, France, Germany and the European Union have also criticized the NEC’s disqualification of the CLP, while the United States has yet to issue a formal statement.  The Cambodian authorities dismissed the criticism, saying the NEC’s decision-making process was designed to “provide a free, fair, just, and transparent voting process” and that this will not “affect the liberal, pluralistic and democratic nature of the country.”  Lend your helping hand!

"political assassination","2023-08-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-23T00:15:10","NEW DELHI, India — India on Aug. 15 celebrated 76 years of independence.  This year’s Independence Day was very different. The Indian flag was everywhere; on cars, taxis, trucks, homes and government buildings. The country celebrated its true identity — Bharat, the Sanskrit name of India.  Sanskrit, the world’s oldest language, is part of India’s cultural identity. But the country’s LGBTQ+ and intersex community is still searching for true inclusion in different government and private institutions.  The Indian Supreme Court in 2018 struck down the colonial-era law that criminalized homosexuality. Four years later, on Aug. 15, Prime Minister Narenda Modi addressed the national from the Red Fort in Delhi, and talked about his vision for the country by 2047, but he did not specifically address the LGBTQ+ and intersex community.  The Indian government and private institutions do not allow people to choose gender-neutral or genderfluid identity markers. The use of appropriate pronouns for the LGBTQ+ and intersex community in public or private institutions is not very common either.  The Washington Blade sought comment from the Indian Post, the world’s most heavily used mail system, for comment on the issue, but it did not reply.  The Indian Post offers a variety of mail, insurance and banking services to its customers. While analyzing the saving account opening form, the Blade found that there are only three gender options: Male, female and other.  The Supreme Court in 2014 recognized Transgender people as the third gender in a landmark ruling and ordered the government to provide welfare programs to the community.  “It is the right of every human being to choose their gender,” said the Supreme Court.  The available gender options force one to identify either with male, female, or other as trans even if they are not any of these. The Madras High Court in 2021 laid out an agenda of inclusion for the LGBTQ+ and intersex community, but the majority of government and private institutions are still far from following these rulings.  The Blade also contacted public sector banks as well as private ones like HDFC Bank; Central Board of Secondary Education; a national level education board; Axis Bank and the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, but received no response.  The Blade reached out to the Bank of Baroda, one of the country’s public sector banks.  A person with the bank’s HR team hung up the phone when asked to comment. The bank has a branch in New York, but it did not respond to a request for comment.  Not everything, however, is as bad as it seems.  Kerala, a state in southern India, in January 2021 decided to include “Transgender” as the option in all government forms for a more inclusive approach. Following the Supreme Court judgment, the state established a district board for the Trans community that can respond to trans-specific ID cards.  Government and private institutions are failing to achieve complete gender inclusivity — including the use of proper pronouns — in spite of efforts to enact progressive policies for India’s Trans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and intersex communities.  Tamil Nadu, another state in southern India, on Aug. 20 published a document from its Social Welfare and Women Empowerment Department.  The document included a glossary of terms to be used to address the LGBTQ+ and intersex community, and it came from the Madras High Court. The Tamil Nadu government mandates the use of terms from the glossary in all institutions, including the media, to address community members. It includes “thirunangai” (Trans women,) “thirunambi” (Trans men,) “pal puthumaiyar” (queer) and “oodupal” (intersex.)  Many high school students with whom the Blade spoke said the use of these terms would be a positive step towards inclusivity, but private schools and other institutions do not provide many options for those who want to select their gender.  The Blade in December 2021 reported the National Council of Educational Research and Training published a manual to make teachers and students more sensitive to LGBTQ+ and intersex issues. It was meant to create a more inclusive environment for Trans students, but the organization withdrew the manual after conservative activists protested.  To make sense of how gender identity and sensitization about gender can affect students in schools, one must look back at February of this year, when a student of Delhi Public School, a premier private school, died by suicide by jumping off his residential building. His mother in a complaint she filed with the police alleged her teenaged son faced extreme harassment at school over his sexuality.  Changes in colleges and universities are also coming, but the pace is slow.  The Blade in April reported that the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research became India’s first gender-neutral university. With this new policy, the university also included the gender-neutral prefix Mx.  The Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, a premier institution in India, and other central government-funded institutions have accepted and are supporting LGBTQ+ and intersex inclusion by allowing the formation of an LGBTQ+ and intersex club at the campus. But gender options other than male, female and other, are still not available on the institute’s entrance exam or during the admission process.  “We agree that despite various rulings and judgments passed by the Supreme Court, there is still a long way to go for having better inclusion in government institutions. Though from having ‘male’ and ‘female’ as the only two default options to choose from, there has been increasing inclusion of ‘genderfluid’, ‘others’, ‘prefer not to say,’ etc., as categories of identity in many, if not all, places,” said Khushi, a representative of Saathi, an LGBTQ+ and intersex support group and a club at the Indian Institute of Technology. “Yet to make this phenomenon or this change a habit or routine, there is a lot that needs to happen. Given the way Indian society is structured, this entire idea many a time falls on deaf ears.”  Khushi from Saathi (Photo courtesy of Khushi)  Saathi throughout the year organizes workshops, movie screenings and informal meetings for everyone, including straight people who want to understand the community.  “To bring about a change, the government bodies have to consistently use inclusive language across its portals. Being inclusive in the school/college admission process as well as a further commitment to a gender inclusive and friendly environment can go a long way,” said Khushi. “Apart from that government can support already existing academic level and independent organizations that uphold the LGBTQIA+ cause. Anti-harassment policies can be gender neutral. In case of universities there can be courses that run-in sex and gender identity. There can be compulsory nonbinary gender orientations. There are many other things that can be done but the point is that though slowly but surely some change is coming through.”  Instagram in 2021 announced the inclusion of the LGBTQ+ and intersex community by providing the option to add pronouns. But Meta’s picture-sharing app is still far from providing the Indian LGBTQ+ and intersex community with this feature.  The Blade reached out to Meta for a comment on the issue, but the company, which faces accusations of failing to prevent the incitement of violence in neighboring Myanmar, did not respond to multiple requests.  While talking with the Blade, Kumaresh Ramesh, a former Saathi coordinator, said that even though the courts have decriminalized same-sex relationships and advanced the rights of people in the Trans community, there is a lot of work left to be done to mainstream acceptance in the society.  Ramesh graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology last year and is no longer part of Saathi. While expressing his opinion, he suggested some measures which can help normalization of other gender and pronoun use.  “While one can litigate in court for enforcing these changes, we should also work on organically making it commonplace. For instance, if we make it a point to state our preferred pronouns and encourage others to do so, the government will eventually have to follow suit. I would like to request professors and teachers across disciplines to also state their preferred pronouns while they introduce themselves. This could be a small but powerful step towards fostering acceptance,” said Ramesh.  “Although IIT Bombay is centrally-funded and the current central government has not come out in support of the LGBTQ community, the administration has been largely supportive of Saathi, especially in the more recent years as awareness about the community has gone up. Talking about the government, intent is the key. If the government wishes to further the acceptance of the community, the importance of diversity and inclusion should be taught to school students. Greater representation of the community in school curriculum will increase acceptance not just in the young generation but also their parents and grandparents.”  Neysara, the founder of Transgender India, an online portal that supports the trans community and creates awareness, said that preferred gender-neutral pronouns are important for the Indian Trans community. She also said that to make preferred/gender-neutral pronouns one of the centerpieces of Indian Trans discourse would be a prime example of blindly copy-pasting western Trans discourse to India without any understanding of the cultural context.  “Forget the pronouns printed in a form, most Trans people in the country are not even allowed to enter SBI (one of India’s largest public sector bank) or a post office,” said Neysara. “How will they even see this form? Such tokenistic moves of printing a word on a form is super easy, what’s more difficult is inclusion, reform and sensitization. That’s what we need in any office.”  Neysara, founder of Transgender India, an Indian Trans rights group.

"political assassination","2019-12-15","Not Discerned","{""Nagpur"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T08:30:41","New Delhi: It was time. Everything was ready for the biggest function in the school – a grand stage, a hall decorated with magnificent lighting, jam packed audience seats, and high-profile chief guests: Union minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda, Puducherry governor Kiran Bedi and several ministers from Karnataka.  And then the curtains were up.  At least 100 students – most of them from Class 11 and 12 – dressed in white shirts, white pants and saffron dhotis, some carrying saffron flags, ran towards the centre of the stage where a huge poster of the Babri Masjid was placed. That’s when the narrator announced (in Kannada) on a loudspeaker, “They demolish the structure with anything they can get their hands on. With enthusiasm, Hanuman bhakts, with Hanuman’s anger, demolish the Babri structure.” As the narrator, the students on the stage and the audience cheered in excitement — ‘Bolo Shri Ramachandra ki Jai! Bajrang Bali ji jai, Bharat Mata ki, Jai!’ – the poster of the Babri Masjid was torn down.  This was the School Day function at Sri Rama Vidya Kendra High School located in Kalladka, Dakshina Kannada district, Karnataka. On December 15, 2019 – around a month after the Supreme Court ruling which called the demolition of the Babri Masjid a ‘violation of law’ – the students of this school were made to enact the demolition. The school is owned by a powerful RSS leader from Karnataka, Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who defended the play in front of the media: “It is not a mosque. It is just a building. It is a historical event that we are depicting… Who are Babur’s children? We are not against Muslims. We are against terrorists. The play was done to show historical events and what is the problem with it.” Bhat is also known as one of the political mentors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  This was not the first time that a school run by the RSS was accused of indoctrinating its students with Islamophobia and other undemocratic, unconstitutional and intolerant beliefs.  Bhonsala Military School (BMS) in Nagpur has been linked to various attacks by Hindu extremists in the recent past. During the investigation into the 2008 Malegaon blasts and 2006 Nanded bomb blast case, Maharashtra Anti-Terror Squad (ATS) found — (1) training camps were organised in BMS where several terror-accused were trained, and (2) meetings, to plan the bombings, were held in BMS between the accused, senior RSS leaders and their affiliates. According to an Outlook article on the Maharashtra Military Foundation, Pune — run by Lt Col (Retd) Jayant Chitale — the school’s visitor’s book, which also preserves the names of all the men trained on campus, revealed that Shrikant Prasad Purohit, who later became an accused in the Malegaon bomb blast case, was also enrolled there.  The past, the present  Under the leadership of M.S. Golwalkar, in the year 1946, the RSS established its first school in Kurukshetra named Gita School. But the ban on the RSS, soon after the assassination of M.K. Gandhi by Nathuram Godse in 1948, put a roadblock on the expansion of the Gita School model. After the ban was lifted, in the year 1952, RSS leaders Krishna Chandra Gandhi, Bhaurao Deoras and Nanaji Deshmukh together laid the foundation stone of India’s first Saraswati Shishu Mandir in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, in a building rented at a monthly rent of Rs 5.  With time, such schools began to be established across several locations in Uttar Pradesh. To manage and coordinate their functioning, a state-level Shishu Shiksha Prabandak Samiti was set up. Later on, with the expansion of these schools to other states, such committees were also set up in Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Similarly, Sarvhitkari Shiksha Samiti was established in Punjab and Chandigarh while Haryana had a Hindu Shiksha Samiti.  In the year 1977, an apex all-India body named Vidya Bharati Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Sansthan (Vidya Bharati) was formed to coordinate the activities between these state committees and administer all the schools run by the RSS across the country. The registered office of Vidya Bharati was in Lucknow, while the functional headquarters were in Delhi. In their book titled RSS, School Texts and the Murder of Mahatma Gandhi: The Hindu Communal Project, Professors Aditya Mukherjee, Mridula Mukherjee and Sucheta Mahajan highlight that by the time this body was formed, “there were already about 500 RSS schools in the country with around 20,000 students enrolled in them”.  Their book explains the trajectory of expansion of Vidya Bharati schools:  “In the early 1990s the BJP governments in states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh encouraged the growth of Vidya Bharati schools and even permitted them to set their own syllabus and conduct examinations for the lower classes and run teacher training programmes. By 1993–94 the total number of schools run by Vidya Bharati was claimed to be 6,000 with 40,000 teachers and 1,200,000 students. With state power coming to the BJP at the centre in 1998, the RSS influence in schools took a quantum leap. In 1999, there were reportedly 14,000 Vidya Bharati schools with 80,000 teachers and 1,800,000 students… In September 1998, the Kalyan Singh government sought to link all state run schools to the RSS shakha. It was made compulsory for all primary schools in the state to involve RSS pracharaks for imparting Naitik Shiksha or moral education.”  According to Vidya Bharati’s official website, it currently runs 12,828 formal schools across India with more than 3.4 million students enrolled in these schools. It also runs more than 6,400 informal education centres by the name ‘Sanskar Kendras’. The website clearly defines the ‘Mission’ of Vidya Bharati: “To develop a National System of Education which would help building a generation of young men and women that is committed to Hindutva and infused with patriotic fervour; physically, vitally, mentally and spiritually fully developed; capable of successfully facing challenges of life; dedicated to the service of those of our brothers and sisters who dwell in villages, forests, caves and slums; and are deprived and destitute, so that they are liberated from the shackles of social evils and injustice and thus devoted, may contribute to build up a harmonious, prosperous, and culturally rich Nation [emphasis added].”  The Wire looked into the Vidya Bharati schools and their curriculum, which look designed to promote communal hatred and produce RSS footsoldiers. What follows was revealed from their books, their curriculum and interviews with students and alumni of RSS-run schools in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.  From Vidya Bharati textbooks  “Name the young scientist of Kanpur who invented the Jyoti lamp which burns with cow urine.” – Here’s one of the questions from Bodhmala 5, a book series taught in Vidya Bharati schools.  Vidya Bharti Sanskriti Shiksha Sansthan (VBSSS), headquartered in Kurukshetra, Haryana, publishes a book series named Bodhmala for Classes 4 to 12. Books in this series discuss diverse subjects/topics – history, geography, politics, personalities, martyrs, morals, festivals (only Hindu ones), religious books, science, general knowledge and much more. With no dedicated subject teacher, the students are expected to read these books on their own. However, on the basis of these books, a Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha (All India Culture Examination) is conducted across the country wherein the students scoring more than 50% are given certificates. Students from outside of Vidya Bharati schools also appear in the exam. The Wire learned in its interviews that there have been instances where students from government schools too appeared for the Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha – though this was a choice made by the individual students and not by the schools.

So It’s Also Being Done Secretly’  A deep study of the Bodhmala series reveals that by glorifying Hinduism, projecting it as the only religion in India and attaching an inflated sense of pride to it, all of these books instil the ideology of Hindutva into young minds. The book by Mukherjees and Mahajan writes about the Bodhmala series, “The Vidya Bharati Sansthan claims to be engaged in providing to the young generation education in religion, culture and nationalism. The catechistic series is part of Sansthan’s effort in this direction… Much of the material in these books is designed to promote blatantly communal and chauvinist ideas, and popularise RSS and its policies and programmes.”  National chauvinism and Hindu supremacy  These books make unabashed efforts to gradually suffuse the concept of Hindu supremacy into the minds of students. Every textbook in the Bodhmala series ensures that it fulfils the purpose of (1) establishing India as the origin of all civilisations that have ever existed; (2) referring to the Hindu Sanatan religion as the supreme religion of India by either negating the existence of other religions or by appropriating them; and (3) belittling and ridiculing other nations, their cultures and history. For instance, Bodhmala 8 claims, “Hindu culture is like a deep ocean in which different ideas merge into one. Different cultures and civilizations were born in the world, but today they do not even have a name’ and ‘All human beings originate from India.”  Bodhmala 9 cites a poem —  जब धरती पर घोर जंगली मानव ही बसते थे,  वस्त्र पहनना नहीं जानते, पशुवत ही फिरते थे,  भाषा हीन विचारहीन होकर बात संकेतों से करते…  हिमसागर की पुण्य भूमि पर प्रथम मनुष्य प्रकट हुआ  (When only wild humans used to live on the earth  (They) did not know how to wear clothes, used to roam like animals  Without any language, without any thoughts, talking with signs…  The first man appeared on the holy land of Himsagar)  These books speak in rhetoric, often making unverified, unsupported and illogical claims. Bodhmala 9 says, “Symbols of Hindu culture are inscribed on Greek coins. San Agustin, the holy city of Colombia is named after Rishi Agastya. Legend of Karna is popular in Babylon, the Caspian Sea is the land of Kashyap… There has been an indelible influence of India on the literary tradition and poetry of Malaya and Java. Ramayana is the national book of Shyam Desh. The old name of Iran is Aryaan. The scriptures of the Parsis said — We offer sacrifices to the works of the Aryans.”  The content is filled with false claims with no supporting evidence. For example, Bodhmala 6 states, “This universe has been created from the supreme conscious element ‘Brahma’… Many cultures of the world have originated from this beautiful land of India. It has been an inspiration for mankind all over the earth.” The research by Mukherjees and Mahajan notes the examples mentioned to describe the ‘spread of the light of Aryatva by Bharatiya Manishis’ – “The credit for lighting the lamp of culture in China goes to the ancient Indians. India is the mother country of ancient China. Their ancestors were Indian kshatriyas….The first people who began to inhabit China were Indians. The first people to settle in Iran were Indians (Aryans). The popularity of the great work of the Aryans—Valmiki Ramayana—influenced Yunan (Greece) and there also the great poet Homer composed a version of the Ramayana. The Languages of the indigenous people(Red Indians) of the northern part of America were derived from ancient Indian languages.”  In the year 2005, a committee was set up under the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) of the Ministry of Human Resources Development to discuss the ‘Regulatory Mechanisms for Textbooks and Parallel Textbooks taught in Schools outside the Government System’. It was asked to study and report on both textbooks used in government schools not following the CBSE syllabus, as well as books used in non-government schools, including those run by religious and social organisations. Many experts from different states, various governmental and non-governmental organisations, educational institutions and concerned citizens all over India were brought into the process and gave their suggestions to the committee.  In its report, the committee made stern observations about the textbooks used in schools run by the RSS:  “The textual materials greatly exaggerate ancient India’s achievements without any of the factual and empirical substantiation required to make that case. They also echo the Hindutva chauvinist narratives that present the country as a victim of repeated foreign aggressions and invasions, especially by Muslim rulers. All past achievements are referred back to the ancient pre-Islamic era. The landscape is bereft of all Muslim or Christian cultural or religious presence. History is shown to develop around a single axis, which bifurcates Indian people into true Indians and aliens, as Hindus and others, as victims and tyrants, as invaders and vanquished. The fact that India has since ancient times been a multicultural, multi-religious, syncretic society has not been emphasised sufficiently thus manipulating the future generation into a pattern of narrow-minded and intolerant thinking.”  ‘Akhand Bharat’  The classroom and corridor walls of Vidya Bharati schools are decorated with glossy maps and large graffiti depicting Bharat Mata, as a woman clad in a saffron sari holding the saffron flag – a symbol of Hindutva – accompanied by a lion. Behind her is a map of ‘Akhand Bharat’, the RSS ideal of an undivided India, often referred to as ‘Vrihattara Bharat’, or greater India, which posits that modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka were once a part of India. Many students confirmed that August 14 is celebrated in RSS schools as Akhand Bharat Diwas since RSS believes that it was till August 14, 1947 that India was undivided. Tilak Pal Singh Baghel, an alumnus (2003-05) of Saraswati Shishu Vidhya Mandir, Bhander – a school run by the RSS in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh – told The Wire, “They laid more importance on August 14 than August 15 [Independence Day].”  The curriculum also makes many mentions of an ‘Akhand Bharat’. Bodhmala books mention the ‘ancient names’ of various countries – Moy (Mexico), Aryan/Parshu-desh (Iran), Upaganasthan (Afghanistan), Lava deep (Laos), Varun Dweep (Borneo), Shyam Desh (Thailand), Champa Desh (Vietnam), Brahma Desh (Myanmar), and Malay Dweep (Malaysia). Bodhmala 5 emphasises that “the division of Akhand Bharat engineered by the enemies is getting manifested in our thoughts” and appeals to the students, “We have to make a pledge that we will restore the Akhand Bharat that we worship.”  Also read: Hindutva Fanatics Want to Rewrite History to Hide Their Lack of Contribution to India  Tilak, who works in a multinational company while pursuing his interest in anthropology on the side, said, “‘Our school used to organise essay competitions. Usually, the topics given were reflective of the ideology of Hindutva and Akhand Bharat. I remember in one of the competitions, I got the topic ‘Akhand Bharat ki parikalpana aur us mein Hindutva ka sthan (The concept of Akhand Bharat and the relevance of Hindutva in it).”  For the books used in Vidya Bharati schools in Bihar, the CABE report observed, “They mention that on ‘achieving worthy ‘sanskar’, people began to be called Aryans… and they travelled east and south to spread Vedic culture.” Similarly, on the books used in Uttar Pradesh, the report commented, “The existence of Bharat as one nation in the modern sense of ‘nation’ is projected into the ancient past repeatedly to fill the child’s consciousness with racial national pride.”  Along with the Bodhmala series, VBSSS also publishes guidebooks for teachers – Praveshika (Elementary), Madhyama (Middle) and Uttama (Senior). These books too push the idea of an Akhand Bharat, “…New history proves that today’s independent countries like Trivishtapa (Tibet), Upaganasthan (Afghanistan), Brahmadesh (Myanmar), Sinhala (Sri Lanka) and Kingpurush (Nepal) had once been part of undivided India.”  ‘Hindu Rashtra’  हर बाला देवी की प्रतिमा बच्चा बच्चा राम है  हर शरीर मन्दिर सा पावन है  गाय जहाँ माँ प्यारी है  इसके सैनिक समरभूमि पर गाया करते गीता थे  These lines from Bodhmala 4 construct in young minds an image of India being a Hindu nation by using religious symbols and concepts from Hinduism – Devi, Ram, Temple, Cow and Bhagwad Gita – to describe the nation as a whole. In its very first paragraph, these lines mention India, “The holy mountains, holy rivers, many pilgrimages, temples and gurudwaras were built here from time to time, seeing which we are still holy and blessed.”  Like Bodhmala, Itihas Ga Raha Hai (IGRH) is also a series of supplementary textbooks taught in Vidya Bharati schools. The CABE report made an important observation on the IGRH series taught in Chhattisgarh, “One of the central planks of the RSS is the equation of ‘holyland’ with ‘motherland’– and the claim that because Muslims and Christians have their Meccas elsewhere, they are not fully loyal to the country. The text exhorts children to remember who they are so as not to become slaves again and asks rhetorically, ‘Whose is this country? Whose motherland, fatherland and holyland is it? Whose customs and festivals are celebrated according to the agricultural rhythms and climate of this land? Which people call Sivaji, Rana Pratap, Chandragupta, Bhagwan Ram, Krishna, Dayanand their great leaders?’ (The implication clearly is that festivals like Eid and Christmas are not locally rooted)… The books refer constantly to ‘Mother India’ from whose womb many brave sons were born, who worshipped her and died for her, with the Gita in their hands and Vande Mataram on their lips.”  Who is a Hindu?  The books clearly define ‘Who is a Hindu?’ and add that Hindutva is the “ideal ideology” and the “need of the hour”.  Bodhmala for Class 10 has a separate topic titled ‘Hindu kaun?’ The content explains (in Hindi), “While defining Hindutva, Dr Radhakrishnan said that Hindutva is a way of life, a flow that leads to smooth life and prosperity, a tradition and an ideal that thinks of the welfare of everyone, from humans to animals, birds and all parts of nature” and adds, “Hindutva is the only power that can bring peace to the whole world, happiness and prosperity to mankind. It is the need of the hour. It is an ideal lifestyle which teaches a man to live as a human being…It is not right to consider Hinduism [the text subtly changes ‘हिंदुत्व’ to ‘हिन्दू धर्म’ ] as a communal word.” The theory given by Savarkar in a pamphlet named “Essentials of Hindutva” – which was retitled “Hindutva: Who is Hindu” and reprinted in 1928 – is iterated in the book, “Every citizen living in this country is a Hindu only if they pay respect to this land by considering it as their motherland, fatherland, holyland.”  Mukherjees-Mahajan’s research writes about the different Q&A series present in almost every Bodhmala book: “They present RSS–VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) propaganda in the form of catechisms to be memorised by the faithful as absolute truths.” Here are a few examples to highlight their point —  Q. Who got the first temple built on [sic] the birthplace of Shri Ram in Ayodhya?  A. Shri Ram’s son Maharaja Kush.  Q. Who was the first foreign invader who destroyed the Sri Ram temple?  A. Menander of Greece (150 BC)  Q. Who got the present Rama Temple built?  A. Maharaja Chandragupta Vikramaditya (AD 380–413).  Q. Which Muslim plunderer invaded the temples in Ayodhya in AD 1033?  A. Mahmud Ghaznavi’s nephew Salar Masud.  Q. Which Mughal invader destroyed the Rama Temple in AD 1528?  A. Babur.  Q. Why is Babri Masjid not a mosque?  A. Because Muslims have never till today offered Namaz there.  Q. How many devotees of Rama laid down their life [sic] to liberate Rama temple from A.D. 1528 to A.D. 1914?  A. Three lakh fifty thousand.  Q. How many times did the foreigners invade Shri Ramajanmabhumi?  A. Seventy-seven times.  Q. Which day was decided by Sri Ram Kar Sewa Samiti to start Kar Sewa?  A. October 30, 1990.  Q. Why will 2 November 1990 be inscribed in black letters in the history of India?  A. Because on that day, the then Chief Minister by ordering the Police to shoot unarmed Kar Sewaks massacred hundreds of them.  Q. When were the Shilanyas of the temple laid in Sri Ram Janmabhoomi?  A. 1 November 1989.  Q. What was the number of the struggle for the liberation of Ram Janmabhoomi which was launched on 30 October 1990?  A. 78th struggle.  Some other questions which have been included along with answers are:  Q. ‘When did Ramabhakta Kar Sewaks unfurl the saffron flag on Shri Ramjanmabhumi?’  Q. ‘Mention the names of the young boys who laid down their life while unfurling the saffron flag’.  The CABE report also stated, “Students taking Vidya Bharati’s Sanskriti Gyan Pariksha are made to memorise that 350,000 “Rambhakts” sacrificed their lives to “liberate the temple”.” Vinay Sultan, a 34-year-old journalist who studied in Sharda Bal Niketan, a school run by the RSS in Nagaur, Rajasthan from 1993 to 2005, told The Wire, “‘Vidya Bharati schools in Rajasthan used to have a series named ‘Sanskar Saurav’. They used to talk about the Ramjanmabhumi movement and the Kothari brothers (The Kothari Brothers came to Ayodhya from Kolkata to participate in the Kar Seva in October 1990. They were killed by police while performing the kar seva. Ram was 23 and Sharad was just 20 years old when they were killed.) They used to teach us about all the ‘martyrs’ from Rajasthan who died in the Ramjanmabhumi movement. Later on, one chapter on the Godhra pogrom was also added to the book.” He added, “They used to have a separate paper for Sanskar Saurav and the marks would get counted in the final result. It was one of the main subjects, not a secondary one.”  Also read: Writing a ‘New’ History to Justify the Sangh Parivar’s Agenda  There is also a Q&A on the Kothari brothers in Bodhmala 8. Bodhmala for Class 9 talks about Bhagyachandra who had ‘spread Vaishnavism in Manipur’ and whose ‘grandfather Pamhiba made Hinduism the state religion’. It also mentions Narayan Guru, “The temples built by Narayan Guru became the centres of the organisation of the Hindu society. If Narayan Guru had not done the memorable work of stopping the trend of conversion in Hindu society in Kerala, Hindus would have become minority from majority.” Here’s an excerpt from Bodhmala for Class 6 that talks about the heroes who laid down their lives for the Hindu religion–  “‘You will get money, you will get the kingdom!’  ‘But why?’  ‘Just leave your religion and accept Islam.’  ‘No, never’… And in the end he was killed. The child was Haqeeqat Rai Prithvi Singh.”  Who are ‘others’?  The CABE Committee noted that much of the material in the so-called Sanskrit Jnan series taught in the RSS-run schools is “designed to promote bigotry and religious fanaticism in the name of inculcating knowledge of culture in the young generation.”  Mukherjees-Mahajan’s research highlighted some of the extracts from the reports submitted to the CABE committee”  During the reign of Ashoka, Gaurav Gatha – books published by Saraswati Shishu Mandir Prakashan – for Class 4 says, “Ahimsa began to be … advocated. Every kind of violence began to be considered a crime. Even hunting, sacrifices in yajnas and use of arms began to be considered bad. It had a bad effect on the army. Cowardice slowly spread throughout the kingdom. The state bore the burden of providing food to the Buddhist monks. Therefore people began to become monks. Victory through arms began to be viewed as bad. Soldiers guarding the borders were demoralised…. The preaching of Ahimsa had weakened north India.”  On the rise of Islam, the same book teaches, “Wherever they went, they had a sword in their hand. Their army went like a storm in all the four directions. Any country that came their way was destroyed. Houses of prayers and universities were destroyed. Libraries were burnt. Religious books were destroyed. Mothers and sisters were humiliated. Mercy and justice were unknown to them.’ It spreads Hindutva propaganda masquerading as history, ‘Delhi’s Qutb Minar is even today famous in his (Qutbuddin Aibak) name. This had not been built by him. He could not have been able to build it. It was actually built by emperor Samudragupta. Its real name was Vishnu Stambha…. This Sultan actually got some parts of it demolished and its name was changed.”  ‘Itihaas Gaa Raha Hai’ (IGRH), another supplementary series taught in Shishu Mandir schools, in its book for Class 5 talks about the “forceful conversion” of Hindus: “Innumerable Hindus were forcibly made Musalmans on the point of the sword. The struggle for freedom became a religious war. Innumerable sacrifices were made for religion. We went on and on winning one battle after another. We never allowed foreign rulers to settle down but we could not reconvert our separated brethren to Hinduism.”  In IGRH 12, one of the statements on Christianity reads – “It is because of the conspiratorial policies of the followers of this religion that India was partitioned. Even today Christian missionaries are engaged in fostering anti-national tendencies in Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal, Bihar, Kerala, and other regions of our country because of which there is a grave danger to the integrity of present day India.”  The same book says about Islam – “Thousands of opponents of idol worship, the followers of Islam, go to the pilgrimage centre of Islamic community at Kaaba to worship “Shivalinga”. In Muslim society, the greatest wish is to have a darshan of that black stone (Shivalinga). In another question, children are asked to fill in the blanks ‘rivers of blood’ as an answer to the question on the means by which Prophet Mohammad spread Islam.”  According to the CABE report, these books communalise the psyche of students, sharpen their Hindu identity and provide space and legitimacy for the promotion of crude propaganda against minorities by a two-fold process: “(a) through repeated glorification of Hindu icons, practices, kings and other persons in history and (b) by presenting non-Hindus mostly in highly negative manner and belittling their characters and contributions.”  Pushpendra Singh Baghel, an ex-student from Saraswati Shishu Vidhya Mandir, Bhander, Madhya Pradesh told The Wire, “Every year on Christmas and New Year, our teachers used to say in class that this is not from our culture. This was also written in the magazine Devputra which was distributed in all Vidya Bharati schools.” Vinay Sultan recalled, “In our books ‘Sanskar Saurabh’, sometimes, for Muslims, they would use the words ‘Aakranta’, ‘Videshi Aakranta’, ‘Vidharmi’ etc.” Tilak Pal added, “Devputra had articles by RSS ideologues saying that there were a lot of mistakes made between 1945 and 1949. If they [Muslims] had followed the two-nation theory and built a Muslim country, why didn’t we build a Hindu country?… It had a travelogue series where the writer argued that all the countries in Europe are religiously aligned, mainly to Christianity. When they can have a state religion, why can’t India have it? In all those articles, there was no space for coexistence with other religions…In their entire curriculum, there was no place for secularism. Their ideology enforces that no other community should stay in India other than the Hindus.” He continued, “Our teachers, directly or indirectly, used to teach us that Muslims are people you cannot trust. They would say, ‘Muslims are foreigners. They have come from outside. They are violent. They are all the converted Hindu population who have forgotten their past. These are the ones who left their religion for the fear of life. How can you trust such people?’”  The curriculum establishes a clear and impermeable demarcation between ‘us’ and ‘them’. Bodhmala 7 states, “We believe in pre-birth” – thus clearly demarcating ‘we’ as ‘Hindus/Jains/Buddhists’ since other religions don’t believe in pre-birth. Bodhmala 8 says saffron, the colour associated with the RSS and Hindu rightwing, is a “symbol of quietness, has scientific and chemical qualities and inspires us towards renunciation and sacrifice”. In an attempt to further define ‘us vs them’, Bodhmala 9 says, “Our rituals are not complete without Gangajal…It is our lifestyle to consider Cow, Ganga and Tulsi as motherhood.”  All the students we talked to echoed the same experience – there were hardly 2-3 Muslim students in the entire school. There was no teacher who belonged to the religious minority. No Muslim or Christian festival was celebrated in the school. The principal was a member of the RSS, usually the Shakha Pramukh, and a Brahmin by caste. Most of the students, teachers and headmasters would go to the RSS shakhas regularly.  Distorted history  The CABE report commented on the Vidya Bharati textbooks, “There is no distinction between fact, fiction and mythology… [Bodhmala 7 clearly states “Mahabharata is our history book”] The entire aim of the history written in these textbooks appears to be the projection of the Hindu communal imagination that the Indian nation has always been primarily and essentially a Hindu one, with its most glorious moments and highest achievements unfolding under Hindu kings.” These books focus excessively on the Mughal invasion of India, highlighting its role in the destruction of the Hindu temples. The report discovered statements encouraging bigotry in the Vidya Bharati textbooks, like “Muhammad bin Qasim died the death of a dog… Shivaji protected the cow, dharma, sanskriti, he is known as the protector of cows and Brahmins.” Vinay Sultan said about the curriculum followed in his school, “During all those years, they would focus on all rulers and the characters which had fought against Muslims like Haqeeqat Rai, Maharana Pratap, Chatrapati Shivaji. They walk you slowly and steadily into that Hindutva mindset.”  Bodhmala 10 talks about the ‘Foreign Invasions Of India And Their Counterattacks’, covering the invasion by the Iranian emperor Purush Mahan, Greek emperor Alexander, multiple attacks by Arabs, attacks by Mahmud Ghaznavi, Muhammad Ghori, Alauddin Khilji, Ibrahim Lodi, Vasco da Gama. It clearly states, “In 1947 Pakistan, a part of India, became our enemy. They send unannounced invaders in the form of tribal boys to capture Kashmir. They got some success in the name of Azad Kashmir, but the Indian forces were forced to chase away these invaders.” The Bodhmala books teach a factually incorrect version of the Battle of Haldighati, saying, “…In this fierce battle, Rana Pratap was able to defeat the Mughal soldiers and the battle of Haldighati ended.”  The CABE report notes, “These textbooks exaggerate and valorise the role of certain figures and personalities as against others. When Gandhi and Nehru are perforce mentioned as national leaders, Hindutva leaders are given equal importance… Most books mention that the Muslim League is a communal organisation and rightly so but the communal orientation of the RSS as an organisation openly committed to the launching of a Hindu Rashtra do not find mention in these books.”  Pushpendra told The Wire about a monthly magazine Devputra published by Vidya Bharati, “The magazine used to hail Golwalkar, Savarkar, Hedgewar and other RSS ideologues. They would boast about the contribution of RSS in the Indian freedom struggle. There were articles saying that Nehru had put a ban on the RSS and he used to hate it.”  Tilak revealed the various rumours popular in RSS schools, “Our teachers used to talk in a way that was not very respectful of Gandhi. They would say that if Sardar Patel wasn’t there, the country would have been divided into pieces. Also, they would say that Gandhi didn’t want Bhagat Singh to live. If he had tried enough, he could have saved Bhagat Singh’s life.” About Nehru, he added, “They would say that he was such an elitist that his clothes went to London for laundry. They would raise suspicions like — Why did the Britishers always release him from jail? Why didn’t he die in jail like others? There must be some reason. Also, they would trace Nehru’s ancestry to Afghanistan and would say that he was originally a Muslim and got converted later.”  Tilak told The Wire about what his teachers said about Godse, “They viewed Godse in high regard and considered him a revolutionary. They would say that if he hadn’t killed Gandhi, Gandhi would have caused more damage to the Hindus. I remember a teacher saying in the class — Godse might be having some reasons. Review the files of that case. Nobody would kill someone just like that. There must have been some reason. There are many facts which have been deliberately hidden.”  The CABE report revealed, “In Karnataka, RSS-leaning organisations distribute books in slum literacy centres, but the source of these books is yet to be traced (they are not easily available, being distributed directly). For example, the Infosys library programme distributes supplementary material among government and non-government schools biographies of “great Indians”, mainly published by the Rashtrothana Publication, which is linked to the RSS… Exclusively upper caste Hindu, these icons include religious and mythical figures, rulers, and a handful of reformers, mostly from the Karnataka region… The RSS ideologues are prominent among nationalist leaders, and significantly Gandhi and Nehru are absent.”  Vinay recalled, “Teachers in our school would openly say that Godse did the right thing [by killing Gandhi]. And that Gandhi was responsible for the partition because he wanted to make Nehru the Prime Minister of the country… Books like ‘Maine Gandhi Ko Kyu Maara’ and other RSS literature were openly sold in the school.”  From students to foot soldiers  In a series of interviews, the ex-students of Vidya Bharati schools revealed how the curriculum and the functions and events organised by their schools made them a part of the Hindutva ecosystem. A few of them confessed that they have still not been able to withdraw themselves completely from it.  From men in 60s to young teenage boys, all dressed in crisp khaki shorts, spotless white shirts tucked in, black caps soaring high on their heads, march with an army-like symmetry in what the RSS calls ‘Shakti Pradarshan’ – a display of strength. It further translates into an unabashed and butch display of armed strength by the Hindu right-wing aimed at browbeating the religious minorities in the area. Tilak said, “Every year on Dussehra, they used to parade with open swords, trishuls, lathis, bhaalas, sometimes even firearms. The ‘Shakti Pradarshan’ was carried out in Bhopal, the regional headquarters of both Vidya Bharati and the RSS. Most of the students and teachers from Vidya Bharati participated. Though no official letter was released, teachers used to announce in the class that participation is compulsory. Also, there was an unsaid rule that these parades will be taken out in Muslim-dominated areas to intimidate the people.”  He added,”‘Our teachers would say that along with every big mandir, Muslims have built a masjid. We need to take a stand otherwise our mandirs won’t be saved… There was direct involvement of RSS in our schools. Their leaders would come to the schools and say — You should be prepared to use different types of weapons. Otherwise, how will you protect yourself in times of riots? In classrooms, we were told that Hitler was a great man. He was a nationalist and was fighting for his rights. Teachers would go on to justify ethnic cleansing and would indirectly convey that all the sufferings are because of the Muslims.”  Vinay Sultan, who in his own words “was a dedicated Swayamsevak since the age of 6 and remained so until the last decade”, said, “It was the year 2002, when the Godhra pogrom had happened. I remember how charged up our classrooms were. Teachers would discuss how the Ram bhakts were killed there.” When asked to elaborate, he revealed, “Every month there was a Mukhya Sthan Shakha which was organised and all the shakhas and Vidya Bharati schools in the city would participate in it. Around 15-20 people from my shakha had also joined. I was one of them. I clearly remember that while returning we purposely went through the Muslim dominated areas and raised provocative slogans. We were holding those lathis – we called them ‘dand’ in the RSS. Doing this was a weird kind of thrill.” He added, “Many teachers in my school, including the headmaster, were themselves Kar Sevaks. They had participated in the demolition of Babri Masjid. They used to come to the class and narrate how bravely they fought. They even glorified the demolition.”  Pushpendra, who is now a researcher, recalled, “When the Ram Setu movement and the agitation was going on during 2007-08, the school administration made all the students write individual letters to the President of India demanding the Ram Setu to not be abolished since it is an important part of Hindu culture. All of us had to bring postcards from home and write the letter in school.”  In just a few words, he summarised what these schools intend to do, “As students we never get to know, but slowly and steadily, they keep instilling Hindutva in us. So, whenever there is a communal riot, all the students will rise up as Kattar Hindus. They prepare us for that day.”  Astha Savyasachi is a journalist based in New Delhi.

"political assassination","2016-07-17","Not Discerned","{""Volgograd"", ""Volgograd"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-22T09:50:00","Story by Lilia Yapparova in collaboration with extremism and terrorism expert Vera Mironova.  For more than a year now, Russia’s intelligence services have been operating under wartime conditions; very little is known publicly about what they’ve been up to. Meduza special correspondent Lilia Yapparova and terrorism expert Vera Mironova have discovered that among other things, the country’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has been recruiting former Islamic State (or ISIS) fighters and trying to embed them in pro-Ukrainian Chechen units and Crimean Tatar battalions. Here’s how they do it.  In January 2014, when Baurzhan Kultanov first joined the Islamic State, he wasn’t surprised by almost anything he encountered in Syria and Iraq’s occupied territories. While recounting his experiences there, he compared Raqqa, ISIS’s then-capital, to Istanbul, where he had met his recruiters, as well as to his hometown of Astrakhan, Russia.  “People live their lives there, just like anywhere,” Kultanov told Meduza. “The women sit at home, they go to the bazaar — just like in Russia. Except, in this case, there are drones constantly flying overhead and dropping bombs. And all the flags are black. And all of the men are armed.”  One other aspect of life reminded Kultanov of Russia as well: the local authorities’ constant surveillance of potential dissidents. “The caliphate’s security service is somewhat like the FSB. They would find dissidents and imprison or kill them,” the former fighter said. “I did a lot of talking myself, but I didn’t fear the consequences: I always had a weapon on my person and explosives on my belt.”  The aftermath of an airstrike in Raqqa. August 18, 2014. Reuters / Scanpix / LETA  ISIS fighters march through Raqqa. January 14, 2014. Militant Website / AP / Scanpix / LETA  Kultanov was placed in a with another Astrakhan native, Shamil Izmailov, who went by the name Abu Hanifa within ISIS. After six months on the front (Kultanov fought at various times against the Syrian opposition, against Kurdish militias, and against Al-Qaeda) and a wound in his temple, he realized that the ISIS propaganda videos he’d watched, which depicted local women crying and asking for help, had misled him. “I started to disappear, to skip [military operations],” Baurzhan said. “I went to help Muslims, but I ultimately realized that the chaos had been created by ISIS itself. And that I needed to get out of there.”  Baurzhan twice tried to escape from ISIS-held territory, but he was detained by caliphate police and the Amniyat, the group’s security and intelligence agency. “In November 2014, I paid $100 to a smuggler, and I finally made it to Turkey. From Syria, it seemed impossible; it felt like there was nowhere in the world where I would be able to start over with a fresh slate. But it turned out not to be so hard after all.”  Baurzhan Kultanov in Syria in 2014 Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  Upon returning to Istanbul, Kultanov immediately requested political asylum at the UN, though he didn’t reveal to officials that he had worked for ISIS. When the authorities found out, Turkish police took him to a deportation detention center. “I didn’t understand Turkish very well, but I managed to make out that a criminal case had been opened against me in Russia. After all, I’d even posted photos from the to VKontakte — the same photos that were added to the FSB’s body of evidence.”  One night — Kultanov remembers the exact date: June 18, 2015 — some people in civilian clothing whom Kultanov had never seen before came into his cell. “When I realized they were about to deport me, I slit my wrists,” he recalled. “They patched me up — and then beat me. In the airport, I ran away from them again, and they beat me again. To the point that the stitches in my wrists split open. So I spent the flight covered in my own blood.”  When he arrived in Moscow, Kultanov was met at the airport by riot police officers and FSB agents. “They took the Turkish handcuffs off me and put Russian ones on,” he told Meduza. “An agent named Maxim showed me a photo of myself sitting in a tank with a machine gun: ‘Recognize this?’”  Russian emigration to Turkey  ‘We decided not to hide’ The war and anti-LGBTQ+ laws forced much of Russia’s queer community to leave, many choosing to resettle in Turkey  Russian emigration to Turkey  ‘We decided not to hide’ The war and anti-LGBTQ+ laws forced much of Russia’s queer community to leave, many choosing to resettle in Turkey  From there, Kultanov was flown to Astrakhan. Alexander Gushchin, an FSB captain who was overseeing the felony case against Kultanov, came to the airport to pick him up.  At the FSB’s Astrakhan office, Kultanov was met by “10 employees, if not more.” “Some were in balaclavas, while others were in uniform,” he told Meduza. “The ten of them stood over me and shouted, ‘Sign a confession! Or maybe you want a pipe stuck up your ass, and barbed wire shoved through it? Or you want electricity sent through you? Or you want to be taken into the forest and shot like a terrorist? And your kids sent to an orphanage?”  Within days, Kultanov had signed a confession — and Alexander Pisarev, one of the FSB investigators working on his case, began treating him unexpectedly well.  “He showed me all of my offenses — ’participating in an unlawful armed formation,’ ‘recruiting,’ ‘mercenary activity’ — and said, ‘Well, that’s twenty years. But if you cooperate with us, we’ll make your prison term shorter than short,’” Kultanov recalled.  The case was examined in a special procedure, and Kultanov was sentenced to just four years and four months. On the day before his sentencing, Captain Gushchin first raised the prospect of him working with Russian intelligence. “We’ll give you a minimal sentence, and as soon as you’re released, we’ll make you into an agent,” Kultanov remembers him saying.  Kultanov’s certificate of release from prison Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  The collaboration began while Kultanov was still in prison, he told Meduza. “I scribbled my signature on some reports for Gushchin, perjuring myself. On the FSB’s orders, I went on TV and spoke,” he said. Often, the agents showed him photos of people he’d never seen before and instructed him to “recognize” them as militants.  “To be honest, I signed so many testimonies that I hardly remember the details,” Kultanov admitted.  Kultanov (under the pseudonym Abdulla) and Gushchin in a REN TV segment. Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  In 2018, not long before Kultanov was released from prison, Gushchin took him to an FSB building, sat him at a table, and presented him with an FSB cooperation agreement. “Read this — you’ll have to sign it,” Kultanov remembers him saying. “The leadership is interested in you. And I’ll be your resident — I’ll oversee your work. There are two copies: one for you and one for me.”  Among other things, the document included Kultanov’s new alias: Ruslan. “I signed it, but Gushchin kept both copies for himself, saying, ‘You’re in prison right now. Why don’t you leave that with me,’” Kultanov recalled.  Recruiting alleged terrorists  From Budyonnovsk to Bakhmut More than a dozen of Kadyrov’s fighters in Ukraine were — or still are — on Russia’s federal terrorist list  Recruiting alleged terrorists  From Budyonnovsk to Bakhmut More than a dozen of Kadyrov’s fighters in Ukraine were — or still are — on Russia’s federal terrorist list  Baurzhan Kultanov was released in 2019, but the FSB allowed him to forego the period of administrative supervision that would usually be required in a case like his. Instead, Gushchin informed him that he would soon be sent on his first assignment — to Ukraine.  “How will I get there? What will I do there?” Kultanov recalled asking his new boss.  “We’ll organize everything. It’s important right now that we have agents there. We have something planned in Ukraine soon,” he responded.  ‘You’ll be our eyes and ears’  In 2019, the FSB began preparing Kultanov for integration into “Chechen groups and Tatar battalions that want to fight with the Ukrainian Armed Forces,” he told Meduza. The agency wanted “the full information” about the units’ equipment and personnel.  The officers overseeing him “decided not to worry about” a cover story, he told Meduza. “‘We don’t need to make anything up: your history and your military experience speak for themselves,’” Kultanov recalled Alexander Gushchin saying. “After all, you really are a terrorist, a Muslim, an ex-con. Just tell them you don’t like Russia and the FSB and that you want to help. They’ll take you with open arms.”  One of Gushchin’s colleagues at the FSB’s Astrakhan branch, agent Vadim Stetsenko, began working with Kultanov to prepare him for his assignment. Having lived in Sevastopol before Russia’s annexation of Crimea and served in the Ukrainian Security Service’s counterintelligence department, Stetsenko likely knew Ukraine better than any of his colleagues. “And then he defected to the FSB,” Kultanov told Meduza.  Muslim life in Russia  Only ‘compatriots’ in war How plans for a new mosque in Moscow exposed the limits of Russia’s religious pluralism  Muslim life in Russia  Only ‘compatriots’ in war How plans for a new mosque in Moscow exposed the limits of Russia’s religious pluralism  Kultanov had difficulty keeping track of the complex instructions he was given. “To be honest, I didn’t even learn all of this Ukrainian stuff. I mean, I’d never been there before. When you don’t know how day-to-day life works in a place, it’s difficult to remember things,” he said. “And Vadim advised me on everything from what SIM card to get to which district to live in. ‘I know Kyiv, I know Kharkiv. Live in such-and-such apartment — I have people there.’”  From his conversations with Stetsenko, Kultanov learned that the FSB was interested in a man named Isa Akayev, the commander of the Crimea Islamic volunteer battalion, which had been fighting against Russia since 2014 and consisted of Crimean Tatars, Chechens, and Kabardians.  Crimea battalion leader Isa Akayev. May 28, 2022. Edgar Su / Reuters / Scanpix / LETA  The Crimea battalion during Friday prayers. May 27, 2022. Edgar Su / Reuters / Scanpix / LETA  In the spring of 2022, fighters from the Crimea battalion became some of the first to enter Motyzhyn, a village in the Kyiv region’s Bucha district, after it was liberated from Russia forces. There, they found the bodies of civilians who had been killed during the occupation. In March of that year, Akayev vowed to kill Russian soldiers “by all means permitted by Sharia.” “Just don’t forget to put seeds in your pockets so that sunflowers will grow [from your bodies],” he added.  The FSB didn’t begin searching for Akayev until then, though the agency had been “obsessed” with the “Crimean Tatar underground” ever since the annexation of Crimea, Andrey Soldatov, an expert on Russia’s intelligence services, told Meduza. “One FSB officer admitted to me that in 2014, when they were supposed to create an [FSB] branch [in Crimea], they just pulled out the archives and looked at what the KGB was prioritizing in 1974 or so. And someone had written, ‘Crack down on Crimean Tatar nationalism,’” Soldatov said. “So they started cracking down on it.”  A message from the author of this story, Lilia Yapparova:  To gain a better understanding of how Russia’s intelligence services work during wartime, terrorism expert Vera Mironova and I read a set of instructions that the FSB compiled for its spies in Ukraine; learned how the agency’s psychologists prepare “freelance” agents for assignments abroad (and who comes up with their cover stories); and looked at photos of people who Russia sought to eliminate abroad.  The Russian government has designated Meduza as an “undesirable organization,” making it a crime for Russians to support our work in any way. In order to continue doing investigative work like this, we need your help. Become a Meduza supporter today.  The FSB even compiled written instructions for how Kultanov was to penetrate the Crimea battalion. Kultanov still has a copy of the document, which includes handwritten notes from his supervisors.  The agency’s goal was to “get a line on Isa Akayev,” according to the instructions, of which Meduza has a copy. First, “Ruslan” was to “read some preliminary information about him on the Internet.” Then, “in the course of his contact with his Ukrainian friends,” Kultanov would “inquire about whether they have access” to the Crimea battalion commander and would ask them to “do some asking around about this asshole.” (Akayev did not respond to Meduza’s requests for comment.)  The FSB’s instructions for Kultanov to infiltrate the Crimea battalion Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  In the next stage, “Ruslan” was supposed to hint to his Ukrainian acquaintances that he had “‘brothers’ back in Astrakhan who were ready for difficult work” and to “find out how much volunteers who join the battalion are paid, what the procedure for them to travel to Ukraine is, [...] and in what conditions they’ll have to work.” If the “Ukrainian friends don’t know shit, then drop the topic,” the document said.  Stetsenko gave Kultanov another task as well. “We need to learn about the Turkish charity organization IHH, which sponsors terrorists in Ukraine and Syria. After all, that’s one way people get to Ukraine,” the supervisor said.  Officially, IHH carries out humanitarian projects in conflict zones, but in 2010, the organization was banned in Germany: according to the German authorities, the group was financing Hamas “under the guise of humanitarian aid.” “IHH really does work with Russian speakers in Turkey,” terrorism expert Vera Mironova told Meduza. The organization itself did not respond to Meduza’s questions.  Both supervisors — Gushchin and Stetsenko — were visibly enthusiastic about the prospect of Kultanov infiltrating Ukraine’s volunteer fighters, Kultanov recalled. The officers believed he might ultimately even manage to “get access to Ukraine’s intelligence services.”  Chechen separatism  Ichkeria dreamin’ A new Chechen separatist army is being formed in Ukraine, but beating Russia in the Donbas is easier than deposing Ramzan Kadyrov  Chechen separatism  Ichkeria dreamin’ A new Chechen separatist army is being formed in Ukraine, but beating Russia in the Donbas is easier than deposing Ramzan Kadyrov  Gushchin, according to Kultanov, generally spoke openly about his goals for his new recruit: “It would be great if you could become a double or even triple agent! So that other intelligence agencies want to recruit you.”  Kultanov got a strong sense that his superiors were “preparing for something in Ukraine” even back then. “You’re our eyes and ears there,” he remembers them telling him. “But you’re not the only one.”  ‘Nobody trusts anybody’  On November 29, 2022, terrorism expert Vera Mironova was contacted by a Caucasus Emirate fighter named Valid. He called her directly from a Russian prison.  Mironova knows a fair number of veterans from the Islamic underground movement, having done research in Chechnya, Dagestan, Syria, and Iraq (she was embedded with Iraqi special operations forces during several operations they carried out against ISIS). She currently consults the Ukrainian authorities on these issues.  Vera Mironova  “Valid had fought since the second Chechen War. He’s been in prison for a long time, and he still has seven years to go,” Mironova told Meduza. “And suddenly he calls me from prison and says, ‘I want to go to the front through Wagner Group and then surrender to Ukraine. Is that something you could help me with?’”  Valid and Mironova, who lives in the U.S., began a correspondence. Eventually, Valid told her that Wagner Group had rejected him — but that Russian intelligence had expressed interest in hiring him. “The FSB had their own plans for me,” he wrote to Mironova. “Dirty work: taking out whoever’s necessary, conducting reconnaissance. Ukraine was top of the agenda. [They would send me] as a lone agent. But they have a lot of lone agents out there.”  As far as Mironova knows, Valid has an impeccable reputation among former militants: “He’s from the old Caucasus Emirate, he’s an authoritative guy, and he has connections to everybody — even from prison, he was in touch with everyone non-stop.” The FSB had taken notice of this as well. “They know I know a lot of people. Including my own [Chechens] as well as people in Europe, Turkey, and Syria,” Valid told Mironova.  But the inmate declined the FSB’s offer, and Mironova doesn’t know what happened to him after that. He stopped responding to her.  Meduza has learned of one other case in which the FSB attempted to recruit a former Islamic militant fighter. A Dagestani man named Karim (name changed) said that he fought with ISIS, belonged to the same jamaat as Baurzhan Kultanov, and served time in prison for this upon returning to Russia.  In 2019, after Karim was released from prison, he was contacted by an FSB officer named Pyotr. Fearing persecution from the authorities, Karim did not feel that refusing to communicate with the agency was an option, and he met with the agent multiple times in cafes and city squares near Moscow’s Vernadsky Avenue metro station, “not far from [the FSB’s] office there.”  surveillance in modern Russia  A ‘Wild Boar’ trained by Yandex A massive data leak reveals the ascent of artificial intelligence in Internet surveillance and suppressing protest in Russia  surveillance in modern Russia  A ‘Wild Boar’ trained by Yandex A massive data leak reveals the ascent of artificial intelligence in Internet surveillance and suppressing protest in Russia  Karim understood that his extremist background had made him into a “coveted target for recruitment” because he would be a valuable “snitch.” The agent asked him all kinds of questions about people from the Caucasus Emirate and from ISIS “sleeper cells,” but Karim refused to share any information. “I didn’t want to commit . It would have been unacceptable to help an FSB agent against a person of faith,” he explained.  When Pyotr stopped asking questions and began demanding that Karim disclose what he knew, Karim “realized that it was time to get lost” and left the country. He’s currently in touch with diaspora members in various countries, and he says Russian intelligence recruitment is a constant topic of conversation among Muslims who left Russia for Ukraine. “For that reason, nobody trusts anybody,” he told Meduza.  According to Karim, the FSB has an ongoing interest in Russians who go to fight with the Ukrainian military. “They identify their full names, find out their routes, figure out who helped them along the way. Yesterday, a relative of mine who went to St. Petersburg for work was detained by local officers, who interrogated him about me, about where I am right now. They started pressuring him, rolling out a theory that ‘That Karim of yours is in the Donetsk area fighting with the Ukrainian military — we know all about it!’”  Some people with histories of extremist activity do indeed end up on the front in Ukraine, Vera Mironova told Meduza, and Ukrainian intelligence services have tapped her to help them assess the situation. “Of course there have been FSB agents who have penetrated Ukrainian territory. Ukraine has managed to ban some of them. It’s even happened that people with Syrian backgrounds have crossed the border by unknown means and said they ‘want to fight for the Ukrainian military.’ Who would argue that’s not a spy?” she said.  Mironova also knows of an incident in which a person “tried to use every trick in the book to get ahold of the list of [members of] one of the international battalions.” “My contacts in the [Ukrainian] intelligence services said it outright: ‘Another agent is trying to weasel in,’” she said. “Another guy raised suspicions because he was constantly hopping from unit to unit. Why do that, unless you’re trying to gather information?”  Russia’s wartime crackdown  ‘The FSB said I’m raising my daughter wrong’ A single father faces felony charges after his daughter drew an anti-war picture at school  Russia’s wartime crackdown  ‘The FSB said I’m raising my daughter wrong’ A single father faces felony charges after his daughter drew an anti-war picture at school  A source close to the FSB confirmed to Meduza that the agency is constantly trying to plant undercover agents in Ukraine, but he said many of its attempts are unsuccessful. “In the last [mission] I heard about, the agents failed yet again,” he said. “Overall, there’s a big problem with the operatives. [After being dressed down by the agency’s leadership,] they just slink out of the meetings.”  In January 2023, Ukraine announced that more than 600 Russian spies and undercover agents had been discovered in the country. The country’s military described the fight against Russian infiltration as a “cancer that metastasizes and devours healthy cells.”  But the FSB continues to send agents — not just to Ukraine, but also to the U.S. border.  a brief digression  How Russia tries to send agents to the U.S. through Mexico  On March 8, 2023, a congressman from Texas named Pat Fallon demanded the U.S. Customs and Border Protection provide a public report on how thoroughly it vets Russians who try to enter the U.S. from Mexico.  “We have a very porous border,” said Fallon. The United States Northern Command had already warned of an increase in the activity of GRU officers in Mexico, he noted, and since the fall of 2022, more than 21,000 Russians had tried to enter the country from the south. “Most illegals don’t carry any documents,” he added. “What’s the likelihood that the records check our officers run will reveal the person’s real identity?”  The U.S.-Mexico border. May 12, 2023. Patrick T. Fallon / AFP / Scanpix / LETA  Since February 2022, about 50 Russians have been arrested on suspicion of working for the FSB at the U.S.-Mexico border, terrorism expert Vera Mironova told Meduza, citing contacts she has in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  These suspects have shown up at various border crossing points and have all told roughly the same story. “Most of them say, ‘I’m an activist, or an NGO worker, or a journalist. I went to protests, and now they’re persecuting me. Let me in,’” Mironova said. “They’ve caught 50. Can you imagine how many they haven’t caught?”  Members of the Putin administration were discussing plans for similar infiltration operations in early 2020, Meduza learned from a Russian public figure who regularly communicates with the authorities.  “I went to the presidential administration then for a meeting with [Domestic Policy Department deputy head Timur] Prokopenko,” the source said. “He spoke about his and Kiriyenko’s initiative to create several decent-looking NGOs and then to declare them ‘foreign agents’ in order to embed them in the West as a spy network. They asked me to put together a team for one such NGO. It was mentioned that there were certain areas where I was ‘excessively loyal [to the Russian authorities].’ ‘That’s a minus, of course, but we’ll clean it up,’ [they said].”  Meduza was unable to find information about the creation of NGOs that fit the source’s description. Our sources inside the Putin administration hadn’t heard of this initiative: “It may have been some personal idea that Prokopenko had.”  According to Vera Mironova, some Russians have turned themselves in to American border authorities, saying, “We were sent here by the FSB to spy on dissidents and journalists, but we don’t want to. We want to surrender. We urgently need political asylum or the FSB will wring our necks.” (Meduza was unable to independently confirm this information.)  Mironova told Meduza that two Russian-speaking men told the U.S. authorities that they had been recruited by the FSB, and one said that it occurred while he was serving a prison sentence. The suspected agents told border control officers (a Department of Homeland Security employee shared the contents of the interviews with Mironova, according to her) that their names were Alexander Davydov and Ivan Cherkashin and that they worked for media outlets called Centro.press and Dobrovideo.ru. One of the men even gave the name of his purported FSB supervisor as Anton Sergeyevich (Meduza has been unable to determine who this could be).

Nagikh told Meduza that nobody from his team has tried to go to the United States.  Meduza was able to find only one article with Alexander Davydov’s byline on the news aggregator Centro.press: an interview with a “government contract expert” titled “How to promote your business by participating in state contracts” that was published in 2019. The site’s editor-in-chief, Igor Kuznetsov, asked Meduza’s correspondent to direct her questions to the outlet’s founder, Maria Fil. Fil did not respond.  It’s possible that the two men had not been contacted by the FSB and told this story in an attempt to get asylum, Mironova said. “Politically, it’s a very good case: ‘They tried to recruit me, but I didn’t give in.’”  Some volunteers who help Russian-speaking migrants get into the U.S. from Mexico have also raised the suspicions of U.S. officials, Mironova told Meduza, citing the Department of Homeland Security. “They believe these groups were created by Russian intelligence,” she said.  The website of the organization Bridge to the U.S.  The volunteer group Bridge to the U.S., for example, offered assistance to migrants from “countries in the post-Soviet space,” advertising that it “helps people enter America legally” and “works directly” with the U.S. Border Service. The organization’s lawyers charged between $2,000 and $3,000 for their assistance. In December 2022, the group’s founders were arrested by the Mexican authorities and found to have a “black bag” containing over $500,000 in cash. Meduza called the number listed on the organization’s site but was unable to reach anyone for comment.  ‘No matter what happens, never say we sent you’  In 2021, the FSB changed its plans for Baurzhan Kultanov. “You won’t go to Ukraine directly, you’ll go through Turkey,” Kultanov recalled his supervisor, Alexander Gushchin, saying.  In the fall of that year, Kultanov was given a set of documents to support his cover identity: a foreign and domestic passport, a birth certificate, an insurance policy, and a driver’s license, all under his new name, Muhammad Abdullayevich Usmanov.  Kultanov’s cover documents under the name Muhammad Usmanov Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  Shortly after, he was assigned to a new supervisor, this time someone from the agency’s central apparatus in Moscow. Vladislav Alekseyevich, as the man introduced himself to Kultanov, was noticeably more knowledgeable than his past FSB bosses; he alluded to the fact that he “worked in Syria,” for example, and “mentioned various .”  “He seemed to me like a counterintelligence officer,” Kultanov said, recalling their first meeting. “He said, basically, ‘I want to send you to Turkey, where the Russian immigrants are, especially because you know the country and you’re a Turkic language speaker yourself.’ He had me take a polygraph. And told me to wait.”  From that day until April 2023, Kultanov was in constant contact with Vladislav Alekseyevich. The two met regularly in Moscow.  In the spring of 2022, Kultanov was invited to an FSB safe house in Astrakhan. He was met there by a group of FSB employees who had flown in from Moscow: his supervisor, Vladislav Voronin; Voronin’s boss (Kultanov doesn’t remember him introducing himself); and two women who worked as psychologists for the agency.  The psychologists’ role was to prepare Kultanov for stressful situations he might encounter while on his mission. They acted out an interrogation at the Turkish customs office, even role-playing the situation of Turkish intelligence officers trying to get him to “break.” “No matter what happens, never tell them that we sent you,” Kultanov recalled the women saying.  Weekly newsletter Sign up for The Beet Underreported stories. Fresh perspectives. From Budapest to Bishkek.  Next, the FSB agents tested Kultanov’s attentiveness. At one point, they asked him to leave the room for several minutes and then come back. “Which of these things were on the table before, and which weren’t? What was I wearing? What did I have in my hands?” they asked him.  Kultanov wasn’t able to answer a single one of their questions correctly; the FSB officers repeated the test 15 times before he finally passed it. “Train your memory,” he remembers them telling him. “Wherever you end up, we need good information.”  The preparation in the safe house lasted for three days. On the last day, Kultanov was given $5,000 (for the first two months of his assignment) and told to buy tickets to Istanbul. “Vladislav’s boss tried to encourage me,” he told Meduza. “Well done, we’re in this together, don’t worry! Just adapt, once you get there. And establish contacts with as many people as you can.”  A mosque in Istanbul’s Başakşehir district Chively / Shutterstock  Istanbul’s Başakşehir district Emrahh / Shutterstock  Baurzhan Kultanov in Istanbul Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  On March 25, 2022, Kultanov flew to Turkey. From that point on, he was in constant communication with Vladislav Voronin and with Igor Yatskevich from the FSB’s Astrakhan branch.  Kultanov was instructed to find out “who is preparing what [operations] against Russia,” and to gather any information related to Ukraine that he could. His tasks included learning “how to get through Turkey to the [Ukrainian] front, who’s sending people to volunteer battalions, and what local Ukrainians are saying,” he recalled. “And Vladislav asked me to make contact with volunteer rescue workers who went to Syria after the earthquake [in early 2023]. He needed that ‘route’ so that he could stick some of his people in .”  Kultanov sent Meduza copies of his messages with both supervisors as well as video recordings of his phone calls with them.

Kutlanov’s communications with his supervisor Igor Yatskevich Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  Kultanov’s messages with FSB officer Vladislav Voronin Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  On February 28, 2023, for example, Kultanov sent Yatskevich a photograph of a new acquaintance he had made in Istanbul, someone he described to his supervisor as a member of an “exclusive club” that sent people and cargo to Ukraine:  “You must know him, [Igor]. He’s very well-known, from what I understood. He worked for [Chechen separatist and terrorist insurgent Shamil] Basayev, and he ran through the woods in his time. I’ve started running into him in Başakşehir, slowly but surely. They have a jamaat there. They have a lot of routes, and I’m gradually starting to do tasks for them. I sent a package to a Baghdad prison at their request, I bought some food for it. They can send stuff to Ukraine. Syria, too,” Kultanov wrote.  “That’s interesting,” Yatskevich responded.  “Also, the jamaat communicates exclusively over some iPhone program. They told me to buy an iPhone, but how am I supposed to afford it?” Kultanov said.  “Show us some work, we already talked about money.”  In one correspondence, Yatskevich asked Kultanov, “Do you go to [Istanbul’s] Başakşehir district, where the immigrants from Russia live? I’ll send you an address and photo. Can you go and see if he’s there?”  The photo he sent showed a man in camouflage standing on a snowy slope, a portable radio antenna poking out from his breast pocket. “His name is Mailan, his apartment is on the first story. This is an old photo, taken about 10 years ago. He’s a Kazakh from Astrakhan. [Find out] what he’s doing and who he lives with. Be careful. You can also ask other Russians there,” Yatskevich wrote.  One of Kultanov’s supervisors tells him to look for Mailan Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  He also asked Kultanov to take photos during his assignment in Başakşehir, though not to photograph “everyone in a row,” but “just the people who have been to Syria or who went to Ukraine.”  Yatskevich didn’t explain why he was interested in Mailan, but Kultanov has his own theory. “They were just agency tasks — and they were purely monetary,” he told Meduza. “How did Vladislav put it? ‘We don’t work for nothing, we have to make money. We’re going to make money! And the [intelligence] that the higher-ups ask for — well, we’ll give them what they want to hear.’”  Among other things, Voronin was insistent that Kultanov find a buyer for “counterfeit dollars, forged documents, passports, and stamps” — and that he inquire “about cryptocurrency transfers.” “From what I understood, there was some stolen money, and they needed to find a card they could use to transfer it to Turkey, use it to buy crypto here, and send it to Russia,” Kultanov told Meduza. “Vladislav promised to give me a cut.”  The FSB officers Kultanov worked with tried to earn money in other ways, too, namely contract killings.  ‘There are people we’ll need to get rid of’  FSB officer Vladislav Voronin entrusted Baurzhan Kultanov with contract killings on two occasions. “It was part of Vladislav’s business,” Kultanov told Meduza.  Voronin once put Kultanov in touch with an “Afghan man who wanted to order [a hit on] another Afghan man who lived in Istanbul.” “The client gave me a photo and an address and told me the person needed to be eliminated,” Kultanov said. “He didn’t say the name [of the victim], but it was someone important: he was in the [Afghan] government, and then [after the Taliban took over the country], he fled to Turkey.”  Voronin left Kultanov in charge of negotiating the price. “Say a million dollars — then we’ll divide it up,” Kultanov recounted his handler saying. “But when I named that price, the Afghan got flustered: ‘I don’t have that kind of money!’ So we didn’t agree on anything.”  Paimon Asil Khan Paimon Asil Khan on VKontakte  Kultanov still has the Afghan phone number of the supposed client as well as his account on the Russian social media site VKontakte. The account owner, a man named Paimon, is one of the sons of former Afghan official Sakhib Khan Asil Khan, who has long lived alternatively in Russia and Afghanistan.  Sakhib Khan Asil Khan was born in Kabul in 1959, when Afghanistan was led by the reformer King Mohammad Zahir Shah and women were not required to wear chadors. In 1978, Sakhib Khan took part in the April Revolution, which initially brought a socialist government to power but ultimately contributed to the breakout of civil war and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  A pro-Soviet Afghan, Sakhib graduated from a police academy in Kabul before attending the Felix Dzerzhinsky Higher Police School in Kyiv. Upon returning to Afghanistan, he worked in the country’s Defense Ministry, the Interior Ministry’s political department, and the state security apparatus (analogous to the KGB). He finished his national security career in the war-torn Afghanistan of the 1980s as an assistant to the head of the army’s main political directorate.  espionage and the war  ‘The war is bad for Russia but good for the regime’ Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov on defending Bakhmut, ‘technological penetration,’ and why recruiting spies still matters  espionage and the war  ‘The war is bad for Russia but good for the regime’ Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov on defending Bakhmut, ‘technological penetration,’ and why recruiting spies still matters  In April 1992, the ruling communist regime was toppled, launching a new phase of civil war, this time between various mujahideen groups. Sakhib Khan fled first to Uzbekistan, then to Ufa, and in 2000, he settled in the village of Tolbazy in Russia’s Republic of Bashkortostan. After obtaining Russian citizenship, he started a construction business and opened a shopping center called Asil Khan.  For the next 20 years — up until the Taliban’s takeover of his home country — Sakhib Khan regularly traveled back to Afghanistan, even founding the Bashkortostan Afghanistan Friendship Society. At the Russian diplomatic mission in Kabul, he met with “Afghans who were interested in developing relations with Russia.”  Watching his homeland (which was then occupied by U.S. troops) with “pain in his heart,” the former officer said repeatedly that “the Afghan people can’t imagine their future without the support of the great Russian people,” that Vladimir Putin is a “great blessing,” and that “the West constantly deceives.”  Meduza was unable to get in touch with Sakhib Khan. His son, Paimon, was indignant when Meduza’s correspondent asked him about Kultanov’s allegations: “Excuse me? What are you talking about? Kill who for Afghanistan?” (“For Afghanistan” was Sakhib’s own phrase; Meduza didn’t suggest this in our questions.) “The only time I come in contact with the FSB is when I land at the airport and they ask me who I am and where I went,” he added.

Here’s what she saw.  Nevertheless, Andrey Soldatov, an expert on Russia’s intelligence services, told Meduza that many members of Moscow’s Afghan diaspora do in fact have ties to the FSB. “They were supervised by the Moscow branch as part of counterterrorism operations, and the FSB officers were supposed to provide them with documents, solve any routine problems they faced (like getting someone’s son into university), and in exchange, they would use their connections with the international diaspora.”  FSB agents may have pulled strings for people’s sons in the past, but carry out an assassination attempt for a former security officer’s son Kultanov did not. After hearing that the operation would cost him a million dollars, according to Kultanov, Paimon stopped contacting him.  Another time, Kultanov told Meduza, Voronin instructed him to find and kill a “Karachay named Ubaidulla.” “Vladislav sent a photo of him and said, ‘Run a search [for his address] — they’re offering big bucks for him,’” he recalled.  Kultanov provided Meduza with a copy of the messages between him and Voronin, which confirm that the officer did send him a photo of a young, curly-haired man in a beanie. A pink drink can be seen on the table in front of Ubaidulla and a machine gun hangs across his chest. However, Voronin was unable to determine even the district of Istanbul where Ubaidulla lived.  FSB officer Vladislav Voronin discussing Ubaidulla with Kultanov Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  “Who the hell knows, he’s like a ghost,” wrote Voronin. “[We need to] at least find some leads about him. Credible ones. A warrant was put out for him by the local [Turkish] Interior Ministry branch. At least find out whether he’s actually on the wanted list or not.”  Kultanov’s account of the FSB’s attempted contract killings in Turkey is consistent with other publicly available information on the topic. For example, two former FSB officers have told the investigative project Dossier that the agency often uses freelance workers for these assignments. Turkish law enforcement agencies have reported multiple times that FSB agents have been involved in murders.  “Also, Gushchin, when he and I met in his car in Astrakhan, told me: ‘You can do it, you know — after Syria! You’ll be a killer!’” Kultanov recalled his first FSB handler telling him. “‘There are people who will have to be [done away with]. You earn money and you help the motherland.’”  According to Kultanov, he never completed a contract killing for the FSB.  * * *  On April 25, 2023, Kultanov was arrested and taken to an immigration jail in the Turkish city of Niğde. The day before, he wrote to Meduza’s correspondent, “It’s like I’m living on pins and needles. My visa expired a long time ago, my residence permit wasn’t approved — I’m illegal here. I contacted the police and even the security services. This time, I told them everything. I requested asylum. They definitely didn’t forget about me: a spy came to turn himself in!”  Kultanov’s supervisors at the FSB were either unwilling or unable to help him obtain legal status in Turkey. On February 16, 2023, Kultanov requested asylum with the country’s migration service as well: explaining that the FSB “threatened” him into becoming a “spy,” Baurzhan asked the authorities “not to extradite or deport” him, or he would be “killed in prison.”  Kultanov’s statement to the Turkish Migration Service. Baurzhan Kultanov’s personal archive  Kultanov told Meduza’s correspondent that after he crossed the border into Turkey, he stopped working for the FSB, and that he only pretended to be gathering information when he messaged them. Meduza is unable to confirm this information.  Meduza’s correspondent last spoke to the former ISIS fighter on May 10, when he called her from prison.  “I only have a few minutes left on this payphone,” he said. Laughter, either from prison guards or from Kultanov’s cellmates, was audible in the background. “I’m in Niğde. The guards say it’s impossible to call here from outside. They’re not providing a translator, but every day they come and ask, ‘Do you want to be deported or not?’ I tell them I don’t.”  Then the call cut off.  The FSB, the Ukrainian Security Service, and Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov had not responded to Meduza’s requests for comment by the time of this story’s publication.

"political assassination","2019-07-23","10:30:00","{""Kandy"", ""Kandy"", ""SriLanka""}","2023-05-22T14:58:13","Thanks to its colonial legacy, Sri Lanka is one of 67 countries in the world that still criminalizes same-sex sexual relations among consenting adults. Sections 365 and 365A of Sri Lanka’s Penal Code state that “carnal intercourse against the order of nature” (in other words, any type of sex that is considered unnatural) and “acts of gross indecency” are criminal offenses punishable by law, carrying a sentence of up to 10 years. While they do not specify that these offenses pertain to same-sex sexual relations anymore, they are most often used against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer/questioning (LGBTIQ) community. In addition, the Vagrancy Law and Section 399 of the Penal Code regarding “cheating by personation” (referring to impersonation) are also used against the LGBTIQ community in Sri Lanka, particularly against transgender individuals.  For eons, criminalization has led to arbitrary arrests, inhumane forceful anal examinations, degrading treatment etc. It has sanctioned discrimination, stigmatization, denial of basic human rights, harassment and violence towards LGBTIQ community by state officials in the criminal justice system and unfortunately by the wider public as well. This has led to social and economic marginalization and to the exclusion of LGBTIQ individuals and groups from vital services. EQUAL GROUND, the oldest and one of the truly diverse organizations in Sri Lanka, has been fighting relentlessly for over 19 years to decriminalize consenting same-sex relationships. This has been a roller coaster ride where EQUAL GROUND encountered political and social backlash, tackled online and offline threats, hate comments etc., but it has never given up. As they say, “Rome wasn’t built in a day, but they were laying bricks every hour.” Rather, the attacks and barriers motivated EQUAL GROUND to stand firmly and continue fighting the good fight. Due to its relentless hard work and support from allies, the international community and like-minded organizations, finally we are seeing decriminalization firmly on the table — something which seemed so far-fetched only a couple of years back.  As mentioned earlier, the criminalization of same-sex sexual conduct in Sri Lanka has its origins in 19th century British colonial law. Introduced in 1883, section 365A originally criminalized “any act of gross indecency” between males. In 1995, when reforming the Penal Code — due to a private members bill in 1995 — the government ignored recommendations to repeal the provision and instead amended Section 365A from “male person” to “person,” bringing lesbian and bisexual women within its remit. Consequently, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer (LBTQ) women in Sri Lanka are extremely vulnerable to harassment, violence and discrimination by State actors and by society at large. At the same time, it perpetuates and reinforces the widespread societal stigma against LBTQ women, giving license to harassment and discrimination in employment, housing, education, health care and family relations, to name a few. Realizing and experiencing such discriminatory treatment, in 2018 Rosanna Flamer-Caldera, executive director of EQUAL GROUND (with the support of Human Dignity Trust) challenged the criminalization of lesbians and bisexual women in Sri Lanka by submitting a communication to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) under the Optional Protocol in August 2018. This move was the first steppingstone towards initiating the process and talk of decriminalization. This ground-breaking case was the first time CEDAW considered an individual complaint relating specifically to the criminalization of lesbian and bisexual women. Flamer-Caldera sought a wide range of remedies, beginning with the repeal of criminalization of same-sex consensual relationships between adult women which is contrary to the Convention. She also sought amongst other things, the wider decriminalization of consensual same-sex activity in private between adults and effective protection from gender-based violence against women based on the intersection of their sex and sexual orientation.  After years of struggle, finally in February 2022, the CEDAW committee ruled the judgment in Flamer-Caldera’s favor. The committee decided that Rosanna Flamer-Caldera’s rights had been violated by the criminalization of same-sex sexual intimacy in Sri Lanka. Moreover, the CEDAW committee urged the government to decriminalize same-sex sexual relations.  In August 2022 Parliamentarian and lawyer Premanath C. Dolawatte presented to Parliament a Private Member’s Bill to amend Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka with the aim of ensuring the rights of the LGBTIQ community. The bill was subsequently handed over to President Ranil Wickremesinghe where he stated that the government will not oppose the amendment. Dolawatte, at a public forum inclusive of major political parties including the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and Ceylon Workers’ Congress, also stated that he was hopeful that a majority of MPs in the House would support his bill and join the effort to protect the rights of the LGBTIQ community. A revised version of this gill was gazetted and presented to Parliament in March and April 2023 respectively.  In September 2022, EQUAL GROUND was invited by MP Buddhika Pathirana (SJB) to put together a discussion on LGBTIQ inclusion, following which a proposal was made and accepted to (a) the Samagi Jana Balawegaya’s (SJB) National Reforms Committee to incorporate LGBTIQ rights in their party manifesto, (b) sensitize SJB parliamentarians and politicians on sexual orientation and/or gender identities/expressions (SOGIE) issues. This discussion was attended by LGBTIQ activists, lawyers, healthcare professionals, business personnel as well as politicians from the SJB party including the party leader Mr. Sajith Premadasa, who is also the current leader of the opposition.  In December 2022, EQUAL GROUND submitted the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) report (4th cycle), in collaboration with the Center for International Human Rights of Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in Chicago. In this joint submission, as remedial measures EQUAL GROUND sought to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual conduct by repealing Penal Code Section 365 and 365A and ensuring that Penal Code Section 399 and the Vagrants Ordinance are not misused to target LGBTIQ persons. In February 2023, at the U.N. Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review Working Group session (42nd session), the U.S., the U.K., Canada, New Zealand and Norway, among others, urged Sri Lanka to decriminalize same-sex relationships. Responding to all the recommendations, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President’s Counsel (PC) M.U.M. Ali Sabry assured that the government would work towards decriminalization, however same-sex marriage would not be legalized. Referring to the Private Member’s Bill, he stated that the government will support its position of decriminalizing same-sex relationships.  A petition was presented to the Supreme Court in April this year challenging the constitutionality of the bill to amend the Penal Code. After hearing more than a dozen petitions on both sides of the argument, the Supreme Court has determined that a private member’s bill seeking the decriminalization of homosexuality is not inconsistent with the Constitution. The decision is seen as a historic development that has created hope towards real change. Activists will still have to lobby for support from the 225 parliamentarians to push forward the proposed legislation through Parliament; but it has opened the door of an inclusive and equal future where everybody will be able to enjoy their basic rights regardless of their sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity etc.  Both the president of Sri Lanka and the joint opposition has stated they will not oppose the bill. The next steps for it to eventually become legislation, is a vote with a simple majority at Parliament to see this through.  This Supreme Court decision in early May 2023 is major for the community in terms of any kind of progress they have seen over the last few decades.  On several occasions, the international community has urged the government to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual conduct. For instance, in 2021 the European Union Parliament adopted a resolution with regard to the withdrawal of Sri Lanka’s GSP+ status given their concern over Sections 365 and 365A of the Penal Code that criminalize individuals with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. Unfortunately, the EU dropped this condition from at the last moment granting GSP+ status to Sri Lanka. It was a severe blow to the LGBTIQ community and EQUAL GROUND who had lobbied at high levels within the EU and had been assured by the EU that indeed decriminalization would be an important condition of Sri Lanka’s GSP+ status.  LGBTIQ rights, from 2021 to until now, has seen some positive changes developing with national laws and policies.  According to EQUAL GROUND’s mapping study in 2021, approximately 12 percent of the Sri Lankan population identify themselves as LGBTIQ. Continuing to preserve Victorian, homophobic laws that penalizes individuals for who they are and/or for choosing a same-sex partner, violates their human rights as citizens of this country and drives the community underground to live in constant fear and in the shadows. Therefore, in order for Sri Lanka to be consistent with international standards of human dignity and rights, these laws can no longer be viewed with the moral standards that existed during the time of their creation. Rather, they have to be viewed in line with modern-day community standards based on the principles of human dignity and respect.  Rosanna Flamer-Caldera is the executive director of EQUAL GROUND.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9uYmxhZGUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvYXMtdGhlLXB1YmxpYy1oZWFsdGgtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWVuZHMtYS1odW1hbml0YXJpYW4tY3Jpc2lzLWJlZ2lucy1mb3ItbGdidHEtYXN5bHVtLXNlZWtlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Observers are trying to ascertain whether Singh, a former Minister and an influential leader from Bargarh district in western Odisha, is unhappy over being denied a ministerial berth. Three BJD leaders were sworn in as cabinet Ministers this morning. From western Odisha, only Rourkela MLA Sarada Nayak has been inducted into the Ministry.  While Susanta Singh claimed that he is not unhappy over the Ministry expansion, his supporters appeared to be in a different mood. Singh said he has all along been getting support from the Chief Minister.  “I am not unhappy, some people somewhere may be unhappy,” said Singh, adding that some of his supporters came to him and he placated them. “CM’s blessings are always on us,” he added.  Following the assassination of Naba Kishore Das, who represented Jharsuguda, Susanta Singh was stated to be hopeful of getting a ministerial berth. However, the Bhatli MLA was unable to find a place in Naveen Ministry. Singh’s supporters claimed he seems to be unhappy over not getting a cabinet berth. He was reportedly not seen in the swearing in ceremony held today.  Sources said the Bhatli MLA’s supporters are highly disappointed over his exclusion from the Ministry. Bargarh district BJD youth wing president Pradyumna Tripathy reportedly said that people of western Odisha were hopeful that Singh will get ministerial berth.  However, their hope has been shattered as Singh was not given a place in the Ministry. Therefore, his supporters are disappointed and they find the whole episode highly frustrating, he said.  Describing Singh as a very good organiser, he said despite all his good work for the party, he has been neglected. After BJD’s landslide victory in Padampur Assembly by-election, people were expecting that he would be inducted into the Ministry. Earlier also he had been ignored during the Ministry reshuffle undertaken in June last year.  Though Singh claimed that he has placated his supporters, sources said resentment is brewing among people close to him in his area. However, it is not clear whether they are thinking in terms of staging a revolt or resorting to any such drastic step.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vb2Rpc2hhYnl0ZXMuY29tL29kaXNoYS1jYWJpbmV0LXJlc2h1ZmZsZS1ob3ctc3VzYW50YS1zaW5naC1jYW1wLWluLWJqZC1yZWFjdC1hZnRlci1oaXMtZXhjbHVzaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1963-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T01:08:00","Sensational TV series about religious leaders sentenced for sexual abuse are broadcast without considering that they wreak havoc in the lives of their innocent followers.  by Massimo Introvigne  Posters for the Netflix series “In the Name of God.” From Twitter.  Last month, I interviewed in Australia a young girl I would call Grace (not her real name). A brilliant company executive with an unimpeachable curriculum, she had just been called by her employer and asked just one question, “Are you still a member of Providence Church?” When she answered yes, and added she did not plan to leave the church in any foreseeable future, she was immediately fired.  The employer had known for years that Grace was a member of the Providence Church, and that the church leader had been sentenced for sexual abuse, as the story had been reported in Australian media. However, he decided to fire her after a Netflix TV series on Providence and its leader had gathered millions of viewers.  I collected similar stories in several countries. Members of Providence, of the Mexican megachurch La Luz del Mundo, of the Czech Guru Jára Path, of the Buenos Aires Yoga School in Argentina either lost their job or had serious problems in their workplaces. The same happened to devotees of Shincheonji in South Korea after the accusation (later declared false by the local Supreme Court) that their religious movement had willingly spread the COVID-19 virus.  Members of the Unification Church/Family Federation in Japan went through the same ordeal after the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by a man who claimed that the church, to which Abe was friendly, had ruined his mother, who is still a member. Although the dynamics are similar, I will focus here on cases where the leaders have been accused of sexual abuse, rape, or inducing members to prostitution.  The legal stories are different. President Jung Myung Seok of Providence Church has been arrested in 2007 and later sentenced to ten years in jail for four counts of rape. He remained in jail until 2018, but was accused of sexual abuse again and re-arrested in 2002. He is currently in prison awaiting trial. Apostle Naasón Joaquín García of La Luz del Mundo pleaded guilty in California in 2019 to three charges of sexual abuse of children and is serving a sentence of 16 years and 8 months.  Guru Jára was sentenced in 2018 to five years for rape, and all his further recourses and appeals were rejected. He was at that time in the Philippines, and remains there in a detention center for illegal immigrants pending a long procedure where he is seeking political asylum claiming that the Czech decision was politically motivated. All the leaders of the Buenos Aires Yoga School were found not guilty in 2000 of charges of operating a prostitution ring but, after a change in Argentinian law, they were arrested again in 2022. They are at present all out of jail, but the case continues.  Devotees of La Luz del Mundo at their headquarters in Guadalajara, Mexico.  Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, dozens of followers of these spiritual leaders have lost their jobs or have been put under serious pressures on their workplaces, not to mention more serious incidents such as physical assaults against devotees or places of worship or teaching. In the case of Providence (also known as Christian Gospel Mission), in addition to Australia, I have collected in Taiwan several disturbing stories of discrimination and abuse of members.  One young adjunct assistant professor in a top-tier university (and one that claims to uphold academic freedom and inclusiveness) had his contract not renewed without any prior warning, solely because his religious affiliation had been exposed online by individuals posting under pseudonyms. Taiwan has hosted important initiatives for the defense of religious liberty internationally. It should guarantee human rights and freedom of religion of Providence believers at home.  These incidents call for an adequate sociological analysis, but first of all we should consider that they involve immense human suffering. The analysis should, I believe, consider two points. The first is that a sizeable percentage, in most cases the majority, of members of the movements do not believe that their leaders are guilty.  Even in the case of La Luz del Mundo, that the Apostle has pleaded guilty within the context of a plea bargain is explained as a mere legal strategy aimed at getting a reduced sentence and avoiding a trial before a biased judge that would have caused the church further embarrassment. Some even see the Apostle as a hero who sacrificed himself for the church.  A sign proclaiming the Apostle innocent at the Guadalajara headquarters of La Luz del Mundo.  I have discussed elsewhere the reasons that persuade the followers of the Buenos Aires Yoga School and of Guru Jára that their leaders are innocent. They also apply to the first case of Providence, and for the second pending case the church has also provided a series of arguments for the defense.  The position that I have expressed on all these cases is, first, that religious liberty does not protect rape or sexual abuse. If religious leaders are guilty of these serious crimes, they should be prosecuted and sentenced and cannot use religious liberty as a defense.  “Physical” rape and sexual abuse (and of course any form of sexual activity involving minors, which is both disgusting and illegal) are clearly defined crimes. It is a different matter when women (more rarely men) claim, in some cases many years after the facts, that they had consensual sexual relationships with the leaders, but they gave their consensus because they were “brainwashed” by the religious movements.  I do not believe that brainwashing—however named: “abus de faiblesse,” mind control, mental manipulation—exists, and as a consequence I am against sentencing anybody on the basis of what I regard as an imaginary crime. To be clear, in the specific incidents it is still possible that a religious leader coerced unwilling adult devotees to have sex with him, but that should be proved through elements more persuasive than brainwashing.  The second argument I have advanced is that the position of those believers who insist that their leaders are innocent, even after courts of law have decided otherwise, is not in itself a crime. All of us disagree with some decisions by courts of law, and there is a whole genre of books trying to prove that judges erred in famous criminal cases.  In a democratic society, maintaining these opinions is not illegal, and is not equivalent to glorifying crime. The devotees do not support crime, they support their leaders because, rightly or wrongly, they believe they are innocent. Some may even think their leaders are guilty, but this guilt had not removed from them the mandate they have received from God. After all, in the history of religions the figure of the “sinful messiah” is not unknown and has a long tradition.  A service at Providence’s headquarters in South Korea. A portrait of President Jung is on the background.  The most interesting sociological point is that, in some (although not in all) cases, religious movements whose leaders have been sentenced for sexual abuse have been able to continue to exist and even experience a growth. This is a variation of the well-known sociological theory of the “Festinger syndrome,” which predicts that when a religious movement proclaims a prophecy (for example, a date for the end of the world), and the prophecy (at least in the eyes of the unbelievers) fails, counter-intuitively it is well possible that the group would gain rather than losing members.  For believers, a prophecy never fails, should just be interpreted differently, and a leader sentenced as a criminal by human courts of law may in fact be innocent or may have ended up in jail as a result of an exceptional design by God.  However, movements who had successfully resisted the court cases and the sentencing and jailing of their leaders experienced more serious problems when they were attacked by a different enemy than police, prosecutors, or judges: television. The 2023 Netflix series “In the Name of God” targeted Providence and other Korean “cults.” It was immensely successful. Providence objected that some of the evidence about the second Jung case was fabricated, but these are matters that scholars are not equipped to decide and will eventually be solved by courts of law.  President Jung at the Wolmyeongdong headquarters before his second arrest.  A predictable consequence of the prosecution of a leader for sexual abuse, schism, had not happened in Providence during Jung’s first detention nor after his second arrest in 2022. However, some senior leaders and members left the church as a consequence of the Netflix show. The South Korean Justice Minister reacted to the Netflix miniseries by stating he would make sure that prosecutors would be “severe” on Jung, and the police raided again the headquarters of Providence—where, obviously, there was nothing to be found, as both the police and Jung’s lawyers had gone through all the documents conserved there before.  The raid was just a show for the media. Speaking of the lawyers, some of those representing Jung resigned, quoting the bad publicity due to the Netflix series, something that would be regarded as unethical for attorneys in other countries but perhaps is acceptable in South Korea. Obviously, those suspected of sexual abuse, be they religious leaders or not, should be prosecuted—but not because Netflix says so.  Devotees of Guru Jára similarly report that their most serious problems started after a Czech TV series (full of factual mistakes) about their case. La Luz del Mundo had much to suffer from its story as told in Spanish by Univision and from an HBO series—but now Netflix has announced that it will produce its own series. There are rumors that Netflix is getting interested in the Buenos Aires Yoga School as well. Netflix even sensationalizes old “cults”: its series on the Branch Davidians of Waco and their deaths in 1993 has been widely criticized by scholars who specialize in this episode of American religious history.  Media in general have a bias against groups labeled as “cults” and rely heavily on “apostates,” a technical word used by sociologists that is not synonym of “ex-member” but identifies the small minority of ex-members who become militant opponents of the groups they have left (most ex-members don’t). Television knows that illicit sex always titillates and sells, and this is even more true for the combination between religion and illicit sex.  Protests against Netflix by Providence. Source: providencetrial.com.  These series, on which Netflix is occupying a dominant position—but all other networks are jumping on the bandwagon—, may be technically well done, and win awards. However, there is one aspect that is never considered. The risk that by sensationalizing the sexual crimes of the leader all common members, who have committed no crimes, and even their children, will be harassed, discriminated, and persecuted is never taken into account. At the very least, a caveat that members of the movements should be respected in their beliefs and are not guilty of the crimes of which their leaders have been accused or convicted should be included in the TV series, and repeated more than once.  The producers of the TV shows claim that they give voice to victims of sexual abuse by religious leaders. This is legitimate and also important (if the victims are real, of course). However, the pain of the victims is not relieved if the shows stereotype and generalize, and further pain is inflicted on those who want to remain in the religious movements and are personally not guilty of any crime.  These are not theoretical risks. I am aware of hundreds of cases of discrimination at schools and on the workplace of members of groups TV series and media have stigmatized as “cults.” In the case of the four groups discussed here, nobody has been killed yet. In other cases, members of Shincheonji and of the Jehovah’s Witnesses have been killed by relatives or ex-members excited by the campaigns against them.  In 2011, I had the honor of serving as the Representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) for combating racism, xenophobia, and religious intolerance. Hate speech was included in my portfolio. If I learned one thing, it is that in the long run invariably hate speech generates hate crimes, violence, and in the end murder. Netflix and the other networks should remember that hate speech can kill—and television can kill too.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYml0dGVyd2ludGVyLm9yZy9pcy1uZXRmbGl4LWEtdGhyZWF0LXRvLXJlbGlnaW91cy1saWJlcnR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In 1983 Ronald Reagan approved an annual national holiday that marks King’s birthday on 15 January.  King was not only canonised posthumously; he was intermittently cherished in his lifetime. In December 1963 he was named Time magazine’s Man of the Year. A year later he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize: aged 35, he was the youngest person to receive the prize, and the second black American (after the UN mediator Ralph Bunche). In a 1964 Gallup poll the American public viewed King as the fourth most-admired man in the world, behind Lyndon Johnson, Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower.  But by 1966 his name had slipped out of the top ten, and 63 per cent of those Gallup surveyed that year viewed him negatively. Most Americans supported the Vietnam War, but King vociferously opposed it. The civil rights movement, which he led with great moral probity, was increasingly seen as an excuse for rioting and mindless violence. Files declassified in 2017 and 2018 showed that King was not a saint but a man who had extramarital affairs; they also showed he was treated with deep suspicion by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI.  Jonathan Eig’s biography of King gives us the person, not the icon. King’s grandfather Jim King never learned to read or write, never owned property and never voted. By the time King’s father was born in 1899, the Jim Crow laws – which mandated the separation of the races in schools, hospitals, theatres, hotels and prisons, on public transport and at water fountains – were already firmly established across the American South. Under Jim Crow, all the services reserved for black people were markedly inferior. Between 1885 and 1930 more than 4,000 black people were lynched.  Related  King grew up in a middle-class household, but as a black boy he was forbidden from swimming in the public pools or playing in the parks of his home city, Atlanta, Georgia. His father, Martin Luther King Sr, was a Baptist minister; so too was his maternal grandfather AD Williams. Both of these men presided over the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. As Eig writes, “Black Baptists outnumbered white Baptists in Georgia. Black culture and black political activism rose from the pews and pulpits of the black church.”  Subscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters Your new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each weekend – from the New Statesman.

THANK YOU Close  This proved crucial to King’s identity and trajectory: “Black Baptist preachers,” says Eig, “frequently imparted the radical message that all people were free and equal under God’s laws… that the racial hierarchies invented by men to justify slavery were false and craven, that the savagery of the Ku Klux Klan and the segregation laws of the South were abominations in the eyes of God, and that God would never love one group of people more than another based on the colour of their skin.”  At 15, King enrolled at Morehouse College, where Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Civil Disobedience” provided his first encounter with the theory of non-violent resistance, a philosophy that would underpin his activism. King delivered his first sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in 1947 when he was 18, and a year later he was formally ordained and became an assistant pastor there. But he had wider horizons.  At Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania he read Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Nietzsche, Rousseau and Mill. By this time in his youth, he was already a ladies’ man. On the morning of his graduation in 1951, he phoned a mentor, Reverend J Pius Barbour, to tell him that, as Eig writes, “several women were planning to attend the graduation ceremony, each one expecting to be introduced to King’s parents as his fiancée”.  Having moved to Boston to study for a doctorate, he met a budding concert singer called Coretta Scott in 1952, and they married the following year. At Boston University he indulged in plagiarism – in 1990 research revealed that parts of his dissertation’s introduction had been copied from the book The Theology of Paul Tillich – but he nevertheless became Dr King in June 1955.  [See also: Martin Luther King and the African-American fight for justice]  King made his name as a nationally significant figure in Montgomery, Alabama, where he moved in 1954 to be the minister at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. In December 1955 an alliance of ministers including King decided to endorse a bus boycott after the seamstress Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat for a white person. A few days later King gave a speech at Holt Street Baptist Church, which, according to Eig, signalled a transformative moment in his career. He discovered “that his purpose was not to instruct or educate; his purpose was to prophesise. With a booming voice and strident words, he marked the path for himself and for a movement.”  Eig adds that King “reminded the people that their advantage was in their moral superiority. They would not burn crosses or pull white people from their homes… They meant to reform American democracy, not overthrow it.” He did this by advocating boycotts, marches and sit-ins, and directly persuading politicians. King also put his safety on the line; he was constantly at risk of assassination and was jailed 29 times.  In 1957 King and a group of ministers launched the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He was not simply a political activist, but also a kind of moral guru. From 1957 to 1958 he wrote an advice column for Ebony magazine in which he defended interracial marriage and birth control, expressed opposition to both premarital sex and anti-Semitism, and described homosexuality as a “problem” that was “culturally acquired”.  The March on Washington, in which King delivered his totemic “I Have a Dream” speech, was originally scheduled for October 1963. But it was moved forward to August to harness the momentum of protests earlier in 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama, in which the infamous police chief Eugene “Bull” Connor set dogs and fire hoses on peaceful protesters. The Washington march attracted an estimated 250,000 people: Mahalia Jackson and Bob Dylan sang, and King was the final speaker.  A year later the Civil Rights Act was passed. It “banned segregation in public accommodations and outlawed discrimination based on race, sex, religion or national origin in the workplace”. King expanded his activism from the South to the North where, as Eig writes, segregation “was a function of law, public policy and discriminatory business practices”.  One of King’s fiercest critics in the 1960s was another black American activist and orator: Malcolm X. King was an integrationist who promoted non-violent civil resistance; Malcolm was a separatist who championed change by “any means necessary” and dismissed King’s 1963 rally as “the Farce on Washington”. However, Eig reveals that King’s famous criticism of Malcolm X, made in an interview with Playboy magazine in 1965, is more nuanced than previously thought. Playboy quoted King as saying, “I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice” – but the line does not appear in the interview transcript, in which King concedes, “Maybe [Malcolm X] does have some of the answer.”  [See also: What ever happened to Martin Luther King’s dream?]  King stood against racism, militarism and economic inequality throughout the 1960s. His relationship with Johnson, president from 1963 to 1969, soured over King’s fierce criticism of the Vietnam War. King’s final campaign before his assassination, aged 39, in April 1968, was advocating better conditions for Memphis sanitation workers.  His politics were not always as radical as they seemed. Eig points out that King “condemned capitalism for generating massive economic inequality while arguing that the system could be reformed. He called for higher worker wages and strong unions, but he did not insist on equal pay for all workers.” Quoting the scholar Tommie Shelby, he describes King as a social democrat rather than a Marxist.  Above all, King was an American patriot and Baptist minister. These positions shaped his outlook profoundly. They explain his support for integration and peace, and his opposition to segregation and inequality. The persuasive power of his oratory came in part from his attachment to the US’s founding principles – his unarguable conviction that the nation had failed to live up to the moral standards it professed to believe – and in part from his religiosity. His speeches were not just speeches, they were sermons.  Even as he grew more political, more powerful, and more respected, he drew his authority from the Bible and relished every opportunity to speak from a pulpit. “In the quiet recesses of my heart,” he said, “I am fundamentally a clergyman, a Baptist preacher.” His mission, he said, was not simply to change the laws and values of America but to redeem the nation’s soul.  Martin Luther King loved sleeping with women other than his wife. He was not always honest. He was not keen on women in positions of authority when it came to civil rights activism. He was an imperfect man, but – as this book convincingly shows – he was also a great one. The values he espoused and promoted illustrate he was very much an American hero. But it is through accepting his imperfections that we can better understand him as a human rather than a saint.  “This Is Not America: Why Black Lives in Britain Matter” by Tomiwa Owolade will be published in June by Atlantic  King: The Life of Martin Luther King  Jonathan Eig  Simon & Schuster, 688pp, £25  Purchasing a book may earn the NS a commission from Bookshop.org, who support independent bookshops  [See also: Simon Woolley Q&A: “I often say I am a disciple of Martin Luther King”]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9ib29rcy9ib29rLW9mLXRoZS1kYXkvMjAyMy8wNS9wYXRyaW90aWMtcHJlYWNoZXItbWFydGluLWx1dGhlci1raW5nLWFtZXJpY2HSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1762-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T20:06:29","Shows like The Great on Stan are changing how we look at history. Instead of being all about getting the facts straight, they’re shaking things up and telling the story their own way. These shows are rewriting the rulebook.  In The Great, the narrative deviates significantly from historical reality. This fast-and-loose approach, humorously labelled as “an occasionally true story”, represents a trend of irreverence that has been evolving over the years.  A German-born usurper, Catherine II, holds a significant place in Russian history, second only to Peter the Great.  Gatchina museum  She played a pivotal role in transforming Russia into a great empire, defying gender norms and expectations of her time. Catherine made Russia a European superpower and established foundations on which Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin based their ideologies of “Mother Russia” – she was the Mother Russia.  The Hulu series The Great takes a bold approach by re-imagining the life of Catherine II as a coarse period comedy. It utilises stunning historical settings to enhance the vivid absurdity of this romp through Russian history in the mid-18th century.  The Great doesn’t pretend to adhere closely to the historical record. Instead, it presents an extravagantly vulgar yet brilliantly humorous portrayal of Catherine II and her era. The series is fast-paced, fiercely witty and tailored for modern audiences, embracing the art of historicising filmmaking.  Taking liberties with history  The Great takes significant liberties with historical facts, distorting the timeline and altering the lineage of its characters.  In The Great, Peter is already emperor when Catherine arrives, whereas in reality, they were married for 17 years before he ascended the throne. In the series, Peter is the son of Peter the Great, whereas the true Peter was his German-born grandson. These creative deviations highlight the show’s inclination towards reimagining historical events for dramatic effect.  While The Great may not align with historical events, it provides an entertaining and irreverent perspective on Catherine the Great’s legacy as a powerful female ruler who shaped Russia’s destiny. Yet, it is not easy to separate fact from fiction, especially with the show’s warped timeline.  Catherine took the power as empress in 1762 and held the supreme authority of Russia until her death in 1796. In her usurpation of the crown, just six months after her husband, Peter III, took the throne, she was assisted by her lover Grigory Orlov.  Wikimedia  With his help, she staged a coup and dethroned Peter III “like a child being sent to bed”, drawing admiration from the Machiavellian Frederick the Great of Prussia.  Who was Catherine the Great?  Catherine was born Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst in 1729 in Stettin, Prussia (now known as Szczecin in Poland).  Her father, a minor German prince, was a Prussian governor of Stettin. Her mother’s royal connections and political machinations brought Sophie to the attention of the reigning Russian empress, Elizabeth. The empress decided to make Sophie the wife of her nephew and heir, Peter.  In 1744, the young German princess arrived in Russia, converted to Russian Orthodoxy, adopted the name Catherine and at the age of 16 was married to Peter.  Tver Gallery  Initially, Catherine struggled to navigate the complex and intricate dynamics of the Russian court, where Empress Elizabeth held absolute power. However, she was determined to learn and adapt to her new surroundings.  Catherine later reflected that she made a conscious decision to do whatever was necessary and to publicly embrace the beliefs and ideals required of her to be qualified for the crown of the tsars.  A disastrous marriage  Catherine and Peter’s marriage was a disastrous mismatch. They were completely incompatible in terms of intellect and interests.  While Catherine was an erudite lover of European culture, Peter was boorish and immature. He lacked ambition and did not understand his role as the future emperor. Their differences led them to seek intimacy elsewhere, raising questions about the paternity of their son, Paul I, who later believed that his father was Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of Poland-Lithuania.  With Peter’s ascension to the Russian throne upon his aunt Elizabeth’s death in 1762, Catherine recognised the threats to her position and life. Her decision to act and overthrow her husband was accelerated by Peter antagonising the key factions at court and behaving dangerously irrationally, as she wrote in her memoirs.  Within first six months of Peter’s reign, Catherine, supported by her followers, staged a coup, arrested Peter and coerced his abdication. He conveniently died eight days later under uncertain circumstances, possibly murder or an accidental result of a drunken brawl. The official cause of death was stated as “hemorrhoidal colic”, a euphemism for assassination.  Catherine claimed the throne in her own right rather that under the pretence of ruling as regent for her son Paul.  Hermitage Amsterdam  Her coronation highlighted her status as the God-anointed ruler of “All the Russias”, bringing us roughly to where the story is up to in season three of The Great – it is hard to tell.  The Great shocks and entertains by revealing that history can be retold to reflect on contemporary society. People, for all the celebrated progress and “giant leaps forward” are as vulnerable today as they were in the past.  Catherine in The Great whispers “Destiny didn’t do it. I did it.” The historical Catherine would most likely have agreed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vaHVsdXMtdGhlLWdyZWF0LWRlcGljdHMtaGVyLWFzLWh1bW9yb3VzLWFuZC12dWxnYXItdGhlLXJlYWwtY2F0aGVyaW5lLXRoZS1ncmVhdC1pcy1wZXJoYXBzLWV2ZW4tbW9yZS1pbnRlcmVzdGluZy0yMDUzOTTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1968-05-03","Not Discerned","{""Evanston"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T08:31:30","It’s been almost three weeks since the 55th anniversary of the Bursar’s Office Takeover, but what can the event still tell us about the larger scope of student protest? The Daily takes a look at a variety of student protest events of the 1960s and early 1970s, tying together the common threads.  PAUL O’CONNOR: From Columbia University in New York City to San Francisco State University in California, Northwestern was just one of many epicenters of student protest in the ’60s. What tied these movements together?  [music]  PAUL O’CONNOR: From The Daily Northwestern, I’m Paul O’Connor. This is Defining Safe, a podcast looking at the intersection of identity and student life at Northwestern.  [music]  PAUL O’CONNOR: On May 3, Northwestern commemorated the 55th anniversary of the takeover of the Bursar’s Office. The event saw over 100 students peacefully occupy the Bursar’s Office in response to unequal treatment of Black students in University policies surrounding housing, financial aid and academics.  MARTHA BIONDI: They were looking at questions of housing, the curriculum, dormitories, faculty hiring, cultural and social activities on campus, and they were really examining every aspect of student life … They were bringing a robust racial justice vision.  PAUL O’CONNOR: That was African American studies and history Prof. Martha Biondi. Biondi authored the book “The Black Revolution on Campus,” which traces the history of Black student activism and social movements across the ’60s and early 1970s.  PAUL O’CONNOR: She says the student activists involved in the Bursar’s Office Takeover were partly galvanized by the political and social turbulence of 1968.  MARTHA BIONDI: I think the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King in April 1968 was a kind of stunning and grievous event that really impacted young people and pushed them to, I would say, a new chapter in the movement’s history.  MARTHA BIONDI: When Dr. King was assassinated, I think one message of that was students felt like, “Oh, here’s this apostle of nonviolence, you know, get killed.” It just made them sad and angry, but also made them feel like they had to sort of intensify their tactics. And they had to sort of pose more of a challenge to institutions. And I think what you saw nationwide is students really engaged in more confrontational tactics. Like, they went on strike, they engaged in sit-ins, they took over buildings, they blocked traffic, that kind of thing.  PAUL O’CONNOR: Protests on campus against institutional racism coincided with protests against the Vietnam War, which lasted into the 1970s. Here’s Kevin Leonard, (Weinberg ’77, ’82) a University archivist for Northwestern. Here’s how he described the atmosphere in the country during the late ’70s:  KEVIN LEONARD: The 1960s, this is a very restive time not only in the United States, but around the world. You have context of the Vietnam War, you have context of an impending presidential election, you have context of the Memphis Sanitation (Workers’) Strike.  KEVIN LEONARD: There was opposition to allowing course credits for military training programs. There, periodically, were demonstrations against the presence of corporations doing hiring on campus if those corporations had been somehow tied to the war effort.  PAUL O’CONNOR: While alumni involved in the Bursar’s Office Takeover say the 38-hour protest was intense, contact between students and the administration never became violent. The University elected instead to negotiate with the students in a series of provisions collectively known as the “May 4th Agreement.” Among other things, the administration agreed to increase enrollment rates for Black students, work to provide financial aid packages and create identity-based housing and communal spaces.  PAUL O’CONNOR: However, student protests at other college campuses did not produce the same type of negotiations. Just a few days before the Bursar’s Office Takeover in Evanston, over 700 students were arrested and over 100 were injured by police after student activists at Columbia University occupied a campus building. The occupation was in response to university plans to expand further into the neighborhood of West Harlem to construct a new gymnasium.  PAUL O’CONNOR: And, six months after the Bursar’s Takeover, the longest-ever student strike in higher education in history occurred at San Francisco State University. Spearheaded by student activist organizations on campus, the strike lasted five months, with police arresting and injuring hundreds.  MARTHA BIONDI: I think that the police were called in a lot, and often in public institutions that were in states with conservative governors. For example, in California, the governor at the time was Ronald Reagan, who, you know, rose to political prominence on “law and order” platforms.  PAUL O’CONNOR: Dr. Sundiata Keita Cha-Jua teaches in the departments of African American Studies and History at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He offered more insight into the involvement of police in student protests.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: It’s not so much students and their tactics, because I think you can find places where a student brought guns on the campus but the police weren’t called. You can find places where the student didn’t bring guns on campus and the police were called. So I think it had more to do with the particular administration, the president, the chancellor, the board of trustees, in terms of their reaction. As a student, I, of course, participated in student protests. We took over some classrooms, and those things turned on whose classroom you took over.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: So I think it’s always going to be a dialectic between how those in power respond to the initial tactics of movement activists.  PAUL O’CONNOR: While many often mistake the civil rights movement as the key motivation for activism on college campuses at the time, Cha-Jua distinguishes the Black Power movement as the primary source of inspiration for student activists.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: The big distinction with Black Power is that Black Power is for, in some degree, structural access. But largely, Black Power is a call to build independent Black institutions and for Black people to gain control and take control of the U.S. public institutions that function in their community.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: So even though from that extent you could say that it’s about being allowed to enter those structures, but it’s talking about controlling those structures -– not just being brought in, but taking control.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: You can look at their dress … berets, black jackets. You can look at and listen to the rhetoric. The rhetoric mirrors the Black Power movement.  PAUL O’CONNOR: Cha-Jua says these student activists weren’t necessarily trying to fix or adjust the university system; rather, they were trying to construct something that adequately accommodated their demands. A major target, then, became the development of Black studies programs.  SUNDIATA KEITA CHA-JUA: We want Black studies. We want a full array of courses, a full curriculum that explores experiences of Black folk in every discipline. And we want to see the creation of an idea in which these disciplines are brought together in a way that something new emerges.  PAUL O’CONNOR: Biondi says this demand was at the heart of the Bursar’s Office Takeover as well as other student protests across the country.  MARTHA BIONDI: In some ways, you can think of it as going beyond what we might think of as a kind of simple process of desegregation or integration, and calling for, you know, a rejection of a eurocentric curriculum and a kind of white liberal colorblindness that sort of didn’t acknowledge or recognize Black cultural contributions to American life.

"political assassination","1973-09-11","Not Discerned","{""Santiago"", ""Metropolitana"", ""Chile""}","2023-05-22T18:56:39","The crisis in which PricewaterhouseCoopers finds itself is a useful illustration that the problem of politicians and bureaucrats becoming lobbyists, and of the revolving door syndrome are far from the only ones besetting integrity in public administration. The widespread use of supposedly independent consultants, many with deep and intractable conflicts of interest, is undermining good government, and costing taxpayers extra billions they should not have to be paying.  But the two problems are closely related, or, as a Twitter correspondent on a similar topic put it last week, different cheeks of the same arse. It is not a matter of a few bad apples, of the sort to be found in every bank, regiment, police force or judicial bench. It’s pretty much systemic by now, having corrupted the spirits and the actions of many of the institutions and the professions. It shouldn’t be surprising anyone. A few years ago, we had the Hayne Royal Commission into the Australian banks. Many were surprised to discover that the pursuit of profit and slight competitive advantage had stripped from most of our most senior bankers, and their boards, almost all concepts of honour, decency, honesty and ethical behaviour. Among the knowing participants on banking and superannuation boards were many of the great captains of industry, commerce, culture and the arts, flush with postnominals for their public service, intimacy with politicians, influence and that sense of public duty which underwrites the political donation system.  We were, supposedly, deeply shocked. Political party leaders vied with each other to declare they would adhere to each one of the recommendations made by Justice Ken Hayne. Four years on, not a single person has faced the courts or any professional bodies over their plain misbehaviour, and not a single recommendation has been adopted in its spirit or, really, its letter. Not a postnominal disappeared from a coat jacket. The dirty and bloody assassination of the report was done behind closed doors well out of the public eye – and by the usual suspects. By the malefactors themselves, very few of whom remained long publicly disgraced, over intimate dinners with politicians and public officials, some of whom had been excoriated for their failures of regulation and supervision. And by well-heeled lobbyists acting for profit. Some in full-time employment acting to promote the public image and the commercial interests of banks, and well trained in the arts of distraction, de-emphasis, diminishment and denial. Others were freelancers, people who, like barristers, will act for any client willing to pay, and put on their behalf any argument they think might serve to get the result that they need.  Many of either class were former politicians, with intimate knowledge of the personalities, predilections and partialities of those still in politics who would be making decisions on behalf of the public. By chance the royal commission report came just before an election campaign, and there was a flurry of activity, promises to learn the lessons and set a steady program of reform. Ministers, from the prime minister Scott Morrison down, who had fought valiantly against any idea that there was a fundamental problem and a need for an inquiry recognised (or at least insisted) that they had been deceived by their mates at the banks. Now they were affecting anger and determination for action. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg – like Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey, Mathias Cormann, and Morrison – a catspaw for acting in the banks’ interests, were now, we were given to think, on the public’s side. They were being invigilated by attacks by senior Labor spokesmen, who at that stage looked like winning the election. They were even more suspicious of any idea that the chronic misbehaviour had been some sort of aberration by women and men who deserved forgiveness after a short sharp purgatory. In a year since gaining power, they do not appear to have taken up any of the promises they made in 2019 or used Hayne as any sort of agenda for long-term reform. It’s ancient history now – a notion that by itself is a triumph for the lobbies and the marketeers, and those, on either side of mainstream politics with little appetite for interfering in the marketplace, demanding social responsibility or social dividends, or expecting that business would ever do anything other than grab for profit.  The PwC affair has a host of features in common with the banking scandals. Indeed, most of its worst features overlapped in time with the worst excesses of the banks, including decisions to charge dead people for the passive management of their bank accounts. A PWC partner sat on a committee to advise government about its future tax plans, including intentions for international co-operation to close a wide array of multinational avoidance and evasion schemes. At the committee, participants were given details about both proposed arrangements and the proposed timetable. The information was explicitly confidential.  The partner, with other senior partners and managers at PwC saw a commercial opportunity for the firm in improperly exploiting this inside knowledge for its own profit.  It could work nationally, but, even better internationally, particularly among high-tech companies engaged in large-scale tax evasion by transfer pricing, arranging transactions so that profits were made in very low tax centres. Business – for example the sale of millions of Apple computers, or advertising arrangements on vehicles such as Google, would have the appearance of being conducted at a loss, at least after licensing and management fees, and supply arrangements from fees and operations, were factored in. There were always some nations which operated as tax havens, now there were others, such as Ireland and the Netherlands, actively soliciting big multinationals to base their operations in their country and providing favourable tax conditions.  PwC people working in the tax area could approach such tax avoiders with inside knowledge of the international and Australian plans, and suggestions for ways of organising affairs to minimise the impact of the new arrangements. The phrase they themselves used was of “monetising” the confidential information – by selling it to those not in, or allowed to be in, the know. The clients or would-be clients would not be directly told about the source of the information, but by the wink wink nod nod system would know it was likely to be very reliable. It allowed them to be a part of the insider club.  It appears that most of the partners in the tax area – perhaps 50 of 900 partners – and most, if not all, of the senior managing partners knew all about the plan. Some cannot deny some knowledge but say they had no idea that it involved improper (and probably criminal) exploitation of confidential information. The problem with this is that PwC has form in this area and has been pinged (if not properly punished) before. Among those who never learn, apparently are folk in Treasury and in some of the financial regulatory agencies. They thought, and now, apparently think again, that the banks and the financial advising industry, were much the same. It is not necessarily a matter of old school ties and friends of friends. It is also a matter of blind faith in markets, despite the risk that markets can be rigged, disrupted by insider trading, or played with by people who are ignorant of the accepted decencies of “chaps” or who, being chaps, treat rules with contempt.  Many conspiracy theories have in their foundations the belief that insiders have privileged access to the system that ordinary people don’t.  It is an idea encapsulated by Donald Trump’s promise to drain the swamp. Experience with lobbyists and consultants in Australia would reinforce the idea of insiderness. For many of them, the world is divided between buyers and sellers, regulators and “stakeholders”, with only a limited regard for any sort of abstract public interest, or the community at large. Consultants buy and sell knowledge and expertise, sometimes as advice, sometimes in managing some project. The advice is rarely disinterested in any sense. The consultant knows what the buyer wants. There is often bargaining about the nature of the advice, and what will be left unsaid, or phrased differently. As the Robodebt scandal demonstrated, advice which ends up being unwanted can be disappeared, or given in another form. A $1 million consultancy on Robodebt ended up merely as a Powerpoint presentation, able to be quickly forgotten, even though a report is said, by then, to have already been written.  There is nothing wrong in seeking external advice. One might be seeking expertise that the public service does not have and could not be expected to nurture. Sometimes one wants to seek external advice by way of testing public service advice, or seeing if there are alternative ideas on a subject, perhaps in other jurisdictions. In either case, we expect that the advice is independent, focused first and last at the public interest, and is, in the classic sense frank and fearless. The consultant’s advice and report must compete in the marketplace of ideas, preferably in the open.  Universal use of consultants invariably undermines the public service. Lots of people will lobby ministers, each with a dog in the fight. Young and ambitious minders may have their own dotty ideas. But the public service ought to be the repository of relevant information and advice that is independent and not pushing a barrow for a particular interest or individual. Departments have been letting their policy advising functions wither and handing it to consultants and others who are not independent and, often, not working in the public interest. They have outsourced most of their central thinking and are neither saving money nor promoting efficiency in the long run. Often their reflex responsiveness to a government’s whims serves the government as badly as the public, as the Robodebt scandal shows. Down the track, moreover, agencies lose the capacity to engage properly in the decision-making process and may well be accentuating the very political shift in power away from the public service towards politicised ministerial offices, not wedded to accountability, transparency, good record keeping or explicit reference to the public interest.  The Covid pandemic had a doubly dire effect on the public service. The Treasurer was determined that it should not be the excuse for its expansion, one that would be difficult to undo once the pandemic was over. That is why many of the extra or new functions of government were let out to the public sector, including the big consultancies, often without any pretence of compliance with tender standards. It also saw consultants rush in to fill the gap on policy advising.  The explosion in consultancies, now slowed but by no means stopped.  The past decade, particularly under Morrison, saw public expenditure on consultants increase by a factor of 10, with most of the money going to the Big Four. PwC was paid more than $600 million. It was also, at the same time, and often with the very same people consulting to rich private sector clients, many of them multinational, about how to win the attention of the public sector and ministers, how to win contracts from government, and how to keep them. Mostly they were acting for big business, not strugglers. People who already had more access than anyone else, in part because they also hired former politicians who were friends of ministerial decision making, or bureaucratic insiders with expertise in pulling the strings.  To say that PwC and other big consultancies were playing both sides of the street might suggest to some that sometimes these consultants were working in the public interest, and at other times, they were working for private interests. A better way of putting it is that the public, and the public interest, rarely came into it. The PwC view of the world is a narrow one, almost invariably full of contestable ideas, such as the superiority of private sector methods compared with the public sector, and the virtues and values of privatisation, contracting out. The prime beneficiaries of such advice, whether going to government or against it, are people like themselves. Not the economy at large. Nor the population at large. At times indeed, the very existence of a report from outside consultants may help to dress up bad policy and bad decisions by giving them an appearance of a special objectivity, independence or inevitably, when the contrary is the case. They are being used to legitimise decisions that suit a government’s political interests, but which are hard to justify or explain if coming through the system.  I argued, two weeks ago, that former ministers and former senior bureaucrats should be banned altogether and indefinitely from acting as lobbyists or as for-profit advisers to government. I do not mean by that that a former insider with expertise must be lost to further public service. I am not opposed to diplomatic, judicial or quasi-judicial appointments where they are on merit rather than political payoff. I can see retired bureaucrats being directly recruited to advise agencies or ministers on special matters or with problems, including inquiries. I have no problem with a federal public servant advising state minister or departments in their fields of expertise, even as employees or temporary recruits of consultancies. And vice versa. But I think it wrong that expertise and experience accumulated while ostensibly serving the public interest should be allowed to be “monetised” and used against one’s former colleagues, or departments. Or to extract a higher price, or a particular order, from the taxpayer on behalf of third parties. I also think that the risk that public servants moving towards retirement will angle their decisions around post-public-service opportunities is far too great. Indeed, I think that in some areas, such as in Defence, the risks have been realised.  I dispute that “inside” knowledge has no value after a 12 months or 18 months separation. Insiderness can prevail forever, even after changes of government and senior personnel. But the impoverishment of public administration over the past decade or more has meant that the notional rules are scarcely being policed or enforced, even in high-risk areas such as defence and law enforcement. At ministerial level, codes have been generally ignored, or rationalised away to virtual non-existence by other insiders.  Some of those who would squeal pretend that this would be an unreasonable burden on their right to have a post-retirement income. It would not be an undue sacrifice and would not much cut the opportunities. Even in Canberra, the home of government, fewer than 0.5 per cent of the population are engaged in lobbying and consulting, and Australia-wide, it would be fewer than one in a thousand. I accept that many have been entirely ethical, but the risks are too great.  PwC is not transparent and many of its reports are never seen by the public. Its reports are short of much financial information because they are partnerships not companies. Some partners – the 95 per cent not involved in tax advice, for example – plead they should not be punished for breaches of duty by the tax partners because it would be unfair. Yet the very essence of legal partnership, and the reason why so many professionals have them, is shared income and risks, and opaque external accountability about economic relationships between partners. There’s a lot of blather and false advertising about “Chinese Walls” and internal protections against conflicts of interest. But one should see, from the tax case, what happens in practice. And one should also understand that the courts have no real respect for the idea, and do not believe that conflicts inside a partnership can be resolved by Chinese walls.  This suggests that the firm should be fined in the tens of millions, with any known to have participated in, or knowing about, the monetisation of confidential information being shown the door after extra fines, and probably criminal prosecutions. Some other consultant firms – McKinseys for example – have been required to pay penalties more than $1 billion for bad conduct in the US, with all partners having to pay. Ernst and Young may well find itself in similar problems – if not misbehaviour in the scale of PwC or McKinseys – over grossly negligent audits in Germany. No doubt the lobbyists are hard at work suggesting that token slaps on the wrist will send the message out and be enough. No one not an insider will agree.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vam9obm1lbmFkdWUuY29tL2hvdy1wd2MtbW9uZXRpc2VzLWl0cy1pbnNpZGVyLXNlY3JldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Cohen, a former counselor at the State Department, considers the dangers of a Russian victory in Ukraine and suggests how the West can best support Kiev. “A Russia that prevails would be a Russia even further empowered to meddle in Europe and to expand its influence with unlimited violence; a Russia that will have learned that it can commit slaughter and atrocities with impunity; a Russia whose ambitions will grow with success. A Russian victory would, as well, teach the world that the West — including the United States — lacks the resolve, despite its wealth, to follow through on its commitments, offering Beijing an encouraging lesson. Conversely, Russian defeat would put Beijing — already somewhat nervous about its partner’s incompetence and wild statements — on the defensive, consolidate the Western alliance, and help preserve some of the essential norms of decent behavior in those parts of the world most important to us. Above all, it would block the Russian imperial project for good, because without Ukraine, as the historian Dominic Lieven has noted, Russia cannot be an empire.” [TheAtlantic]  🕍 Trial and Tribulations: The Washington Post’s David Nakamura visits Pittsburgh as the city’s Jewish community prepares for the upcoming trial of the Tree of Life shooter and simultaneously begins renovations on the synagogue to transform it into a museum. “‘It’s easy to be discouraged by the ugliness and uncivil discourse,’ [Rabbi Jeffrey] Myers said. ‘I don’t look at it that I’m failing. I look at it as it reaffirms the choice I made, and there need to be voices to stand up and say, “This is not okay.”’ At the synagogue ceremony, he sought to lift up the congregants, referring to the seven decades the building had served the community: ‘We cannot, we must not, permit one day out of 25,993 days, to define us, nor outweigh all the good. Not only do these venerated walls hold great stories, but so do all of you assembled here today. And no one can take that away from us.’ The congregants were invited to place stones in the garden as a sign of respect. Myers was overcome by emotion as he picked up a screwdriver to remove a mezuza — the decorative case holding a parchment with Biblical passages that adorns Jewish doorways — that had been affixed to the synagogue’s main entrance since it opened in 1952. He sobbed quietly while wrapping the mezuza in a handkerchief and slipping it into his overcoat. It will be placed above the entrance of the renovated facility, which planners hope will open early next year.” [WashPost]  👀 History Lessons: In The New York Post, Tevi Troy compares the friction between President Joe Biden and New York City Mayor Eric Adams to the feud between former President Jimmy Carter and former Mayor Ed Koch. “The underlying reason for that feud was Carter’s Israel policy, but the actions and reactions are similar to the current one. Koch relentlessly criticized Carter’s Israel policy, and Carter responded with snubs. In one case, in October 1977, shortly before Koch’s election as mayor, Carter disinvited Koch from a limousine ride with the UN president. Snubs did not stop Koch, though. He continued to criticize Carter and his team and was even friendly to Carter’s 1980 Republican challenger Ronald Reagan when Reagan visited New York on the campaign trail, although he did not break party ranks and officially endorse Reagan. Carter fumed over Koch’s criticism. At a 1980 fundraiser, Carter himself complained to Koch that ‘you have done me more damage than any man in America.’ The feud had real consequences for Carter… This history is important, since the current feud could be harmful to Biden’s reelection efforts, both in a potential primary challenge, but also in a general election.” [NYPost]  🎵 Dark Notes: In an excerpt from his upcoming book published in The Wall Street Journal, Makana Eyre spotlights the lifelong effort of Aleksander Kulisiewicz, a Sachenhausen inmate who spent decades documenting how concentration camp inmates incorporated music into their lives. “At camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Buchenwald, Flossenbürg, Majdanek and Dachau, inmates had gathered to share music and poetry. Some prisoners composed original scores, from popular songs to classical or modern music, many of true artistic quality. Others wrote new lyrics to melodies they knew by heart… As Kulisiewicz documented, the SS used music to tire, humiliate and break prisoners. They were forced to sing cheery German folk songs as they marched to and from their work assignments, or during torturous physical activity. Camp orchestras were ordered to play during punishments and executions. Yet music could also lift people from despondency and hopelessness, even if for just a moment. Prisoners formed choirs, string quartets, harmonica troupes and performed for their fellow inmates, sometimes at great risk. One prisoner, Bohdan Rossa, attended a performance of a secret string quartet at Sachsenhausen. He later wrote of the experience, ‘After the first few notes I thought I had a fever. It ran hot and cold down my back. It was like a dream.’” [WSJ]    💌 Shadchan Spotlight: In New York magazine, Hannah Jackson looks at the resurgent popularity of matchmaking in the Jewish community. “What was once seen as desperate is slowly becoming de rigueur. Dating apps evolved in a similar way. But today, there is no shortage of reporting on how online dating mostly just frustrates young singles. The lack of courtesy and seemingly endless choices of dating-app culture has bred a Prisoner’s Dilemma of sorts, fostering an environment that punishes sincerity and rewards indifference. It’s a concept that can feel completely antithetical to finding a real partner. But using a matchmaker could make things easier. Instead of questioning your date’s intentions, you already know that they’re getting drinks with you because they really are looking for something romantic — not just sex or even an ego boost. And if you both used the matchmaking service to find each other, it can feel like permission has been granted for both parties to act with earnestness.” [NYMag]","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vamV3aXNoaW5zaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9kYWlseS1raWNrb2ZmLXRoZS1sYXRlc3Qtb24tdGhlLXdoaXRlLWhvdXNlLWFudGlzZW1pdGlzbS1zdHJhdGVneS1taWtlLWZldWVycy1sLWEtcGl0Y2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1914-07-16","Not Discerned","{""Sarajevo"", ""FederacijaBosnaIHercegovina"", ""BosniaHerzegovina""}","2023-05-23T02:00:00","The contrast couldn't be starker. G7 declared it would supply F16 fighter jets to Ukraine while its leaders posed for an official photograph in Osaka, Japan, with the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Dome in the background.  History shows that wars often start when interests of major powers collide. European powers fought over the control of their colonies in World War I. In the early 1900s, most of the colonies in Asia and Africa were under the British and French imperial control. Other European powers were not happy and they wanted a share of the lucrative pie. As British and French expansionism continued, tensions rose with their opposing powers – Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire (Central Powers). Germany felt surrounded and threatened by the Triple Entente alliance between France, Britain, and Russia. The triggering event for World War I was, of course, the assassination of Austria's Archduke Franz Ferdinand, but there were already elaborate preparations for war. Austria-Hungary declared war against Serbia. Russia moved to Serbia's support, initiating the world war, dragging everyone else into it.  The result was devastating, killing almost 17 million people. The infamous Western Front between Germany and France became a hallmark of horror, poison gas and trench warfare, where a few million died as the front moved back and forth by only a few hundred metres. The futility of war couldn't be more evident, which is the subject of Erich Maria Remarque's book All Quiet on the Western Front (1928). It is a heart-wrenching saga of how innocent and naive young men are stoked with toxic nationalism to get at each other's throat, all the more bizarre because they have no conflict between them, but are only feeding into the warmongers' insatiable thirst for power, influence, and wealth.  World War I ended with Germany, the Ottoman Empire, and their alliance's defeat. But seeds for future wars were also sown, resulting in World War II, and the incessant conflicts in the Middle East which is still going on.  After World War II, the European alliance system continued in a different form – the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) under the American leadership, and the Warsaw Pact under the Soviets. The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, taking down the Warsaw Pact with it, but Nato continued to expand, almost surrounding Russia and coming close to Moscow's doorstep, reminiscent of the situation Germany faced before World War II.  Just as the fascists rose to power in the post-WW1 Germany with an aim to rearm and regain its lost stature in the world stage, Russia also increased its military might and became more assertive in establishing its influence in the geopolitical arena, preparing the ground for the Ukraine war.  Of course, the above is an oversimplification of a much more complex set of events and intricately linked interests of Europe, Russia, China, and the US. The increasingly confident role of the European Union (EU), its growing trade with China, and Russia's expanding energy supply network to Europe – all have had something to do in the events leading to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some of these are worth recalling.  In 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron bluntly stated that Europe should itself be a strategic geopolitical power if it wanted to be in control of its destiny, further adding that Nato was facing ""brain death.""  Ignoring American dismay, Europe expanded its collaboration with China and adopted the China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation, taking the 2015 Connectivity Platform further towards implementation. Germany planned to go ahead with Nord Stream pipelines to buy Russian gas despite considerable opposition from the US. In November 2019, a China-Germany joint venture launched the fastest rail service from Xi'an to Hamburg and Neuss, cutting transit time from 17 days to 10-12 days. In 2014, Victoria Nuland, then the assistant US secretary of state, was caught in a telephone conversation about Ukraine where she dismissed the EU with an F-word, forcing her to apologise.  Now, after the onset of the ongoing Ukraine crisis, Nato has revived with increased vigour as Finland has become its latest member, soon to be followed by Sweden. For the first time in history, the US is now a bigger gas supplier to Europe than Russia. Not only that, Europe is paying much higher for American gas replacing Russian supply. Nord Stream is as good as dead. Europe's defence spending has increased significantly.  Who will want to end such a beneficial war?  That's why it's not at all surprising that G7 has taken a tougher stance on Russia and decided to supply Ukraine with more equipment and money. But that will only fuel the war further and cause lasting devastation to the country and its people, not to mention the huge profit it will bring to the defence contractors.  Military interventions are often justified with promises of ""eliminating terrorists."" But after decades of war that ended in a huge disappointment (Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021), creating ""homelands"" for lasting peace, which rarely happens (Israel-Palestine conflict since 1948), or removing ""tyrants"" that only created more anarchy and led to the deaths of millions including children (Iraq since 2003), we should know how futile military force can be when it comes to eliminating conflicts at their roots.  Of course, geopolitics is a reality and must be dealt with as such. But if we want peace, we should stop fuelling war and address the root causes of conflicts instead. Ironically, peace was perhaps the last thing in the G7 leaders' minds.

Tim Scott (S.C.), who filed paperwork on Friday with the Federal Election Commission to run for president in 2024, kicked off his campaign for the GOP primary with an announcement address Monday morning in Charleston.  The only Black Republican member serving in the Senate, Scott developed a strident anti-LGBTQ record since entering national politics in 2010 with his first election to the House, during which time he told Newsweek homosexuality is a “morally wrong choice, like adultery.”  Today, Scott remains opposed to same-sex marriage, writing on his Senate bio that South Carolinians “have voted overwhelmingly to protect the traditional definition of marriage, and I stand with their decision.”  Last year, Scott cosigned a letter with 20 other Senate Republicans urging the GOP caucus to oppose the Respect for Marriage Act unless it contained provisions allowing for discrimination against LGBTQ couples. Scott, 57, is single and never married, which has led to some speculation about his sexual orientation.  In February, with GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, Scott introduced legislation that would cut funding for any elementary or middle school in the country that changes a student’s pronouns, gender markers, or access to sex-based accommodations like locker rooms without first obtaining consent from their parents or legal guardians.  Having developed a reputation as a fiscal and social conservative who is well-liked by his Republican Senate colleagues, Scott hopes to build a coalition of establishment types and evangelical conservatives who are skeptical or critical of the party’s 2024 frontrunner, former President Donald Trump.  According to Vox, Scott is polling around 1 percent, but he will be able to transfer $22 million from his Senate campaign coffers to help fund his presidential bid and has begun aggressively buying up television ads in early primary states as campaigns get underway in the next few months.  The junior senator from South Carolina will face off against the state’s former Republican governor, Nikki Haley, who served as ambassador to the United Nations during the Trump administration. Haley, who appointed Scott to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jim DeMint in 2012, announced her bid for president in February.  Caitlin Byrd, senior politics reporter for the Post and Courier, noted on Twitter that South Carolina Democrats are broadcasting mobile billboards that echo the same arguments they used to oppose Haley’s candidacy, seeking to portray the candidates’ platforms as indistinguishable from Trump’s.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25ibGFkZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9hbnRpLWxnYnRxLXJlcHVibGljYW4tc2VuLXRpbS1zY290dC1lbnRlcnMtMjAyNC1wcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtcmFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2005-11-01","10:30:00","{""Gandhinagar"", ""Gujarat"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T09:32:36","On 17 May, Azam Khan—a crucial witness in the high-profile case relating to the alleged extrajudicial killings of the gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh; his wife, Kauserbi; and his associate Tulsiram Prajapati—was moved from Udaipur Central Jail to a high-security prison in Ghooghra, in Ajmer district. A relative of Khan’s told me that they spoke to him while he was still in Udaipur, through a phone that prisoners are allowed to access, around 10.30 am that day. They recalled that Khan told them that police officials had notified him about the decision approximately half an hour earlier. “It was all very sudden,” the relative said.    Khan, who knew Sheikh, Kauserbi and Prajapati, made several explosive claims while testifying before a special Central Bureau of Investigation court hearing the case in Mumbai, on 3 November 2018. Later that month, his wife, Rizwana Khan, filed a petition at the Rajasthan High Court seeking protection for her husband, asking that he not be transferred and that he and his family be provided security. The petition alleged that Khan and his family had “been facing a growing number of threats,” and that police officials had warned him that he would be “killed en route like Tulsiram Prajapati was.” This petition is pending before the court.    In a December petition to the Bombay High Court, Rizwana noted that such threats had been issued to her husband many times since October, specifically that he would be transferred to the high-security prison in Ajmer, “and thereafter, whenever he was brought from Ajmer to Udaipur for court appearances, any adverse incident could happen … be it through unknown perpetrators or under the guise of a gang war.”    I reached out to multiple Rajasthan police officials to confirm Khan’s transfer and to seek details on the underlying reasoning. “Actually, this is not our concern, and I am not the appropriate person to speak about it,” Ajay Pal Lamba, the inspector general for the Udaipur range, told me. Vikas Sharma, the police superintendent of Udaipur, said, “I don’t think this is a right question to ask. First you should tell me why you are asking me about this person … These are administrative issues, ma’am, they don’t need any reasoning … This is a very routine process, ma’am.” Bhupendra Kumar Dak, Rajasthan’s director general of police for prisons, replied, “Who told you, who told you … tell me, where did you get this information from.” He said, “Why is Caravan magazine so interested in this, in Azam Khan?”    ***  Sheikh, Prajapati and Khan were associates and had known each other, according to Khan’s testimony before the CBI special court, since about 2002. In the testimony, Khan recalled that he had helped them find housing in Udaipur and also made arrangements for Sheikh and Kauserbi’s wedding, because of which Sheikh and he became close.    In his testimony, Khan made a startling assertion: Sheikh had told him that he, along with two other people, Shahid Rampuri and Naeem Khan, had killed Haren Pandya, a former home minister of Gujarat. “I felt sad and told Sohrabuddin that they have killed a good person,” Khan said. “Thereafter Sohrabuddin told me that this contract of killing was given by Shri. Vanzara.”    In the initial months following Pandya’s assassination, DG Vanzara, a senior Gujarat Police official, headed the crime branch’s investigation. The case was later transferred to the CBI. The agency’s subsequent probe into the alleged extrajudicial killings of Sheikh, Kauserbi and Prajapati prominently featured Vanzara as one of the prime accused in the case. Khan’s testimony raised troubling questions about the veracity of the official account of Pandya’s death—upheld by the Supreme Court in July 2019—according to which the murder was “part of an international conspiracy” to “spread terror among Hindus.”  A Bharatiya Janata Party leader and member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Pandya was found dead in his car on the morning of 26 March 2003. Pandya’s father was vocal about his belief that the assassination was a “political murder” and wanted Gujarat’s chief minister at the time, Narendra Modi, to be investigated in the case. He even filed a petition to this effect with the Supreme Court, which the court dismissed.    In November 2005, Sheikh, Kauserbi, and Prajapati, were travelling from Hyderabad to Sangli, in Maharashtra, by bus. According to the CBI’s charge sheet, police officials intercepted them en route. Sheikh and Kauserbi were eventually taken to a farm house near Gandhinagar, where they were killed, within days of each other. The CBI accused police personnel from Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh of being involved in and executing the conspiracy. Soon after news of Sheikh’s murder broke, the Gujarat Police reportedly claimed that he had been associated with the Pakistani terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba and was supposedly plotting to assassinate Modi. The police also claimed that officials killed Sheikh because he fired at them when they tried to apprehend him.    Prajapati, who alighted from the bus with Sheikh and Kauserbi, was a witness to their abduction, according to one of the CBI’s charge sheets in the case. Less than a month after the killings, he was imprisoned in the Udaipur Central Jail for a separate murder case. Through the following year, Prajapati was vocal about the threat to his life and even wrote to the National Human Rights Commission, seeking help. His mother reportedly recalled him telling her multiple times, “mera counter ho jaega”—I will be killed in an encounter. In December 2006, Prajapati’s fear came true. He was returning to Udaipur from a court hearing in Ahmedabad when, according to the police officials accompanying him, he supposedly escaped from their custody, forcing them to take lethal action.    In its investigation, the CBI alleged a chilling conspiracy, which traced its roots to an extortion racket enabled by a “criminal-politician-police nexus,” of which Sheikh and Prajapati had been part. Eventually, the bureau named Amit Shah, then Gujarat’s minister of state for home affairs, as one of the chief conspirators behind the racket and subsequent killings. Its charge sheets in the case also included the names of Vanzara, Gulab Chand Kataria, Rajasthan’s junior home minister at the time, and Dinesh MN, the then police superintendent for Udaipur, among several other police officials.    By the time that Prajapati was taken to Udaipur Central Jail, Khan—who had been arrested months earlier, in relation to the same murder case as Prajapati—was imprisoned there as well. (Everyone accused in the murder case, including Sheikh, Khan and Prajapati, were subsequently acquitted.) “Tulsiram met me and started weeping by saying that Sohrabuddin and Kausarbi have been killed because of his mistake,” Khan said in his testimony. He recalled Prajapati telling him that Vanzara and other Gujarat police officials had obtained Prajapati’s cooperation in apprehending Sheikh under false pretences. They had assured Prajapati that Sheikh would only be arrested for a few months at most, as there was “political pressure,” and then released.    In the months leading up to Prajapati’s murder, according to the CBI, Rajasthan and Gujarat police officials likely made multiple attempts to target him and, by extension, Khan, when they travelled to Gujarat for court appearances in relation to one of the cases in which they were accused. Several among these police officers, including Dinesh MN, were accused in the alleged extrajudicial killings of Sheikh and Kauserbi. In one of its charge sheets, the CBI surmised that some of these efforts were thwarted because Khan and Prajapati’s relatives, whom the two had alerted about the danger they sensed to their lives, accompanied them along with the police escorts when they travelled.    During one such court visit, Khan recalled in his testimony, officials from Gujarat’s Anti-Terrorism Squad took over their custody from Rajasthan police officials once they reached Ahmedabad. Khan noted that it was customary for them to be taken to the Sabarmati Jail before being produced in court but, this time, the officials took them to the ATS office instead. “Myself and Tulsiram were under fear,” Khan said. “We both started shouting by saying that we will be killed by police.” They were eventually taken to a judge. The ATS claimed that it was protecting Khan and Prajapati, since their lives were in danger because of gangsters. “I told the judge that I fear [for] my life at the hands of the police,” Khan added. He recalled that he also told the judge that they should be taken back to Udaipur handcuffed, so that the police could not later claim “that we attempted to run away and that time were killed in encounter.”    On 25 December 2006, Prajapati travelled for another court appearance along with a team of escorting police officials, which, the CBI alleged, had been “handpicked” by Dinesh MN. Khan did not go with Prajapati for this hearing; he had been taken into police custody in another case. The CBI alleged that, although Dinesh could have interrogated Khan in relation to this case a few days earlier, he told his colleague that he wanted to see Khan on 25 December. He did this to ensure “that Tulsiram Prajapati has to travel alone to Ahmedabad,” a CBI charge sheet noted. It added that Dinesh had told his subordinates that he would interrogate Khan in person, but he never interrogated Khan during the time he was in police custody. The charge sheet stated that “this only proves that his only purpose in all this was that he was acting in furtherance of the criminal conspiracy … to ensure that Mohd. Azam is separated from Tulsiram Prajapati during the transportation of the latter.”    On 28 December, Prajapati was killed.    In his testimony, Khan recalled his final meeting with Prajapati in jail, on 23 or 24 December. “The last talk between us was that either I will not come back or he will not come back to jail.”    ***  On 19 December 2018, over a month after Khan’s testimony in front of the CBI court and only a few days before the court reached its verdict, he sought to be re-examined. In an application to the court, Khan wrote that his testimony was incomplete because he had faced “almost twenty days of unrelenting torture at the hands of Udaipur Police personnel” in the days preceding the testimony and that, “even on the morning of the deposition [Khan] was threatened by one of the accused.” As a result, the application noted, although Khan “was able name one retired IPS officer”—Vanzara—he was scared to name other police officers and politicians.    Khan claimed that his statement recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code was not exhibited as evidence by the public prosecutor. Unlike statements to the police, those given under Section 164 are admissible as evidence.    According to the application, the details which were left out of his deposition included the fact that, in 2010, he had been threatened by Gujarat Police officials and was taken into illegal custody to give a false affidavit that stated that the CBI had coerced him into giving false statements. Khan said that he was forced to go to a hotel in Ahmedabad, and that one of the people who took him there told him, “What you did by giving a statement against our Abhay Chudasma sir in court wasn’t right. You can’t even imagine what we will do to you now.” Chudasama was a deputy commissioner of the Gujarat Police at the time of the alleged extrajudicial killings of Sheikh and Kauserbi, and an accused in the CBI case. Khan said in his statement that he was also told, “Amit Shahji is getting bail by 27 September 2010, we have had the whole conversation with him, we will get you a flat here, and whatever business you say, we’ll help you set it up here.”    A CBI charge sheet, which made note of the incident, stated that its investigation had disclosed that Shah and Chudasama, “while in judicial custody, conspired with some Gujarat police officers to destroy the crucial evidence, and to shield accused from the law.” Khan’s abduction, it alleged, was in “furtherance of the said conspiracy.” The bureau also found that by filing the false affidavit, Khan was “forced to retract from his statement with the view to help accused Shri Amit Shah to obtain bail.”    In his December 2018 application, Khan alleged that he and his family were harassed, intimidated and threatened in a sustained manner during the six months preceding his testimony. On 7 June that year, the application claimed, two of his brothers and his uncle were picked up by the Udaipur police. The officials allegedly threatened Khan’s mother, telling her that they would not let her relatives go unless Khan “testified as per their wishes.” The application stated that Khan’s relatives were released seven days after being picked up—but were made to sign statements that claimed that they had been taken for questioning only for a couple of hours and had immediately left for the Ajmer Sharif Dargah without telling their family.    The application added that, when Rizwana Khan went to the CBI court on 26 September, she was threatened by an unknown person inside the court room who told her that Khan needed to give his witness statement “as we have told him to.” Rizwana submitted a written request from her husband to the court, asking that he be allowed to testify on a date of his choosing to ensure his safety. The court agreed to this.    Five days later, the application went on, three men on motorcycles without number plates accosted Rizwana as she was leaving her home. They forced her to go with them to a location nearby, where a white luxury car was parked. A person sitting in the back seat of the car allegedly threatened Rizwana and told her that, if Khan did not give a favourable statement, “what had happened to Kausarbi … would happen to her” and that her husband “would meet a fate worse than that of Sohrabuddin and Tulsiram.”    On 6 October, Rizwana detailed her experience in a letter to the then chief justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, which was copied to the chief justice of the Rajasthan High Court, Pradeep Nandrajog, and the chief justice of the Bombay High Court, Naresh Harishchandra Patil. In this letter, Rizwana also alleged that the person in the car told her to give Azam the “example of Justice Loya, in which he did not follow one instruction and what we did with him.” BH Loya, who had been presiding over the special CBI court hearing the matter related to the extrajudicial killings, died under mysterious circumstances on the intervening night between 30 November and 1 December 2014. Rizwana also sent letters to the NHRC and the National Commission for Women, flagging the intimidation.    Khan, who had reportedly been out on bail, was arrested in Delhi on 12 October by a special branch of the Udaipur police. Khan’s application alleged that he was brought to the Bhupalpura police station in Udaipur. Rizwana only found out the next day, when she went looking for him. According to the application, when she reached the police station, she was not allowed to speak to Khan. Instead, the in-charge of the station, Harinder Singh Soda, allegedly assaulted Rizwana and put her in a lock up. “Her phone was also taken from her and she was detained there for four-five hours, from about 11 am to 4 pm,” the application alleged.    The application alleged that, between 13 October and 18 October, Khan was repeatedly assaulted in custody. On 17 October, the application stated, Soda forced Khan to sit in front of a Hanuman temple on the premises of the police station and directed over fifty police personnel to beat him. By 23 October, the application added, Khan was taken to a Mahila Police Station, on the outskirts of Udaipur city, where Bhagwat Singh Hingad, the deputy superintendent at the time, tortured him, and “he was repeatedly told not to implicate police officers from Gujarat and Rajasthan.” Khan “was also threatened that he would, like Tulsiram Prajapati, be killed while being transferred between cities.”    According to the application, on the morning of 3 November—the day on which Khan was to testify—the police officials accompanying him took him to a black car parked near his hotel. Abdul Rehman was sitting inside. Rehman, a police inspector from Rajasthan at the time of the alleged extrajudicial killings, was one of the officials accused by the CBI in its investigation. Khan alleged that the police team left him for around half an hour with Rehman, who told him to not mention any police personnel from Rajasthan in his statement or else “more cases would be concocted against him.” In the application, Khan also alleged that Rehman threatened him again at a police station when he returned to Udaipur the next day.    Given the prevailing circumstances, by 15 November, Rizwana filed the petition with the Rajasthan High Court, asking for protection as well as requesting an order to prevent Khan’s transfer from Udaipur. Two days later, Khan, then in judicial custody, was taken to the Udaipur Central Jail where, according to his application, the jail superintendent told him that he was being transferred to the high-security prison in Ajmer. On 30 November, the application alleged, an attempt was made to move him even though Rizwana’s petition was pending. The transfer was stopped at that time after Khan’s mother went to the Udaipur Central Jail and submitted an application stating that his life would be in “grave danger” if he were to be moved, and Rizwana filed an email complaint with multiple authorities, including the NHRC and Rajasthan’s director general of police for prisons.    Khan’s application to be re-examined by the CBI special court, as well as a similar application filed by another witness in the case—Mahender Zala, a Gujarat-based petrol pump owner—were rejected on 21 December, the same day that the court passed its verdict, acquitting all 22 accused due to lack of evidence. The CBI had originally named 38 people, of which the special court had already discharged 16, including politicians and senior police officers. By the time the court passed its verdict, 92 out of the 210 witnesses in the case had turned hostile.    Dinesh MN, who was arrested in relation to the case in 2007 and suspended from service, was released on bail on 9 May 2014. He was reportedly reinstated by the Rajasthan Police four days later. In August 2017, he was discharged from the case by the CBI special court. In February 2023, he was posted as Rajasthan’s additional director general for crime.    On the day of Khan’s transfer, while I was reaching out to Rajasthan police officials with queries, I got a call from Manjeet Singh, who identified himself as an additional police superintendent of Udaipur. “This is just a routine process, the police does these things from time to time,” he said, when I asked him about the reason for Khan’s transfer. That night, I reached out to Paras Jangid, the superintendent of prisons in Ajmer, for details. He said, “Ho gaya, woh aa gaya”—It’s done, he has come. According to Jangid, Khan reached the prison “around 3–4 pm.”    On the afternoon of 20 May, Khan’s lawyer, Akhilesh Mogra, met Khan at the Ajmer prison. “He was quite scared and nervous,” Mogra told me. “He said he is not able to understand why he was suddenly transferred.” According to Mogra, while Khan was in a cell with other prisoners at the Udaipur Central Jail, he was alone in his cell at the high-security prison in Ajmer. “Neither is he being allowed to meet anyone, nor is he being allowed to speak with anyone,” Mogra said, adding that, when Khan enquired about this, he was told, “It will be like this till there are further instructions from higher authorities.”  I reached out to Jangid again on the night of 21 May. He denied that Khan was the solitary occupant of his cell, claiming that one more person was lodged there. “I saw this myself when I had visited the prison,” he said. I asked him when he had made the visit, to ascertain whether it was before or after Mogra met Khan. “I can’t tell you that,” Jangid replied. “I have already told you quite a bit, and these are matters of security.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYXZhbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmluL2NyaW1lL2tleS13aXRuZXNzLWluLXNvaHJhYnVkZGluLWNhc2UtYXphbS1raGFuLW1vdmVkLWZyb20tdWRhaXB1ci10by1ham1lci1qYWls0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2009-07-17","Not Discerned","{""Istanbul"", ""Istanbul"", ""Turkey""}","2023-05-22T18:18:00","Duvar English  Every day a new piece of information emerges about the affiliations of the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) new partner Free Cause Party (HÜDA-PAR) with the radical Islamist terrorist organization Hizbullah.  Now it has come to light that a former executive of Hizbullah, named Mehmet Fatih Anal, is currently a member of HÜDA-PAR’s General Advisory Board, according to Özgür Cebe from the daily Sözcü.  Anal fled Turkey in the early 2000s after authorities issued a search warrant against him due to his position in the Hizbullah. His activities within Hizbullah came out when police seized the group's archive during a raid in Istanbul in 2000.  In an attempt to secure asylum, Anal unlawfully fled to Switzerland while successfully evading the authorities who were actively searching for him.  He was detained by Swiss police on July 17, 2009 after a red notice was issued against him, and the news of his arrest was communicated to the Swiss Consulate of Turkey.  On the same date, Turkey’s Justice Ministry submitted an extradition request to the Swiss authorities for Anal. In the file, the ministry stated that Anal was an executive of the terrorist group Hizbullah, that he was in charge of mosques within the scope of the organization's activities, that he recruited members for the organization, that he collected money under the name of zakat on behalf of Hizbullah and sent reports to the organization's management.  However, Switzerland rejected this request and did not hand Anal over to Turkey.  In the early 2000s, Hizbullah started to reorganize itself quietly under a number of foundations, associations and other entities. Several members of the group established the HÜDA-PAR as a political party in December 2012 with the support of the current government, which green-lighted the party's entry into politics.  The AKP lifted the arrest warrant against Anal after its ties with the HÜDA-PAR became stronger. Anal then voluntarily came to Turkey and was released after his statement was taken during this process.  A report prepared by intelligence units and submitted to the National Security Council (MGK) in 2005, stated that Hizbullah was preparing an assassination plan against senior generals in order to give morale to its base after their leader was killed during the operation in 2000.  Hizbullah members who stood trial are known to have said in their testimonies that Anal was one of the most influential figures of the organization.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1dmFyZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vaHVkYS1wYXJzLWFkdmlzb3J5LWJvYXJkLW1lbWJlci13YXMtb25jZS1pbnRlcnBvbC13YW50ZWQtc3VzcGVjdC1vdmVyLWhpemJ1bGxhaC10cmlhbC1uZXdzLTYyNDUx0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR1dmFyZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vYW1wL2h1ZGEtcGFycy1hZHZpc29yeS1ib2FyZC1tZW1iZXItd2FzLW9uY2UtaW50ZXJwb2wtd2FudGVkLXN1c3BlY3Qtb3Zlci1oaXpidWxsYWgtdHJpYWwtbmV3cy02MjQ1MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1984-01-01","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-22T15:45:13","It all started in the year 1873 with what was named the “The Singh Sabha Movement,” which had two primary objectives. The first objective was to ensure that Sikhs were not deprived of the prevalent Western modern education of that time. The second objective, founded in Amritsar in 1873, had the dual purpose of providing modern Western education to the Sikh community and countering the influence of other religious groups such as Muslim preachers, the Arya and Brahmo society, who had their own cultural concepts, and the promoters of Christianity. The first step was to establish their own schools, which they called Khalsa Schools, in Punjab, conforming to their religious identity. This was followed by the Akali movement, which aimed to free all Sikh Gurudwaras from the control of the Udasin Mahants, whom the Sikhs believed to be infidels.  These two movements played a pivotal role in the advancement of Sikh nationalism. The Khalsa schools succeeded in proliferating Sikh nationalism, and the subsequent events after India’s independence further bolstered the demand for Khalistan. The Akali movement continued to campaign for even more autonomy for the religious institutions of the Sikhs. These historical movements laid the foundation for the emergence of the Khalistan movement in the years to come. The partition of India in 1947 was displeasing for Sikhs as they felt that they lost their established lands to Pakistan, resulting in a mass migration of immigrants into India. This period also witnessed brutal inter-communal violence between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, resulting in the loss of many innocent lives. To preserve Sikh identity, another movement called the “Punjab Suba” was launched by the community, aiming to reestablish Punjab on the basis of language, leading to the split of the region into three areas: Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab.  The Khalistan movement was spurred by the “Anandpur Sahib Resolution,” which demanded Punjab’s autonomy and the identification of regions for a separate state. The resolution also called for Punjab to have its own constitution. Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a forerunner of the movement, sought to restore the doctrines of puritan Sikhism. The movement soon took the form of agitation, and the Government of India launched “Operation Blue Star” to capture Bhindranwale and halt the movement, resulting in strong anti-India sentiment. Other extremist groups such as the Commando Force of Khalistan, Khalistan Liberation Force, and the Babbar Khalsa also emerged, successfully misleading the youth into believing that extremism was the only way to achieve Khalistan.  As years passed, the movement turned into a vicious attempt, backed by anti-India forces, to destabilize India. Four decades ago, when India and Russia (then USSR) proposed to join hands to strengthen the eastern front, the move did not sit well with the Western powers and their proxies. Many plans were unleashed to disrupt India, such as creating turmoil in Punjab, forming the Gorkha movement in the east, galvanizing Tamils in Sri Lanka, and the migration and atrocities against Hindus in Kashmir. These were all well-mastered plans to destabilize India’s growth. Sikhs were made to brutally fight for a separate country. At that time, the pro-Soviet Indian Government quickly became a threat to the growing Western powers.  In the 1980s, in an uprising attempt, extremists hid arms and ammunition in the Golden Temple because, according to the country’s law, it is believed that no bloodshed can be done in religious places like mosques, temples, and other places of worship. During Indira Gandhi’s regime, a civil war-like situation emerged in which both Hindus and Sikhs were killed.  A well-planned assassination saw Indira Gandhi being shot dead by her Sikh bodyguards. The killing of Gandhi in 1984 and the anti-Sikh riots further stoked anti-India feelings in the community. To prevent prosecution, many perpetrators fled the country and went to countries like Canada, the USA, Australia, and England.  Now, as India is becoming stronger, Khalistan supporters are playing truant and paying heaps of money to somehow keep the agitation alive. The sheer size of India and its recent success has once again become a threat for a certain section of misguided Sikh youths. Amritpal Singh used to travel in luxury cars and also barged into police stations, asking for the release of his associates who are in prison. He was on the run for a very long time and used to relay messages stating that he would surrender only if he was kept in a Punjab jail. The police were unable to hunt him down for quite a long time, and certain sources claim that he was being protected by political parties who oppose India’s central government. He blatantly declared that under no circumstances would he surrender to the Indian Government. Kumar Vishwas, a poet and socio-political activist, had claimed that the present Government in Punjab and its supreme leader supported terrorists. Vishwas was once part of the same party but left them after what he called inappropriate connections and influence of the party.  Another saddening incident happened in London some time back when Harman Singh Kapoor, a Sikh restaurant owner in England’s capital, was attacked by pro-Khalistan elements. Kapoor had posted a video on social media opposing the disruption certain anti-social elements were causing in the country in London. Since then, Kapoor and his kin faced threats of rape and were said terrible things about on social media platforms. This happened at the time when the miscreants, with all impunity at their command, pulled down India’s national flag from the Indian High Commission. The restaurateur said that even the police displayed a laid-back attitude when he approached them with his complaint.  The present Indian Government is doing everything possible for the welfare of the Indian Sikh community as they are the country’s pride. Whenever there is a crisis in any part of the country or the world, Sikhs are the first to offer humanitarian aid in the form of langars (community kitchens), blood donation camps, and so much more. Sikhs fought valiantly for India’s independence, and many of them also worked with Subhash Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army, such as Pratap Singh Kairon, Niranjan Singh Talib, and Bhag Singh. These were noble and honorable leaders who served the country selflessly. As a religion, Sikhism is known to be pragmatic and fosters the spirit of service and humanity. Guru Nanak was the first Sikh Guru, and then nine more gurus succeeded him. The tenth Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, declared Guru Granth Sahib, the scripture, as the ultimate successor, thus closing the line of human Sikh gurus. The religion emphasizes the tenets of truthfulness, faithfulness, self-control, and purity of the soul.  Mere vandalism and threatening people are not justifications for establishing a separate sovereign state. Political powers and organizations that fund such elements must realize that, geopolitically and demographically, it is not currently feasible to create a separate country. Therefore, supporting extremist groups and indoctrinating young minds is a futile tactic that will ultimately be detrimental to their cause.  What began in 1873 has lost its credibility due to the involvement and encouragement of individuals who seek social, political, and economic unrest in India. India is determined to remain united and aims to see the Sikh community thrive and play a significant role in the country’s development.

Dorvil, who grew up in a small town in northern Haiti, secured a scholarship to study in Germany and Switzerland and now holds the position of senior economist at the European Investment Bank.  He recently appeared on Today Radio's The Home Stretch to discuss his charity organisation.  In 2020, Dorvil established Kiskeya Luxembourg with the help of his friends. The charity aims to provide support to Haitian children.  Political instability and violence have rocked Haiti since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in 2021, leaving many families struggling financially, especially in the more rural parts of the island.  Kiskeya's primary objective is to offer a daily warm meal to approximately 150 school-aged children, which often serves as their sole source of warm sustenance. “So that at the end of the day with a better education we can have a better Haiti,” Patrick concludes.  But the charity has wide-ranging ambitions, hoping to provide scholarships to more children in rural areas. An annual donation of just €60 allows individuals to sponsor a child and contribute to providing basic infrastructure. Details of how to get involved can be found on their website.  While education remains their main focus, the charity is also exploring ways to support environmental causes, as issues such as the plastic invasion are threatening local biodiversity.

"political assassination","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""Williamsburg"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T11:15:00","Peter C. Mancall Historian, University of Southern California  In 2008, officials erected a historical marker in West Point, a small hamlet in Virginia’s King William County. Set at an intersection about 20 miles north of Williamsburg, the plaque is titled “Indians Poisoned at Peace Meeting.” It commemorates a little-known act of colonial duplicity: a mass poisoning carried out by the English in 1623 as part of an attempted assassination of the Pamunkey leader Opechancanough.  “Why place a marker of tragedy?” asked Pamunkey Chief William P. Miles at the unveiling ceremony. “By telling the past,” he added, “it leads to our future. … Not many knew of this poisoning. This will help tell the story of the good and bad neighbors.”  May 22 marks the 400th anniversary of that unprecedented moment, when English soldiers gave poisoned wine to 200 Powhatans, members of a confederacy of about 30 Native groups. The historical record is unclear on how many of those who were poisoned died. But even during a war that ravaged Indigenous and colonial communities, the incident stood out because Europeans at the time believed no civilized nation should employ poison in war—an idea later embodied in the 20th-century Geneva Conventions.  Does the 1623 poisoning constitute a war crime? The answer to this question depends on one’s understanding of the term. Modern discussions of war crimes began after the horrors of World War I, which contributed to the formation of the League of Nations and later the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions. But efforts to define legitimate rules for war and peace stretch back centuries. In 1625, for instance, the influential Dutch legal theorist Hugo Grotius published a three-volume meditation on warfare that asked “what is permissible in war” and “to what extent.”  Today, war crimes are generally defined as violations of codified rules of warfare. Examples range from torture to taking hostages to killing combatants who have surrendered. Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court explicitly categorizes “employing poison or poisoned weapons” as a war crime; this stipulation echoes Grotius, who codified European legal ideas dating back to antiquity that defined the use of poison in war as a crime. Still, the question remains: Would the 17th-century Europeans who poisoned the Powhatans have viewed their own actions as a war crime?  “Judgments about historical events prior to the 20th century are necessarily situational,” says Douglas Greenberg, former director of the USC Shoah Foundation, the renowned center for genocide studies launched by filmmaker Steven Spielberg. “Did the specific acts violate the standards of the time? Understanding what those standards were is the hard part, of course, but the poisoning of the Powhatans appears to qualify on those grounds.”  Tensions between Native American communities and the English arose not long after the latter set up a small outpost on the banks of the James River in Tsenacommacah, homeland of the Powhatans, in 1607. The political alliance that stretched across much of the Chesapeake Bay was led by the weroance (paramount chief in the area) Wahunsonacock, whom the English typically called Powhatan. He resided in Werowocomoco, along the York River near modern Richmond.  Colonists reported that Wahunsonacock had perhaps 100 wives who lived in towns that constituted the confederacy, relying on his many children to help maintain his authority. Each of these communities owed the chief tribute (typically offered as corn, though he also accumulated copper and pearls), which he redistributed to secure his power and the loyalty of those in the area.  When the English arrived, approximately 15,000 Powhatans and other Indigenous people lived in and around Tsenacommacah. The colonists understood their survival depended on maintaining good relations with Wahunsonacock. They knew that failure to coexist with the Powhatans could lead to their destruction—a realistic fear for newcomers who didn’t know what had happened to the English who tried to colonize the Outer Banks of North Carolina in the 1580s. Theories abound, but the mystery of the lost colony of Roanoke remains.  At first, Wahunsonacock saw the advantages of turning the English into another tributary community within his orbit. But the English had different ideas. They believed Elizabeth I had given this territory to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, when she awarded the explorer a patent to settle Virginia. The colonizers’ possession was based on the so-called Doctrine of Discovery, a 15th-century European idea that allowed newcomers to claim places beyond the boundaries of Christendom. (The Vatican recently declared this policy inconsistent with Catholic thought.) After Elizabeth’s death in 1603, the colonists believed they were offering the Powhatans the benefits of becoming subjects of James I.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, these conflicting views about who controlled the region fueled tensions that exploded in 1609. The subsequent conflict, known as the First Anglo-Powhatan War, subsided in 1614 after the English captured and ransomed Wahunsonacock’s daughter Matoaka, known to the English as Pocahontas.  Despite animosities generated during that conflict, Wahunsonacock saw the benefits of creating a lasting alliance. To advance that goal, he approved Pocahontas marrying the English colonist John Rolfe, who had played a central role in establishing the newcomers’ tobacco economy. Pocahontas converted to Protestantism and changed her name to Rebecca Rolfe. The couple soon traveled to London, where Pocahontas sat for a portrait and met members of the English elite, including the king and queen.  In 1617, after the birth of their son, Thomas, the couple decided to return to Virginia. But Pocahontas became ill and died at the age of just 20 or 21. Her body is buried in the English town of Gravesend. According to a Mattaponi oral history, Pocahontas’ older sister and the quiakros (priests) who accompanied them to England believed she was poisoned by English men involved in the colony, including Rolfe.  “Certain people believed that Pocahontas would endanger the English settlement, especially because she had new insights into the political strategy of the English colonists to break down the Powhatan structure,” note Linwood “Little Bear” Custalow and Angela L. Daniel “Silver Star” in The True Story of Pocahontas: The Other Side of History. But this suggestion never spread among the colonists.  Wahunsonacock died soon after his daughter, in 1618. The Powhatan confederacy fell under the control of one of his brothers, Itoyatin, who was closely aided by another brother, Opechancanough, a Pamunkey leader who became the group’s war chief. Tensions between Indigenous peoples and newcomers rose again, likely exacerbated by colonists trying to acquire more land for tobacco, the most profitable export at the time. Within four years, the Powhatans concluded that the newcomers had overstepped their bounds.  On March 22, 1622, Opechancanough and his allies attacked outlying English farms and small communities. On a single day, the Native warriors killed 347 colonists of all ages, or about one-fourth of the colonial population of Virginia. The body count would have been higher if not for the warning of a Powhatan boy who had converted to Christianity. Colonists soon launched a series of reprisals, but they couldn’t get past the shock of the event they quickly labeled a “massacre.”  A chronicler named Edward Waterhouse wrote a lurid history of the attack, which was published in London before the end of the year. In addition to his descriptions of carnage, Waterhouse claimed that Opechancanough had traveled to a coastal Indigenous community in search of poison to use against the colonists, though he failed to find any. Waterhouse’s list of victims’ names filled nine pages of his book.  If Opechancanough had tried to acquire poison, he was likely after water hemlock or mandrake, two plants the Powhatans knew could be used to make poison, according to an Indigenous oral history. English readers of Waterhouse’s book would have known that local plants near the Chesapeake could be used to make poison, a fact they learned from Thomas Harriot, a mathematician who had traveled to the Outer Banks in 1585 and returned home to write a hugely influential tract about the region. Harriot described a plant called coscúshaw, which had a poisonous juice that needed to be extracted before the Algonquian speakers of the region could make bread from it.  Fourteen months after the March 1622 uprising, a colonial commander named William Tucker and 12 men ascended the Potomac River to rescue captives taken in the conflict, now called the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. According to Robert Bennett, proprietor of a local corn and tobacco plantation, the English told the Powhatans they had come to sue for peace. One witness claimed the soldiers placed the rescued captives in a small boat, then returned to the supposed peace conference.  Once the speeches concluded, the visitors produced sack, a Spanish wine, for a toast. To allay any suspicions, Tucker took a drink from one container, then surreptitiously offered another filled with poisoned wine to the Powhatans. “It is thought some 200 were poisoned,” Bennett wrote, adding that the English then returned to kill and scalp about “50 more.” (The spelling of historical texts has been modernized throughout this article.)  The poisoning wasn’t the first time that English soldiers resorted to mass ambush and murder during war, either in Europe or North America. Henry VIII’s soldiers unleashed vicious attacks against civilians during the king’s campaign to reclaim Boulogne, a French territory he believed belonged to the English crown. A generation later, when Elizabeth I’s forces invaded Rathlin Island, off the northern coast of what is now Northern Ireland, in 1575, soldiers murdered entire families, some of them found cowering in caves as they hid from the main scene of the battle.  Then, during the First Anglo-Powhatan War, the English destroyed Indigenous towns and attacked civilians, committing atrocities that would be considered illegal under the Geneva Conventions. During that conflict, says Matthew Kruer, a historian at the University of Chicago, English colonists embraced “attacks against non-combatants and systematic theft or destruction of food supplies, with the goal of making it impossible to survive even absent direct killing.” This shift in strategy represented a move toward extirpation, “a pulling out by the root, [or] total destruction,” Kruer adds. As recently as January 1623, Virginia’s council had sent a report to London bragging that colonial soldiers had stolen the Powhatans’ corn, burned their towns and likely killed more of their enemies in the region than ever before.  But what happened on May 22 stands out against this bloody backdrop. Until that encounter, the English had never intentionally used poison in war. In Europe, doing so was unacceptable, as Grotius and others pointed out.  When word of the incident leaked, Governor Francis Wyatt and Virginia’s council told London officials the report was false. Still, while denying that English soldiers had distributed poisoned sack to the Powhatans, the colonists pointed out that doing so would have been legitimate given Opechancanough’s earlier efforts to acquire poison.  Council members acknowledged the parley had gone wrong; that soldiers had killed 9 (not 50) Powhatans; and that they had failed to find Opechancanough, “the prime plotter and actor of the late inhuman massacre.” They admitted the soldiers could have had poison with them but said they were certain that no one died from poisoning. Even if some did succumb, the colonists argued, their deaths would have been justified to save “so many captivated Christians.” Two sources claimed Opechancanough was shot during the incident, but in fact he lived another 23 years, until colonists captured him in 1646. An English soldier murdered the aged leader while he was in captivity.  Despite the council’s denials of wrongdoing, James I sent a message across the ocean that a colonist named John Potts (or Pottes) should not be involved in governing Virginia because he was “the poisoner of the savages [there].”  Scholars who have written about early Virginia widely accept as fact that the poisoning occurred. “How many sickened and died is uncertain,” says James Horn, president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation and the author of a crucial 2021 book about Opechancanough. “But the English reported to the Virginia Company in London with evident satisfaction that their ‘successful stratagem’ had killed many Indian chiefs and commanders, including the great chief Opechancanough. No unease, either in the colony or in England, was expressed at the time about the method adopted.”  Horn adds, “Labeling the Native Americans a barbarous and treacherous enemy, Virginia’s leaders declared they ‘held nothing unjust’ that would lead to the Powhatans’ ruin since ‘with these [people] neither fair war nor good quarter is ever to be held.’” The poisoning fit a pattern, the late Yale University historian Edmund Morgan observed, “of lulling the Indians into security, the better to surprise them.”  The poisoning of May 1623 represents a turning point in the history of the English conquest and colonization of North America. The early modern Atlantic world was a brutal place, and no population had a monopoly on unleashing violence against others, either in wars of conquest, civil wars, or through captivity and enslavement. But before 1607, the English believed they would not need to conquer territory through war. They were sure that Indigenous peoples would quickly recognize the superiority of the newcomers’ culture, from missionaries who promised a route to a true heaven to a benevolent monarch who would enclose and protect them in his metaphorical arms. Despite the violence that plagued the region from 1609 to 1614, Powhatans and English worked to coexist, at least for a time.  March 24, 1622, changed that calculus, not only in Virginia but across English America. During the Elizabethan era, English promoters of colonization believed Indigenous peoples would embrace the European way of life. But the Powhatans’ rebellion revealed the error of that assumption. The colonists felt betrayed, which may help explain their lust for revenge.  This shifting perspective can be seen in what became the most enduring visual image of the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. In 1628, Matthäus Merian, an artist who worked in his family’s publishing house in Frankfurt, created an engraving to accompany the German and Latin translations of Waterhouse’s account. Over the previous three decades, the firm’s engravers had often created terrifying images, depicting Iberian Catholics committing brutal acts against Indigenous Americans. Drawing on this visual repertoire, Merian depicted the Powhatans surprising colonists at their tables, stabbing and clubbing innocents. European viewers of the image may have concluded that there was no need to abide by the common rules of war in the wake of such an attack.  The Second Anglo-Powhatan War came to a formal conclusion in 1632, but by then, Europeans who wanted to wrench eastern North America away from its Indigenous occupants seemed more willing to engage in acts that fit modern definitions of a war crime. They did not resort to poison on a large scale again, but in New England in 1637 and in New Netherland a few years later, they set Native towns on fire and shot those who tried to escape.  The 13 colonists who likely participated in the poisoning of 1623 acted without precedent and beyond the norms of what constituted proper Christian behavior in times of conflict. To contextualize their actions in the larger story of European conquest and colonization in North America, historians must consider the aftereffects of the secret slaughter—and possibly rewrite that plaque in West Point to address a crucial question: namely, was this one of the first American war crimes?

Beneath its hipped roof are the “Kremlin Chimes,” a 500-year-old clock with four broad 20-foot faces. In the darkened, early morning hours of May 3, the hands registered 2:27 when the first drone appeared, quickly speeding in high above the yellow and white sign warning that the area was a “No Drone Zone,” in Russian and English. A split-second later, it exploded a few feet above the green dome of the Kremlin’s Old Senate Palace. Sixteen minutes later, a second drone coming from another direction set off a bright flash and crashed into the convex roof near a pole bearing a fluttering Russian flag. Security officers could be seen ducking as they scrambled up a ladder to check out the earlier damage.  In all of Russia, there is no greater symbol of power and authority than the green dome and the building beneath it. Completed in 1787 and the shape of an isosceles triangle, this was where Vladimir Lenin had a private four-room apartment, along with a 40,000-volume library; where Joseph Stalin had an office and a five-room suite that also housed his children, Svetlana and Vasily; and where Nikita Khrushchev paced the floor of his office, next to a desk cluttered with tacky models of satellites, planes, and locomotives, while pondering the fate of the world during the Cuban missile crisis. For all those who followed, from Brezhnev to Yeltsin, the Kremlin served as a way station during their years in power. Today, it is where Vladimir Putin has his presidential office, with its tall windows covered in French-style curtains of silky-white folds, his polish oak desk with a briefing console extending from the front, and his flat-screen computer monitor with its screensaver of the Spasskaya Tower at night.  The early morning dual drone attack was meant as a warning—not an assassination attempt. As the attackers certainly knew, Putin at the time was at his home in Novo Ogaryovo, a 19th-century English Gothic manor, surrounded by an 18-foot wall built on the banks of the Moscow River, near the village of Usovo. Had someone wanted to harm him, they would have loaded the drones with considerably more explosives and targeted his home in the middle of the night—not his empty office.

Deadly and extremely dangerous. The armed drones were an unsubtle and explosive message: Forget your warning signs and your high-tech defenses, we know where you are, we know how to kill you, and you are on our list. “If we presume it was a Ukrainian attack,” noted Russia specialist and security analyst Mark Galeotti, “consider it a performative strike, a demonstration of capability and a declaration of intent: ‘Don’t think Moscow is safe.’”  As with the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline, there were accusations that Russia itself had attacked the Kremlin. “Social media is awash with cries of ‘fake!’ and ‘false flag!’”said Steve Rosenberg, the BBC’s Moscow editor, who went on to ask: “Why would it stage-manage such a potentially embarrassing incident that many will interpret as a sign of the Kremlin’s weakness? And think back to those TV news bulletins: They avoided showing images of the explosions.”  Rather than Russia, it was instead far more likely that Ukraine was behind the attacks, just as it was also likely behind a recent string of assassinations, both attempted and successful. Among them, the car-bomb murder near Moscow of Daria Dugina, the daughter of Aleksandr Dugin, a Russian ultra-nationalist philosopher who is known as “Putin’s brain“—and was probably the intended target of the attack. The Russian Federal Security Service alleged that Dugina’s murder “was prepared and committed by the Ukrainian intelligence agencies.” And the United States reportedly agreed, believing that parts of the Ukrainian government authorized the killing.  Pentagon Leaks Reveal New Dangers  With no repercussions from Washington or Europe following that attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky apparently decided to ramp up his assassination program along with other sabotage attacks in Russia. In a meeting in late January, for example, Zelensky suggested that Ukraine “conduct strikes in Russia.” Among them was an operation to “blow up” the Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline that provides oil to Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic—all members of NATO. These new revelations are contained in the hundreds of highly classified Pentagon and intelligence documents allegedly leaked by Jack Teixeira, a 21-year-old Air National Guardsman later charged with espionage. Current Issue View our current issue  In addition to revealing just how far the Ukrainian government is prepared to go to take the fight to Russia, the leaked documents bolster the view that Ukraine itself was also behind the September 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline. From the context of the messages, and the codewords on the documents, it is clear that the US National Security Agency has long been eavesdropping on the highest levels of the Ukrainian government, if not Zelensky’s private cell phone. After all, in the past the NSA has targeted the private cell phones of allied leaders in such countries as Brazil and Germany. What seems clear is that the Biden administration knows much more about Ukraine’s likely role in the pipeline’s destruction—a violent act of war against Russia, Europe, and NATO—than it has shared with the American public.  Following the January meeting focused on “strikes in Russia,” on April 2 Vladlen Tatarsky, a high-profile pro-Kremlin military blogger, was assassinated when handed a bomb-rigged sculpture in a St. Petersburg café. A month later, on May 3 came the drone attack on the Kremlin, and just three days later was another assassination attempt. This time, the target was another popular pro-war blogger, former State Duma (parliament) member Zakhar Prilepin. As with Daria Dugina, the weapon was a remotely controlled car bomb and, although Prilepin survived with injuries, his passenger was killed. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office later charged Alexander Permyakov, a 30-year-old native of the occupied Donetsk region of Ukraine, who, they said, “claims that he was acting on the orders of Ukraine’s special services.” A spokesman said the organization could neither confirm nor deny the involvement of Ukraine’s special services in the explosion.  “We regard these actions as a planned terrorist act and an attempt on the president’s life, carried out on the eve of the Victory Day, May 9, parade,” said a statement from Putin’s presidential office regarding the attack on the Kremlin. “The Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit.” Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, then blamed the United States. “We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,” he said. “This is also often dictated from across the ocean.… In Washington they must clearly understand that we know this.” The leaked documents will probably bolster that view, since they clearly indicate that the US. knew in advance about the planning for such violent attacks—but apparently never intervened to stop them. Or if they did, Ukraine simply ignored the warning.  Just as President Joe Biden is never far from the “football”—the black leather briefcase containing the nuclear go-codes to launch World War III—President Putin is never far from his “cheget,” that serves the same purpose. “All the necessary communication tools, including the strategic communications, are always with the president wherever he is, be it Russia or any other country in the world,” Peskov told reporters in Moscow in 2021. Lest anyone forget, it was the assassination of a lowly archduke that precipitated the start of World War I.  On cable news programs and the Internet, day-to-day coverage of the war focuses on which battalions have advanced or retreated from one place or another, or what Ukrainian town or village was the latest to suffer a missile attack. But the other war—Ukraine’s increasing use of covert operations inside Russia—takes place in the shadows. And it is that war that poses the greatest danger of involving the United States as a cobelligerent, especially if US intelligence is used to carry out sabotage and assassination operations inside Russia. As Adam Smith (D-Wash.), ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, has warned, “We have to help Ukraine in every way we can without widening the war and stumbling into World War III.”  Until this past March, when hundreds of documents were leaked from the Pentagon, neither the American public—nor, possibly, Moscow—had any idea of the enormous intensity of US intelligence collection targeting Russia on behalf of Ukraine—or how much the United States knew about Ukraine’s secret assassination and sabotage programs. An indication of the depth and breadth of that intelligence coverage comes from the classification of many of the documents, such as one dated March 1, 2023. Titled, “Russia/Ukraine: Status of the Conflict as of 1 Mar,” and “updated every workday,” its classification line read:“TOP SECRET//HCS-P/SI-G/TK//FGI/RSEN/ORCON/NOFORN/FISA.  What those classifications mean: TOP SECRET is the highest national security classification. HCS-P stands for Human Intelligence Control System—Product, meaning that the information is extremely sensitive because it is the product of human CIA spies, likely in Russia. SI-G stands for Special Intelligence, indicating it is the results of NSA eavesdropping, and G stands for Gamma, meaning it is extremely sensitive. In the past, Gamma has been attached to high-level intercepts from senior Kremlin officials. TK stands for Talent Keyhole, a designation used on very sensitive overhead imagery from spy satellites controlled by the National Reconnaissance Office. RSEN stands for Risk Sensitive, indicating that the data is a highly sensitive analysis of overhead imagery by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). FISA means Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, indicating that the intelligence was derived from a court authorized national security wiretap. NOFORN indicates that the information should not be released to foreigners “without permission of the originator.” And finally, ORCON is used when the information “clearly identifies or reasonably permits ready identification of intelligence sources or methods.”  Beyond the arcane intel babble of the classification system is the enormous army of human and machine spies secretly and aggressively targeting Russia on behalf of the Ukraine government. It’s a multibillion-dollar spy war that, as a result of an accident or a deliberate act, could quickly trigger a hot war involving the United States, NATO and Russia. A key example, revealed in the leaked Pentagon documents, was the near downing of a NATO RC-135W signals intelligence aircraft with over 30 members of the British military on board. A Russian fighter sent up to keep a close eye on the spy plane misunderstood a command from the ground and fired a missile at the aircraft. It was only because of another glitch that the missile failed to hit its mark and potentially ignite World War III.  Eyes in the Sky  But the RC-135Ws are only one element in a vast and growing airborne armada of spy craft constantly patrolling the tense and increasing crowded skies above the land and sea border regions of Russia, often shadowed by Russian fighters dangerously close to their wingtips. “We hoover everything up,” said a former US RC-135 mission manager. “It’s a flying vacuum cleaner—we take every frequency, every angle we see.” The spy planes provide critical intelligence for Ukraine’s military commanders, and likely as well for its covert operators during their cross-border assassination and sabotage operations. Other intelligence comes from the constellations of spy satellites orbiting high above the airborne armada  The center for US satellite espionage targeting Russia sits just south of Denver, on Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colo. Known as the Aerospace Data Facility-Colorado, or Space Delta 20, it’s a lunar vista of bulbous white radomes, stretching for acres, which serve as the downlink for scores of eavesdropping and high-resolution satellites providing imagery useful both for tactical warfare on the battlefield, as well as covert operations deep within Russia. In just the first two weeks of the war, “the Ukrainian government used or streamed or downloaded more than 40 million square kilometers of area,” Sandra Auchter, director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s highly secret Denver facility, told a symposium of geospatial intelligence specialists. “For us to be able to provide that to a foreign partner in such a short period of time is incredible.” Related Articles We Can’t Reduce the Ukraine War to a Morality Play Andrew J. Bacevich Why Can’t Washington Break Its War Addiction? William Astore Why the Right Embraces Military-Veteran Vigilantes Spencer Ackerman  Last February 26, according to the leaked March 1, 2023, top secret document mentioned above, Ukraine launched a covert sabotage operation in neighboring Belarus, a country friendly to Russia but thus far holding back from sending troops. In many ways, the operation was a carbon copy of the dual drone attack on the Kremlin several months later. Ukrainian intelligence agents inside Belarus launched two small weaponized drones that attacked and damaged a highly sophisticated Russian airborne early-warning aircraft. Known as an A-50U Mainstay, the plane had been deployed to Belarus’s Machulishchy Air Base south of Minsk. Although nervous officials in Kiev issued an order calling off the attack at the last minute, it went ahead as planned. The Ukraine government regularly denies involvement in such covert operations, as it did with the Kremlin drone attacks and the recent assassinations. But the leaked top secret documents make it clear that the United States knew the February operation was carried out by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, and “its agents in Belarus.”  Shortly after that attack, a dual Russian-Ukrainian national was arrested by Belarus police. Then the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, issued a warning to both Ukraine and the United States. “A terrorist was trained,” he said. “The security service of Ukraine, the leadership of the CIA, behind closed doors, are carrying out an operation against the Republic of Belarus,” he said.  The United States currently provides Ukraine with massive amounts of intelligence—but only minimal oversight and restrictions on how they use it. These circumstances give rise to the perception, justified or not, that Washington is an active collaborator—a cobelligerent—in Ukraine’s growing list of bloody political assassinations and drone attacks like those on the Kremlin, in Belarus, and elsewhere in Russia. Such reasoning was only reinforced by Biden’s own words early in the war indicating a desire for regime change in the Kremlin: “For God’s sake this man cannot remain in power.”  Unless the Biden administration demands an end to Kiev’s thinly veiled use of assassination and terrorism within Russia, at the same time it is on the receiving end of America’s most valuable spyware, the risk of dragging the US deeper and deeper into an endless quagmire will continue to grow. That’s terrain the United States seems to have occupied in every recent war, from Vietnam to Afghanistan to Iraq. But in this one—with two of the parties having 11,405 nuclear weapons aimed at each other—the stakes are much, much higher.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS93b3JsZC9zaGFkb3ctd2FyLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLXVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2019-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Gorakhpur"", ""UttarPradesh"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T08:45:23","Former minister and strongman leader of Purvanchal, Pandit Harishankar Tiwari, passed away at the age of 90 on May 16 after a prolonged illness. His death marks the end of a chapter in the region’s politics which was marked by the criminalisation of politics, caste-based gang war and gave rise to Brahmin-Thakur politics in Uttar Pradesh.  The active political innings of Pandit Harishankar Tiwari, a resident of Tanda village of Barhalganj area in Gorakhpur, spanned nearly four decades. His first electoral contest was to become a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) in 1974, which he lost to Congress candidate Shivharsh Upadhyay. Tiwari’s supporters still believe that the polls were rigged. In 1984, he contested the Lok Sabha elections from Maharajganj parliamentary seat while in jail, but lost this election as well. One of his opponents was another strongman, Virendra Pratap Shahi, who also contested from jail. Tiwari came second, Shahi third while Jitendra Singh of the Congress won.  Meanwhile, Harishankar Tiwari received the patronage of Chillupar MLA and senior Congress leader Bhrigunath Chaturvedi. The latter made him the president of the management committee of the National PG College, Barhalganj in 1983 and also handed him the political legacy of Chillupar. Tiwari contested assembly elections from Chillupar in 1985 and became an MLA for the first time. He had contested this election while being lodged in jail. Subsequently, he won five consecutive elections from this seat and remained an MLA. During the phase of unstable governments in UP, which began in 1997, he also became a minister in the cabinets of Kalyan Singh, Ramprakash Gupta, Rajnath Singh, Mayawati and Mulayam Singh. He was also handed a cabinet berth in the one-day Jagdambika Pal government.  Tiwari, who was believed to be unbeatable in Chillupar, lost the next two elections in 2007 and 2012, to journalist-turned-politician ‘Muktipath Wale Baba’ Rajesh Tripathi. After two consecutive defeats, he handed over the seat to his son Vinay Shankar Tiwari and stayed away from electoral politics. However, he maintained his image as an influential Brahmin leader in Purvanchal. His elder son, Bhishma Shankar Tiwari alias Kushal Tiwari, became MP twice from Sant Kabirnagar and his younger son Vinay Shankar Tiwari became MLA from Chillupar once (2017-2022). His nephew Ganesh Shankar Pandey was also elected MLC for four terms (from 1990 to 2016) from Gorakhpur-Maharajganj Local Body and was the chairman of the Legislative Council from 2010 to 2016.  Pandit Harishankar Tiwari’s foray into electoral politics began as an independent candidate contesting the 1974 Legislative Council elections, 1984 Lok Sabha elections and 1985 Legislative Assembly elections. He later joined the Congress and contested from Chillupar in 1989, 1991 and 1993. In 1996, he contested the elections on the All India Indira Congress (Tiwari) ticket. Subsequently, he formed the All India Democratic Congress with the help of many leaders including Shyam Sundar Sharma, and Bacha Pathak and remained associated with it till the end. Both his sons and nephew have been with the Samajwadi Party for about 18 months after brief stints with the BJP and BSP.  Currently, the Tiwari family is desperate for electoral success. Bhishma Shankar Tiwari lost the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, while Vinay Shankar Tiwari lost the 2022 assembly elections from Chillupar. Ganesh Shankar Pandey skipped the MLC polls to contest the assembly elections from Paniyara in 2017 but faced defeat. Since then he has distanced himself from electoral politics. Despite the setbacks, the Tiwari clan and Harishankar’s residential complex, called Hata, cast a significant political influence in the region.  The Tiwari family’s politics is unabashedly pro-Brahmin and has equated ‘Brahmin interest’ with ‘national interest’. After joining the SP, Harishankar Tiwari’s eldest son Bhishma Shankar Tiwari wrote on Facebook, “The Tiwari family has always been fighting for national interest and for the protection of Brahminism and will continue to do so. We are identified by our community. Our respected father, Pt. Harishankar Tiwari has always taught us this lesson. We will never allow disrespect to the community. In the last five years, in view of the neglect faced by our community and the current political scenario, with the approval of the elders in the interest of our community, the Samajwadi Party was found to be more creditable. Brahmin interest is national interest and vice versa.”  Supporters of the clan are condoling the death of Pandit Harishankar Tiwari by hailing him as ‘Brahmin Shiromani’ (the crown jewel of Brahmins).  Math, Hata and Shakti Sadan  ‘Hata’, the house of Harishankar Tiwari located in Dharamshala market, remained a centre of politics in Gorakhpur and Purvanchal since 1965. This is where both his sons and nephew Ganesh Shankar Pandey live.  Many years ago, the complex functioned as a meeting point. Visitors were given milk and whey to drink. Now, it has changed significantly. It has partly been converted into a modern residential complex but the eastern gate has still retained the form of the old compound. It has a big thatched shed and old wooden chairs, benches and tables in the courtyard. This is where the senior Tiwari preferred to meet people. This shanty has remained the same since 1960, when Harishankar Tiwari was active in student politics of Gorakhpur University. After his death, the body was kept here for public viewing.  In UP politics, Harishankar Tiwari was known to be a strongman leader. But people around Hata knew him as a kind, guardian-like figure who used to leave his house every morning donning a tracksuit for his routine walk and enquire about the well-being of people he met on the way.  A shopkeeper of Dharamshala market recalls, “Once Tiwari ji was returning with his convoy when a particular song was playing at my shop. Soon, a person came from inside the Hata and asked me to increase the volume as Tiwari ji liked the song a lot.”  Tiwari was usually dressed in a dhoti-kurta and sadri but would wear a tracksuit for his morning walks. But there is a picture of him in a safari suit on his Facebook page with the caption, “Sometimes, I also wear safari suits instead of dhoti-kurta.”  Harishankar Tiwari was very polite with the people he met and spoke very gently. He kept a distance from the media and never rushed to give his comments on any matter.  The politics of Gorakhpur has been revolving around three political centres: Math, Hata and Shakti Sadan for a long time. Math (Gorakhnath Temple) became the centre of Hindutva politics, while Hata became the centre of Brahmin politics. Shakti Sadan located in Mohaddipur was the centre of Kshatriya politics, which came to an end in 1997 after the assassination of Virendra Pratap Shahi. Kshatriya politics then completely shifted to the Math.  Caste-based gang war  In the 1980s, Gorakhpur witnessed a period of caste war between the two power centres – Tiwari’s ‘Hata’ and Shahi’s ‘Shakti Sadan’. In this gang war, more than 50 people – including Janata Party MLA Ravindra Singh and Gorakhpur Student Union vice president Rang Narayan Pandey – were killed. During this period, Gorakhpur earned the sobriquet ‘Chicago of the East’ and ‘Slice of Sicily’.  The seeds of this caste war were sown right when the Gorakhpur University was founded. It not only engulfed student politics but later extended to the politics of the entire Purvanchal region. After the establishment of the university, a rivalry broke out between Surati Narayan Mani Tripathi (the first district magistrate of Gorakhpur and later the treasurer of the university) and Mahant Digvijay Nath of the Gorakhnath temple for control over it. The appointment of teachers and employees in the university was done on the basis of caste. Student leaders were made pawns in this battle for supremacy. Harishankar Tiwari, who was a student here, was made a member of the University Court in 1965 by the Brahmin lobby. In response, Balwant Singh and Ravindra Singh were projected as the face of the Thakur lobby.  This battle for caste supremacy soon turned into a bloody struggle with a spate of murders.  The bloody trail of violence and counter-violence between the two groups lasted for almost a decade. First, in 1978, student leader Balwant Singh, who was close to Ravindra Singh, was murdered in Golghar. Before Singh, a person named Mannu had been killed.  When Singh was killed, Virendra Pratap Shahi was in Basti kickstarting his political career. He contested assembly elections from Basti in 1974 and received only 5,740 votes. He was named in a murder there. Soon, he entered an enmity with Rana Krishna Kinkar Singh after Singh lost one eye to Shahi’s bullet. It is claimed that after Balwant Singh’s murder, Ravindra Singh called Shahi from Basti to Gorakhpur after securing his bail as he was in jail then.  Shortly after Shahi arrived in Gorakhpur, one of his supporters, Bechai Pandey, was murdered on August 28, 1978. In retaliation, three people including Rang Narayan Pandey, vice-president of the Gorakhpur University Students’ Union, were killed in Danwarpar the same evening.  A year later, Amol Shukla was murdered. Soon after, Ravindra Singh, the MLA of the Janata Party and President of Gorakhpur University and Lucknow University Students’ Union, was shot at Gorakhpur railway station on August 27, 1979. He was severely injured in the attack and died three days later. One more person was also killed in the firing at the railway station.  With this began a spate of murders as both factions entered a running feud over government contracts for taxi stands, district hospitals, medical colleges and railways. Virendra Pratap Shahi was attacked in the district hospital but survived. Later, there were three more attacks on him. The vengeful murders spread over to Lucknow from Gorakhpur and Basti Mandal. Both the groups would file FIRs against each other citing the incidents as the rationale.  In police records, Tiwari and Shahi had tons of serious charges against them but they were portrayed otherwise in the media. In newspapers, Pandit Harishankar Tiwari was referred to as an ’eminent leader’ and Virendra Pratap Shahi as ‘The Lion of Purvanchal’. The press releases for both of them were measured and printed in the same size. If this equation faltered, local journalists and editors would bear the brunt. Such stories of their notoriety are still popular in the region today.  It was a norm for both the musclemen to travel in convoys of 200 vehicles each brandishing guns and other firearms. Stories about the valour of the two, both real and concocted, circulated on the university campus and the youth aspired to be like them. Getting the chance to sit in those vehicles or hold their guns was a matter of pride for the college boys. Both bahubalis openly interfered in the student union elections during this period.  The statues of Ravindra Singh and Rangnarayan Pandey on the student union building of Gorakhpur University are reminiscent of the period.  In his book Nishane par Samay, Samaj Aur Rajneeti, senior journalist Santosh Bharti compiled several reports documenting events of the period marked with caste-based politics and the criminalisation of politics as well as describing the role of political figures in it.  The politics of the state also stood divided when it came to these two musclemen. Tiwari maintained good relations with former chief ministers of UP Shripati Mishra, Narayan Dutt Tiwari, and Congress stalwarts like Makhan Lal Fotedar, and Motilal Bora. On the other hand, the irrigation minister who later became chief minister, Veer Bahadur Singh, was accused of patronising Virendra Pratap Shahi. While the Thakur leaders of the state rallied in favour of Shahi, the Brahmin leaders supported Tiwari.  In 1984, Virendra Shahi and Harishankar Tiwari were charged with the National Security Act (NSA) after pressure from Veer Bahadur Singh. While Shahi was arrested, Tiwari fled to Nepal. It was speculated that a prominent leader in Nepal had granted him asylum. Tiwari later surrendered and went to jail. It is reported that when he surrendered before the magistrate, he was wearing a turtleneck suit and the police could not recognise him. The picture was published in the newspapers.  When Veer Bahadur Singh became the chief minister of UP in 1985, he tried to rein in both the musclemen. An attempt was also made to end their monopoly over government contracts and leases. As a result, the bloody conflict between Shahi and Tiwari entered a period of lull but the political rivalry continued.  It is also believed that both Shahi and Tiwari had an unwritten pact to let the cases against each other lapse so that they could shed the baggage of their criminal past and build an image of ‘pure politicians’.  When Pandit Harishankar Tiwari contested his last election in 2012, there was not a single criminal case against him. According to the affidavit filed by his son Bhishma Shankar Tiwari alias Kushal Tiwari, there is no case against him either. Vinay Shankar Tiwari has a case under sections 120B, 420, 467 and 451 regarding loans from banks, which is being investigated by the CBI and ED.  The lion of Purvanchal  Virendra Pratap Shahi, who called himself ‘Sher e Purvanchal’ or the lion of Purvanchal, won the 1980 assembly election from Laxmipur in Maharajganj district after defeating Amar Mani Tripathi, who used to be a close aide of Harishankar Tiwari at the time. Later, Tripathi had a tiff with Tiwari and they parted ways. Amar Mani Tripathi carved a niche as an independent political figure. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment along with his wife Madhumani for the murder of poetess Madhumita Shukla. Both are currently serving their sentence in Gorakhpur jail.  Later, in 1985, Virendra Pratap Shahi again contested against Tripathi. This time, Tripathi finished third while Shahi secured a win yet again.  Meanwhile, Shahi joined the Maneka Gandhi Vichar Manch and later joined V.P. Singh’s Jan Morcha. He was a contender for the MP ticket of Maharajganj from Janata Dal. But when he did not get the ticket, he contested the parliamentary election from Maharajganj and the assembly election from Nautanwa as an independent. He got the lion as an election symbol and in the poll campaign, his supporters carried cut-outs of Shahi and a lion behind bars. It was also rumoured that on the final day of the campaign, a lion in a cage would be paraded through the streets of Maharajganj, his parliamentary constituency. However, Shahi lost both elections. After this, he lost every election he contested and his political career dwindled.  In the meantime, one of his close friends, Vivek Singh, was murdered in a railway contract dispute. This led Shahi into a face-off with gangster Shri Prakash Shukla. He was attacked by Shukla’s gang in Golghar, Gorakhpur in 1996 in which the shooter was killed but Shahi survived, despite being shot. But a year later, Shri Prakash Shukla gunned down Shahi, unarmed and alone, in Lucknow.  From ’eminent leader’ to ‘vikas purush’ to ‘Brahmin Shiromani’  Harishankar Tiwari, on the other hand, kept on securing poll wins. In 1993, he faced a tough challenge from Shyamlal Yadav and was on the verge of losing but Mulayam Singh Yadav’s rally in Barhalganj changed the wind in his favour. In his address, Mulayam Singh Yadav is reported to have said, ‘Who is a bigger Yadav than me?’ As a result of his support, the Yadav votes of Chillupar went to Harishankar Tiwari instead of Shyamlal Yadav and he won.  Tiwari was appointed cabinet minister continuously from 1996 to 2007, which was the era of unstable governments in UP.  In newspapers, instead of ’eminent leader’, he came to be referred to as ‘vikas purush’ or pro-development leader.  In the Mayawati government, he organised Parshuram Jayanti in a grand manner in Lucknow to establish himself as a Brahmin leader. The preparation for the event went on for months and spread from Gorakhpur to Lucknow. Every day, there was a press conference in Gorakhpur in which the rationale for celebrating Parshuram Jayanti was explained and the work done by Pandit Harishankar Tiwari was praised. Apart from the leaders, scholars and intellectuals in Gorakhpur used to address the press conferences. A journalist from a newspaper, which claims to be the best-selling daily of the state, would prepare the text of the press conference and release it after final approval from Tiwari. The press conference was only a sham.  When Parshuram Jayanti was celebrated, he was hailed as ‘Brahmin Shiromani’ (crown jewel of Brahmins)  ‘Will sit in your lap, pluck your beard’  After the assassination of Virendra Pratap Shahi in 1997, Kshatriya politics was in want of a leader. Meanwhile, Yogi Adityanath emerged on the scene as the successor of Mahant Avaidyanath of Gorakhnath temple. After becoming an MP in 1998, his career catapulted quickly. The same group of people who once rallied behind Virendra Pratap Shahi surrounded him. When Yogi Adityanath wanted to gain influence in the BJP, he clashed with the then BJP MLA and minister Shiv Pratap Shukla, who had been winning continuously since 1989. Shukla had a close connection with Tiwari. In the 2002 assembly elections, Yogi Adityanath rebelled against the BJP and fielded Dr Radha Mohan Das Agarwal from the Hindu Mahasabha against Shiv Pratap Shukla and Agarwal won. Shiv Pratap Shukla gradually lost influence and Yogi Adityanath’s dominance increased.  Along with Shukla, Harishankar Tiwari now became a rival to Yogi Adityanath. He once publicly taunted Yogi Adityanath in a BJP meeting in MP College saying that he “will sit in your lap and pluck your beard,” as Adityanath had turned against the BJP while being in the party. In response, Yogi Adityanath opened a front against Harishankar Tiwari in Chillupar. Harishankar Tiwari won that election but was defeated in the next two. Rajesh Tripathi, who defeated him, had contested the election on a BSP ticket but allegedly had ‘full support’ from Yogi Adityanath.  The Tiwari clan came out in support of the senior Tiwari in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when his younger son Vinay Shankar Tiwari contested against Yogi Adityanath from the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat from the BSP. Bhojpuri film actor Manoj Tiwari contested as an SP candidate in this election. It was rumoured that Amar Singh made Manoj Tiwari contest from SP to divide the Brahmin votes so that there would be no hindrance in the victory of Yogi Adityanath.  ‘Hata’ and ‘Math’ have thus been involved in direct and indirect face-offs every now and then.  In its most acute form, the rivalry came to the fore when the police raided ‘Hata’ in search of a robbery accused on April 22, 2017, just a month after Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister. The Tiwari family alleged that it was an action taken at the behest of the CM and protested strongly against it on April 24, 2017. Harishankar Tiwari, who was then 77 years old, also participated in the protest and raised slogans. The presence of a large number of Brahmins in the protest put the BJP in trouble. It was feared that the BJP may lose the support of the Brahmin community which had tremendously backed the party in UP. The BJP top brass immediately took conciliatory steps and did not allow the feud to escalate further.  Since then, no direct confrontation between Yogi Adityanath and the Tiwari family has been reported.  Both the poles of Thakur-Brahmin politics, Harishankar Tiwari and Virendra Pratap Shahi, which emerged in the 70s and reached the peak in the 1980s are now dead but the impact of the politics for which they laid the foundation still runs deep. The successors of this politics exist in different forms. It has been manifesting from time to time and will continue to do so in the future.

"political assassination","1973-04-17","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T02:00:15","On the afternoon of December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553 from Washington, D.C., to Omaha, Nebraska, via Chicago crashed from the sky, killing most people onboard. Among the victims were an Illinois congressman, a promising young CBS reporter named Michele Clark, Howard Hunt’s fed-up wife, and — if White House Plumbers is to be believed — a conspicuous stranger who gave Howard Hunt’s wife a menacing look as she boarded. The series’ most recent episode ends with standard true-story boilerplate — “some of the events, characters, and dialogue have been fictionalized” — plus an addendum: “But Dorothy Hunt definitely died in a mysterious plane crash.”  In real life, the crash was attributed to pilot error. But there were enough people to suspect foul play that the tragedy came to be known by some as “The Watergate Crash,” which is the conspiracy theory that White House Plumbers is flirting with. With only one episode left, I confess I’m less sure than ever what this show is trying to say about this black moment in U.S. history. The series started as a darkly comic story of two bumbling men who toppled an extraordinarily popular presidency by accident, but what is it now? After the arrests at the Watergate, Dorothy emerges as a hero to Howie’s disgraced band of political criminals, securing payouts from Nixon’s dubious cronies and flying across the country to collect and distribute them. By the end of the episode, though, the mother of four is gone — the death of the series’ most thoughtful character reduced to a jump scare.  “The Writer’s Wife” picks up six months earlier, in the closing moments of episode three. Jim McCord and the Cubans have just been arrested by hippie cops, whose unexpected hippie attire I assumed would be explained this week but appears to have been forgotten. (They were undercover street cops.) Meanwhile, Howard and Gordon race to cover up their own involvement in the operation, each following their distinct brands of stupidity.  For Howard, that means speeding home to “Witches Island.” In the middle of the night, he rips his teenage son from bed and confesses his identity as a CIA spook and Nixon henchman. Then he recruits the panicked kid to aid and abet in destroying evidence, forever implicating Saint John in unlawful interference with a federal criminal investigation. Yes, this is Howard’s contingency plan. This is what it looks like for a top campaign operative to break glass. He and a tearful Saint John throw Howard’s typewriter in the river, go make omelets, and wait for … what, exactly? A cop knocking at the door? An angry call from the White House? For Dorothy to race home from Paris and save them all?  In the end, it’s Bob Woodward who makes the first approach. He calls Hunt to ask about the letter bearing his name that Macho was carrying at the time of his arrest (a joyful little voice cameo from Robert Redford, who played Woodward in All the President’s Men). And from that point forward, the Hunts are forbidden from answering the telephone. The soundtrack of their lives will be the interminable shrill of the family landline.  On the other hand, Liddy is exquisitely deranged and/or frighteningly equanimous when he clicks on a bedroom lamp and lets Fran know he may soon be heading to prison. The next morning, he tracks down acting AG Richard Kleindienst — by this point, John Mitchell’s resigned to focus on Nixon’s reelection — and pressures him to somehow spring McCord, who is arrested carrying a fake ID, from lockup. Alas, it’s already too late to avoid an association between the Watergate arrests and the White House. A former colleague who just happens to be passing through the precinct where McCord is being questioned reveals his identity, giving the cops a clear link between the piece of tape on the Watergate freight door and the president’s campaign manager.  Hunt and Liddy can destroy it all, but it will never be enough: typewriters and listening devices, purloined Watergate Hotel soap. Liddy, always in a race to be the most ludicrous person in Washington, even throws the unspent cash Mitchell gave them into the paper shredder. The White House reacts by refusing to comment on every little break-in in the nation’s capital, which is the political equivalent of sticking your own fingers in your ears and screaming, Nah, nah, nah, I can’t hear you! Everyone is scrambling, but the train has left the station. The FBI will be at Hunt’s door by the end of the day.  Somehow, though, the situation is still in the process of getting worse. Remember Mark Felt, who refused to help Liddy when he proposed breaking into Doctor Ellsberg’s Los Angeles office? We haven’t seen Gary Cole’s G-man since episode one, but he’s heading up the FBI investigation into Watergate. The White House may have some modicum of plausible deniability when it comes to Watergate, but, as Liddy reminds John Dean, it was former White House lawyer John Ehrlichman who okayed the Ellsberg mission (if anyone can remember that many bureaucrats called “John” ago). But while Hunt’s beginning to doubt Nixon’s loyalty, G. Gordon Liddy tells J. Dean he’s willing to be assassinated for the president — an event that seems unlikely to deflect suspicion from the campaign, but it’s the thought that counts.  As a plan, it’s only marginally worse than what Howard cooks up. Worried that the White House will abandon the plumbers, Howard suggests to Dorothy, fresh off the plane from France, that the entire family head to Nicaragua and seek refuge with the Somoza family, who really owe Howard. A tin-pot dictator always pays his debts. Dorothy prevails upon him to lawyer up instead, and soon they’re sitting across from William Bittman, the cookie-loving attorney best known for prosecuting Jimmy Hoffa.  This is when Dorothy takes the reins. Howard refuses to make a deal to avoid prison, preferring instead to take the fall and pray for an eventual pardon. Dorothy can’t make him cough up the names of the president’s inner circle, but she’s the one to remind the White House that the kind of loyalty Howard’s offering doesn’t come cheap.  Eventually, Nixon’s posse comes through with cash for Howard, McCord, and the Cubans only. There won’t be any help for Liddy and his five kids, though it’s unclear why. Maybe the White House is sure he’ll stay silent for free? Maybe they don’t think anyone would believe a nut like Liddy anyway? However, Howard refuses to see his partner cut out of the arrangement and persuades a reluctant Dorothy to part with some of their share of the money. And just like that, Dorothy gets dealt back into the spy game. With Howard under FBI scrutiny, she’s the one with the physical freedom to fly around the country collecting moneybags from airport lockers, delivering payouts to the Liddys in baking tins like the little housewife she pretends to be. (The Liddys keep her cash casseroles in the freezer — a delightful detail.)  The more secure the president’s reelection becomes, even in the face of the blossoming Watergate scandal, the less generous the cash hose flows. It’s more of a slow dribble, really. Dorothy is angry and astonished, but McCord sees Nixon and his men for what they are. They’re motivated by “fear and power,” he explains, suddenly far more astute than he’s ever been before. “Mainly the fear of losing power.” Now that they’re no longer afraid of that, there’s no reason to pay up. For McCord, it turns out, politics was always a job. For Howard, who’s since been fired by the PR firm, too, it remains a religion.  But Howard still likes the finer things in life. Over the course of yet another unbearable couples dinner with Fran and Gordon, he suggests they pair up to write a tell-all, which his agent thinks will fetch the small-time crooks half a million dollars. His logic is sound if naïve: The story of Watergate will come out no matter what. What difference does it make to the president if the men he entrusted with his campaign make money from it? Maybe they can even accomplish a little reputation rehab in the process — from “third-rate burglars” to patriots. Predictably, Liddy shuts the idea down on the spot, which doesn’t sound like a bad outcome for the Hunts necessarily. Half a million dollars goes much further when you don’t have to split it.  Unfortunately, Liddy wants to make sure they both stay broke. It turns out that Howard’s been sending out notes on White House stationery, including to the flirty flight attendant who he met on the way home from the Ellsberg break-in. I think the threat is that if Howard writes the book on Watergate, the Ellsberg scandal will break, too? I’m not entirely sure, but seeing as the book seems like a TERRIBLE idea, I guess it’s just as well! For retaliation for Gordon’s refusal — not to mention his callous willingness to embarrass Dorothy by implying Howard’s roving eye — Dorothy discloses that the money she’s been bringing over has come directly from the Hunt family coffers. Needless to say, the quartet never makes it past the salad course.  The next day, everyone is arraigned. Liddy’s mom pays his bail, a detail so bizarre it must be true. A further disgraced Howard tells Bittman to put more pressure on the White House, to remind them that he could still disclose the truth of the Ellsberg break-in and, in the series’ most long-running innuendo, Kennedy’s assassination, too. But why should they fear this guy now? His credibility is nonexistent.  The show reminds us again and again how broke the Hunts are, but it’s hard to drum up too much sympathy for the new economic reality they’re facing — a hardscrabble future in which they don’t have the money to spoil their tennis whites at the country club or maintain a private stable of horses. Saint John tells his mother that Papa dragged him into the Watergate cleanup, but I think the real last straw for Dorothy is Nixon’s landslide victory. “Well, it was all for nothing,” she spits. “Fuck Nixon.”  A month later, Dorothy boards a plane to Chicago to move some illicit money into the hands of men who broke laws on behalf of a president she hates, but before she goes into the airport, she breaks the bad news. When she gets back from this one last trip, she’s leaving Howard. She’s leaving because he made her befriend racists. They fight over who’s been more unfaithful and how many times, but then Dorothy plays her trump card: She knows he used Saint John.  Their conversation is set to somber music, but it’s not actually sad. Dorothy hates her husband. He never appreciated her and how it bored her to type up his inane novels, how it enraged her to eat baked ziti with Nazis. On the flight, she tells Michele Clark everything she knows about Watergate, and then she dies. Did she take a stand against corruption and against her husband too late? Yeah, of course. But that she was finally taking a stand at all proved to be useless. And, in the end, maybe that’s part of what White House Plumbers has to say about what it takes to stop endemic political corruption. A lot more than one woman’s sacrifice or a vengeful tell-all. Perhaps there’s no force big enough to stop it at all.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2hpdGUtaG91c2UtcGx1bWJlcnMtcmVjYXAtZXBpc29kZS00LXRoZS13cml0ZXJzLXdpZmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1966-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T16:30:00","        No one can doubt that Bob Dylan is an original artist. However, throughout his career, he has cherrypicked from across the spectrum of popular culture to craft some of his works deemed amongst the greatest in popular music. This is understandable, as it’s a trend that all great artists have partaken in, whether it be Elvis Presley, The Beatles or Nirvana.  In his greener years, Dylan was hailed as his generation’s answer to the eminent protest songwriter Woody Guthrie, a man Dylan made no bones about loving. Unsurprisingly, during his protest-song era of the early-mid 1960s, the stylistic nods to Guthrie couldn’t be clearer.  Then, when he went electric on 1965’s Bringing It All Back Home, the debt to the era’s defining penchant for rock ‘n’ roll was front and centre, causing outrage amongst some of those who had been fans of Dylan’s when he was a purely folk artist. Famously, the record was so divisive that in 1966 a crazed fan tried to stab Dylan in Scotland, declaring him a “fucking traitor to folk music”. This is Bob Dylan, though; he was undeterred and pressed on into the future and a career best described as a creative odyssey. Later, Dylan would look to Christianity, reggae and other areas for inspiration.  One place that Bob Dylan has always had his eyes on is the headlines. Famous examples include analysing the socio-political upheaval of his day on earlier tracks such as 1965’s ‘Subterranean Homesick Blues’ and revisiting the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy on one of his finest outings to date, 2020’s ‘Murder Most Foul’.  In Rolling Stone, back in 2009, Dylan’s biographer Clinton Heylin revealed some of the secrets to the troubadour’s best-loved songs in his then-latest book, Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan 1957-1973. Using excerpts from Heylin’s work, the piece peeled back the curtain on several tracks, including three that Dylan ripped from the headlines.  First mentioned was 1963’s ‘The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll’, a song released on the 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin’. The protest piece is an account of the Black Baltimore barmaid who was killed after being hit with a cane by a wealthy white tobacco farmer in 1963. Heylin asserts that in the song, Dylan got nearly every aspect of the incident wrong, from his description of Hattie Carroll and the attack to the trial’s details. “There are two types of Dylan myths,” Heylin said. “One is the myth that Dylan himself creates, and the other is the myth that fans create.”  The next song Heylin says his research found was ripped from the headlines was 1975’s ‘Hurricane’ from the following year’s Desire. The song is about the imprisonment of the boxer Robin ‘Hurrican’ Carter and a man named John Artis for a triple murder. It lists acts of racism and profiling against the athlete, which Dylan claims led to a false trial and conviction.  Notably, in October 1965, Dylan was forced to re-record the song after concerns were raised by the lawyers of his label Columbia that references to Alfred Bello and Arthur Dexter Bradley – the two key witnesses in the case – as having “robbed the bodies” could result in a lawsuit. After all, Bello and Bradley had not been accused of such acts in the case.  The other song Heylin notes as being taken from the headlines is ‘Only a Pawn in Their Game’, another one from The Times They Are a-Changin’. This piece is written about the 1963 assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in Mississippi and offers Dylan’s support for the African Civil Rights movement.  The lyrics blame the killing and the broader racial violence of the time on rich white people in power who manipulated poorer whites into directing their anger towards their Black counterparts. The song posits that Evers’ murderer, Byron De La Beckwith, does not deserve to be remembered in history, unlike the “king” Evers, as the KKK member was “only a pawn in their game.”  Dylan performed the song as part of the March on Washington on August 28th, 1963, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic ‘I Have a Dream’ speech. However, it only received light applause, suggesting that many in the crowd did not agree with the sentiment that exonerates Beckwith as just a poor white man manipulated by politicians and the social system, as he clearly wasn’t.  Nevertheless, despite being plucked from the headline, Heylin revealed all three songs also to be erroneous. “He’s very lucky that he didn’t get his ass sued,” he writes of ‘Hattie Carroll’. “I love the song, but it’s a shameful piece of writing.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmFyb3V0bWFnYXppbmUuY28udWsvdGhyZWUtc29uZ3MtYm9iLWR5bGFuLXJpcHBlZC1mcm9tLXRoZS1oZWFkbGluZXMv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9mYXJvdXRtYWdhemluZS5jby51ay90aHJlZS1zb25ncy1ib2ItZHlsYW4tcmlwcGVkLWZyb20tdGhlLWhlYWRsaW5lcy8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2018-07-28","10:30:00","{""Rawalpindi"", ""Punjab"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-23T04:47:42","Pakistan’s former military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa declared at the end of his tenure the military would no longer meddle in politics.  However, the recent arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan – once seen as the “army’s blue-eyed boy” – and the army’s intention to prosecute civilian protesters under military laws proves the men in uniform are still very much in politics.  The recent turmoil in Pakistan also serves as a poignant reminder of the considerable power wielded by the military.  Amid the ever-changing political landscape, the only permanent force is the military establishment, while the political parties only coexist to share power with it.  Khan, whose success in the 2018 general elections was engineered by the military itself before the two drifted apart, has more than 100 cases registered against him now. These cases range from corruption and sedition to terrorism and even blasphemy, which is punishable by death.  His arrest was followed by days of violent anti-army protests across the country. Protesters set fire to police vehicles, damaged public property and mobs stormed into the compounds of army commanders in Lahore and Rawalpindi.  However, days after the military’s intention of using army laws on civilians became public, events changed course rapidly. Peaceful rallies expressing solidarity with the army took the centre stage.  How did a military of roughly 140,000 men at the time of partition of India in 1947 become the world’s seventh most powerful army?  Anjum Naveed/ AP  An army with a state  Since its creation in 1947, Pakistan has been under military dictatorship spanning a total of 34 years. When not directly in power, the military elite have discreetly engaged in hybrid regimes, exerting influence on civilian governments from behind the scenes.  The British colonial legacy has played a vital role in shaping Pakistan’s military today. British generals continued to head the Pakistan’s military until 1951, when the authority was transferred to General Ayub Khan. Just seven years later, Ayub became Pakistan’s second president through a military coup.  This foundation led to the establishment in 1948 of the spy agency Inter Services Intelligence. It gained remarkable influence in the 1980s, when the US covertly waged a war in Afghanistan using Pakistan as a proxy against the declining Soviet Union.  This period also saw the execution of an elected prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.  Then came the era of religious extremism under General Zia-ul-Haq. This consolidated Pakistan’s obsession with the “strategic depth” for interference in Afghanistan.  In later years, Pakistan saw the assassination of an elected prime minister, Benazir Bhutto under the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. This was the time of enforced disappearances of civilian dissidents. Pakistan also became a safe haven for Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden while receiving funds from the US as a frontline ally in the war against terrorism.  Inter Services Public Relations/AP  Pakistan’s army received substantial financial backing from the US during the Cold War. This bolstered its might domestically while allowing it to undertake adventures abroad for which it was unaccountable.  Traces of the Pakistani military’s involvement could also be seen in the Arab conflicts and the Bangladesh “rape camps”.  Military immune to hyper inflation in Pakistan  Pakistan is on the verge of an economic meltdown, weighed down by harsh pay-back terms from international lenders. With only A$5.2 billion worth of state reserves and a debt of over A$13.5 billion owed to the International Monetary Fund, the army nonetheless received an increased payment of A$11.27 billion in last year’s budget.  Between 2011 and 2015 alone, the army’s assets grew by 78%. By 2016, the armed forces in Pakistan ran over 50 commercial entities, including public sector organisations and real estate ventures worth A$30 billion. Today, their commercial assets are worth over A$39.8 billion.  Top military officers, including former army chief General Qamar Jawed Bajwa and army spokesman, General Asim Saleem Bajwa, have been revealed to have experienced significant financial gains within a relatively short time. Bajwa’s immediate family amassed substantial wealth, transforming into billionaires within six years.  General Asim Saleem Bajwa and his brother established a business empire that included 133 restaurants across four countries, operating under the Papa John’s pizza franchise. An investigation was also launched into real estate corruption by the brothers of former army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, who for many years was the most powerful figure in the country.  The Pandora Papers exposed a long list of Pakistan’s former military officers who had accumulated immense wealth through tax evasions and corruption.  Over time, the military’s economic interests have gained prominence. This includes military-owned businesses, significant onshore and offshore land and property holdings, influence over defence contracts, as well as alleged involvement in ventures linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  The military’s influence in Pakistan extends beyond politics and the economy. To control information dissemination, the military employs a combination of traditional and social media censorship. It also utilises vaguely worded draconian laws.  Emilio Morenatti/ AP  These laws effectively criminalise any form of “ridicule” directed at the army, carrying severe penalties such as long prison sentences and hefty fines. Slain journalist Arshad Sharif was charged with “sedition” under the same laws for allegedly spreading hate against the military and disrespecting state institutions.  As a nuclear state, Pakistan’s military is much like Voltaire’s description of Frederick II of Prussia: it is a state within itself, benefiting from its sheer size, a great deal of money, and an advantageous geopolitical positioning.  The military’s rise to power in Pakistan is linked to cultivating a collective ethos that portrays politics as inherently corrupt, while positioning itself as the sole bastion of honesty, discipline and nationalism.  It is because of this approach that despite corruption within the military, it has successfully distanced itself from the prevalent political culture, which is characterised by kinship ties, factionalism, patronage networks, and most importantly, corruption.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9leHBsYWluZXItYS1oaXN0b3JpY2FsLXRyYWlsLW9mLXBha2lzdGFucy1wb3dlcmZ1bC1taWxpdGFyeS1lbnRlcnByaXNlLTIwNTc0OdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2018-07-20","Not Discerned","{""Damascus"", ""Damascus"", ""Syria""}","2023-05-23T04:00:00","After many years of equivocation and handwringing, Arab states have decided to bring Syria in from the cold and back into the fold. Arab foreign ministers announced earlier this month that Syria would be readmitted to the Arab League, the regional organization that suspended the country’s membership in 2011. At the time, President Bashar al-Assad’s regime had become a regional pariah because of its brutal crackdown on a popular uprising in the country, which eventually claimed roughly half a million lives and displaced another 13 million people. That period of ostracization is now over.  This decision marks the culmination of a tortuous debate among Arab governments about how to handle the Syrian tragedy. But it promises to create more problems than solutions. Even Arab officials who support a gradual diplomatic normalization with the Syrian regime are uneasy about the disorganized way this process has occurred and are wary of its outcomes.  Syria’s readmission to the Arab League allowed Assad to travel to Saudi Arabia to attend the group’s summit on May 19. His appearance provides a glimpse of the drawbacks of the current rush to normalization: he appeared relaxed and triumphant during the visit, sharing grinning handshakes with prominent Arab leaders. His speech denounced Western hegemony and called for the protection of Arab identity—Syria’s own misery and the circumstances of its people went unmentioned. He also failed to mention the issues that most concern his Arab hosts: Syria’s emergence as a major exporter of drugs throughout the region, its sluggishness in taking back refugees, and the freedom with which Iran-backed militias operate across its territory.  While an improvement of humanitarian access and economic conditions in parts of Syria is likely, the Arab rehabilitation of Assad will only accelerate dangerous trends across the region. The regime will use Arab support to subsidize its brutal strategy for consolidating power. The normalization also threatens the position of Kurdish groups in Syria’s northeast and could hasten a U.S. withdrawal, resulting in the resurgence of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). It gives populist politicians across the region an excuse to escalate attacks on Syrian refugees, even as Assad does little to facilitate refugees’ return to Syria. And it is being cheered by Iran and Russia, which see the normalization of the regime in Damascus as an opportunity to both recoup some of their expenses in propping up Assad and cement their influence in the heart of the Arab world.  A HOUSE DIVIDED  Assad has benefited from the Middle East’s fragmented political landscape, which has prevented his many enemies from uniting around a common military or diplomatic strategy toward him. Since 2018, several countries launched initiatives to “return Syria to the Arab fold,” but those efforts did not gain traction because of inter-Arab divisions and Western opposition. But earlier this year, the process started to gain momentum due to a shift in Saudi policy. The divisions within the Arab world guaranteed that Syria would soon be back at the table: governments quickly abandoned their earlier cautious positions in the rush to surpass their regional rivals in embracing Assad’s rehabilitation.  In 2018, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) became the first country to embrace Assad’s diplomatic rehabilitation. Its approach to the Syrian dictator was driven by the urge to contain Turkey, accommodate Assad’s close ally Russia, and mark a conclusive end to the era of popular uprisings. Although this effort received support from Oman, Bahrain, Iraq, and Algeria, which was keen to announce Syria’s return to the Arab League summit it hosted in 2022, the UAE was unable to rally other states behind its conditions-free approach.  Jordan, too, was an early advocate of outreach to Assad. Amman worried that the brutal Russian intervention in 2015 and 2016 in northern Syria would repeat itself in the south, causing a massive exodus of refugees along its borders. It also feared the consequences of Western disengagement: Washington was keen to end its support for Syrian rebels in southern Syria and focus on the campaign against ISIS in eastern Syria and Iraq. In 2018, Amman agreed to a Russian-guaranteed return of regime forces to southern Syria in the hope that Moscow would moderate Assad’s behavior and ensure some stability in the region.  But Amman quickly learned the costs of this gamble. The regime reneged on its promises of reconciliation with local opposition groups, Russian security “guarantees” amounted to very little, and legal trade has been minimal. Instead, southern Syria has become more unstable: it is the conduit for a multibillion-dollar drug-trafficking business overseen by the regime, a safe haven for ISIS and extremist cells, and the staging ground for Iranian-aligned militias. As a result of the 2018 deal with Damascus, Jordan became more exposed to the consequences of the Syrian conflict, more skeptical about Assad’s ability and willingness to compromise, and more cautious about antagonizing its Western partners.  As a result, Amman designed a gradual, multilateral diplomatic process that conditioned the improvement of relations with Syria on verifiable concessions by the regime. This plan attracted Egyptian and polite Western interest but little more. Jordan was stymied by a lack of coordination among its Arab allies: the UAE disagreed with Jordan’s insistence on placing conditions for normalization on Assad, and Saudi Arabia, which was at the time opposed to any kind of normalization, did not want its policy to be set by another country. This robbed Amman of any leverage it might have had. Seeing these inter-Arab divisions, Assad saw no reason to take the Jordanian proposal seriously.  RIYADH’S DIPLOMATIC PIVOT  It took a change of heart in Riyadh to get the ball rolling. Until a few months ago, Saudi Arabia was dead set against normalization. The Saudis had a painful and humiliating history of bargaining with the Assad regime, and they believed that Syria’s normalization would amount to a recognition of the success of Iran, Assad’s ally and Saudi Arabia’s nemesis. During the civil war, Assad had also repeatedly insulted the Saudi leadership and accused it of being behind the rise of ISIS, an accusation Riyadh deeply resented.  Saudi leaders may have no love for Assad, but other factors spurred Syria’s reintegration in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has recalibrated the kingdom’s foreign policy, seeking to insulate his grandiose economic development plans from regional instability. This has motivated his decision to reduce competition with Turkey and Iran, and reduce Saudi involvement in conflict zones. He has also grown frustrated with the United States, which he perceives as unreliable, sanctimonious, and in the process of reducing its security commitments in the Gulf. Rather than rely on Washington, he wants to work with China and Russia on areas of mutual interest, such as energy policy.  For the crown prince, Syria is an annoyance he inherited from his predecessors and a distraction from his transformational agenda. In breaking with past Saudi policy toward Syria, he is indicting the previous generations of Saudi leaders, who had massively invested in regional affairs with little to show for it. The Syrian opposition, for its part, has been fatally weakened by its military setbacks and political incompetence—he no longer needs to worry about it. The May 19 Arab League summit served as a platform to showcase Saudi leadership of Arab politics, and readmitting Syria to the group represented low-hanging diplomatic fruit.  The February earthquake that killed tens of thousands in northwest Syria and Turkey provided the opportunity for this diplomatic shift. During the crisis, Riyadh provided much-needed humanitarian assistance to areas under the control of the Syrian regime, which offered a pretext for direct engagement with Assad. The easing of Western sanctions to facilitate the influx of humanitarian aid to Syria also proved convenient for Riyadh, as it gave Saudi leaders an opportunity to highlight how Western policy had reached a dead end.  RUSH TO REINTEGRATION  Once Saudi Arabia decided to normalize relations with Assad, Jordan and Egypt attempted to slow the Saudis down in several meetings. They were supported by Kuwait, which did not want to perturb the United States, its key ally, and is constrained by anti-Assad domestic forces; and by Qatar, where Assad remains the ultimate pariah. These countries argued that Assad would perceive Syria’s conditions-free return to the Arab League as a kind of surrender on the part of Arab countries.  But these differences did not prove insurmountable, in large part because all these countries have bigger fish to fry. Egypt is going through a serious economic crisis as well and a period of tensions with the Gulf states; Jordan faces similar economic struggles and is more concerned by developments in Israel, where a hard-right coalition is in power, and in the West Bank, where a new intifada remains a possibility. Both could ill afford to antagonize Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Qatar is unwilling to jeopardize its reconciliation with Saudi Arabia after the two countries were at loggerheads between 2017 and 2021; it plausibly insists that Syria’s return to the Arab League, a peripheral institution, does not obligate it to restore bilateral relations with Damascus.  Ultimately, the Saudi endorsement compelled Arab countries, including the reluctant ones, to fall in line. Saudi officials initially claimed that they would pursue a cautious and gradual approach, similar to that envisioned by Jordan. But the process accelerated quickly. An initial announcement of the opening of a Saudi consulate in Damascus was quickly upgraded to the full reestablishment of diplomatic relations, including an embassy in the Syrian capital. Recent Saudi and Emirati statements regarding Syria do not even acknowledge UN Security Council Resolution 2254, the framework to resolve the conflict.  Western governments are unlikely to do anything to stop the Arab rehabilitation of Assad.  Gulf capitals have felt vindicated in their course of action by the feeble Western reaction to Assad’s rehabilitation. None of the topmost Western officials have mentioned Syria in their recent public comments. Readouts of Western officials’ meetings with Middle Eastern leaders rarely mention it. Opposition from the State Department was couched in the mildest terms: the United States would prefer that Syria remained politically ostracized, but does not demand it.  This tepid response has only reaffirmed the dim view in the region of Western policy regarding Syria. For Gulf states, this strategy was bookended by U.S. President Barack Obama’s failure in 2013 to enforce his “red line” on Assad’s use of chemical weapons and the success of the 2016 Russian intervention in rescuing the regime. Subsequent diplomatic failures and U.S. President Donald Trump’s partial withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2019 only made matters worse. Currently, Arab governments view the lack of U.S. response to mounting attacks by Iranian-aligned militias in Iraq and Syria as an ominous sign. If Western governments are disengaging, Arab thinking goes, all the more reason to reengage with the Assad regime.  It is unlikely that Western governments will do anything to stop the Arab rehabilitation of Assad. Western leaders want nothing to do with an issue that consumed their predecessors, would distract them from the ongoing war in Ukraine, and might complicate relations with the wealthy Gulf monarchies. Western sanctions on Assad’s regime and (dwindling) humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people have become a substitute for policy. It is telling that the Western envoys to Syria are increasingly junior in rank or that the position has been discarded altogether.  ASSAD’S DIPLOMATIC PLAYBOOK  Assad does not show any remorse or magnanimity to those Arab officials who meet him in Damascus or Gulf capitals. In his view, he does not need to repent or reflect on his brutality. Instead, he expects Arab states to apologize for the sin of having opposed him. Fortunately for him, the memory of the carnage his regime unleashed—the use of chemical weapons, the brutal sieges of cities such as Aleppo, and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians—is already beginning to fade, and moral inhibitions against cutting a deal with Damascus are melting away.  Assad has managed to turn a very weak hand into a winning one. His strategy of digging in and patiently waiting for regional and global winds to shift has worked, as it has in the past. He sees concessions as a mark of weakness, aims to empty multilateral processes of their substance, and perceives diplomatic relationships as tools that allow him to triangulate endlessly to avoid taking decisions.  During the height of his ostracization, Assad found comfort in history. It was only 15 years ago that he sat triumphantly on the Champs Élysées in Paris as French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s guest of honor for France’s Bastille military parade. At the time, he was coming out of a period of diplomatic isolation owing to his suspected involvement in the assassination of Lebanese political figures. It mattered little that he had been building a secret nuclear reactor, was supporting Sunni jihadists in Iraq, and was working with Iran to arm Hezbollah. Assad’s then-best friends were the Qatari and Turkish leaders, and he hosted U.S. leaders, including Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry, in Damascus. Even though Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah blamed Assad and Hezbollah for the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri (the king’s Lebanese protégé and a former prime minister), he conducted a high-profile reconciliation with Assad. Even then, Assad capitalized on the unstructured, disorganized rush to Damascus to maximize his financial and political gains. And in the end, he gave up nothing.  Ultimately, absent an integrated, inclusive reconstruction framework, Syria will remain broken and impoverished.  Assad seeks to employ the same formula that has served him so well in the past. In his view, refugees, Captagon (the drug that has flooded Gulf cities), and terrorism are rents. They provide him with a steady stream of political and financial leverage as supplicants visit Damascus imploring him to help solve a problem he himself created. And he is already trying to translate Arab engagement into geopolitical and financial gains: Both he and his foreign minister, in meetings with their counterparts, have asked Arab states to lobby Western governments to relax sanctions on Syria. Similarly, he is using Arab engagement to pressure Turkey to commit publicly to withdraw from northwest Syria. Assad and his ministers also have made financial demands of their interlocutors, saying that without an injection of money they will not be able to welcome back refugees or halt the export of captagon.  It is doubtful that Arab governments will spend precious political capital lobbying Western capitals over sanctions. The rapaciousness of the Syrian regime, the difficulty of conducting any kind of business inside Syria, and the war-torn state of the country will also likely prevent any large-scale funding for reconstruction. If funding is provided, some will make it into the Syrian economy—but much more will find its way into the pockets of regime insiders or go to fund its brutal security services.  The normalization will have practical effects in other ways, however. For a start, the increase of elite exchanges will inevitably improve the way Syria is portrayed in the media across the region. Security cooperation between intelligence agencies is also likely to rapidly expand. Syrian residents in the Gulf states, already careful not to antagonize authorities there, will worry even more about doing anything to cross Damascus. While the regime will facilitate Gulf humanitarian assistance, it will insist that it is deployed in line with its preferences instead of international standards. Some early recovery projects may be put on track, but large-scale reconstruction financing remains unlikely. Ultimately, absent an integrated, inclusive reconstruction framework, Syria will remain broken and impoverished, and Syrians will continue to seek refuge elsewhere.  THE COST OF COMPLACENCY  It may be tempting to welcome the rehabilitation of Syria as an unfortunate but acceptable cost of the lowering of political tensions across the Middle East. The war in Syria, after all, is increasingly seen as intractable. For many Western countries, offloading Syria to their regional partners may seem to be an attractive option.  But Arab rehabilitation of Assad is legitimizing and accelerating dangerous trends across the region. Squeezed between Turkey and Assad, Kurdish-led militias in northeast Syria have renewed their diplomatic overtures toward Damascus. The trend toward Arab normalization is amplifying fears about the sustainability of current Western policy and, should U.S. appetite to maintain a military presence in the region vanish, the result could be the revival of the ISIS insurgency. Meanwhile in northwest Syria, a crucial cease-fire in place since 2020 appears increasingly fragile amid fears that regional normalization could ultimately fuel renewed regime military offensives.  For the over five million Syrian refugees in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, normalization has brought them no closer to being able to return safely to their homes—many of which remain in rubble from the war. But it has made it easier for populist politicians in those countries to escalate xenophobic rhetorical campaigns against them as part of an effort to force them out. The expectation in neighboring governments and societies that large numbers of refugees will return does not square with a widely shared suspicion that Assad does not intend to take back people he views as fundamentally disloyal and possible future threats. In Assad’s mind, most refugees are not worth luring back unless he is properly rewarded for their repatriation.  To whet Arab appetite for engagement, Syria has allowed small numbers of refugees back to the country. Lebanese security agencies are already expelling refugees despite the protestations of UN agencies and Western donor countries. But Syria insists on screening them, and those who run afoul of these checks are quickly disappeared by the mukhabarat, the Syrian intelligence services. In addition to inspiring fear, the regime has created other obstacles to returning refugees, including the legal dispossession of property, urban reengineering of their communities, and denying them the right to settle back in the places they came from.  The Syrian president knows that he has no more loyal partner than Iran.  The Arab embrace of Assad is also raising fears in Lebanon that Syria will once again exert influence on its politics. The leading candidate for the presidency is Sleiman Frangieh, a politically weak former warlord whose only asset is his proximity to Damascus and Hezbollah.  Assad’s two primary allies, Iran and Russia, have also welcomed the Arab normalization of Syria. Iran calculates that this process is happening on Assad’s terms and is unconcerned that anything about it will challenge its influence in Syria. It has embedded itself deeply inside the country and can operate largely unimpeded, save for Israeli strikes against its proxies. The Syrian president also knows that he has no more loyal partner than Iran, however difficult the partnership may sometimes be. It was no coincidence that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi chose to visit Damascus in the midst of the Arab opening in early May, the first visit by an Iranian president to Syria since the uprising began.  Russia has welcomed Syria’s reintegration into the Arab world with particular delight. The move allows Moscow to present itself as victorious to its population and other doubters as it struggles in the prosecution of its war in Ukraine. It also maintains its image as a global power and solidifies its partnership with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. Moscow is also using Syria to pull Turkey out of the Western orbit and has organized meetings between top Iranian, Syrian, and Turkish diplomatic, military, and intelligence officials. The normalization process promises to make Moscow’s job easier. Finally, Russia expects Arab countries to contribute to Syria’s stabilization, thus reducing Moscow’s own burden.  The incessant Western claims that “there is no military solution, only a political one” to the Syrian conflict have been proven wrong. Unsurprisingly, battlefield successes have dictated political outcomes—and this mantra only served to justify Western inaction toward a conflict that has had a direct impact on European politics and security. Assad’s rehabilitation by Arab states is yet another recognition of that reality. At a time when Western states are debating what goals to pursue in Ukraine, Syria is a reminder of the strategic and human costs of such complacency.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmVpZ25hZmZhaXJzLmNvbS9zeXJpYS9ob2theWVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","1914-06-28","Not Discerned","{""Sarajevo"", ""FederacijaBosnaIHercegovina"", ""BosniaHerzegovina""}","2023-05-22T11:00:00","In correspondence with other writers over the years, Joseph Conrad often referred to Henry James as “The Master.” He would not be the only writer to do so. James was a writer’s writer, the kind who attracted the adulation of his peers. Conrad once described James’s writerly talent as a “magic spring” flowing “without languor or violence in its force, never running back upon itself, opening new visions at every turn of its course.”  James died more than a century ago, in 1916, but his reputation has come through the 20th century nearly unscathed. Between the taut psychology of The Portrait of a Lady, the dizzying world of What Maisie Knew, and the nuance of The Ambassadors, James has retained both his status as one of America’s greatest writers and his perennial place on college syllabi. But even James has had some of his stories lost to time. The Princess Casamassima is largely forgotten; it isn’t one of the books that scholars use to prove James’s genius. Yet it remains startlingly modern, and offers a lesson for our politically chaotic times.  The Princess Casamassima, first published in The Atlantic in 1885, is a strange novel that follows an oddly named bookbinder, Hyacinth Robinson, through encounters with both aristocratic and revolutionary circles in late-19th-century London. The highest drama in the book comes from characters turning up unexpectedly in one another’s parlors, speaking in dense, portentous turns of phrase. The same could be said of any of James’s novels: The action takes place mostly in social subtleties that have largely lost their meaning to 21st-century readers. In most Henry James novels, such as The Awkward Age and The Golden Bowl, the threat to the lives of the characters is some kind of domestic disturbance: adultery, elopement, lechery. In Casamassima, the threat looms over civic life rather than domestic life, and that makes its characters’ super-subtle phrases and actions even more difficult to parse. Yet there is real wisdom to be gleaned for the modern reader.  Casamassima is James’s only “political” novel, and the easiest criticism it faces is that it is not political enough. Americans have seen, especially in the past few years, how easily people can dismiss books and TV shows that fail to endorse or validate their own political worldviews. All too often, people read Ayn Rand or Tracy K. Smith and joke that the other is not worth reading. As polarization worsens, it also becomes more visible throughout culture and daily life to the point of absurdity: Consider, for example, the ubiquity of yard signs that begin with in this house, we believe followed by a string of rhetorically charged slogans. These signs are sometimes the weapons of lawn-ornament wars that reduce political discourse among those who disagree with each other to dueling Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter flags. It’s hard to imagine that the politically disengaged work of Henry James would have much to offer this situation—but the novel is politically disengaged only if we limit our understanding of politics to rhetoric. We can learn something from James about our own politics: how to let go of our political identities in service of political actions.  Read: The dangerous rise of ‘front-yard politics’  The names and dates of hot-button political fights in James’s day may have been different, but the polarization is all too familiar. On one side of English politics in the 1880s, the Liberal Party claimed to protect the poor and disadvantaged, but was mistrusted by the people as made up of bureaucrats and performers who cared only about lining their own pockets. On the other, a Conservative Party preached national values tied to nostalgia for a mythologized past, and its members did everything in their power to protect the hyper-wealthy elite who kept them in office. Then a new party emerged. In 1881, the Social Democratic Federation was established. Its early leaders included the writer and visual artist William Morris, Eleanor Marx (daughter of Karl), and James Connolly, who would later be executed for his role as commander in chief of Ireland’s Easter Rising. This political backdrop offered a loose model for James in developing Hyacinth’s revolutionaries. It was a time of extraordinary political turmoil and unrest. Soon after Casamassima appeared in this magazine, police in London violently quashed a Socialist-led protest in an event that came to be known as Bloody Sunday—one of many instances of police violence to go by that name.  Casamassima is less a debate between two sides than a portrait of the tense political scene playing out in London at the time it was published—the novel is a portrait, too, of the dangers of thinking that either side can offer a realistic model for understanding an individual’s relationship to civic society. Hyacinth’s ingratiation with revolutionary circles starts out the way these things typically do: a vague politics supported by occasional attendance at barroom meetings where one performs much shouting before returning home. He is introduced to these meetings by Poupin, an older man from his workplace who seems to speak only in political slogans. It would go no further, except that he meets the Princess Casamassima, an aristocrat who wants nothing more than to devote herself to the Cause so long as there is a real Cause to be devoted to. So Hyacinth gets more involved with socialism in direct proportion to his growing involvement with the Princess, a contradiction that propels the story along. He encounters the beautiful world that wealth makes possible and at the same time pledges himself to someday commit violence for the Cause. The last third of the novel is given up to Hyacinth’s fluctuations of feeling as the possibility of that violence looms and the Princess becomes more and more invested in the Cause herself, giving up the ornate furnishings and artworks she previously surrounded herself with. Finally, Hyacinth is called on to commit an assassination, and the novel ends with the crisis of him deciding whether or not he can bring himself to do it.  James’s novels are concerned almost exclusively with the mind, but in Casamassima every character whose politics are based on ideas is mocked. By the end of the novel Poupin is described in hideous terms: His “ardent eyes, fixed, unwinking, always expressive of the greatness of the occasion, whatever the occasion was, had never seemed to him to protrude so far from his head.” Poupin is no villain in the novel, and in fact the novel has no discernibly malicious character. He does, though, keep repeating the slogans he seems to feel he is supposed to say, rather than taking political action like Hyacinth does, and grows grotesque and insectlike along the way. The upper-middle-class liberals whose politics remain within the bounds of their lawn ornaments might find something to relate to in Poupin. In both cases, there is little expectation that they will act on their political slogans, because they are clearly disinterested in following through on their incessant talk. Opposite Poupin we see Paul Muniment, Hyacinth’s political idol. Soon after he is introduced in the novel, Paul says of Hyacinth, “Look at the way he has picked up all the silly bits of catchwords!” The only people Paul actually respects in the novel are those who visit his bedridden sister, regardless of their stated politics. Paul Muniment has an attitude toward political life that we could use more of today: a politically involved person who doesn’t care about what you say so much as what you do.  Read: The political novel gets very, very specific  The novel has as many defenders of the aristocracy as it does of the revolution. Hyacinth’s foster mother, Pinnie, worships the idea of the aristocracy in much the same way that Silicon Valley fanboys reflexively defend Elon Musk: with an almost endearing lack of information, rehearsed disdain for their detractors, and a mysterious, unimpeachable regard for status. The Prince, the estranged husband of the novel’s title character, is treated even more comically than Pinnie for his contempt toward anyone without a title.  In this way, the Prince comes off as a surprisingly contemporary character—the way he warps everything he encounters makes him conspicuously like the culture warriors who denounce “wokeism” but cannot define it. Not all who support the aristocracy are made fun of by the novel: An old woman named Madame Grandoni lives with the Princess and disagrees with her growing involvement with the revolution, saying throughout that there is a point at which she will no longer be able to stay with the Princess and implicitly sanction her behavior. By the end, Madame Grandoni has left; her clear-eyed understanding of the politics around her and the material role she plays is never treated with anything but dignity.  There is a lesson here too: Rather than degrading oneself like the Prince, skulking around the world looking for clues that your worst nightmares have come true, you should instead be like Madame Grandoni. When you find yourself in a situation that you dislike, or that you think you are inadvertently enabling, simply make your disapproval quietly clear, then leave.    Casamassima shows us how rhetoric makes politics ridiculous and toothless—how ideologies, when rigidly defined by the slogans and catchwords we think we’re supposed to believe in, lose all meaning. This is what makes Hyacinth’s fate by the end of the novel so tragic. Hyacinth got caught up in language, gave a stirring stump speech about his willingness to do more than speak, and was condemned to action he didn’t believe in because the language he had learned to mimic made unsubtle claims that he would fully understand only when it was too late. Too often people today fall into the same trap. They parrot rhetoric without understanding that their words should be based on their actions, not the other way around. In a world of yard signs and bluster, we would do well to learn from Hyacinth’s mistake.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9ib29rcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjMvMDUvaGVucnktamFtZXMtcHJpbmNlc3MtY2FzYW1hc3NpbWEtbm92ZWwtcG9saXRpY2FsLXJoZXRvcmljLzY3NDA4NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2018-03-18","17:00:00","{""SaintPetersburg"", ""SaintPetersburg"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-22T14:33:54","Understanding Putin’s Russia, like Russia of the Communist Commissars and the Tsars before that, has always been difficult for outsiders. The Kremlin invests substantial state resources to protect its monopoly on power, hide its intentions, and spread falsehoods. Russian citizens who have challenged the Kremlin’s narratives have been threatened, arrested, or killed.  Recently, Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza received 25 years in prison for criticizing the regime (serial killers and mass murderers in Russia receive more moderate sentences). Foreign diplomats and journalists in Moscow face oppressive surveillance, intimidation and disinformation. The arrest of Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich and the flood of false information pumped into western (and Russian) media streams make clear that the days of Potemkin villages and KGB repression are hardly things of the past.  Consequently, the West has often relied on spies and defectors to develop a basic insight into the Kremlin’s intentions. Professional intelligence services have had to uncover or steal the kind of information readily available to the public in the West.  Those Russian spies have told a consistent story to western leaders over the past century. They warned us again and again that the Kremlin is propped up by an evil state-within-a-state, and that Russia will never be a responsible member of the community of nations until its security services are destroyed. While the Soviet Union died over 40 years ago, former KGB officer Vladimir Putin has recreated the oppressive and brutal security system that jailed and killed domestic opposition, and engaged in relentless political warfare against the west. Even if Putin dies tomorrow, the KGB state endures.  Read More: Why Putin Is Right to Fear for His Life  The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) recruits spies and sources around the world, to gain access to specific programs and groups that are not accessible by academics, journalists, diplomats or collection by technical means. The motivations of those who cooperate secretly with the CIA are as varied as there are people. Sources may seek adventure, money, help for their families, revenge against their bosses or the ego gratification that comes with assisting a superpower.  In Russia it is different. The motivation and messages from Russian sources over the years have shown an uncanny similarity and consistency not found in other groups. That is, secret Russian sources almost always make the choice to help the west after concluding that their system is evil and must be destroyed. They usually express love for their culture and homeland, but are committed to smashing the leadership and secret security services that underpin their corrupt, murderous, and oppressive system. From my experience over decades working in the CIA, Russians tend to be the among the most committed sources. They are often their country’s best and brightest who eventually conclude that there is no hope in changing an evil system from the inside.  In recent months, Gleb Karakulov fled while on a business trip in Kazakhstan. Karakulov was a Captain in the Kremlin’s Federal Protection Service. His unit was responsible for protecting and setting up secure communications for Putin wherever he went. He traveled with Putin on over 180 trips abroad. During a recent interview, Karakulov commented that, “Our President has become a war criminal.” He described Putin as isolated and paranoid. He reported that Putin doesn’t use a mobile phone or the internet, insists that those who will be in the same room submit to a two-week quarantine, and avoids airplanes, usually traveling on an armored train. According to Karakulov, “All the information he receives is only from people close to him. That is, he lives in a kind of information vacuum…He is pathologically afraid for his life. He has surrounded himself with an impenetrable barrier of quarantine and a lack of any information from the internet.”  In some ways Karakulov’s decision to flee is similar to that of Boris Bajanov, the first defector to come to the West after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. Bajanov was Stalin’s personal secretary and in the Soviet Politburo until 1928 when he fled to British India. Bajanov reported that the Kremlin viewed the British Empire as the Soviet Union’s “main enemy.” He noted that propaganda and agitation were the Kremlin’s main weapons as part of a strategy to weaken Britain from within so that if war came it would be easier to win. Soviet cultural and diplomatic institutions were centers for propaganda, espionage, assassination and means to foment industrial and political unrest. According to Bajanov, their goal was to hoodwink western intellectuals by “throwing dust in the eyes of educated persons in the West.” He warned that the Soviet Union was a terrorist regime that suppressed domestic dissent and spread foreign disinformation because it could not survive if the world knew the truth.  In the decades to come, defector after defector has arrived in the West with the same message. The Kremlin had created a ruthless police state capable of mass surveillance, empowered to destroy perceived domestic threats, and intent on relentless attack on foreign foes.  In the early 1960s Soviet military colonel Oleg Penkovsky spied for the U.S. and Britain, providing the intelligence that allowed President Kennedy to navigate the Cuban missile crisis. Penkovsky was so motivated to destroy the Soviet system that he even offered to plant a nuclear device near to the Kremlin in central Moscow.  In 1980, senior KGB officer Victor Sheymov defected to the U.S. Among much else, Sheymov passed intelligence on KGB plans to kill the Pope, details of the KGB assassination of the Afghan President, and the massive technical penetration of the American Embassy in Moscow which forced the US government to spend billions to tear down and build a new, secure diplomatic facility. Sheymov was a brilliant analyst and became a successful U.S. businessman. While inside the KGB with access to secret files, Sheymov studied the Soviet system and concluded that the problem was much more than corruption of the leadership. “The evil in the system was fundamental, inherent in its nature.” Of his own institution he commented, the KGB “is supposed to defend the Soviet people, but it doesn’t. It works against them and the whole world.” He and his family risked capture and death in an effort to inflict as much damage on the system as possible.  The head of the KGB mission in New York City Sergei Tretyakov defected with his wife and daughter to the U.S. in 2000. He passed on details of Soviet infiltration of the United Nations and its diplomats. He was a bigger-than-life figure who appeared destined for the top rungs of the Russian intelligence services. Tretyakov was initially optimistic that the changes that led to the fall of the Soviet Union would lead to a new, democratic, and powerful Russia. However, Tretyakov quickly lost hope. “I saw firsthand what kind of people were and are running the country. I came to the ultimate conclusion that it became immoral to serve them…Russia has been repeatedly raped and looted by its leadership. I call this process genocide of the Russian people performed by a group of immoral criminals…I realized that the intelligence information I delivered was only used to contribute to the totally corrupt political system that didn’t show any signs of improvement.”  In democracies, security services exist to protect their citizens; while in Russia their sole purpose is to keep the regime in power. Countries that spring from revolutionary roots often create a powerful system of regime security rather than national security. Their rule is illegitimate and they need a powerful force to destroy any internal opposition. They are about protecting the leadership at all costs. Costs to the country be damned.  Indeed, the Soviet founding fathers were terrorists who were in and out of Tsarist prisons. Even today we know them by their underground revolutionary names – Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky. They knew when they took over the massive Russian landmass via a political coup, they needed to arrest or kill all potential opponents. Lenin’s first act was to create a powerful personal security service (the Cheka), calling for “merciless mass terror” and immediately ordering the arrest of opposition parties. The leader of the Cheka stated publicly, “We stand for organized terror…this should be frankly admitted. The Cheka is obliged to defend the revolution and conquer the enemy even if its sword does by chance sometimes fall upon the heads of the innocent.”  The Russian security services became an unaccountable state within a state. They killed and jailed tens of millions over the past century, and due to former KGB officer Vladimir Putin’s system of rule, are still alive and well today. The Kremlin engages in war, lies, and murder. We in the West experience it in a relentless form of political warfare of subversion, sabotage, agitation, disinformation, and even assassination. Russian citizens are unable to engage in politics and are under constant threat of being imprisoned or killed as a traitor for even mild criticism.  Western leaders and diplomats have long tried to find a means to work with the Kremlin in hopes of evolving the system. The Ukraine war has finally convinced many that Putin will never change. If we had listened to those hundreds of brave Russians defectors who came to us over the years with powerful warnings, we would have known long before 2022 that reforming Putin’s rotten system is a fool’s errand. Russia will never be a trustworthy member of the family of nations as long as the Russian security services maintain their power over the people.

"political assassination","1978-11-27","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T21:29:48","I got to work with Harvey on the Coors beer boycott, which was one of the first, if not the very first, real alliance between the LGBTQ movement and the labor movement, specifically the Teamsters, who were on strike at the brewery in Golden, Colorado.  Harvey saw an opportunity to get jobs for gay people, to support the union and to build a relationship that ended up being incredibly valuable, because just a couple of years later, we in California faced the Briggs Initiative, which was Proposition 6 of the 1978 November ballot. Prop. 6 would have essentially made it illegal for LGBT people and their supporters to work in any capacity in the public school system. And so those initial alliances with labor through the Teamsters then grew to a powerful alliance with the teachers union, the service workers union, and all the unions who saw that not just as an attack on gay people, but as an attack on workers.  Milk also taught me a lot. He took me with him to City Hall when he got elected and I was a student intern in his office until he was shot. So I got to work on the inside and saw the nuts and bolts of creating legislation, the hearings, the committee work, all of that. But I will say one kind of overarching lesson I learned from him that has really stuck with me is the importance of communicating with plain language, and always trying to find common ground. He was really a genius at that. He could meet anybody, a worker in a union hall, a society lady on Nob Hill, cute street kids. He could talk to anybody, find the common ground, and create a deeper conversation about shared values and shared aspirations.  You have been open about this before: You found Milk on the night that he was gunned down. What was going through your mind then?  It was Nov. 27, 1978. It was horrifying. I’d never seen a dead person before. I’d never seen close up what bullets do. I was maybe the third person to walk in. Dianne Feinstein was there. I just kept thinking, “Well, it’s all over now.” He was our leader. And also for me personally. Harvey had become, for me, very much a father figure. And I just kept thinking, everything’s over. I mean, how can we move forward without him? And it was a real personal loss.  But that night was so extraordinary. As word spread, people began to gather, gay and straight, young and old, Black and brown and white, immigrant and native-born, and it was just thousands and then tens of thousands and tens of thousands more. And that enormous silent candlelight procession filled Market Street from Castro to City Hall. It was just the most extraordinary thing. And I think I realized that night that I was wrong. It wasn’t over. It was just beginning.  We often just hear about these highlights with major figures, the tragic ones. But I want to know about moments of joy. Like maybe a time when Milk made people laugh or some other act of kindness.  Harvey was very funny. He loved being a clown. He would dress up as a clown. He really had an amazing ability to connect with kids and make them laugh. He also had a real big place in his heart for senior citizens. At his campaign office, his camera store and his City Hall office, I was always struck by how many kids and seniors were there. He was very empathetic and he had all these funny little rituals. Like one of the rituals was that every year on his birthday, he would receive a pie in the face.  He was very good at self-deprecating humor, and this was part of a strategy, because at that point in time most heterosexual people had yet to encounter an out-loud-and-proud gay politician. So there was fear, there was anxiety, there were all sorts of preconceptions. And Harvey would disarm people with humor that would then open the door for more serious conversations to happen.  You have dedicated your career to fighting for LGBTQ rights. In what way did being close to Milk help you reach this point where you realized that this was the work that you wanted to do?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rcWVkLm9yZy9uZXdzLzExOTUwMjY4L3N0aWxsLXVuZGVyLXRocmVhdC1vbi1oYXJ2ZXktbWlsay1kYXktbGVhZGluZy1hY3RpdmlzdC1zYXlzLWxnYnRxLWxlYWRlcnMtZmFjZS1kYW5nZXJzLWRlY2FkZXMtYWZ0ZXItYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Srinagar"", ""JammuAndKashmir"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T10:46:06","On May 21, 1990, five men posing as fund seekers representing the newly formed Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terror group gained easy entry into Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammad Farooq’s house in the Nageen area of Srinagar. Once inside, these hard-core HM terrorists opened indiscriminate fire on the unsuspecting Mirwaiz, and after killing him on the spot, made their escape.  With the perpetrators of this grizzly crime successfully fleeing the scene, law enforcement agencies were unable to establish their identity, and since no one took responsibility for this killing, it became very difficult for the police and intelligence agencies to discern the exact motive for this senseless cold-blooded murder.  Since Mirwaiz Farooq was the chairman of All Jammu and Kashmir Awami Action Committee, an amalgam of political parties seeking a resolution to the Kashmir issue, the pro-Pakistan lobby promptly blamed the security forces and intelligence agencies for this gruesome murder, and the indoctrinated public quickly lapped up this humongous lie.  The truth, however, is that even though Mirwaiz endorsed the self-determination campaign, being a preacher, he was totally against the use of violence and being a true nationalist, he was also averse to the idea of allowing Pakistan to take control of this movement. Being widely respected and extremely popular in Kashmir Valley, the ISI thus saw him as a serious threat to the proxy war that it had just started in Kashmir through the HM. So, the then Kashmir-based HM commander Abdullah Bangroo was ordered by his ISI handlers to eliminate Mirwaiz. Bangroo willingly agreed and selected four other HM militants (Javed Ahmed Bhat, Mohammad Ayub Dar, Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and Abdul Rehman Shigan) to assist him in killing Mirwaiz, who besides being a learned preacher and respected politician, sincerely worked for the betterment of Kashmiris, irrespective of the faith or religion they belonged to.  While Bangroo and Shigan were subsequently killed in encounters with security forces, Ayub Dar was apprehended and after being convicted for his role in the murder of Mirwaiz, is currently serving a lifetime in jail. However, the remaining two assassins (Javed Bhat and Zahoor Bhat) went underground, and thanks to HM’s active support and financial largesse, were able to elude arrest for 33 years by frequently changing their bases in Pakistan and Nepal.  With Javed and Zahoor remaining untraceable for more than three decades, it appeared that these two assassins had vanished into thin air, and people had largely given up hopes that they would be arrested and brought to book. Presumably, the absconding killers also must have thought that the police and intelligence agencies had forgotten about them and probably that’s why they sneaked into Kashmir Valley.  With these arrests, all five terrorists involved in the killing of Mirwaiz Farooq have been killed, incarcerated or held in police custody. The credit for the latest arrests goes to the State Investigation Agency (SIA) of J&K police, for displaying exceptional professional acumen and perseverance that enabled them to nab the elusive HM terrorists. Their trial and subsequent conviction will bring final closure to the brutal murder of a God-fearing Kashmiri by his own brethren.  Now that the murder of Mirwaiz Farooq is back in focus, it would not be out of place to recall many other such killings by militant groups that have largely gone unnoticed. The separatists may say that no such thing happened but in 2011, while speaking at a JKLF-organised seminar on ‘Role of intellectuals in the Kashmir movement’, senior Hurriyat leader Abdul Gani Bhat admitted that “Lone sahib (Peoples Conference founder and senior Hurriyat leader Abdul Ghani Lone), Mirwaiz Farooq, and (JKLF ideologue) Professor Abdul Ahad Wani were not killed by the Army or the police. They were targeted by our own people. The story is a long one, but we have to tell the truth.” He even accepted that “wherever we found an intellectual, we ended up killing him,” and put across a haunting question- “Let us ask ourselves: was (JKLF ideologue) Prof Wani a martyr of brilliance or a martyr of rivalry?”  Coincidently, the arrest of the absconding killers of Mirwaiz Farooq comes just days before his assassination, which falls on the eve of the third meeting of the G20 Working Group on Tourism (May 22, 2023) to be held in Srinagar and Gulmarg. Though these arrests have no direct relationship with the G20 event, they are nevertheless a major victory in the war against terror in J&K and validate New Delhi and J&K’s deep commitment to rid this region of the scourge of terrorism.  Known as ‘Paradise on Earth’, and one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, J&K has been plagued by terrorism being sponsored from across the LoC for more than three decades, which has discouraged tourists. However, due to the Centre’s efforts in choking terror funding, the dogged determination of security forces and law enforcement agencies as well as whole-hearted public support, things are looking up once again.  Hence, as the arrest of Mirwaiz’s elusive killers comes as a shot in the arm for those who have faith in the rule of law, it also serves as an unambiguous.

"political assassination","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Srinagar"", ""JammuAndKashmir"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T07:54:00","On May 21, 1990, three young men came to meet Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq at his home in Srinagar. It was nothing out of the ordinary: the Mirwaiz, Kashmir’s head priest and one of its most influential political leaders, received visitors as a matter of everyday routine. Except, this morning’s young visitors were assassins. They fatally shot the Mirwaiz and got away.  The assassination shocked Kashmir and, although support for the separatist struggle was at its peak, it could have led to a public backlash against the armed separatists, who were suspected to be the assailants. That did not happen. Instead, public anger was directed at the government. The reason: as thousands of agitated people carried the Mirwaiz’s body in a procession from the hospital to his home, they were fired at by the Central Reserve Police Force near Hawal in Old City, killing at least 60 and wounding scores. The government, led by Governor Jagmohan, claimed that the CRPF had come under fire from within the procession and retaliated.  The government justification for firing further muddied the waters. In his book My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir, Jagmohan would assign the blame to his police chief N S Saxena, arguing that if he had gone himself or sent a strong police contingent with the procession, the killings of the mourners would have been averted. “His conduct, to say the least, was highly irresponsible, particularly in the context of my instructions,” Jagmohan claimed. “An officer of his seniority was expected to provide leadership and show initiative on such occasions”.  The Mirwaiz’s was Kashmir’s first major political assassination. The murder and its aftermath eventually led to Jagmohan’s ouster as Governor.  The assassination was investigated by the CBI, which said that it was planned by Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan and executed by their operatives Ayub Dar, Javid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat. Bangroo and Shigan were killed in gunfights with the security forces not long after. Dar was caught and sentenced to life in prison. Last week, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat were arrested, after 33 years on the run.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvdGhlLW1pcndhaXpzLWtpbGxpbmctYW5kLXdoeS1pdC13YXMtYS13YXRlcnNoZWQtbW9tZW50LWZvci1qay04NjIwMzE1L9IBfWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvdGhlLW1pcndhaXpzLWtpbGxpbmctYW5kLXdoeS1pdC13YXMtYS13YXRlcnNoZWQtbW9tZW50LWZvci1qay04NjIwMzE1L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

His unwavering commitment to equality, justice, and unity continues to inspire people around the world. This article delves into the life, accomplishments, and enduring legacy of Abraham Lincoln, highlighting his remarkable leadership and impact on American society.  Early Life and Political Journey  Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hodgenville, Kentucky. From humble beginnings, he rose to prominence through his dedication to education and self-improvement. Lincoln embarked on a political career, serving in the Illinois State Legislature and later as a member of the United States House of Representatives. His political journey laid the foundation for his future leadership and the transformative changes he would bring to the nation.  Emancipation Proclamation and the Fight Against Slavery  One of Lincoln’s most significant contributions was his steadfast opposition to slavery. As the nation grappled with the issue, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, declaring that all slaves in Confederate territory were to be set free. This historic proclamation marked a turning point in the fight against slavery and laid the groundwork for the eventual abolition of this inhumane institution.  Leadership During the Civil War  Abraham Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil War was a testament to his unwavering resolve and his commitment to preserving the Union. He guided the nation through one of its darkest periods, demonstrating exceptional leadership skills, strategic thinking, and a deep sense of empathy for the soldiers and citizens affected by the conflict. Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, delivered in 1863, stands as a powerful testament to his vision of a united and equal America.  The Embrace of Equality and the Thirteenth Amendment  Lincoln’s vision of equality extended beyond the issue of slavery. He firmly believed in the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race or background. In 1865, just a few months before his assassination, Lincoln played a crucial role in the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which formally abolished slavery and laid the foundation for a more just and equal society.  Legacy and Impact  Abraham Lincoln’s legacy and impact on American society are profound and enduring. His leadership during a time of great turmoil and division not only preserved the Union but also set the stage for the nation’s progress towards equality and civil rights. Lincoln’s unwavering commitment to justice, unity, and freedom continues to inspire leaders and citizens alike, reminding us of the power of principled leadership and the pursuit of a more perfect union.  Lessons for Future Generations  The life and leadership of Abraham Lincoln offer valuable lessons for future generations. His ability to rise above adversity, his dedication to education and self-improvement, and his unwavering commitment to equality serve as a beacon of inspiration. Lincoln’s legacy reminds us of the importance of empathy, integrity, and the pursuit of justice in our own lives and in the advancement of society.  Conclusion  Abraham Lincoln’s impact on American history cannot be overstated. As a visionary leader and champion of equality, he led the nation through one of its most challenging periods, leaving an indelible mark on the fabric of American society. Lincoln’s unwavering commitment to justice, unity, and equality serves as a reminder of the enduring values that define a nation. His legacy continues to inspire generations, encouraging us to strive for a more just, inclusive, and united society.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdGFsZXNidXp6LmNvbS9hYnJhaGFtLWxpbmNvbG4tdGhlLXZpc2lvbmFyeS1sZWFkZXItYW5kLWNoYW1waW9uLW9mLWVxdWFsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to Iranian media, the tweet caused upset for several reasons, including the use of a “false flag” by Sweden.

(Credits: REUTERS/Costas Baltas)  The flag used in the tweet, which featured a golden lion and a sun, was replaced by the Islamic Republic in 1980. According to National Geographic, this flag had its roots in 12th-century Persia, and was a symbol of monarchy. When the Iranian Revolution overthrew the monarchy in 1979, a new flag with red tulips was designed by Hamid Nadimi.  Embassy tweet urges Iran to end executions and links recent executions of three men to protests that have been taking place since State assassination of Mahsa Amini. Iranian media told three men as “terrorists”.  Iranian media described the tweet as an “act of interference” and criticized Switzerland’s “interfering stance on Iran’s internal affairs…”.  Iranian Foreign Ministry statement  Iran’s foreign ministry also issued a statement on Saturday saying Europe and the US are not authorized or in a position to comment on Iran’s internal affairs or human rights.  In the statement, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said, “Instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and presenting a human face, Western politicians had better listen to the voices of protest from their own citizens and spend their time providing.” Spent demanding their human rights and citizenship.  Widespread violations of the basic rights of Western citizens, including the right to freedom of expression, and the use of excessive violence by police and security forces against people protesting in Europe and the United States, issuing political statements, as well as interfering with the internal affairs of other countries The laws clearly indicate the use of human rights as instruments to advance illegitimate goals and political interests.  “It is ludicrous that people who themselves have an overwhelming history of egregious human rights violations against other nations are openly engaged in violating the rights of their own citizens in their own country and are complicit in the country’s daily tragedies and crimes. Silent in front of Comment on the execution of court orders against the Zionist regime against the Palestinian nation and the murderers and promoters of violence against the lives and peace and security of the people of Iran, even taking a supportive stance in this regard.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nLmJoYXJhdHRpbWVzLmNvLmluL3N3aXNzLWVudm95LXRvLXRlaHJhbi1zdW1tb25lZC1ieS1pcmFuaWFuLWZvcmVpZ24tbWluaXN0cnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1966-01-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T10:17:50","By kola Johnson  In the ensemble of political actors in the contemporary politics of the Fourth Republic, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu easily stands out within the mix, and clearly far above others, in terms of his unalloyed puritanism as the most detribalized and extremely excellent bridge builder, whose cosmopolitan worldview, the humanistic creed of the universal brotherhood of men, and magnanimous large-heartedness, rebuff, and with unguarded effortlessness too, illusive segregationist trifles of race, tribe, ethnicity, religion, sex or distortively jaundiced vision of any sort. This indeed is an aspect which even his sworn enemies will concede, and all so readily too, in conscionable sincerity, if they really would.  To be sure, during his memorable gubernatorial epoch in Lagos State, Tinubu ran an all-inclusive government, in which Ibos were regaled with key appointments in government, ranging from commissionership, local government chairmanship, supervisory councillorship, councillorship, and even membership of the Federal House of Reps, and Lagos State House of Assembly.  You will agree with me, that in the medley of the heterogeneous diversities of tribes domiciled in Lagos State, Ibos constitute about the greatest numbers of tribal blocs. Empirical evidence availing illustrates in poignant clarity, that a good number of Igbo immigrants had decided to relocate to Lagos, in order to enjoy the health and educational amenities, which are not only excellent, but considerably liberal and devoid of discriminatory cleavages on tribal ground, or prejudicial conditionalities of any sort, to access.  And for the Igbos engaged in big-time businesses, one could well succinctly attest to the fact that successive governments in Lagos State, have often accorded them the optimum hospitality, as could ever be imagined.  However, under Tinubu, especially during his memorable gubernatorial epoch, our Igbo brothers have never had it so good, in terms of the conducive ambiance they have continued to enjoy in Lagos State, surpassing in quantum measures, the milieu as extant in regimes prior to Asiwaju’s tenure as governor of Lagos State.  We needn’t overly elaborate on this feature, which is crystally self-evident, in terms of his spiritedly sustained, and of course, intensified efforts, expended in integrating the Igbos into the mainstream of affairs, both in the sphere of political administration and governance and socially too, in the bid to instill a reciprocal sense of belonging which comfortably settles them to feel at home, as members of the same family, with the vast mass of natives of their home states, especially Lagos and Yorubas as a whole  This is why developments unfolding over the years, had signally expressed no cause for cheers, in terms of the inability of our Igbo brothers to reciprocate his markedly affectionate passion, through their patently unfriendly attitude, bordering on outright hostility, indubitably reckoned in the general mind, in their ever sustained and intensified consistency, ever before Asiwaju’s gubernatorial ascension, as a genetic staple of common behavior  Remember that it was no other personality than Oba Rilwan Akiolu, who sometime in 2015, summoned a meeting of Igbo leaders, during which he gave them a bitter piece of his mind, with regards to their broiling belligerence, notoriously stuck over the years, as a distinctively unique epaulet, perennially unleashed against their ever hospitable Yoruba hosts, and worse still, Tinubu, who presided as the political leader of the ruling party in the state, and who by that token, appertain to their chief host.  On this, could it be recalled, how a highly disturbed Asiwaju, quickly rallied the Ibos together, with a spiritedly passionate appeal, to assuage their aggrieved mind?  To be sure, Tinubu’s passion and manifest sense of kinship for the Ibos, going by the manner in which he had ostensibly gone beyond himself to accord them a filial sense of oneness, as an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, is simply amazing.  Indeed some of those privileged to be quite close to Tinubu, could divulge with competent authority, that quite a good number of times, not a few of the intensely concerned ones, had perennially essayed to awaken the renowned APC leader to the mortal danger, posed by the Ibos, particularly in Lagos State, citing their purulent pus of bad blood, bordering on intensely unbridled hate-mongering, despite all spirited attempts by Asiwaju to encourage and re-assure them from time to time, that not only are they an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, but an esteemed and privileged one for that matter. However, Tinubu in his characteristic quixotry and magnanimous large-heartedness had often dismissed such insinuations as mere figments of the imagination.  But today, Tinubu will need no one sounding the reveille for an intelligible cognizance of the message, visibly unfurled in its ominous augury.  This lamentable show of bad blood, which had quite lingered over the years, sadly attained a climax, the moment Asiwaju emerged at the recently concluded primaries as the APC flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election.  Right from that moment, hell was immediately let loose, with an orchestrated campaign of hatred and calumny, emanating from our Igbo brothers, becoming increasingly vicious, worrisome, and extremely alarming, bordering on something else.  Ordinarily and of course sincerely, one perceives nothing bad or odious with criticisms constructively offered, just as giving your mind, a free rein of expression in the public space, in as much as the laws of the land entrenches the inalienable right to free speech; however, the critical moment of departure, that it begins to negotiate an alarming descent to inflammatory hate words and a flurry of conflagratory verbiage, as our Igbo brothers have indulgently elevated to trivial pleasurable razzmatazz, then every right thinking Nigerian, and lover of peace, should be so verily concerned as to raising an eye brow, for the premium sake of peace, growth and unity of this potentially great nation.  No wonder, popular spectacles of fierce and bitter verbal exchanges between the shamelessly ungrateful Igbos on one hand and their highly considerate and hospitable Yoruba hosts continue to greet the public space with disturbing ubiquity, just as the social media is ever awash with vitriols of all sorts, unleashed with unmitigated fury, by these overzealous dacoits of pan Igbo irredentism, giving a clear and undoubted impression that these are clearly the handiwork of hired hatchet men, at the behest of their “invisible” taskmasters, dictating the shot.  As we could all recall, it soon attained a most infuriating point that FolashadeTinubu Ojo, the Iyaloja-General, who also happened to be Asiwaju’s daughter, could not but chip in a piece of her mind, on the need for these ungrateful stock, to temper their vitriolic vituperations, daily being orchestrated, against the eminent Nigerian statesman, with unfettered restraint.  Indeed, it couldn’t have been anything but shock, an exceedingly severe one for that matter, when a group of Igbos, in an unwarranted rage of defiance, stirred tremors of warning that she was fanning the embers of wild belligerence; hauling, in a rave of uncontrolled lunacy, that they were ready, and indeed more than capable to respond squarely to any drum-beat of battle, as their hospitable Yoruba hosts might bring to bear in the contest. Haba!  A curious aspect of the charade in progress was that as Asiwaju was all this while, at the receiving end of the untrammeled aspersions, perennially hurled by the Igbos, in their possessive fury of hate words, Atiku had all along remained virtually off their scurrilous purview, except for occasional scratchers, which in no way compared in severity, with the lethal verbal assault and saber-rattling incendiaries increasingly being orchestrated against Asiwaju, with sustained and intensified angst.  Yet, this is a man, who as governor, presided over the affairs of Lagos, at a time, when the nagging question of high-frequency migration of the Igbos to Lagos State, attained a peak, continually stretching the existing infrastructure almost beyond the limit of endurance, thus keeping successive administrations sleeplessly on their toes in the herculean toilsomeness that grappled to cope with the increasingly alarming population explosion, daily being witnessed as a result of the accelerating incursion of people in quest of greener pastures, on account of it’s a conducive ambiance to flourishing endeavors.  Of course, it cannot be too often emphasized that Igbos constitute the most considerable chunk of this category. This is why their pestiferous and patently uncouth outpourings against Tinubu indeed herald such a huge surprise, so to say.  Why is it, that Igbos incubate such pathologically inscrutable loathsomeness for their Yoruba brothers, perennially let loose, with frenetic ruthlessness and the most unimaginable vitriol on Asiwaju, who ironically happens, in exceedingly befitting terms, to be their foremost benefactor and ardent lover of their progress?  During Asiwaju’s heroic reign as governor of Lagos State, he succeeded in lifting Lagos to hitherto unprecedented heights, while in the process, making the state, not only the premier state of the federation but also the benchmark of excellence, whose dynamic policies, spreading like an amazing contagion, were emulated with religious fervor, by other states, far and wide.  Why is it therefore, that our Igbo brothers would always with fervent impulsiveness be ready to throw reason to the dogs, ever haunting and hounding this unusually detribalized statesman, at their capriciously whimsical will, and woolly sentimentality, while literally looking less at the individual governors presiding in their own primordial states of the South-East?  Why is it that you come to Lagos; make a huge fortune and big money, and yet, reserve nothing but sheer bilious angst and hate, for your accommodating hosts and their leaders, who hitherto have accorded you such a bosomy familial embrace devoid of any shred of discrimination?  If the governors in your respective native states of the South-East had done even a fraction of Tinubu’s accomplishments in Lagos, with the transformative impetus that has elevated it to one of the leading cities in Africa, would you dare have descended on them with such whorish pang of depredation, so terrifying to imagine? Pray. Why are Igbos so envious, panicky, and intensely jittery even of the slightest shadows of the Yorubas?  Imagine again, the umbrage devoid of the traditional African deference for old age, quite in tune with the Igbo behavioral stereo-type, befittingly evocative of the landmark “ranting of an ant” of Chuba Okadigbo, in his message to the Great Zik, with which they swooped on Wole Soyinka just for his reasoned elderly admonishment on the nutsy band of off-hook scoundrels, parading as pyrate fraters; consigning the cultivated virtue of home training to the dogs, in their reprobative burlesquing of the revered patriot and statesman?  Could you imagine their effusive gibberish rant answering, quite in character with the monocultural racial herd in their wanton abrasiveness against the Yoruba-born globally acclaimed genius of all times, who dominates the global literary fraternity like a colossus, for no imaginable reason whatsoever? Imagine again, the latest in their primitive savage streak, displayed with untamed recklessness, in their churlish and petulant pepper-market jabs unleashed in their brusquely uncouth mannerisms, against the global literary giant, just because of his latest post-election commentaries, in which he made very apt and cogent points.  In the same vein of bilious ingratitude, one recalls that Victor Adebunkola Banjo, a lieutenant colonel of Yoruba extraction, in a sacrificial fit of immolation, discountenanced the implicating tag of a traitor, expectedly coming from his Yoruba kinsmen, to fight on the side of Biafra; but as it were to turn out, Ojukwu’s reciprocal code of appreciation, was an outright summary execution by firing squad, of that brilliant, charismatic and courageous soldier and intellectual.  Same with Adekunle Fajuyi, the then Governor of the old western region, who in an exemplary fit of chivalry, unprecedented in the annals of human existence, staked his life, by choosing to die with his guest and the then military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi ironsi. Yet our Igbo brothers will far from appreciate it.  On this patrimonial inheritance of genetic anti-Yoruba obsession, Chinua Achebe, a foremost exemplar of anti-Yoruba racial hatred, could poignantly be seen as taking the lead, as of course signally evident in the retrospective play-back, 37 years ago, when in the wake of the frabjous ambiance heralding the exhilarating announcement of the Yoruba-born literary giant, he (Achebe)ascended the roof-top, with an unwarranted gaffe, that the global literary diadem, was by no implicit assumption, a caveat for the Asiwaju title of African literature.  Indeed, looking back decades ago; that moment of destiny when Soyinka bagged the Nobel literary diadem; unarguably a staggering all-time feat in the annals of black achievements, he had, even if unknown to him, unwittingly stepped on the wounded toes of the collective mass of envious and inferiority-ridden Ndigbos, who in turn, will never forgive him, just for that singular feat, which they had cherished with passionate fervor, that it should have belonged to one of them or a non-Yoruba rather than a Yoruba.  Indeed, Soyinka himself could not help but describe the banal effusion of the arch-Igbo tribalist as “uncalled for and disappointing”. “I was a little bit disappointed, and didn’t see the necessity…that particular subject under contention didn’t relate to literature”, stressed the world-renowned writer.  Even Soyinka himself, in an article personally written years ago, in an edition of this Day Newspaper, could again, not help but lament a conspiratorial wave of propaganda, insurgently saturating the public space; then championed by an Igbo-born professor; animated by a weird hunch of diabolism, had mischievously sought to forge an interpretatively suspicious link between Achebe’s fatal accident, that rendered him mortally crippled, shortly after a particular edition of his birthday anniversary; to the gift of a live cow, presented to him on that particular occasion by Soyinka; ostensibly as an innocent well-intentioned goodwill gesture, to a comrade in the literary fraternity; but which the arch Igbo tribalist, and a supposedly enlightened professor, had in an unguarded magisterial whim effectively poisoned the vulnerable willing herd of fellow arch tribalists who in their bizarre flight of fancy, had came to construe in the grotesque coloration of occultic wickedness.  Yet, this was the same Soyinka, whose sacrificial immolation for the Biafran cause, in the thick of the civil war, earned him a harrowing 22-month ordeal in the gulag, during the Gowon era.  Again, Achebe would not allow any moment to slip by, without a paludal inveighing of Awo, as the ominous harbinger, paving the fenestra for the demonizing incursion of the tribal monster, into the political firmament.  In the inexpungible quibble of revisionism, we would all recall the ever unrepentantly chronic tribal bigot, who was so quick to the post, harassing Awo as the primordial agent of dispersal of tribal infiltration, advancing a rather meretricious make-belief that the revered statesman of the Yoruba stock, it was, that engineered the parliamentary cross-carpeting that put paid to Zik, in oppilating his visionary misadventure for the Leviathan premiership of the Old West.  Lamentably, his curious quirk for selective amnesia would least avail to advert in reference to the doctrinaire chauvinism of the great Zik, as of course unfolded in his reprobative heresy, way back in 1949, that “….the god of Africa, has created the Igbo nation to lead the children of Africa from the bondage of ages.”  It is, of course, a popular staple of common knowledge, how Zik as the incumbent vice-gerent, in the NCNC, following the glorious demise of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay, would without qualms of conscience, cannibalize the NCNC as an exclusive inheritance, of which the Igbos were the sole legatees; a signally disturbing trend, which in turn elicited the vexatious discountenance of people like Adegoke Adelabu, who were verily uncomfortable with the unstatesmanly descent to base pertavinity.  At this juncture, I shall proceed to expound three signally illustrative instances, in which the defective strabism of Igbo leaders, Zik and Ojukwu in particular, in terms of their myopic preferences of political alliances, had not only dragged the larger mass of their collective filial kins into the excruciating marginalization conundrum, celebrated over the years, in inconsolable crocodilian canticles, but also in the process, dragooned the collective Nigerian nationhood into its contemporary tumult.  However, let me affirm, right before the narrative just about coming on the heels, that this does not in any way, vitiate a jot, the credible moral force, latent in Asiwaju’s fraternizing parley with a vastly enlightened North, as currently extant – contrasting in its progressive paradigm with the feudal fascism of the era of old; for which Awo desperately needed fellow progressive fraters in collaborative synergy; to square up to; for ultimate libertarian triumph, of the Northern Talakawas in an avowed visionary pursuit which unfortunately footled to failure for lack of a willing mate in response to the clarion call, for a united solidarous front, particularly from the strategic North.  Going down memory lane,1959 to be precise, one recalls that Awolowo advanced an alliance overture towards Zik, premised on the logic that a combination of the Action Group, led by him, and the Zik-led NCNC, will overwhelm the Hausa-Fulani NPC, whose narrow feudal bent was clearly ill at variance with the vision of a united and virile Nigeria, and the liberation of the down-trodden, especially the highly pauperized Talakawas of the north.  Zik was crystally enamored of Awo’s unassailable logic, or so it seemed. But dramatically, all of a sudden, Nigerians woke up one day, only to discover that the great Zik had indeed gone with the Hausa-Fulanis! Thus did the Hausa-Fulani NPC seize power, and promptly grabbed it as a much-awaited opportunity to annihilate Awo.  Of course, those who knew at that time would easily recall Akintola’s machiavellian deployment, being a willing myrmidon of the north, for a head-on collision against Awo, his erstwhile leader – as inspired and engineered by the Hausa-Fulani oligarchs, animated by a subterranean cant for a greater Lebensraum and hegemonic continuity – and the violent conundrum in the West; eventually culminating in January 15, 1966, military coup, master-minded by a cross-section of Igbo-born army officers, and the assumption of power by Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, as the first military Head of State, after the gruesome assassination of the then Prime-Minister of the federation, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and the then premier of Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, a direct great-grandson of Shehu Usman Dan Fodio.  The January coup was to inspire the July 29 coup, spear-headed by the Hausa-Fulani elements in the army, in unconsolable revanche to the killing of Balewa and Ahmadu Bello.  Of course, the then ruling military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, among sundry top army officers of Igbo extraction, also lost their lives in the retributive backlash of the same tribal-motivated coup, which in disastrously fatal turn, catalyzed a massive wave of inter-tribal killings between the Igbos and Hausas; triggering the declaration of Biafra, by Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, and the inevitable consecution of a civil war; a gory celebration of blood bath, in which an estimated two million souls perished.  In yet another ominous turn, 1979 would again witness an unfortunate rehash of the same charade, as Awo again made an alliance overture to Zik, ostensibly premised on a mutual synergy between the Awo-led Unity Party of Nigeria, on one hand, and the Zik-led Nigerian People’s Party, aimed at counteracting the Hausa-Fulani-led NPN, a feudal ideological resurgence of the Northern People’s Congress of the First Republic. Again, the entire nation woke up one day, only to discover that the Zik-led NPP had unabashedly flocked along, in parley with the Hausa-Fulani NPN, a feudal reincarnation of the First Republic Northern People’s Congress.  Of course, we could all well attest to how the alliance fortified the NPN, which had ripped off on their fortune-hunting partners, the NPP, to install their men into principal offices in the legislature, now embarked on a pleasurable binge of massive tyranny, as unfolded in the politically motivated mass killings of the Bakolori farmers in Sokoto, the deportation of the Majority Leader of GNPP, Alhaji Abdul-Rahman Shugaba, the terrifying tomfoolery of the 1983 elections, and the devastating quake and tumult, coupled with the demonic prodigality in public spending; a saturnalian frenzy of high-wire corruption, which again was to culminate in the Buhari-Idiagbon coup of December 31, 1983.  Of course, as an intensely agitated Zik cried out, following the massive electoral chicanery, we would all recall the horrifying reckless rant of the notorious rantipole, ChubaOkadigbo, who unsurprisingly typical of his coprolitic gutter-rant style, which would go down as a locus classicus in intellectual hooliganism, dismissed the rightful democratic remonstrance of the great Zik as” the ranting of an ant”  Looking back, one could well affirm without any shred of doubt, that Zik’s preferential cohabitation with the then Northern People’s Congress at the time in question, was motivated by a pathologically embedded narcissism that he could use the benefit of an alliance with the then feudal Northern People’s Congress, to acquire greater leverage for his fellow Igbo brethren against the Yorubas, then renowned for their elevated notch of superior education. Unfortunately, as it would turn out on each occasion, none else, but the Igbos, came out the greatest losers as patently expressed in an unremitting pathos of mournful dirge, in their lachrymal canticles on marginalization.  This unimaginable faux pas of history would also derive an unfortunate replication in the inexplicable choice that saw the Ikemba of Nnewi, Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu who on his return from exilic sojourn in Ivory Coast, now Cote d’Ivoire, had sought for a political party to enlist in, and found none, except the Hausa-Fulani NPN, thus betraying an arrant lack of grasp of the causative dynamics of history.  On what note does one, therefore, reckon with such a big goof in cognitive dissonance, emanating from a supposedly learned Oxford-educated historian of an elevated Master’s degree cadre, as the Ikemba of blessed memory, one may ask?  Not until the devastating defeat he suffered in the Senatorial duel from Dr. Onwudiwe of the NPP, just as his party, the NPN, barely did reckon with him, did it eventually dawn on him that he was already demystified and his terror value which hitherto had stared the Northern feudal oligarchs inwardly scared stiff, effectively defused.  Still, on the Biafran warlord of blessed memory, it would well be apt and relevant at this point, to ask:”In taking recourse to the Hausa-Fulani NPN, as it were, at that time, whose interest was he serving? The collective interest of the Igbos or his own personal interest? If the interest of the Igbos, he should tell that to the marines.  Similarly, in a back-track reminder as might well be deemed for strategic emphasis, we would all witness the manner in which Zik had jettisoned two crucial and strategic overtures for progressive synergy, as advanced by Awo, firstly in 1959, and secondly in 1979, exactly twenty years after; and the catastrophic aftermath for the corporate national existence.  No wonder, Sir James Robertson, the last British governor-general of Nigeria, during the colonial era, daubed him in his memoirs, as mercurial, unpredictable, and unreliable, while the Late Professor Ayodele Awojobi, the engineering genius of blessed memory described him categorically as ‘consistently inconsistent’.  Now pray: in taking recourse to the feudal Hausa-Fulani NPC, and NPN in 1959 and 1979 respectively, exactly 20 years after, whose interest was Zik, indeed the Great Zik of Africa serving? National interest or the interest of his Igbo kith and kin? As for national interest, he could well tell that to the Marines!  Ironically, going down the lane of history, one recalls with definitive clarity, that Zik actually rode to dominantly prosilient fame and eminence, on the political war chest of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay – the then leader of the NCNC, at a time that Zik held forte as the Secretary-General ­­– who at various public fora, openly expressed his passionate love for Zik, as his beloved son, in whom he was well pleased.  This in effect is to say that the wider national appeal that the Zik-led NCNC enjoyed after the demisé of Macaulay, erstwhile leader of the party, was largely due to the immense populist clout and towering larger-than-life imagery of the legendary Macaulay, who at the zenith of his fame and glory, bestrode the Nigerian political hemisphere like a colossus.  It was a tribute to these grave political miscalculations of the great Zik, that no less a personality than the former Premier of the Eastern region, Dr. M.l. Okpara of blessed memory, recanted in agonizing lament, that he will regret till his dying day, his failure to advise Zik, to rather go with the Awo-led Action Group, as against the parochial expedience of the Hausa-Fulani feudal NPC.  Unfortunately, by the time the Zik-led NPP would negotiate corrective ideological repentance for the progressive configuration, of “The Twelve Progressive Governors”, Awolowo’s brain-child in progressive synergy, which Zik had twice rejected, initially in 1959 and again in 1979, it was already too late in the day, as the looming surge of anarchy, had irrepressibly waxed beyond redemption, and could thus not avail as a viable counter-force to rebuff the incursion of the Buhari-Idiagbon duo, who on December 31st, 1983, sprung forth to upstage the apple-cart of the corrupt and purulently decadent Shagari-led civilian administration of the second republic.  And in the case of Ojukwu, we would all recall, how having been politically demystified and deflated sequel to his attendant fiasco at the Senatorial election, he in angered repudiation of his erstwhile Hausa-Fulani allies, recanted in the fashion of a new convert to doctrinaire proselytism of an East-West understanding fanatically propounded and propagated as a counter-force to the monolithic geo-political behemoth of the north.  Unfortunately, and on a tragic note of paradox, the average Igbo man would see nothing wrong in the political leaders of their own genitive breed, let alone the discerning cognitive intellect that essentially exposes these two key leaders of the Igbo tribe, in the context of the endemic faux pas in their choices and preferences borne of narrow personal and at best, tribal promptings, in terms of their dialectical linkage to the conundrum prevalently etched for decades, with increasing virulence on the polity; of which the Igbos were to come out the worse, arising from the seminal outpourings of the blighted vision of their own leaders.  On this, the Ghanaian statesman of blessed memory, Joe Appiah remarked in his autobiography, in which he exposed Zik as the veritable fugleman providing the primeval irritant for the irruption of the anti-Yoruba racial hate, uncontrollably festering the general Igbo psyche.  Going down the lane of history, Appiah recalled the historic moment of the formation of Egbe Omo Oduduwa in London, and the conflagratory rhetorics immediately following on the heels, as Zik in the September 8 edition of the West African Pilot, thus issued the provocative cassus belli: “Henceforth, the cry must be one of the battles against Egbe Omo Oduduwa, its leaders at home and abroad, uphill and down dale, in the streets of Nigeria and in the streets of London and the residence of its advocates’.  According to Chinweizu, a notable Igbo intellectual, “the testimony from a Ghanaian, who for many years, was a member and president of W.A.S.U in London, should give Igbos pause about the version of the Igbo-Yoruba cold war they had accepted. The key point is that the Ibo Union had been in existence before the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was founded. Yet Zik declared war on Egbe Omo Oduduwa. Why? If it was because the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was not pan-Nigerian, then what of the pre-existing Ibo Union?”  “In other words, it wasn’t the Yorubas who introduced tribal unions and tribal politics into Nigeria but the Igbos. But whatever his reason, Zik was the one who declared war on the Yorubas; he was the aggressor”.  “With that aggression as background, the carpet-crossing becomes an understandable response to Zik’s declaration of war. If somebody who declared war on your people arrives to govern your homeland, what should your leaders do? Welcome him and let him govern, or drive him out by any means necessary? The carpet crossing accomplished just that, and Igbos following Zik, the instigator of the response, I commend the Yorubas for defending themselves against aggression”.  “Zik’s conduct is an example of how Igbos can act without thinking of how their actions might look to those their proposed action might adversely affect. That is a weakness Igbos should be on guard against and should work to eliminate by extra self-awareness and constant self-criticism.”  “For seven decades we have paid for Zik’s aggression against the Yorubas. The cold war, which Zik started, made it possible for the British to install the NPC in power in 1959 when Zik refused to join with Awo to form the federal government. He explained it away by alluding to his distrust of Awo that stemmed from the carpet-crossing affair. In other words, Zik is ultimately responsible for our disasters and oppression under the caliphate. But the pertinent issue at this time is that we, not the Yorubas, are responsible for the Yoruba-Igbo feud. We are not the innocent victims of Yoruba tribalism and hatred. That fact should inform our attitude in seeking reproach with the Yorubas, especially now that we need a Yoruba – Igbo alliance to help create conditions.”  Unlike Achebe, whose world-view horrifyingly begins and ends with a segregationist chauvinism of pan Igboism, to the extent that he would see nothing bad in Zik, Ojukwu, and the primitively untamed Onyeama, but rather a blanket sweep sentiment of everything good, while in the obverse, he will faint blink an eye, before taking Awolowo, the foremost heroic symbol, to the cleaners on sheer sentimental illogic, which exposes his grossly deficient intellect – Soyinka on the other hand, had more than sufficiently ample space to literally take the three-some to the hangers by virtue of their incredibly horrifying fumblings, sacrilegious deportments, and heretic rantings and vituperations; but he would rather not plow that path, borne of his magnanimous large-heartedness and unifying propensity.  Similarly, he had the discretion to take on Achebe and his demented, warped, infantile, and mediocre intellect, yet he would rather choose to lie low, actuated by sheer pacifist impulse and of course a macro-dimensional, all-encompassing vision of a united and indivisible Nigeria.  To be sure, as could not be too often repeated, Tinubu succeeded in lifting Lagos State to hitherto unprecedented eminence, thereby making it, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose progressive, dynamic, and pragmatic policies were emulated all over the federation.  In the libertarian struggle for democracy, he was prosiliently sui-generis as the hero of the struggle, as of course attested to, by the likes of Wole Soyinka, Colonel Nyiam, Dele Momodu, Kayode Fayemi, and even the Ayo Adebanjos, Abraham Adesanyas, Olanihun Ajayis among several others.  Besides, Asiwaju’s vast expanse of the network built over the years, coupled with his personal charms, mobilization, and organizational acumen, and his peculiar gift of the sixth sense, which his competitors could verily not match, are such rare but highly cherished treasures that money cannot buy.  But apart from the fact of his personal talent and endowment, is the law of Divine compensation, which is to say that Asiwaju is a man who had paid his dues.  As an arrowhead of NADECO’s struggle for democracy under the totalitarian fascism of General Sanni Abacha, Asiwaju’s heroic role in this regard, will as much, demand an entire voluminous book to do justice to.  Of course, it’s a generally acknowledged fact of history that, unlike the reactionary elements who would not give a damn in parleying with Abacha, Asiwaju refused to sell his conscience, but would rather negotiate a tedious journey to exile, despite the assurance by the management of Mobil, where he held forte as the Chief Treasurer, that he should not hesitate to retrace his step back to his plum job if his romance with politics appeared bleak.  Evidence abounds from the very horse mouth of people like Dele Momodu, Colonel Tony Nyiam, Kayode Fayemi, Bayo Onanuga, and co, as to the immense sacrifice which Asiwaju made in assisting financially disadvantaged exiles whom he quartered in his houses both in the U.K .and the U.S., and even assisted financially, with regards to their daily upkeep.  At least, Bayo Onanuga did not mince words in divulging Asiwaju’s benevolent gestures in permitting him to draw a regular allowance of hundreds of dollars weekly, from proceeds issued from Asiwaju’s Gas Station in Chicago.  Femi Ojudu, Osibajo’s Chief Campaign Man, similarly did reveal, how Asiwaju from his base in the U.S. was regularly remitting money for the payment of staff salary, and also for the daily running cost of PM NEWS and THE NEWS, at the harrowing moment when Abacha’s killer squad were let loose against the newspaper organization and its editorial staff.  Asiwaju did all these, despite the fact that he was not a shareholder in the organization. Rather, as a progressive politician and democrat to the core, he was solely fired by the zeal to boost the morale of the rank-and-file staff of the newspaper, in the struggle for democracy. The same thing Asiwaju did for TELL Magazine when things were direly so rough.  Similarly, Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, also narrated how at a point in time, as an exile in the U.S., Asiwaju embarked on the sale of Rice which involved a shuttle between Thailand and some African countries, while dedicating the proceeds from the business to the collective cause of the NADECO struggle.  Kayode Fayemi in his writings, also attested to this, in his remarks on how Asiwaju stretched his financial resources to the limit in the collective struggle for democracy.  The same incumbent governor of Ekiti State also narrated the crucial role that Asiwaju as a member of the Board of Trustees of NALICON, founded by Wole Soyinka, during that era in exile, played in encouraging and convincing the Olof Palme Foundation, based in Sweden, to assist NALICON with the urgently needed fund for the establishment of the Radio Station which subsequently contributed in no mean measure, to a formidable propaganda armada which attracted international condemnation that increasingly debilitated and devastated the defenses of the Abacha regime, making its eventual exit a matter of time, before the dramatic demise of the notorious military dictator.  At this juncture, the crucial point to be noted is that Asiwaju had barely spent two years as a senator before Abacha took over. In this circumstance, a lesser mind would have wallowed in regret, cursing the day he went into politics; and would surely not hesitate in retracing his step back to his plum job, or fall headlong in romance with Abacha, just like a huge lot of members of his political class actually kowtowed at that time, while throwing honor and principles to the dogs. To be sure, it was apparent that Asiwaju was not looking forward to any gains. Rather, his main point of satisfaction consists in the fact that it was a worthy struggle.  In a nutshell, this is the democracy we all enjoy today. How many people ever bordered to imagine, the valley of the shadow of death, Asiwaju passed through in his struggle for civilian governance which we are all enjoying today, and how many of us who knew, do indeed appreciate it?  All the political eaglets, neophytes, and nonstarters, including state governors who had hardly spent 100 days in office, to whom an Angel had appeared and handed them the divine mandate to be president overnight, including those of them that Asiwaju made, where were they at that harrowing moment when Asiwaju was leading the battle from the trenches, far away in exile? How many members of the political class, who would not like to see even Asiwaju’s shadow, ever knew or appreciate or remember, as the case may be, what Asiwaju went through in those days; the dastardly vandalization of his residence in Lagos and eight of his cars destroyed beyond repairs, the accusation that he wanted to plant a bomb at Ejigbo NNPC Depot, just because of his frontline involvement in the June 12 struggle, and how he escaped death by the whiskers by wangling through the borders of Benin Republic, for a harrowing life in exile?  Yet, Asiwaju never allowed his distinguished achievements in the struggle, to get into his head, through an overnight fancy for the presidency.  Reliable authority even had it that on arrival from exile, Asiwaju in his characteristic selflessness, had actually intended to go for a Senatorial seat, but Afenifere top-notchers at that time, prevailed upon him to head on for governorship.  For close to thirty years, after he had been in politics, Asiwaju had refrained from announcing any ambition for the presidency, rather, he had over the years, provided a platform for others like Falae, Atiku, Ribadu, Buhari, and Co; to run for the presidency, while in the process, risking his life, and everything dear to him, to accord them maximum support.  Imagine, for instance, the immense role he played in the formation of APC, which eventually provided the platform for the fructification of Buhari’s passionate presidential ambition after three previously failed attempts which on a particular occasion, publicly drew tearful pathos of lament from him. For this, Asiwaju was bugged by some morally suspect media which obviously had kowtowed for the bargain of settlement; yet he refused to budge, until his unflagging support, inspired Buhari to a roller-coaster ride to presidential victory.  As an eminent political figure, an accomplished veteran of the battle for political liberty, a courageous leader of the opposition, and an arrowhead of the progressive forces, coupled with the fact that Asiwaju commanded more States in his own regional constituency than any other politician could claim to command in their own respective regions, Asiwaju nevertheless conceded to Buhari.  Indeed in a more civilized clime, Asiwaju would have had no need to embark on any campaign spree or consultation. Rather, he would have been literally co-opted, without the slightest opposition, and with strong plea and persuasion too.  To be sure, people in Asiwaju’s class are rare. Not only is he an enigma, but an enigma within an enigma, the category that the Yorubas would describe as “Akanda Eeyan”. You can only toy with him at your own peril.  In all the geo-political Igbo-speaking states of the South-East, how many of Asiwaju’s contemporaries as state governors, command any conspicuity on the political radar, in astonishingly wide-berth comparison with Tinubu, who has continued to rise and rise like a meteor, to the enviable height which has deservedly earned him the treasurable eulogium of the ” Main Issue In Nigerian Politics”.  Imagine Igbos boasting that Lagos is no man’s land. Imagine the falsidical bunkum that they contributed the most in building Lagos. Why then do they not take recourse to their primordial native home and bring it to par with Lagos, after all, charity, they say, begins from home.  Familiar popular domiciles like Kaduna, Kano, and Abuja, are notable spots with beehive ubiquity of Igbos. In other words, Igbos are virtually etched on the minutest space in these places; yet they would only tread cautiously, and would never stretch their luck too far, contrary to their licentious spoilt sport brag in Lagos, cashing in on the traditional hospitality of Yorubas and Lagosians in particular, stretched more than ever before, during the Tinubu era – in the embrace of our Igbo brothers whom the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello would daub in the awry imagery of pathologically ungrateful usurpers.  All the excesses Igbos perpetrate in their host states, how many non-Igbos dare try an inch of that, in their own land, knowing Igbos for their characteristic hostile intolerance of non-Igbos in their own land?  When will Igbos rise above their genetically ingrained anti-yoruba hate and phobia, truculently unleashed this time around, on Soyinka and Tinubu, simply borne of their Leviathan stature and glowing distinction, waxing so discomfiting, dizzying, and unbearably unsettling in bewildering wide-breadth gap to their lilliputian frame.  The magnitude of hate words and outright rage of curses daily being unleashed on these great leaders of African continental and global renown by these over-zealous hordes of incurable anti-Yoruba Igbo haters, is not only amazing but simply unimaginable, in this civilized epoch of modernity. It is amazing that Tinubu’s innocent biological offsprings are not even spared on this celebrative savage haul of unremitting outright curses.  The same threat of searing hate words, they also unleashed on Sam Omatseye. In one of the finest pieces, ever written, the cerebral chairman, the editorial board of the NATION newspapers marshaled a forensic psychosis of primeval savage deportment of the Igbo mass behavior in the dotting voyage to electoral destiny, come 2023; as a ready revanche; ever latent in the Igbo mass sub-conscious driven by a cathartic vent of the Biafran frustration.  No, sooner had the publication greeted the public space, than all hell, literally let loose on the highly endowed writer, courtesy of the unabashed herd of bigots, putting his precious life on the hanger with all manner of threats; which in turn elicited an outcry, from the larger mass of the Omatseye clan, pleading that nothing must touch their son.  But here are the same herd of over-zealous pleasure bullies making so much fetish of their miniature political god-head, who like Napoleon, can never be wrong and therefore above any reproof, or else Amadiora the mythical god of thunder, will descend in terrimotive wrath on the accuser  It is amazing that over fifty years after the civil war, Igbos would simply refuse to let go, as they continuously let loose the subdued pang of their latent Biafran frustration and segregationist chauvinism of anti Tinubu-Soyinka-cum-Yoruba hatred expressed through their primitively effusive farrago of empty balderdash  Just because they saw Tinubu as their main obstacle to the garrison conquest of Lagos State and the totalitarian circumambience of the larger Nigerian frame. Dear Ndigbo, why embroiled in a battle you know you cannot win, with all your soaring din of loud, but ineffectual pleasure stunt of empty grandstanding? Come May 29, 2023, the great leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will surely keep faith with history.

"political assassination","1991-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Jaffna"", ""Jaffna"", ""SriLanka""}","2023-05-21T23:31:51","By N Sathiya Moorthy  The foreign ministry cannot be blamed for coming down relatively heavily on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for using the 14th anniversary of the end of the ethnic war to play to the gallery in his country. Yes, Diaspora Tamil constitutes a substantial constituency for him, yes, but to over-do the act of Canada’s traditional human rights concerns, year after year, with the same goal, does not help matters, anywhere.  But there is a difference, this time, to the customary governmental reaction to the even more customary Canadian ranting, independent of whoever is prime minister there. “Such irresponsible and polarising pronouncements by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony and hatred both in Canada and Sri Lanka, instead of promoting peace and reconciliation,” the foreign ministry statement has said, possibly for the first time, indicating a possible reaction to Trudeau’s statement nearer home in Canada itself.  If the government indicated that it could soon be picking up human rights violations in countries that are critical of Sri Lanka on this score without real consideration for possible reconciliation on the ethnic front especially, then this may only be a small beginning. After all, Canada does not figure prominently in the global human rights map as a violator, but there are others that keep being on the top of the chart, almost on a daily basis. For instance, you have Canada’s US neighbour, where indiscriminate attacks on African-Americans nearer home is matched (only?) by military attacks on nations such as Afghanistan and Iraq, about which Trudeau, for instance, has not had a word, then or now.  Does it mean that Third World nations alone are for targeting, not First World partners, because they too sail on the same boat? It is not as if Canada is bereft of HR violations, but certainly not of the domestic kind as in Sri Lanka and/or the US. When it comes to the US war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan, Canada was by its side and on the field. It will not take a group in Sri Lanka, if not the government, to flag the issue inside Canada, in the form of a statement, if not protest, everything Trudeau or whoever is in his place chooses to tick off Sri Lanka on rights violations from the past, again and again, year after year.  Fall guy, but…  Yes, Sri Lanka is the fall guy just now on the economic front. It may have diminished the government’s self-confidence to pay back others in their coin. But it does not mean that there is no other nation similarly placed in political terms but not in economic terms, for Canada, the US and the rest to pick their choice of target/victim. One day they may decide to hit back, and that could mean much more than what the US and the rest of the West may have been prepared for in political terms.  After all, the US missed out on Osama bin-Laden and his Al Qaeda when it should have stopped him – only because the nation and the leadership had conditioned themselves not to see through such a possibility. Likewise, now, for instance, the West has got used to picking its choice on the human rights front – which is the fashionable thing for them just thing, to wash off their guilt from the past, near and distant. But they do need to acknowledge that the world has changed since the Ukraine War. Or, has the Ukraine War lent momentum to what was hidden in the minds of colonised nations from the past?  As coincidence would have it, the war’s end in Sri Lanka comes days before the LTTE’s terror-killing of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi – though distanced by years. The Rajiv Gandhi assassination took place way back in 1991 whereas the Sri Lankan war ended much later in 2009.  As if to send out a message to nations like Canada and leaders like Trudeau, foreign minister Ali Sabry has tweeted his strong condemnation of the LTTE’s terror killing of Rajiv Gandhi, pointing out how the government in Colombo had eliminated the savage terrorist group. The hidden message is for the likes of Trudeau:”If you think that eliminating Osama needed doing, so did the elimination of the LTTE.”  Collateral damage  What the minister has possibly left unsaid even more is what they coolly dismiss as ‘collateral damage’, which ordinarily should have shamed the US, Canada and the rest of the West, in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it has not. But in the case of Sri Lanka, it is not collateral damage but war crimes and human rights violations. Full-stop.  This is also because the West chose to believe the number of war victims that made its post-Iraq, post-Afghan conscience relatively clear. After all, to them, it is all in percentages. In the case of Afghanistan and Iraq, collateral damage, they calculate against the global population. In Sri Lanka, they choose work it out on the basis not even necessarily against the larger national population but viz the total Tamil population, or what they assume it to be at the commencement of the war.  That is because it calms their conscience, this way and that. More so, viz the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora, they also have a domestic constituency, that keeps soothing their frayed conscience dating back to the Spanish colonial masters’ mass-killing of native American Indians and with retrospective effect, dating back to centuries, not just years – where ‘14’ for them is only a number.  None of it means that there was no collateral damage in Sri Lanka. But Trudeau and his ilk forget how the LTTE would fire from behind schools, temples and hospitals, and the armed forces would be left with no choice but to fire their heat-seeking missiles that would destroy those institutions with their inmates (whom the LTTE would often not allow to escape to safety, before starting it all).  If there is one person who was cool and cruel at the same time, it was LTTE’s Prabhakaran. He is the only one in recorded history of centuries and millennia to have used his own people as human shields, and used the most convincing way of doing it. Decades earlier, he had begun by vowing to take care of the parents and family members of his fallen foot soldiers, as if they were his own family. They were his human-shields.  If the West knew of Prabhakaran’s motives even then, they conveniently overlooked it. If they did not with their greater exposure to war and violence across the world and through centuries, then they could not expect the much less exposed Sri Lankan government and troops to divine it, to avoid all those collateral damage.  Sophisticated ploy  So, when it came to the army encircling the LTTE in Jaffna town in the mid-nineties, they caused the townspeople to empty the place, threatening them with mass killing, mass rape and worse. But it was Prabhakaran’s sophisticated ploy of creating a human shield around himself, for his personal safety – and make the world too believe that the Sri Lanka armed forces were crude and savage, and admiring his tact and command over the innocent Tamil people, who had always thought they (alone) were god’s very own gift to Sri Lanka.  Then came Mullivaikkal, the last venue of the LTTE war, to which PM Trudeau too remembers to recall 14 long years later. To Mullivaikkal, Prabhakaran moved with around 300,000 residents of Kilinochchi town and other villages his armed men passed through on their way to the one place, Prabhakaran had hoped to escape, yes, in a western ship, with possible western naval and air cover.  Overnight, the killer of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Rajiv Gandhi and hundreds of others targeted as LTTE’s victims in pre-planned assassinations, had become worthy of the West’s indulgences – and no Trudeau was there to tell the American partner and neighbour that it was not on. Yet, it was the Sri Lankan armed forces that brought back close to 300,000 Tamil civilians out of LTTE’s captivity, which history Trudeau has either not cared to know or has cared to ignore, 14 years hence.  Then what needed to happen, happened, and there are no details in the hands of the West, or the INGOs they fund, as to the number of old and lame ‘human shields’ that Prabhakaran had collected around him over years and decades, who ether did not want another lease of life or were not allowed to go. After all, as reports went, the LTTE cadres were shooting all those who wanted to escape from Mullivaikkal, yes, but were not allowed to in the initial phases — until the Prabhakaran leadership faced the revolt and let them go.  It looks as if PM Trudeau has not been briefed about the way the Sri Lankan soldiers helped all those 300,000 innocent Tamils, by whom all he came across in his country and who had lamented over the death of their loved ones at the hand of the armed forces at Mullivaikkkal and elsewhere. Not just that. The government and the armed forces had set up temporary camps beforehand for those they hoped to free from the LTTE’s clutches. The West was muted in its appreciation of the army’s achievement in all these. Instead, they called those IDP camps as ‘concentration camps’ and worse.  Thereby hangs a tale of prejudice and consequent pre-suppositions. Amen!  (The writer is a policy analyst & political commentator, based in Chennai, India.

"political assassination","1966-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Ibadan"", ""Oyo"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-21T07:11:14","Turbulent anger of Obidients landed on Lamidi Apapa last week. By the time their anger petered out, Apapa had lost his cap to a God-knows-who. Esu Elegbara, the trickster deity of the Yoruba people, it will seem, lives in caps. Though most of the exploits of Esu exist in myths, Yoruba constructed a pantheon of beliefs that implicate the Esu as divisive and full of tricks. One of such, sauced in mythology, was translated into a very sobering track by ace Yoruba Awurebe musician, Alhaji Dauda Akanmu Adeeyo, popularly known as Dauda Epo Akara. Famous for his anecdotal offerings affixed to virtually all his songs, Adeeyo got this sobriquet, for which he was more known by than his actual name, while he was a pupil in primary school. His uniforms were always soaked in bean cake oil called Epo Akara.  The Ibadan maestro entitled the track under reference Itan Ore Meji – the tale of two friends – in a parent album he called My Mother. Like Epo Akara, in 1987, Donald Cosentino, a lecturer in the Folklore and Mythology Programme of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote an article for The Journal of American Folklorewhich heentitled Who Is That Fellow in the Many-Colored Cap? Transformations of Eshu in Old and New World Mythologies (Vol. 100, No. 397. Jul. – Sep., 1987). In it, he also situated the Esu as author of dissent, “an exponent of ceaseless rearrangements” and a dissembler. Esu, said Cosentino, is a counterpart to Ifa, who the Yoruba see as the Lord of Divination and through whom sacrifices and propitiations are made to God for peace in the world.  Advertisement  Epo Akara and Cosentino’s narratives are not dissimilar. The two of them began this folklore thus: There existed two friends who were so fond of each other and inseparable. They were objects of discussions by the whole village. In fact, sang Epo Akara, won ki ja, won kii ta – they never had a word of disagreement since they began their friendship from their infancy. So, one day, Esu swore to cause irreparable discord between them. The object he cast for that dissention was a cap. So the Esu sowed a multicolored cap, something in the mould of Dolly Parton’s coat of many colours. The colours, says Cosentino, have been “variously described as red and white; red, white and blue; or red, white, green, and black.”  Epo Akara, however, put the colours of the cap as white and black. So the Esu transformed himself into an irresistibly dressed, handsome young man in dainty Aso Oke and Sanyan cap. As the two friends sat in a foyer chattering, Esu walked between them and in the words of Cosentino, “put his pipe at the nape of his neck and hung his staff over his back.” As Esu walked past the two friends, in the rendering of the Awurebe musician, the first friend called the attention of his pal to the cap, which he said was black. Once he had money, the friend remarked, it would be his delight to buy it – bi mo ri’ru e, ma ra’kan, Balarabi, Wali Muhanmonda. The friend fired back, insisting that the cap was white and insulted the other friend by asking if he was blind – ab’oju re o ri’ran? Then, a very deadly brawl ensued between the duo as they came to blows.  Advertisement  While Epo Akara insisted that, having achieved his dissembling aim, Esu transformed himself into who he was and settled the quarrel, Consentino argued that the tiff came to a halt when the disputants were brought to court. In court, the scholar said, Esu confessed to his trick, boasting that “sowing dissension is my great delight.” In the rendering of the Folklore and Mythology scholar, Esu then fled. As he fled, Esu lit fire along the way, mixing up all the possessions of fleeing townsfolk. He also tested and exposed friendships along the way, thereby creating and destroying wealth. He then laughed at the ignorance of the people about his innate destructive nature.  Nigeria’s Labour Party, (LP) it will seem, is where Esu Elegbara has made his temporary home now. Last week, the party’s internal tiff reached a cancerous level at the Presidential Election Petition Court in Abuja. In the glare of the whole world, the timely intervention of police officers prevented miffed supporters of Peter Obi from skewering the flesh of the party’s Acting National Chairman, Apapa. Apapa and Julius Abure, hitherto suspended national chairman of the party, were embroiled in a leadership tussle. This led to blood-baiting hounds, suspected to be sympathetic to the Abure faction of the party, pouncing on Apapa. The wolves had prevented Apapa from addressing the press and shoved him dangerously off television cameras. In the process, one of them took off Apapa’s cap. He later took possession of it.  Advertisement  Speaking at a press conference after the attack, the 73-year old Apapa rained curses on the person who removed his cap. He had said: “My cap is here as you can see it. It was not burnt, and the boy who removed my cap will suffer it in his life. I saw him, he’s a young chap. He’ll never grow old by God’s grace. He deserves it, you know why? I didn’t use cutlass on him.”  Were Apapa’s curses of Janus colour and texture as that of Adedara Arunralojaoba, Ijesaland’s – domiciled in Osun State – most evocative musician who sang Adamo music during his lifetime? Janus, you know, is the Egyptian binary god with two faces. Some installments away, I narrated this Adamo musician’s encounter with another musician, Ayinla Omowura, in Ilesa in the 1970s. Omowura’s drums began to get torn in subsequence as he set out to sing at a live gig where he and Adedara had been invited. In the words of Arunralojaoba, on arriving the bandstand to take over the evening belt of entertainment of invited audience, Omowura had been drunk to stupor with his assumed musical superiority. Speaking to Dele Adeyanju, a renowned broadcaster, in an interview, the Adamo musician had attributed the torn drums to God fighting his battle for him and not any traditional African spiritual attack. Adedara was known to have at one time been a member of the Ogboni fraternity. So, were the torn drums God’s own way of fighting for Adedara against his adversary, or the scenario was a product of metaphysical invocation?  Advertisement  The removal of Apapa’s cap reminds me of the same violence and indignity suffered by Chief Bola Ige, ex-governor of old Oyo State, in the hands of sponsored miscreants like those hooligans in the LP. It was at the height of the intra-party sabre-rattling of the Alliance for Democracy (AD). At a ceremony held on Saturday December 15, 2001 where Olusegun Obasanjo’s late wife, Stella, was conferred with a chieftaincy title by the Ooni of Ife, wolves suspected to be in the herd of Iyiola Omisore, erstwhile Deputy Governor of Osun State, pounced on Ige in similar cavalier but blood-baiting manner Apapa was to witness almost 22 years after. They seized the cap of the man, known as Arole Awolowo – Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s heir – caps which, unlike Apapa’s, he was never to set eyes upon again.  Five days before this, an attempt to impeach Omisore was held at the Osun State House of Assembly. Odunayo Olagbaju, believed to be one of Omisore’s Rottweilers, was at the forefront of the disruption of the impeachment proceedings. Allegations were rife that Olagbaju was also the coordinator of the violent seizure of Ige’s cap. Four days after the attack on Ige, Olagbaju was mysteriously assassinated in Ile-Ife. Exactly four days after Olagbaju’s assassination, Ige was also taken out in what appeared like cult-like revenge killings. Today, Omisore is Southwest progressives’ highest-ranking national official, representing the Yorubaland which venerated Ige as an avatar.  Advertisement  Beyond their ethno-cultural implications as significant aspect of dressing and fashion, caps also have mythic qualities among the Yoruba especially. Aside caps’ aesthetic and symbolic elaboration of the body, they are also seen as weapon in the hands of Esu. The cap perhaps gained that relevance due to the renowned place that the head has in African epistemology. The head receives special aesthetic attention as a result of its spiritual and biological importance. Among the Yoruba, the head, called Ori, is a site of spiritual intuition and destiny. It is as well a harbinger of a man’s reflective spark of human consciousness. It is an Orisa, or god, of its own and is not only venerated but worshipped. To acquire a balanced character – iwa-pele – the Yoruba believe that the individual, working in tandem with this Orisa, can achieve this desirable personality. When he does, the individual then receives an alignment with his Ori, the divine self. People whose destinies are skewed are advised to worship their Ori whose variant among the Igbo is chi. So, when a cap, the decorative ornament of the head, is rudely removed as was done to Ige and Apapa, Yoruba see it as bad omen, symbolizing a rude yank-off of the human person.  Immediately after the seizure of Ige’s cap, some knowledgeable elders in sorcery and witchcraft opined that there existed causality between the cap’s removal and his eventual killing. For a people who use metaphysics as human agency to explain what the common eyes cannot penetrate, when Ige eventually died, the narrative of the connect between the removed cap and his death took front burner. So, in the seizure of Apapa’s cap, was Esu Elegbara on the usual roller-coaster of his famous trickster prowess, or does the act just symbolize a fatality to either Apapa, the Labour Party or the boy who bit the bullet by removing the cap?  Advertisement  The chief accusation against Apapa is that he is the Esu Elegbara in the Labour Party who this destructive god lent his heart for a fee. As Epo Akara and Cosentino narrated in their works, could Apapa be the modern or Nigeria’s political party version of the trickster deity, who is sowing dissention in the party? Ask those who are ranged against him to explain why, they will tell you that Apapa has received humongous bribe from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to act as the Judas within the party. On an Arise television interview last week, Apapa asked those who leveled such allegations to provide evidence. Again, in his insular trickery, I saw Esu Elegbara laughing rambunctiously. Do those who give bribes leave traces? Should those who also leveled such allegation against this old man sincerely do this without providing evidence? Are they themselves the Esu, being on the payroll of Abure, to ensure that Apapa is fought to a standstill?  Precedent is however on the side of those who accuse Apapa of acting the script of the APC. Nigerian politics is so enmeshed in indignity and amorality that virtually all those who engage in it possess scarred souls like the devil’s. They even tell you that politics and morality are in perpetual enmity. If you observe, the highest fusillade of attacks, both judicial and verbal, from the APC to any party, is towards the Labour Party. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its commissars receive scant attention of that party. It must believe that that party is already mortally wounded. APC, peopled by a commune of scavengers, vultures and deadly hit-men, will logically rent an Apapa for a dissembling assignment. It is because the If I must hanker a guess, it must be because the LP poses the greatest social threat to the legitimacy that APC needs, not necessarily during the current judicial process but after it. Thus, employing an Esu Elegbara within the fold of the LP for this dirty job is a politically wise decision for a party whose men, in the name of politics, will kill their mother and rope their father for the murder without batting an eyelid.  Advertisement  Esu Elegbara seems to be on the trail of the Labour Party and is not relenting yet. At the tail end of last week, until the clarification given by the court, the Federal High Court in Kano was reported to have declared the votes polled by the Abia State governor-elect, Alex Otti, Labour Party’s only state governor in the last general election, as wasted. It however reportedly refrained from nullifying the certificate of return issued by INEC to the governor-elect. A newspaper later on published the clarification of the court, stating that it denied annulling the election of the governor-elect.  If you think it is only in LP that Esu Elegbara wrecks its havocs, you are mistaken. In the PDP, he began his life-sworn disruption and destruction, as they say, as a pre-election cancer. By the time Atiku Abubakar and his party realized that Esu was in cahoots with the party, Elegbara had destroyed all the cells within the body of the party, finally and permanently retiring the Adamawa-born politician from his serial quest for the Nigerian presidency.  Advertisement  Elegbara, it will seem, is on his way to the APC as we speak. From reports, the party is on its way to a political liaison with Musa Rabiu Kwankwaso, New Nigerian People’s Party (NPP’s) presidential candidate. President-elect, Bola Tinubu, was reported to have met the NPP boss for political talks in Paris last Monday. There is the need for enough senators to complete the circus of a pliable National Assembly. I imagine the mind of Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Kano State governor, at the moment. The Nigerian politician, in pursuing his persuasion that politics and morality are not friends, devised what is labeled a “no permanent friends, no permanent foes” lexicographic feature of politics. But, must politicians be indistinguishable from serial adulterers? Esu Elegbara must be somewhere now, devising his next trickery. Will he wear Ganduje like an apparel?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9waW5pb25uaWdlcmlhLmNvbS9sYW1pZGktYXBhcGFzLW1pc3NpbmctY2FwLWJ5LWZlc3R1cy1hZGVkYXlvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1978-08-01","Not Discerned","{""Nairobi"", ""Nairobi"", ""Kenya""}","2023-05-21T17:44:26","Mark Mwithaga greets Mzee Jomo Kenyatta as Moi and JM Kariuki, among others, look on. [File, Standard]  The warning shots have been fired. Some Kenyans are angry and want their representatives in Parliament (Senate and National Assembly) to reject some of the proposed taxes in the Finance Bill 2023, which they fear will make their lives unbearable.  The MPs have been warned of dire consequences should they not undertake this mandate.  Such has been the trend since the introduction of a parliamentary system of government in 1907 when a gang of six civil servants and two white wananchi met in a mabati building along Haile Selassie Avenue, then known as Whitehouse Road.  This marked the beginning of leaders debating the fate of the nation. Since then, Kenya’s history has been replete with cases of uncooperative elected leaders being cut to size for disappointing their voters.  One of the severest blows to the elected leader was meted out by the voters in 1974 when 60 per cent of all the MPs who had served in the third parliament never made it back.  So unforgiving were the voters that when the elections were held on October 14, 1974, 83 MPs out of 153 were voted out. Out of these were four cabinet ministers. Ironically, four politicians who had successfully petitioned and caused the nullification of results in their constituencies were nevertheless rejected by the electorate.  The winners of this election were however to experience more grief.  After the shock caused by the assassination of JM Kariuki, a number of his friends also lost their seats after they were either detained or imprisoned after conviction.  Some of the most recognisable outspoken MPs who condemned JM's assassination and were detained included Jean Marie Seroney, Martin Shikuku, George Anyona, Mark Mwithaga and Chelagat Mutai.  Others who lost their seats after they were convicted were George Muhuri Muchiri, and Mwangi Gachago, while Kabeere M'mbijiwe and Anarita Karimi Njeru, lost their seats following election petitions.  Paul Ngei miraculously escaped even after he was found guilty of a criminal offence and technically knocked out of the general elections. The biggest shock however was the death of Jomo Kenyatta in August 1978, which altered the country’s political landscape and ended the careers of some of his close buddies.  Despite all the tribulations they faced, the MPs were quite active as they generated 3,980 questions, with a further 604 queries filed by members in their private capacity.  The Parliament etched its mark in history after it amended the constitution for a record five times. It is remembered for altering the supreme law to empower the president to pardon a convict to contest elections.  The MPs later undid this amendment as soon Paul Ngei was elected. Perhaps because of the fiery and lively debate that lit up Parliament, 160,000 visitors, the majority of them students visited its precincts even as the government pushed through 107 bills and lost only two.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW5kYXJkbWVkaWEuY28ua2UvbmF0aW9uYWwvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDAxNDczNDIzL2hvdy12b3RlcnMtZGlzY292ZXJlZC10aGUtcG93ZXItb2YtcHVuaXNoaW5nLWluZXB0LW1wc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2006-09-12","10:30:00","{""Dili"", ""Dili"", ""EastTimor""}","2023-05-21T22:11:44","ANALYSIS: By Melissa Conley Tyler, The University of Melbourne and Andrea Fahey, Australian National University  Today is election day in Timor-Leste, when voters are deciding on 65 members of Parliament to represent them.  Each election is a reminder of the successful regional and international cooperation that led to Timor-Leste’s independence. It is also a reminder of the importance of Timor-Leste as an exemplar of democracy, peace and human rights as foundational values.  It is in Australia’s interest that this be nurtured.  As a small state facing many challenges, maintaining these values has regional and global resonance.  Timor-Leste is an important voice both in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is a successful state that, despite difficulties, has been able to be peace-loving and sustain relations with Indonesia.  By contrast, democratic regression, or the worst-case scenario of a failed state, would be an enormous setback for the entire region.  What role should Australia play in keeping this democracy strong?  Complicated relationship  The history of the Australia-Timor-Leste bilateral relationship is complicated. It includes the vital Timorese assistance during World War II and Australia’s tacit approval of Indonesia’s 1975 annexation.  It also includes Australia leading the UN International Force East Timor (INTERFET), which in turn led to Timor-Leste’s transition to independence following a referendum in 1999.  The two nations have been complexly intertwined through Timor-Leste’s journey to independence and democratic development.  There have been instances of unease between the two countries. The most notable was the allegation of Australian spying during negotiations on the Greater Sunrise oil fields. This remains an ongoing issue with the potential to derail ties again.  But there have also been positive steps, such as Operation Astute, an Australian-led military and police deployment. This operation helped stabilise the country during the 2006-2008 political turmoil that culminated in the attempted assassination of President Jose Ramos-Horta and his medical evacuation.  In 2018, Australia and Timor-Leste concluded a treaty establishing their maritime boundaries following a United Nations conciliation process.  The complexity of the relationship means Australia needs to be respectful in relations, but it should not stop Australia from being a partner to support Timor-Leste’s democratic processes and institutions.  Supporting governance  A recent report outlines how Australia can support Timor-Leste’s governance in ways that ensure effective, capable and legitimate institutions that are responsive to people.  Australia has a track record of such programs. The eight-year, $72 million Governance for Development Programme supported Timor-Leste agencies to develop good policy and improve systems as well as helping civil society engage with government decision-making.  The programme worked in areas including public financial management, economic policy, enabling business, public service administration, law reform and financial services.  The Partnership for Inclusive Prosperity (PROVISU) will continue to support good governance and economic policy by providing support to Timor-Leste’s central government agencies and economic ministries. Through programmes like this, Australia can offer meaningful support to Timor-Leste.  Good governance that responds to citizens’ needs is a perennial problem. Timor-Leste’s nascent bureaucracy makes this a priority issue. Australia should continue to develop partnerships that strengthen institutions so they are able to deal with problems.  An example of this is PARTISIPA, a ten-year $80 million programme to improve access to quality basic infrastructure and services. It works in partnership with national and subnational governments to improve the delivery of decentralised services and village-level infrastructure, such as rural water. It continues Australia’s long-term support for the national village development programme and its community-driven processes.  Another area where Australia can contribute is in media.  Vibrant media  Timor-Leste has a vibrant media landscape that is among the freest in the region. Australian can support Timor-Leste to ensure its media are strong and robust as well as free, with public interest is at its core.  It can also work with local media to strengthen their ability to educate the general public on governance issues, to hold power to account and to promote the rule of law.  An example of this is a recent memorandum of understanding between the ABC and Timor-Leste’s public broadcaster RTTL, which includes media development programmes. The agreement recognises the vital role both organisations play in informing audiences and contributing to democracy.  The ABC will work with RTTL to establish a new English-language news service, helping staff enhance their journalism and content-making skills.  Another priority Australia can engage with is the justice system.  Consultations with Timorese civil society organisations, conducted by the Asia Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D) report, revealed a particular concern about rebuilding trust in the judicial system. It is an area with which Australia has not been greatly involved compared to Portugal.  Australia should also engage with Timorese political parties, recognising the important structural role they play in governance. This can complement continued engagement with formal government institutions and the national parliament.  Promotion of human rights  Australia should continue to invest in the protection and promotion of human rights.  Finally, Australia should be a partner for youth civic and political engagement, given the reality of a future political transition from independence leaders to younger generations.  Timor-Leste today lives with a legacy of conflict, which has far-reaching implications. There is significant pressure on government to meet the needs and expectations of the Timorese people. Australia can be a partner to support these goals.  By helping to build a stronger, resilient and prosperous Timor-Leste, Australia is investing in a more secure and stable immediate neighbourhood, which will reap mutual benefits.

"political assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T20:50:19","25 years ago: Pakistan detonates nuclear device  On May 28, 1998, Pakistan detonated a nuclear device. South Asia had been brought to the brink of a fourth Indo-Pakistani war, as India had also run nuclear weapons testing in the previous weeks. In justifying its staging of a nuclear test, Pakistan charged that India was about to launch an air strike on its nuclear test site. India vigorously denied this charge, but in the days preceding the Pakistani test, leading Indian government officials repeatedly warned that Indian troops might soon cross into Pakistani-occupied Kashmir.  Nawaz Sharif in 2013  Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif employed apocalyptic language in his May 28 televised address announcing the nuclear tests. “Today, we have settled the score with India,” he declared. “Today the nuclear flames of the nuclear fire are all over. I am thankful to God that ... we have jumped into these flames....' Subsequently, Pakistan raised the ante by announcing that its Gauri missiles would soon be armed with nuclear warheads.  Fearing a run on the banks, the Sharif government ordered them closed Friday, May 29, then announced an indefinite freeze on withdrawing foreign currency from foreign denomination accounts. As Pakistan had only $1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, equal to about six weeks' worth of imports, there were fears that Pakistan would default on $800 million in interest payments the next month.  Both India’s Hindu-supremacist BJP government and Sharif’s Islamist regime used the threat of war to attack democratic rights. Within hours of the nuclear test announcement, Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar declared a state of emergency, suspending the constitution and civil rights. For its part, the BJP government in India labeled all opponents of its aggressive stance against Pakistan as “disloyal.”  The more the ruling cliques in New Delhi and Islamabad exchanged threats, brandished nuclear devices, missiles and other weapons of mass destruction, and made appeals for “national unity,” the more apparent it became that they were on a common trajectory. The national bourgeoisie of each country used chauvinism and militarism to divert attention from their own reactionary socioeconomic policies and to channel mounting social anxiety and frustration in a reactionary direction.  50 years ago: Attempting to save face, Nixon admits to Watergate cover-up  On May 22, 1973, United States President Richard Nixon conceded for the first time that high ranking members of his administration had taken part in the Watergate break-ins of the Democratic National Convention and the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist. The admission came one week after the public US Senate investigation began making details of the scandal public.  In a written White House statement delivered to the press by White House press secretary Ronald Ziegler, Nixon admitted that “it is clear that unethical, as well as illegal, activities took place” and that there was an attempt to cover-up the Watergate spying plot. Nixon also admitted that his administration had put into action covert spying operations against American citizens, claiming “national security” threats. He also admitted that in the aftermath of Ellsberg’s release of the Pentagon Papers the White House had created the secret intelligence group “the plumbers” to stop other government secrets from being exposed.  The admission was a sharp turn from previous statements that acknowledged no wrongdoing on behalf of the White House. Yet Nixon still maintained that he had no knowledge of the illegal actions. “It now appears that there were persons who may have gone beyond my directives and sought to expand on my efforts to protect the national security operations in order to cover up any involvement they or certain others might have had in Watergate,” the president claimed. Making clear he had no intention of resigning Nixon added in an additional statement that, “I will not abandon my responsibilities. I will continue to do the job I was elected to do.”  The Nixon administration had claimed the legally dubious right to “executive privilege” which was preventing most of the top figures in his administration from testifying. Still, the testimony that had been provided so far by lower level officials was painting a damning picture.  Jack Caulfield, official in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, testified before the Senate in the Watergate hearings on May 22, 1973  The same day that Nixon admitted to the cover-up, John J. Caulfield, a official in the Bureau of Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, testified that John W. Dean, former White House Counsel, and John W. Ehrlichman, former White House Domestic Affairs Advisor, had ordered him to offer James McCord, one of the Watergate burglars, a pardon if he stayed silent and refused to give evidence implicating other White House officials in the crime.  With these revelations now made public, Nixon was forced to admit as much as the testimonies revealed. However, he was careful to say no more than that and remained vague on the details involving his own role in the plot. To that point, none of the testimony had directly implicated Nixon in the conspiracy. Caulfield, for example, told the Senate that he had “no knowledge of my own” that Nixon had approved or known about the pardon offer to McCord.  75 years ago: GM agrees to wage increase and cost-of-living allowance  On May 25, 1948, General Motors (GM) announced that it had struck a new contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, providing for an eleven cent an hour wage increase. The deal, hailed by the UAW officialdom as a victory, was made under threat of a strike that would have involved 225,000 autoworkers.  Most notably, the GM contract was the first major union agreement in the United States with an automatic wage allowance based on changes to the cost-of-living (COLA, or cost of living adjustment). It provided for pay increases pegged to inflation, adjusted every three months based on figures provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Autoworkers during the 1945-46 strike against General Motors at the 36th Street plant in Wyoming, Mich.  The Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the American Trotskyist organization, noted the shift marked by the deal. For many years, the Trotskyists had called for a sliding scale of wages, linking pay to the costs faced by workers. The union bureaucrats, including in the UAW, had opposed the demand.  The UAW-GM deal, however, contained only a small real wage increase and no improvements to conditions, with an effective management dictatorship remaining in place. As the SWP noted, “the UAW leaders have accepted the sliding scale program not as a fortification of, but as a substitute for the needed increase in real basic wages, welfare benefits and grievance improvements.”  The GM contract was approved amid a series of sell-outs by the union bureaucracy, with protracted disputes ended for relatively limited wage increases. On May 21, a 67-day strike of CIO United Packinghouse Workers was called off after all but one of the major companies agreed to a nine cent an hour raise. On May 28, the UAW called off a 13-day walkout by Chrysler autoworkers, who received a thirteen cents an hour raise.  In the immediate post-war years, American capitalism had been rocked by a massive upsurge of industrial struggle. Major strikes took place in all of the key industries, as workers fought back against the consequences of wartime wage freezes and post-war cuts, amid a substantial increase to inflation. GM and the other car companies were hit by protracted stoppages. The unions, including the UAW, had done everything possible to prevent the strikes from coalescing into a political movement of the entire working class against the profit system.  By mid-1948, there were signs of a stabilization of American and world capitalism, based above all on the betrayals of the post-war upsurge by the Stalinists. The US was increasingly asserting its global hegemony, including through aggressive Cold War policies directed against the Soviet Union. GM and the other car companies would expand their operations internationally. Under these conditions, more far-sighted sections of the ruling elite considered limited concessions the necessary price to pay for industrial peace aimed at advancing the broader interests of American imperialism.  100 years ago: Mass strikes in Germany’s Ruhr Valley  A German communist propaganda poster from 1921. The slogan at the top is “ Workers! Women workers! Which way do you want to go? To the Social Democracy or to the Communist Party?”  On May 26, 1923, over 300,000 workers were on strike in the French-occupied Ruhr Valley, the industrial heartland of Germany.  A strike wave in the region had begun earlier in the week with explosive force. Workers set up strike committees and councils under the influence of the Communist Party (KPD). In the city of Gelsenkirchen, strikers closed over 30 plants and factories and raided warehouses for foodstuffs. Strikers there set up their own police force. In Bochum strikers shut down pro-government newspapers.  The German authorities in the Ruhr Valley asked the French command for permission to send in special armed police. One official in Düsseldorf wrote to the French military: “I take the liberty of recalling in this connection that at the time of the Paris Commune [during the German occupation of Paris in 1871], the German Command did all it could to meet the needs of the French authorities taking repressive action.”  The French, who had held off from interfering with the strikes, obliged. Over 15 people were killed in the next few days in violence between strikers and police. By May 27, civil war conditions were developing. The New York Times wrote of a “bourgeois counter-revolutionary movement” emerging in Bochum, where a KPD meeting was dispersed by police and bourgeois volunteers. Strikers retaliated, however, that evening, by surrounding the Fire Department barracks where the counter-revolutionaries were quartered.  The immediate cause was hyperinflation. On May 22, the German mark crashed to an exchange rate of 57,000 to one dollar. The price of bread increased 100 percent overnight, and the government increased trolley fares by a third.  Workers had opposed both the employers and the French troops who had occupied the Ruhr Valley in January to enforce Germany’s payment of war reparations. But now a revolutionary situation was emerging there and in the rest of Germany. Dresden, in Saxony in the east of Germany, also saw mass protests. There the League of the Unemployed closed stores in hopes of putting pressure on wholesalers to reduce prices.  The historian Pierre Broue´ describes the temper of the times. After the assassination in Switzerland of the old Bolshevik and Soviet diplomat V.V. Vorovsky, he writes:  “On 13 May, the KPD attracted around 100,000 demonstrators in Berlin to protest against the assassination and the plans to attack Russia. On 16 May, more than 150,000 people encircled the coffin of Vorovsky, which was en route to Moscow, in a gigantic torch-lit demonstration, about which Victor Serge was later to write that it ‘marked the opening of the period of revolutionary mobilization.’”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvdW90Yy1tMjEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T00:59:28","The concept of hybrid warfare encompasses use of all means available to a state to subdue its adversary and achieve strategic goals without the ostensible use of available kinetic force.  It may include subversion, deepfake videos, terror attacks, cyber aggression, economic coercion, exploitation of sectarian, linguistic and ethnic fault lines, disinformation warfare, and financial and diplomatic support to political opposition parties to paralyze a sitting government and break the country from within without any direct foreign physical aggression.  Hybrid wars envisage the use of all elements of national power including foreign electoral interventions through the internet as seen in the 2016 American elections. Besides this, in April 2018, foreign news outlets ‘The Guardian’ and ‘The New York Times’ broke a story of a UK-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica which unethically expanded potential voters of some political leaders while illegally using over 87 million Facebook profiles.  Such a negative use of social media to promote or downgrade political leaders through artificial intelligence aims at disrupting the functionality of a state to render it ungovernable without declaring an all-out war, which is being done against Pakistan. It is also worth noting that the concept of hybrid warfare is not new and can be traced back to thousand years ago when the celebrated Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu said in his book ‘The Art of War’: “To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.”  The current unfortunate state of Pakistan implies that we as a nation have unfortunately – advertently or inadvertently – become a victim of hybrid warfare. Let us first take a look at external manoeuvres aimed at our economic strangulation. Taking advantage of both our flawed economic policies that remain unchanged for many decades and the resultant economic vulnerabilities, the IMF is further aggravating the situation as an instrument of hybrid war.  This can be explained in the words of Joseph Stieglitz – a Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences – who says, “The IMF and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) are tools for economic coercion against vulnerable states”. To support his argument, he quotes the example of the East Asian financial crisis of 1997.  The FATF is another instrument used for the said purpose. Pakistan was kept in the grey list even when it had worked on 26 out of the 27 observations raised. In 2021, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar explicitly said that the BJP government led by Narendra Modi ensured that Pakistan remained on the grey list.  Also, Pakistan’s flagship project ‘CPEC’ – which is an essential concept for our economic revival – has been declared a red line by Indo-US lobbies, and all external pressures are being exerted for sabotaging it. Similarly, the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project – the most pivotal for our crucial energy needs – is being resisted tooth and nail. To use terrorism as an instrument of hybrid war, unrelenting TTP attacks are being supported – both financially and politically.  Cyber warfare is yet another dimension of hybrid war, and our adversaries are missing no opportunity to use it against us. In this Information Age, social media is full of disinformation. Extremely venomous propaganda, deepfakes and character assassination of our politico-military and judicial leadership are extremely lethal instruments of hybrid war, which are being used against our national unity and coherence.  The most dangerous dimension of this onslaught is however the dirty propaganda being made against members of our armed forces to pollute public minds. To thwart these evil trends, we must first of all focus on the biggest problem – the current acute political polarization created by some leaders who are hell bent to retain or reach out to power corridors at all cost through hook or crook.  Political differences have been transformed into personal enmities. The police and law-enforcement agencies are being targeted by the ‘misguided cult’. State installations, radio stations, cultural centres, historic forts and commercial show rooms are not only being attacked but also looted with impunity.  The judiciary, unfortunately, became controversial when its decision led to the de-seating of 25 MPs. This verdict, given by our honourable courts, wrote a black chapter in our already polluted judicial history which turned the tables and created political turmoil, which is worsening with every passing day. The situation further compounded when the chief justice of Pakistan took a suo-motu notice on the political issue of holding elections in the country.  And as things began to unfold, parliament was made ineffective and the sacred institution of our defence forces was made controversial. The way forward is political dialogue to conduct general elections across the country on a mutually agreed date according to the spirit of the constitution.  Exemplary punishments should be announced for planners, instigators, abettors and perpetrators who took the law in their hands and attacked state assets. The superior judiciary also needs to look inward and ensure that justice is free from bias.  Political leaders across the board must refrain from using derogatory language against the judicial and military leadership and must abide by parliamentary ethics. The PDM government may ensure that law-enforcement agencies remain professionally potent but not allow the use of excessive force, which brings a bad name to the government and the country.

"political assassination","2023-08-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T02:00:00","Ford isn’t just one of the biggest automobile manufacturers in the world, it’s also one of the oldest and arguably one of the most influential.  The American carmaker sold a total of 24,710 units in the country in 2022, an increase of 22 percent from the previous year and good enough for third place in the ranking for bestselling car brands in the country last year.  Car guys would know that Ford has had a long and proud history in the Philippines, and, for a time, even operated several production and assembly facilities right here. But why exactly are there no more Ford plants in the country?  ALSO READ  24 Rare Photos of the Early Car Industry in the Philippines  History of Ford in the Philippines  Before we tackle Ford’s exit from the Philippines, we first need to know about its entry. Ford, of course, is known for helping revolutionize the car industry after its founder, Henry Ford, introduced the moving assembly line for the mass production of automobiles in 1913. Just five years later, in 1918, Ford entered the Philippine market through the Ford Motor Company of the Philippines, Inc. (FMCP), which operated as an importer and distributor of Ford vehicles.  By May 1968, Ford had officially opened a local automotive assembly plant: measuring 182,000 square feet inside an 11-hectare piece of land in Muntinlupa. This plant assembled models such as the British Cortina, the German Taurus, and the U.S. Galaxie.  The plant was equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and technology “to meet the highest standards of vehicle quality required by Ford research and testing.”  ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW  “More eloquent than any testimonial, Ford Motor Company's optimism for the Philippine economy is manifested in its multimillion-peso investment in its latest subsidiary, Ford Philippines, Inc..” said Henry Ford II, chairman of the board of Ford Motor Company in a message to celebrate the opening. “The installation of the Ford insignia at our new assembly plant in Greater Manila is symbolic of our confidence in the continuing development of the country's economy. We are therefore grateful for this opportunity to contribute to Philippine progress and it is our earnest hope that Ford Philippines, Inc. will be received with the same good faith with which we have come to the Filipino people.”  Then-President Ferdinand Marcos also sent in a message, which was delivered by his Industry Undersecretary Cesar Virata. “The opening of the automotive assembly plant of Ford Philippines, Inc. here is one more demonstration of the increasing capabilities of Filipino craftsmen and technicians, a manifestation that bids well to buoy our hopes for the eventual industrialization of our country,” President Marcos said. “On the company's part, it is an expression of confidence in the economic stability of this country and in the future of the Republic. This investment adds substance and sinews to our resources, which we must continually replenish and invigorate in order that we may attain all our goals of development. My warmest congratulations to Ford Philippines, and I hope that its venture in this field will enjoy every success.”  Of the plant’s 450 employees, nearly 100 percent were Filipinos.  CONTINUE READING BELOW watch now  Ford Facility in Bataan  In the late 1960s, the administration of then-President Marcos was inspired by the success of Taiwan’s Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone in attracting foreign investments and generating employment for its citizens. And so the government formally established a Free Trade Zone in Mariveles, Bataan. The area was eventually renamed to the Bataan Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in 1972, and it commenced operations one year later, 1973.  What attracted companies to set up shop in the EPZ were the numerous incentives, both fiscal and non-fiscal. For instance, companies who were registered there were exempt from paying customs duties on raw materials, semi-processed inputs, and even capital equipment. They were essentially exempt from all regulations applying to imports, as well from paying all export taxes, among many other incentives.  One of the firms that opened in the EPZ was Ford, which, in 1973, broke ground on a body stamping plant at the cost of P257 million. The Washington Post, in an article dated August 1, 1978, noted that the timing of the Ford plant was “fortuitous” as it came just a year after President Marcos imposed Martial Law in the country and that he was under pressure to prove that his iron hand was bearing fruit in terms of large-scale business investments.  In fact, one other reason for Ford’s presence in the country then was the Marcos administration’s Progressive Car Manufacturing Program of the Philippines, an initiative which “sought to encourage the assembly of the vehicles in the country with the use of imported completely knocked down (CKD) kits.” At the time, General Motors was also in the midst of constructing a P137 million transmission plant in Muntinlupa, as was Delta Motors, which had just completed an engine block plant.  ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW  In 1981, the Ford Philippines stamping plant represented an investment of around $35 million and was the third largest investment in the EPZ. Body parts for the Ford Cortina and the Grenada were stamped in the facility. It's worth noting though that the stamping plant itself was officially listed as a Canadian investment, perhaps due to the fact that a subsidiary was named as the owner rather than the American parent company.  There is not much data on how the body stamping plant was performing financially in its early years; however, the Washington Post story said that the plant reported losing $17 million by 1977. Thankfully, a year later, by 1978, the plant reported a turnaround—profit of $1.1 million against sales of $10.2 million.  First shutdown and reopening  However, five years later, in 1983, Ford announced that it would shut down operations in the Philippines, ostensibly due to a combination of factors: including economic challenges and changes in the global automotive industry at the time. It probably didn’t help that the Philippines was undergoing major political instability, especially following the assassination of Marcos’ political foe, Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino Jr. in August 21 that year.  Despite the closure of the production facility, Ford vehicles continued to be sold in the country through its network of dealers and distributors. However, in April 1998, Ford announced that it was resuming manufacturing operations in the Philippines with a $100 million investment on a new assembly plant in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. The company said then that it was “encouraged” by the economic and political stability of the country under then-President Fidel V. Ramos.  The plant, which opened about a year later in 1999, was planned to produce models such as the Ford Ranger pickup truck, the Laser, and the Econovan commercial truck. Several component supplier plants were also planning to join Ford in the Laguna Automotive Technology Park.  “Under the leadership of President Ramos, the Philippines has exhibited the political and economic stability that gives us the confidence to make this investment,” the Associated Press quoted Wayne Booker, Ford’s then-vice chairman, as saying in a statement.  The AP report also said the Philippine government granted Ford special incentives to woo the company to open the assembly and parts manufacturing plant in the country, including a special five percent gross annual income tax rate, which was less than the combined total of national and local taxes that companies outside of special zones have to pay, an exemption from payment of tax on imported machinery and equipment, and a deduction in tax payments for half of the company’s personnel training.  Some of the models that were produced or assembled in the Sta. Rosa plant during this period include: the Ford Lynx, the sedan and hatchback that was based on the Ford Focus platform; the Ford Ranger pickup, one of the brand’s bestselling models; the Ford Escape compact SUV; the Ford Focus; and, for a time, the Ford Everest.  Shutdown again  In June 2012, Ford Philippines sent shockwaves throughout the business and automotive communities in the country when it announced that it was, once again, shutting down its production facility in the country. A total of 250 jobs were affected by the closure.  ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW  According to Ford officials at the time, it was a decision that they did not make easily after a “comprehensive assessment of opportunities to bring a new product program to the Philippines.”  The biggest issue, Ford Motor Co. ASEAN president Peter Fleet said, was the size of the local supply base, which wasn’t yet on a scale that makes new investment decisions very straightforward.  “It’s a different question when you bring in a whole new platform into the plant, getting new supplies, with new components. So that’s the biggest issue—the lack of a broad supply base in the Philippines.”  The second issue was of economies of scale. By global car manufacturing standards, the facility in the Philippines was minuscule, with only about 250 employees churning out about 35,000 vehicles a year.  “If you look around the world, the way Ford Motor Co. tends to operate is that we really like to manufacture in scale with full integrated manufacturing facilities, which typically would be at a scale of 300,000 units plus, in terms of assembly capacity in any one plant,” Fleet said. “The plants being built today in China, India and Thailand, all of those plants have the potential of that kind of capacity should we choose to do that. Clearly that’s not practical today in the Philippines.”  Essentially, from a business standpoint, it was more practical for Ford to expand an existing production facility that already had large-enough production capabilities rather than keep one that was still relatively smaller scale. Plus, parts were also easier to obtain from suppliers nearer those other facilities than here in the Philippines.  This was what happened in the Philippines. About a month before Ford made the announcement to close the Sta. Rosa plant, it was celebrating the opening of a brand-new facility in Rayong, Thailand for which it invested $450 million and that was expected to produce as many as 150,000 units annually.  Despite the shutdown of Ford’s local assembly operations, the American carmaker remains a popular brand whose models are embraced by many Filipinos. And there’s no doubt that it will continue to remain a favorite in the years ahead.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcXVpcmVtYWcucGgvbG9uZy1yZWFkcy9mZWF0dXJlcy9mb3JkLWhpc3RvcnktcGhpbGlwcGluZXMtYTAwMjg5LTIwMjMwNTIyLWxmcm3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","1971-12-16","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T18:08:15","Bangladesh was not born with a silver spoon in its mouth. A 23-year long struggle — first for autonomy and then for independence — and a 9-month long sanguinary battle with the Pakistani occupation army gave birth to this nation state in the year 1971. Our long-awaited liberty was achieved through fierce fighting, not through compromise solutions. And in the tumultuous years of the independence struggle and the liberation war, our dearly beloved motherland was helped and supported by many countries while opposed by many including super power(s).  The most challenging situation Bangladesh got into was that the travails of the birth of the country took place against a backdrop of the Cold War that marked a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies which impeded the process of our winning a victory and international recognition. But finally we achieved both.  They stepped into a web of intrigue against the civilian population of Bangladesh. Though India diplomatically tried to pressurize Nixon to compel Yahya Khan to stop genocide, and hand over power to people's representatives, the US President took no heed of it. On July 7, 1971 over a breakfast table, the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi repeatedly requested Kissinger, who was then visiting India before going to Pakistan, to persuade President Nixon to prevail upon Yahya to abandon the programme of genocide and torture against the people of Bangladesh, and hand over power to Sheikh Muijb without delay. But Kissinger was being evasive in the extreme. On July 8, 1971, as he was having dinner with Yahya, Kissinger rebuked him (Yahya) for having run what Kissinger called “a lousy election” (1970), which he considered unbecoming to a dictator. Kissinger also flew to Beijing, and held extensive discussions with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai on July 9 and 11, 1971. Both leaders expressed unwavering support for Yahya's stance on the Bangladesh issue. Eventually, Kissinger flew back via Paris and reached Washington on July 13, 1971.  America’s role against Bangladesh Liberation War culminated in giving Pakistan overt military support and diplomatic assurances. At the fag-end of the war in December 1971, when the occupation forces were kept at bay by the joint attack of the freedom fighters and allied troops, America, shot their bolt, and sent a task force led by the nuclear-armed aircraft carrier of the Seventh Fleet called “USS Enterprise” to the Bay of Bengal to have a crackdown on the allied forces. However, their plans backfired after Russia, as a counter to the Seventh Fleet, had sent their Eighth Fleet to the Andaman Sea in aid of Bangladesh. The rest is history.  Plots are still being hatched up by US political hegemony to discredit Bangladesh and Sheikh Hasina’s government. Hasina herself claims that the Biden administration is looking to knock her government off their perch. The circumstantial evidences also testify to it. The US Treasury Department’s sanctions on Bangladesh’s elite paramilitary force called Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and its seven officers on alleged grounds of human rights violations are absolutely preposterous. Living in glass houses the US is throwing stones at others. According to the reports of the Western media like The Guardian and BBC, there are cases of gross human rights violations in the US itself.  According to the official statistics of the United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation, we get a gloomy picture of US human rights scenario which includes gun violence, mass shooting and police brutality. There is a shocking amount of racism in American society. Owing to systemic racism and white supremacy, police brutality has emerged as an alarming human rights issue in the USA. How does the US define all these incidents? Doesn’t it treat them as acts of human rights violation? If they do, what punitive action they have taken against the perpetrators? It is a wonder that holding the world record for human rights violations, they are pointing an accusing finger at Bangladesh. How far is this justifiable?  The old resentment that the US harbours against Bangladesh is more for geopolitical reasons. As a matter of fact, after Bangladesh has asserted its authority in the new global order, and started perusing a neutral foreign policy by striking a balance between the key players of geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific region, US-Bangladesh relations have been under strain. The United States under Joe Biden’s leadership perhaps does not want Bangladesh to enjoy wide latitude to make its own geopolitical decisions. So, Bangladesh’s refraining from joining the US-led alliance--the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue known as QUAD seems to have upset the US apple cart. The growing strategic partnership between USA and India in pursuance of America’s Indo-Pacific policy aimed at thwarting China’s indomitable economic growth wants Bangladesh to side with them in their battle for supremacy in the region while China, the largest development partner of Bangladesh, may be, quite deservedly, looking forward to Bangladesh’s support. So, Bangladesh is having to watch its steps with all countries vying for primacy in the region, and tilt the balance only in favour of its own geopolitical interest. Where’s the harm in that? But USA sure does not like it, and therefore might have made the blatant attempt to buy Bangladesh’s loyalty. Besides, the publication of US State Department’s report on alleged human rights violations in Bangladesh without any prior discussion with Bangladesh Government smacks of aggressive hegemonic control.  The ulterior motive of the hegemonic power is to prove Bangladesh as a failed state under Sheikh Hasina’s premiership. If their plots are successful, and we are alarmed over the potential loss of national sovereignty, there will be a mad scramble for hegemonic control over the country. The power-hungry countries will look forward to establishing political and military dominance over us in the name of curbing militancy, and consequently, Bangladesh may have to suffer the same fate like Pakistan or Afghanistan. Uncle Sam’s continuing desire for political and military hegemony over Bangladesh in particular and Indo-Pacific region in general has always been a vexing problem for Bangladesh, the region and the world as well.

"political assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T15:27:00","“Most Americans will be shocked to learn that the conspiracy-theory label was popularized as a pejorative term by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a propaganda program initiated in 1967.” –Professor Lance deHaven Smith in his 2013 book Conspiracy Theory in America; emphasis in original  “Thus the conspiracy-theory label has become a powerful smear that, in the name of reason, civility, and democracy, preempts public discourse, reinforces rather than resolves disagreements, and undermines popular vigilance against abuses of power. Put in place in 1967 by the CIA, the term continues to be a destructive force in American politics.” – Professor Lance deHaven Smith, 2013  The assassination of President John F. Kennedy, coordinated by the CIA and Mossad, is a watershed, not just in U.S. history. It is a watershed in twentieth century history and its evil effects continue with increasing intensification as the first quarter of the twenty-first century nears its end. The assassination was a coup d’état aimed at capturing the White House and ensuring that all future occupants of the White House shall follow the dictates of the wealthiest families on the planet.  The great Eustace Mullins was spot on when he wrote: “Few Americans can grasp the disturbing fact that the governing power in the United States is not a governing agency, or laws or political parties. Rather it is the power of the Assassins, those behind the scene figures who have the power to order the assassination of anyone whom they can no longer control. We have seen two Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln and John Fitzgerald Kennedy, assassinated because they ordered the Treasury of the United States to print non-interest-bearing dollar bills, a development which threatened to deprive the international bankers of billions of dollars in unearned interests.”  The CIA is one of the arms of these banking families, which have a share in every major business and industry, including the military industry. The Western mainstream media, “presstitutes”, as Paul Craig Roberts names it, is a propaganda arm of these families. The media serves only to prevent the public from finding out the truth and to stifle discussion on genuine questions that bother the public mind.  The CIA has had a longstanding program of controlling the entire mainstream media. It started as Operation Mocking Bird in the early 1950s, and has now spread its tentacles worldwide, with “leading” journalists and media persons, not just the in the U.S., but in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, on the CIA payroll. This has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the rebel German journalist Udo Ulfkotte in his German book translated in 2019 as Presstitutes: Embedded in the Pay of the CIA. Ulfkotte, who himself was on the CIA payroll, died at age 57. There are question marks surrounding his death.  When John Kennedy was assassinated, the assassins ensured that, in contravention of Texas law, no autopsy would be carried out at the Dallas Parkland Hospital. It was also ensured that no police investigation, as required by law, would be carried out. Instead a Commission, known as the Warren Commission, was set up to investigate the crime! It was studded with those who had either planned the murder or worked for the planners of the murder.  Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested within 90 minutes of the assassination and was charged with the murder. This was despite the fact that a nitrate test given to him on that very day showed that Oswald had not fired a gun in the past 24 hours! For ten months this explosive information was kept hidden and never made it to the mainstream media. The media, generally, propagated the theory that Oswald was a lone gunman who had shot Kennedy and there was no conspiracy. The Warren Commission report reiterated this fraudulent thesis. As early as December 1963 the lawyer Mark Lane had written to Chief Justice Earl Warren to allow legal representation for Oswald. Within four weeks of the assassination Mark Lane published an article in the National Guardian with the title “Oswald Innocent? A Lawyer’s Brief”. He challenged the Dallas county District Attorney who held Oswald responsible for the murder.  The Warren Commission Report came out at the end of September 1964. Once the Warren Commission Report had been made public, criticisms of the report began. Soon books challenging the lone gunman theory made their appearance. Mark Lane, the lawyer, was among the very first to question the official narrative. His book Rush to Judgement, a critique of the Warren Commission Report came out in 1966 and became a bestseller. By 1966 at least three books questioning the lone gunman theory had appeared. And as the criticisms gained ground the CIA stepped in quietly.  A memo dated April 1, 1967, entitled: “Countering Criticisms of the Warren Report” was sent to all field offices of the CIA. This document, identified as CIA document number 1035-960, was released in September 1976, as a result of a Freedom of Information lawsuit. The memo opens as follows: “1. Our Concern. From the day of President Kennedy’s assassination on, there has been speculation about the responsibility of the murder. Although this was stemmed for a time by the Warren Commission report, various writers now have had time to scan the Commission’s published report and documents for new pretexts for questioning, there has been a new wave of books and articles criticizing the Commission’s findings. In most cases the critics have speculated as to the existence of some kind of conspiracy, and often they have implied that the Commission itself was involved. Presumably as a result of the increasing challenge to the Warren Commission’s report, a public opinion poll recently indicated that 46% of the American public did not think that Oswald acted alone, while more than half of those polled though the Commission had left some questions unresolved. Doubtless polls abroad would show similar, or possibly more adverse results.”  The opening paragraph shows that that CIA was very concerned that the suspicion of a conspiracy in the JFK assassination was gaining ground in the public mind. Why would the CIA be concerned unless it was itself involved in the conspiracy and feared exposure? The document goes on to mention that “This trend of opinion is a matter of concern for the U.S. government and our organization.” The memo also states that President Johnson being the beneficiary is also suspected of “in some way being responsible for the assassination.” It also states “Conspiracy theories have frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us.” It is now established that Oswald worked for the CIA.  The memo then comes to the point. “The aim of this dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit circulation of such claims in other countries.” Point number 3 of the memo is titled “Action.” It includes a total of seven suggestions (a-g) on how to tackle criticisms of the Warren Commission. It suggests that CIA officers discuss the publicity problem with “friendly elite contacts (especially politicians and editors)” and tell them that the Warren Commission had done a thorough job, “that the charges of critics are without serious foundation, and further speculative discussion only plays into the hands of the opposition.”  The CIA memo then injects a damaging suggestion or false innuendo against those who question the official narrative. “Point out also that parts of the conspiracy talk are deliberately generated by Communist propagandists. Urge them to use their influence to discourage unfounded and irresponsible speculation.” In the post-McCarthy, post-Bay-of-Pigs era the charge of being linked to Communists was something highly damaging to anyone questioning the Warren Commission report. Questioning the official version has been dubbed “unfounded and irresponsible speculation” and thus dismissed.  The CIA memo goes on: “To employ propaganda assets to [negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.” The memo suggests: “Our ploy should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (I) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (II) politically interested, (III) financially interested, (IV) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (V) infatuated with their own theories.” One may note that the memo uses the word “ploy”. This clearly shows that the CIA was not interested in the truth but in obfuscating the search for truth by attacking those seeking it!  Dr. Richard Crenshaw, who was present in Trauma Room One at the Dallas Parkland Hospital, and who, through his books since 1992, has exposed the medical cover-up of the JFK assassination, has made important observations on the CIA memo. He writes: “Notice the memo instructs recipients of the memo to ‘provide material’, utilize ‘editors’, employ ‘propaganda assets,’ and use ‘feature articles’ in countering the critics.” Dr. Crenshaw notes further: “Notice also that the attack is to be directed toward the Warren Commission critic and his motive rather than toward the allegations. This agenda has become the most commonly used ploy with respect to critics of the official version of the assassination – always attack the messenger rather than the message – for to do otherwise might cause confrontation with the real issue – and perhaps the truth.”  Professor Jim DeBrosse has carried out an exhaustive study of how the US mainstream media has dealt with the JFK assassination in his 2018 book See No Evil: The US Media and the JFK Assassination. He writes: “America’s mainstream media have choked the parameters of the debate and stifled the search for answers to the Crime of the Century.” This is in accordance with the CIA strategy outlined in the memo. DeBrosse notes: “Mainstream journalists continue to marginalize opponents of the Warren Commission by a variety of fallacious means, including ad hominem attacks, loaded words, and broad-brush criticisms.” Ad hominem attacks, i.e. attacks on a person’s character or motivations rather than a position or argument, are what the CIA memo of 1967 advocated.  Jim DeBrosse quotes a fiftieth anniversary (i.e.2013) article by Executive Editor Jill Abramson in the New York Times: “Conspiracy speculation abounds – involving Johnson, the C.I.A., the mob, Fidel Castro or a baroque combination of all of them. Many of the theories have now found new life on the Internet, in websites febrile with unfiltered and at times unhinged musings.” Please note that without addressing the reasons of the suspicions, the journalist employs words to belittle, disparage and trivialize what she calls “conspiracy speculation”. Also note the sarcasm and contempt in the phrase “febrile with unfiltered and unhinged musings”.  Similarly, DeBrosse cites the example of a 2013 Washington Post review of a book The Kennedy Half Century authored by Larry J. Sabato. After “chiding” the author for devoting several chapters to JFK assassination conspiracy theories, the reviewer, David Greenberg, writes: “While the book’s first section is perfunctory, the second part which deals with the assassination, is somewhat wearying and likely to interest only those hard-core buffs – I realize there are many – who wallow in outraged speculation about who was behind Kennedy’s murder.” Note the choice of words “wearying”, “hard-core buffs”, those who “wallow in outraged speculation” about who was behind JFK assassination. One may notice how the mainstream media discourages people from trying to pursue the question of who was behind the assassination and to keep people away from books that deal with the issue.  In his study of book reviews of JFK assassination books in major newspapers, DeBrosse writes: “Book reviews in the New York Times and the Washington Post have overwhelmingly defended the conclusions of the Warren Commission against alternative assassination theories. The reviewers often resorted to broad criticism of conspiracy researchers as paranoid, obsessed, or just plain mercenary.” As an example he quotes from a 1992 Washington Post column “Historians, Buffs and Crackpots” by freelance writer John G. Leyden who, as DeBrosse puts it, “burned through nearly thirty years of assassination books, writing off whole categories of them in a sentence or two.” He quotes Leyden: “Most of the contemporary crop of assassination writers have a more global view and tend to mix and match their conspiracy theories according to the latest fashion. The only consistent element throughout is the alleged involvement of the CIA.” The very title of the article implicitly labels those who question the Warren Commission and suspect the CIA, as “buffs” and “crackpots”, just as the CIA memo advises.  What began as a ploy to counter criticisms of the Warren Commission, and cover the truth about the JFK assassination, has been extended to all similar operations, particularly 9/11. When this author googled the term conspiracy theory on 9/11/21, he got 123 million results in 0.94 seconds; a day later he got 147 million results in 0.72 seconds. And this author knows from experience that, for any search, google search engines give a far larger number of results in the West compared to Pakistan. The google search for conspiracy theory on 9/11/21 also listed two top stories: A BBC report titled: 11 September 2001: The conspiracy theories still spreading after 20 years; and a Washington Post opinion titled: False, toxic Sept. 11 conspiracy theories are still widespread today. One may notice that the concern about conspiracy theories about 9/11 being widespread. One may notice the disparaging tone about 9/11 conspiracy theories, quite similar to the tone about JFK assassination conspiracy theories.  One may also take up a discussion about the name 9/11. Does one remember Pearl Harbor as 12/7 (December 7, 1942)? Or is the JFK assassination called 11/22 (November 22, 1963)? No. These events have a name, not a date by which they are remembered. But that discussion will take us in a somewhat different domain. One may however ask the reader to think as to why is the event, when the twin towers, and a third tower fell, the twin towers said to have been hit by planes, called 9/11 and what kind of implications such a name have? What should be the name given to 9/11?  We may end by quoting two professors of communication at Boise University, G. Husting and M. Orr. In 2007 they published a peer reviewed article entitled “Dangerous Machinery: ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ as a Transpersonal Strategy of Exclusion.” The opening paragraph of the article states: “If I call you a ‘conspiracy theorist,’ it matters little whether you have actually claimed that a conspiracy exists or whether you have raised an issue that I would rather avoid. As part of the machinery of interaction, the label does conversational work no matter how true, false, or conspiracy related your work is. Specifically, when I call you a ‘conspiracy theorist,’ I can turn the tables on you: instead of responding to a question, concern, or challenge, I twist the machinery of interaction so that you, not I, are now called to account. By labeling you, I strategically exclude you from the sphere where public speech, debate, and conflict occur.”  All this civic and social damage is the result of a CIA conspiracy regarding conspiracy-theory that began in 1967. As a counter to the term conspiracy-theory scholars have proposed the phrase State Crimes Against Democracy – SCAD!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZGFpbHlwYWtpc3Rhbi5jb20ucGsvMjEtTWF5LTIwMjMvY2lhLXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcnktY29uc3BpcmFjedIBWmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uZGFpbHlwYWtpc3Rhbi5jb20ucGsvMjEtTWF5LTIwMjMvY2lhLXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcnktY29uc3BpcmFjeT92ZXJzaW9uPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Khan, who previously accused the US of playing a role in his ousting, is now allegedly seeking intervention to address the situation unfolding in his country.  Imran Khan seeks US help over Political Crisis?  An alleged audio leak has surfaced on social media, purportedly featuring a conversation between Imran Khan and US Congresswoman Maxine Moore Waters. In the leaked audio, Khan can be heard requesting the American lawmaker to raise her voice against what he calls ""human rights violations"" in Pakistan.  ""[This is] probably one of the most critical times in our history. We have the most bizarre situation going on in this country. I received three bullets in one assassination attempt. My government was removed by ex-army chief [General Qamar Javed Bajwa] because the military establishment is very powerful here. He conspired with people who are in power currently and toppled my government,"" he said in the alleged audio tape.  The PTI chief alleged that his party was facing the “worst crackdown” that no democratic party had ever faced in the country’s history. He claimed that if Maxine Waters made a statement highlighting the ""crackdown"", it would help him and his party. ""We just want a statement highlighting the [crackdown] and that would really help us. If someone like you Maxine speaks up it makes a lot of waves,” he said.  Notably, the former Pak PM was arrested by the paramilitary Pakistan Rangers at the Islamabad High Court premises on May 9, which triggered unrest across the country. For the first time in the country's history, protesters stormed the army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and also torched a regional corps commander's house in Lahore.  Reacting to the unrest following Khan's arrest, the top military brass vowed to bring the arsonists, who attacked the civil and military installations, to justice through trial under relevant laws of the country, including the Pakistan Army Act and Official Secrets Act. Law enforcement agencies have arrested over 7,000 PTI workers across Pakistan, 4,000 of them from Punjab.

"political assassination","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Berlin"", ""Berlin"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-21T13:10:59","The German police are currently conducting an investigation into the potential poisoning of exiled Russians. This comes after a journalist and activist reported experiencing health issues following a meeting of dissidents in Berlin. A spokesperson for the police force confirmed this on Sunday.  The incident has raised concerns about the safety of exiled Russians living in Germany. The country has become a popular destination for Russian dissidents who have fled their homeland due to political persecution. However, this recent incident has highlighted the potential dangers they may face even while living abroad.  The journalist and activist who reported feeling unwell after the meeting have not been named. However, it is believed that they were attending a gathering of Russian dissidents in Berlin. The event was organized by the Open Russia movement, which was founded by exiled Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky.  The police have not yet confirmed whether or not the individuals were actually poisoned. However, they are taking the matter very seriously and have launched an investigation into the incident. The police spokesperson stated that they are currently examining all possible leads and are working closely with the individuals who reported feeling unwell.  This is not the first time that exiled Russians in Germany have faced potential danger. In 2019, a former Chechen rebel commander was shot dead in a Berlin park. The incident was widely believed to be a political assassination ordered by the Russian government. The suspected killer was later arrested in Russia and extradited to Germany to stand trial.  The incident sparked outrage and led to calls for greater protection for exiled Russians living in Germany. However, it appears that more needs to be done to ensure their safety. The recent incident has once again highlighted the risks that these individuals face, even while living in a supposedly safe country like Germany.  The potential poisoning of the journalist and activist is particularly concerning given the recent history of poisonings involving Russian dissidents. In 2018, former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in the UK. The incident was widely believed to have been carried out by Russian agents, although the Russian government denied any involvement.  The incident led to a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Russia, with many countries expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with the UK. The Skripals survived the attack, but it highlighted the potential dangers faced by Russian dissidents living abroad.  The potential poisoning of exiled Russians in Germany is a worrying development. It raises questions about the safety of these individuals and the measures that need to be taken to protect them. It also highlights the ongoing tensions between Russia and its exiled dissidents, even when they are living in other countries.  The German authorities must take this incident seriously and do everything in their power to ensure the safety of exiled Russians living in their country. This includes providing them with adequate protection and investigating any potential threats to their safety. The international community must also stand in solidarity with these individuals and demand that their safety is protected at all times.  In conclusion, the potential poisoning of exiled Russians in Germany is a concerning development that highlights the ongoing risks faced by dissidents living abroad. The German authorities must take this incident seriously and do everything in their power to ensure the safety of these individuals. The international community must also stand in solidarity with them and demand that their safety is protected at all times.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vZ2VybWFueS9nZXJtYW55LWludmVzdGlnYXRlcy1hbGxlZ2VkLXBvaXNvbmluZy1vZi1ydXNzaWFuLWV4aWxlcy1yZXBvcnQv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2xvYmFsdmlsbGFnZXNwYWNlLmNvbS9nZXJtYW55L2dlcm1hbnktaW52ZXN0aWdhdGVzLWFsbGVnZWQtcG9pc29uaW5nLW9mLXJ1c3NpYW4tZXhpbGVzLXJlcG9ydC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Srinagar"", ""JammuAndKashmir"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T10:04:21","Pakistan says India ‘misusing’ G20 chair by hosting meeting in Srinagar as China boycotts  ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistani foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Monday New Delhi was ‘misusing’ its presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) countries by hosting a tourism meeting of the forum in Indian-administered Kashmir, an internationally recognized disputed territory.  The meeting, being held in the city of Srinagar, is the first major international event in Kashmir since New Delhi revoked its special autonomous status and split it into two federally governed territories — Jammu and Kashmir — in 2019, promoting Islamabad to downgrade its diplomatic relations with the neighbor and cut trade ties.  The Muslim-majority region is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over control of the territory. The region is also plagued by a decades-long separatist insurgency.  On Monday, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the part of the region governed by Pakistan, announced protests and rallies against the holding of the G20 meeting.  “India is hosting the meeting of a tourism working group of G20 in Srinagar, which is yet another display of India’s arrogance on the world’s stage,” Bhutto-Zardari said while addressing the Azad Kashmir assembly.  The foreign minister is visiting Azad Kashmir on a three-day trip to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people as New Delhi hosts the G20 tourism meeting.  “India is misusing its position as a chair of the G20, a forum created to address global financial and economic issues with utter disregard for the UN Security Council resolutions, the UN charter, and its principal,” he added,  The UN Security Council adopted several resolutions in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the region’s future. Another resolution also calls upon both sides to “refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation.”  UN peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a cease-fire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, the part of Kashmir administered by India.  As India aims to project normalcy on its side of Kashmir, the Pakistani foreign minister said the “harsh reality” was that Jammu and Kashmir remained one of the most militarized zones on the planet.  “Normal areas are not under siege under millions of troops, normal areas are not operated under so-called governor rule, and normal areas do not have unidentified graves,” Bhutto-Zardari said.  “I wish to remind Indian leaders that unilateral steps in Jammu and Kashmir can neither record legitimacy to their occupation nor suppress the true sentiments of the Kashmiri people as gimmickry cannot replace legitimacy,” he added.  Jitendra Singh, the Indian minister for science and technology who is from Jammu, said during the opening of the meeting that events like G20 would in the past be met with calls for strike from Islamabad and shops in Indian-administered Kashmir would be shut.  “Now, the common man wants to move on, all shops are open,” he said.  Since the 2019 changes, the region known for its rolling Himalayan footills has turned into a major tourist hotspot for domestic visitors, as Indian authorities attempt to attract more economic activity into Kashmir and woo foreign investors.  Srinagar’s commercial center and roads were spruced up for the G20 meeting, while security was stepped up across the city with extra CCTV surveillance, a counter-drone unit and marine commandos under the elite National Security Guard. Mobility restrictions for civilians were also put in place on major streets.  Altaf Hussain, a former BBC journalist and political analyst based in Srinagar, said the Indian government was seeking to project normalcy in the region.  “By inviting international delegates to Srinagar, New Delhi wants to show that things are normal in the valley and that its move to annul the region’s special status has brought down militancy in the region,” Hussain said.  Over 60 delegates from G20 member countries are expected to attend the tourism event in Srinagar.  China, however, said on Friday it will not attend as Beijing “firmly opposes holding any form of G20 meeting in disputed territory.”  Other members of the bloc, including Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Indonesia were also expected to stay away, according to reports.  Speaking about the G20 meeting, former Pakistani diplomat Naghmana Hashmi said India was trying to create the “false impression” of peace in Kashmir.  “But India will not succeed as the world knows that India has unleashed a rule of suppression and by force controlling the lives of Kashmiri people,” she told Arab News, adding that Pakistan was “happy” to note that countries like China who had decided to boycott the meeting.  “It is an interesting situation,” Prof. Siddiq Wahid, a Srinagar-based political analyst, told Arab News. “Countries excusing themselves from the G20 event in Kashmir is a significant statement.”  As president of the G20, India will host a summit in September, where leaders from the world’s largest economies, comprising 19 countries and the EU, are expected to attend. The grouping accounts for about 80 percent of global economic output and two-thirds of the world’s population.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzQ1MS9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T19:28:57","Viewers shocked as hit Pakistani serial includes ‘marital rape’ theme, writer says script demanded it  KARACHI: The scriptwriter of a popular Pakistani television serial on Friday defended her decision to introduce the theme of marital rape in the latest episode after receiving social media criticism, saying it was a demand of the story and not the first time such a subject had been addressed on local television screens.  The drama serial “Tere Bin” has received lavish praise from viewers since its premiere in December. Starring Wahaj Ali and Yumna Zaidi, the record-breaking production has gained massive popularity not only in Pakistan but also in India and other countries.  The story revolves around the lives of Meerub (Yumna Zaidi) and Murtasim (Wahaj Ali), who captivated the audience with their performance and portrayed a love-hate relationship after their marriage in the serial.  However, fans expressed disappointment after the recent episode aired on Thursday when the teaser for the next episode hinted at possible marital rape.  In the last episode, Meerub spits and slaps Murtasim after catching a glimpse of him being locked in his cousin’s embrace. At the end of the episode, Murtasim drags her toward the bed and shuts the door.  “It’s a situation which was the demand of the serial that will lead to the climax,” Nooran Makhdoom, the writer of “Tere Bin,” said in an interview with Arab News.  She maintained that those questioning the inclusion of marital rape and asking for changes should understand that this is how she intended to weave the story.  “If the audience isn’t getting it, I can’t change it,” she continued. “It’s just a drama. They should wait for the entire story to unfold instead of taking issue with every episode.”  Makhdoom pointed out the content team or 7th Sky production house did not object to the storyline.  “It’s not like this has happened onscreen for the first time,” she added. “It’s just that this project has received such wide recognition that people reacted strongly to the recent twist.”  She revealed that the scene had been tweaked before filming, as she had not initially included the spitting and slapping. However, she took complete responsibility for the script.  “If you speak of my social responsibility, I created a story and I stand by it,” she said. “And this is not an unusual occurrence; it has happened before.”  The recent episode that aired on Thursday night has surpassed 18 million views and is currently trending as number one on YouTube. The hashtag #TereBin has also overwhelmed Twitter, with approximately 30,000 tweets in 18 hours.  However, many fans of the television production expressed their dismay after the latest episode.  Fashion and lifestyle journalist Maliha Rehman called the sudden change in the storyline as a “terrible twist.”  “The #Murtasim #Meerub romance will be completely ruined if assault becomes part of the storyline,” she said. “Have been enjoying the drama so far. I do hope that it doesn’t get quite so ugly now, when finally we were moving towards a happily ever after.”  What a terrible twist to #TereBin. The #Murtasim #Meerub romance will be completely ruined if assault becomes part of the storyline. Have been enjoying the drama so far. I do hope that it doesn’t get quite so ugly now, when finally we were moving towards a happily ever after. — Maliha Rehman (@MalihaRehman) May 18, 2023  Another Twitter user, who only identifies himself as Haroon, wrote: “This country is beyond finished, trash content like tere bin is being watched by millions of people, embarrassing.”  This country is beyond finished, trash content like tere bin is being watched by millions of people, embarrassing. pic.twitter.com/ZUbekkWqVI — Haroon (@ThisHaroon) May 18, 2023  TV drama critic Aamna Haider Isani took to Twitter and shared her opinion on Twitter, saying: “Just saw the promo for the next episode.

The Makkah Route initiative is a component of Saudi Arabia's Guests of God Service Program, which King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud inaugurated in 2019 under the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 to diversify the economy. Under the scheme, Hajj pilgrims go through immigration facilities at the airports of their respective countries.  Pakistan's Minister of Religious Affairs Senator Talha Mahmood and Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, along with officials from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), saw off the pilgrims at the airport.  “We are very much pleased for the Route to Makkah facilitation at Islamabad airport as the first Hajj flight from Islamabad went to Madinah,” Haseeb Ahmed Siddiqui, the Hajj director in Islamabad, told Arab News.

The Makkah Route initiative will facilitate the departure of more than 26,000 Pakistani pilgrims to Saudi Arabia this year, according to the Pakistani authorities.  “Thanks to the Route to Makkah initiative, I did not face any issues and did not have to wait in a queue as my immigration was swiftly completed within no time,” Muhammad Almas Tabbasum, a Pakistani Hajj pilgrim, told Arab News.  “I spent no more than a minute at the counter and was able to exit.

"political assassination","1846-07-04","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T15:30:00","Talk about overdue — a man returned a book to the St. Helena Public Library in California’s Napa Valley that was due Feb. 21, 1927.  Benson Lossing’s “A History of the United States” is a weighty tome with the crumbling binding one would expect from a book published in 1881. It’s stamped “Property of the St. Helena Library Association,” and library staff suspect it was one of the original 540 volumes available when the Free Public Library opened in 1892.  The man returned the library to the front desk but didn’t leave his name. Library staff hope he comes forward. Library Director Chris Kreiden said the library went fine-free in 2019, so the man won’t owe a cent for keeping the book longer than two weeks.  “Nobody on the staff recognized the gentleman who brought it in,” Kreiden said. “The library (staff) would definitely love to know” the story of how he came across the book.  In case you’re wondering, the library’s old nickel-a-day fine would have added up to roughly $1,756 from the 1927 due date through last week.  The book offers a glimpse into the library’s history. Before the Free Public Library opened in 1892, it cost 25 cents a month to borrow books — including possibly this one — from the St. Helena Library Association.  According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, Lossing (1813-1891) was a prolific and respected American historian. He was known for traveling widely to seek out primary sources and visit historic buildings and battlefields, a practice that was unusual at the time but is considered standard for today’s historians. His massive “Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution” was the result of 9,000 miles of travel over two years.  The 754-page volume returned to the library contains 400 engravings and a full account of the then-recent national centennial celebration of 1876.  Kreiden said the library staff haven’t decided what to do with the book, but their top priority is to protect it from further deterioration.  “It would be cool to put it on display someday but we haven’t figured out how to do that,” she said.

The meeting, being held in the city of Srinagar, is the first major international event in Kashmir since New Delhi revoked its special autonomous status and split it into two federally governed territories — Jammu and Kashmir — in 2019, promoting Islamabad to downgrade its diplomatic relations with the neighbor and cut trade ties.  The Muslim-majority region is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over control of the territory. The region is also plagued by a decades-long separatist insurgency.  On Monday, the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the part of the region governed by Pakistan, announced protests and rallies against the holding of the G20 meeting.  “India is hosting the meeting of a tourism working group of G20 in Srinagar, which is yet another display of India’s arrogance on the world’s stage,” Bhutto-Zardari said while addressing the Azad Kashmir assembly.  The foreign minister is visiting Azad Kashmir on a three-day trip to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people as New Delhi hosts the G20 tourism meeting.  “India is misusing its position as a chair of the G20, a forum created to address global financial and economic issues with utter disregard for the UN Security Council resolutions, the UN charter, and its principal,” he added,  The UN Security Council adopted several resolutions in 1948 and in the 1950s on the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, including one which says a plebiscite should be held to determine the region’s future. Another resolution also calls upon both sides to “refrain from making any statements and from doing or causing to be done or permitting any acts which might aggravate the situation.”  UN peacekeepers have been deployed since 1949 to observe a cease-fire between India and Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir, the part of Kashmir administered by India.  As India aims to project normalcy on its side of Kashmir, the Pakistani foreign minister said the “harsh reality” was that Jammu and Kashmir remained one of the most militarized zones on the planet.  “Normal areas are not under siege under millions of troops, normal areas are not operated under so-called governor rule, and normal areas do not have unidentified graves,” Bhutto-Zardari said.  “I wish to remind Indian leaders that unilateral steps in Jammu and Kashmir can neither record legitimacy to their occupation nor suppress the true sentiments of the Kashmiri people as gimmickry cannot replace legitimacy,” he added.  Jitendra Singh, the Indian minister for science and technology who is from Jammu, said during the opening of the meeting that events like G20 would in the past be met with calls for strike from Islamabad and shops in Indian-administered Kashmir would be shut.  “Now, the common man wants to move on, all shops are open,” he said.  Since the 2019 changes, the region known for its rolling Himalayan footills has turned into a major tourist hotspot for domestic visitors, as Indian authorities attempt to attract more economic activity into Kashmir and woo foreign investors.  Srinagar’s commercial center and roads were spruced up for the G20 meeting, while security was stepped up across the city with extra CCTV surveillance, a counter-drone unit and marine commandos under the elite National Security Guard. Mobility restrictions for civilians were also put in place on major streets.  Altaf Hussain, a former BBC journalist and political analyst based in Srinagar, said the Indian government was seeking to project normalcy in the region.  “By inviting international delegates to Srinagar, New Delhi wants to show that things are normal in the valley and that its move to annul the region’s special status has brought down militancy in the region,” Hussain said.  Over 60 delegates from G20 member countries are expected to attend the tourism event in Srinagar.  China, however, said on Friday it will not attend as Beijing “firmly opposes holding any form of G20 meeting in disputed territory.”  Other members of the bloc, including Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Indonesia were also expected to stay away, according to reports.  Speaking about the G20 meeting, former Pakistani diplomat Naghmana Hashmi said India was trying to create the “false impression” of peace in Kashmir.  “But India will not succeed as the world knows that India has unleashed a rule of suppression and by force controlling the lives of Kashmiri people,” she told Arab News, adding that Pakistan was “happy” to note that countries like China who had decided to boycott the meeting.  “It is an interesting situation,” Prof. Siddiq Wahid, a Srinagar-based political analyst, told Arab News. “Countries excusing themselves from the G20 event in Kashmir is a significant statement.”  As president of the G20, India will host a summit in September, where leaders from the world’s largest economies, comprising 19 countries and the EU, are expected to attend. The grouping accounts for about 80 percent of global economic output and two-thirds of the world’s population.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzUzNi9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photograph: EPA  Gaza is again, perhaps fleetingly, in the headlines. An Israeli assassination strike, inevitably inflicting civilian casualties, led to rockets being launched towards Israel and waves of Israeli bombings. Palestinians in Gaza have been under an Israeli land and sea blockade for 16 years. A very simple fact about Gaza that is rarely mentioned is that it is overwhelmingly a community of refugees; 70 per cent of its population live in refugee camps. Many were expelled from areas in today’s Israel just on the other side of the electrified, highly surveilled and fiercely guarded prison-like fence surrounding the enclave.  This adds a particular poignancy to recent commemorations of the 75th anniversary of the Nakba – “the Catastrophe” – the term Palestinians use to refer to when they were expelled from their homes between 1947-49 to create a Jewish majority in the new state of Israel. Of the approximately 750,000 who were expelled, many were driven to Gaza.  Israel has attempted to divide and separate the Palestinian collective into manageable silos. A unified Palestinian reality is deconstructed into, as Israel would have it, the problems of Gaza, the West Bank, an Arab minority within Israel and refugees (with Arab states being blamed for the failure to integrate rather than Israel for preventing their return). That is the legacy of the Nakba.  It is almost impenetrably counterintuitive for Israelis, as well as for many in Jewish communities across the world, to think of that period after 1945 as one in which the Zionist movement was perpetrating a crime rather than as a time of recovery from the atrocities and devastation of the Holocaust. A time in which the broken pieces and remnants were being restored and Jewish life was being reconstituted – primarily in that new state of Israel.  READ MORE  At the same time Palestinian acknowledgment of the enormity and tragedy of the Holocaust cannot negate the Palestinian experience of the Nakba, absolve those who perpetrated it, or ignore the price still being paid by Palestinians. Palestinians were not only physically uprooted and prevented from returning to their land and homes, entire villages were erased and over time those properties were seized by the state. The same processes continue to be deployed in Jerusalem in the West Bank to this day. The Nakba has never been sufficiently recognised, let alone made whole.  Palestinians tend to be far more aware of Jewish and Zionist history and narratives than vice versa. Historically this is not unusual in deeply asymmetrical relations of coloniser and colonised. Ultimately, though, sustainable peace will require Israelis to interrogate their own history and that of the Palestinians – including the Nakba. That is true also for third parties seeking to advance peace.  Israel’s continued expropriation and dispossession of Palestinians, settlement expansion, refusal to de-occupy and accept genuine Palestinian sovereignty rendered the two-state Oslo option moot. An Israeli friend recently confided to one of us that she had watched the Derry Girls TV series through sobbing eyes, being of the same generation as those Irish youngsters, glimpsing a path Israel had not taken. Continued adherence to the peace process maintains a fiction, acting as cover for the denial of Palestinian equality, rights and freedoms.  Looking to the future means looking at the reality of sharing this one political space which Israel has recreated, including who can live in this land.  In dismantling the structures of occupation and discrimination established by Israel there will have to be an acknowledgment that the Jewish-Israeli presence is not going anywhere. It will be an equal but not privileged part of any future political dispensation. Likewise, equality for Palestinians will apply not only to those residing in this one space reality, it must also address the rights of refugees, including reparations and return for those who seek it.  However, righting the wrongs of either the past or the present are not on the Israeli political agenda. Israel has gone from denying that the Nakba happened, to justifying it as a necessity, to now (among certain political circles) threatening another mass expulsion of Palestinians. The current governing coalition is primed with cabinet ministers who openly agitate for a second Nakba, inspiring the violence of settler militias, often under the protection of the Israeli military.  Israeli willingness to end its human rights violations against the Palestinians is only likely to emerge if it is held accountable and recognises there is a cost for its policies.  Ireland can help Palestinians and Israelis out of this morass if it is ready to lean more into accountability and to be a more robust voice in Europe and beyond in challenging impunity in the face of Israel’s international law and human rights violations. Belatedly ending all trade with Israel’s illegal settlements is a not unreasonable place to start.  Zaha Hassan is a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Previously she was the coordinator and senior legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team during Palestine’s bid for UN membership, and was a member of the Palestinian delegation to Quartet-sponsored exploratory talks between 2011 and 2012.

This has to be the last hurrah if not a celebration of Julian Assange’s release from the US’ vendetta against Julian and their own First Amendment – Freedom of Speech!  The morning will pivot around highly influential speakers from the epicentre of the Free Julian Assange campaign (including & especially his family), amid politically astute performance artists & symbolic imagery in a collective effort to share the contagious enthusiasm of people-power as the only option for just governance.  The action not only provides us with clear instructions to secure Julian’s freedom. It’s a chance to network and brainstorm with the finest minds on the planet on how to challenge an embittered system that continues to go after anyone that threatens its strong hold.  If you haven’t yet publicly supported Julian and by default our right to hold to account public servants for any misconduct, then come to this historical event.  As most know there’s been ‘movement at the station’. Gratitude has been felt globally for our Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese’s public statements of late. The ‘Enough is Enough’ phrase has been an oasis in a desert, in contrast to the previous 13 years of Prime Ministerial silence. Noting also, the recent meeting of several MP’s with the US ambassador in Canberra, and Albanese’s controversial quote of ‘quiet diplomacy’ that’s been echoed throughout Labor’s camp right down to the local level.

Julian’s family, their international team of lawyers along with a growing number of leaders and constituents of countless organisations, scholars, concerned citizens – and especially the Iraqi family members of the murdered, have watched on in horror. If there is a silver lining to the trial of Julian Assange, it is that every immoral and illegal manoeuvre against him has been placed under a giant ethical microscope. It’s been diligently dissected to reveal an unfathomable volume of seemingly insurmountable corruption. Inspiring even the least political of humans to become political.  It was the mainstream media’s ‘job’ to sell the Iraq invasion, then to run relentless smear campaigns against Julian Assange. After the initial onslaught from the mainstream media that mirrored the increasingly tight lipped government.

As for Peter Dutton finally sticking up for Julian Assange, it immediately reminds us of the Department of Defence’s current case against David McBride. Considering the Assange team has passionately united with team McBride on the global stage, surely Dutton will support his case being dropped as well?  If the mainstream consensus is that Chelsea Manning was a lesson of what not to do in disclosing war crimes, then McBride would surely be the shining example of what should be done. Having used the correct departmental avenues to report corruption and war crimes, McBride was well within his right to go to the media once those avenues failed. This report later became known as the ‘Afghan files’. These files were the reason the historical raids on the ABC occurred and McBride was arrested. Like McBride says in an interview with Michael West, putting him in jail is an absolute waste, he’s offered to return to Department of Defence to help them clean it up. It’s bewildering why they’re not taking him up on that offer? He should be awarded the Defence Ministerial’s portfolio for his moral bravery!  Fortunately, the lack of support for cases like McBride, Assange and multiple cases like theirs has always hung by the thread of ignorance in an information & media rich world. Enter the arts; Julian Assange’s Brother & Father, Gabriel & John Shipton, not only produced the film on ABC ‘Ithaka’, they’ve toured the world with screenings followed by talks and intimate Q & A time with the audience. To hear Mr Shipton share his thoughtful and philosophical deductions of this alarming era, is moving to say the least. Not only extending on the information about his son’s case he delivers historical teachings in relation to Julian being emblematic of a broken system and initiates discussions on how we must restore integrity. With faith in humanity he skilfully hands over the baton to his audience. The injustice just doesn’t sit right in our hearts, it creates a hunger to seek justice, Mr Shipton sincerely expresses. To this end, people must stand in solidarity with whistle blowers, we must harness this courage to speak up, isn’t this what we are teaching our children?  Assange was yet another astutely bright mind on the scene, like Edward Snowden who challenged the US’s abuse of surveillance laws. Minds with global integrity in their sights. Assange created the anonymous drop-box known as WikiLeaks. It allowed anyone to safely expose their concerns on corruption. The most notable publication of Wikileaks, coordinated with multiple news corporations was the irrefutable war crimes perpetrated by the US alliance in Afghanistan & Iraq. Comparably, Aaron Swartz, was also a bright young mind with similar technical nouse who copped the full force of the law when he challenged corporate greed. Additionally he tried to make legal processes highly accessible for the public to oppose invasive new laws. Both Julian and Aaron were simply proactive people with big bleeding hearts. They both had exceptional information technology skills, and an all too rare visionary compassion. Ultimately enabling them to maximise global reach for actions. This undermined the stronghold of powerful entities, turning formidable forces against both Assange and Swartz in what is being unveiled as not only a gross abuse of the judiciary system, but of the spirit of law itself. The authority’s hunt devastatingly led to the death of Swartz. ‘The internet’s own Boy’ Free to watch on YouTube  Returning to the glimpse of hope mentioned earlier, it feels like the famous quote: ‘hope is a very dangerous thing’. With emotions naturally high, people who fight for Assange, fight for him like he’s their brother. Most of us, with the cognitive ability for empathy would publish those documents, it is undeniably a moral obligation. We should not be frightened to speak up and are consequently forced to call his actions brave.  So, to Julian’s captors, be warned, this is your last chance for redemption!  With the millions of supporters in the world, there is still a massive untouched reserve of ‘new Assangers’ out there! Julian is a modern day William Wallace and we are all witnessing his slow assassination in progress. However, this potential reserve of Assangers that surround us are Netflixers! Junkies, binging on an Amazonian amount of entertainment!  Traditionally not documentary viewers. All it takes is just one of the hundreds of the award winning screen writer/directors to release a powerful film. Ava DuVernay would be perfect! Imagine an accurately dramatised film of Julian Assange from a mother’s point of view, interwoven with an Iraqi family’story of loss? DuVernay’s film ‘When they see us’ moved mountains. Almost immediately after she released this four-part series, the true story about the ‘Central Park Five’, which was another legal crime of the century, heads immediately began to roll! There was an outpouring of horror and support as the film went absolutely viral!  So who exactly are these ‘powers that be’ that are holding Julian Assange hostage?  Well … that’s easy! If you’re an investigative journalist! Luckily, Johnny Harris has put together a neat little entertaining package on his YouTube channel. He does a deep dive on which companies got filthy rich from the Afghanistan war. I dare say he’ll be in the process of stitching together an analysis for Iraq. He shows us a list of about 40 members of congress who have shares in said companies. These members also have the rubber stamp power to approve wars. It is a classic case of revolving doors with a horrific amount of bloodshed on their hands. Saying this, when it comes to getting the Australian public to get behind AUKUS with no acknowledgement of the infamous Bush, Blair and Howard trio’s illegal and deadly cooperation 20 years earlier, it’s a ludicrous ask. It begs the question; Are we in a domestically abusive relationship with the US? If it has to be a quiet diplomacy to request Julian Assange’s release then YES it’s coercive control and the world is wising up!  It has been the barbaric reaction of the state to Julian Assange, the late Aaron Swartz, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and David McBride, Dan Duggan, Richard Boyle, Violet Coco – to name just a few, that’s proved to the world just how bent the system is. Are you’re tired of the political semantics?

"political assassination","2017-07-25","22:30:00","{""Rawalpindi"", ""Punjab"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-22T00:07:03","Harsha Kakar  Addressing party workers in his first public appearance after his assassination attempt in Nov last year, Imran Khan stated, ‘if you want to live life in the true sense, free yourself from the fear of death,’ adding, ‘remember that death cannot come unless Allah is willing for it, and when the time comes, no one can escape.’ Post his recent release by the Supreme Court, Imran stated, ‘I am ready to die than live under these duffers. The question is are you ready.’ He subsequently mentioned, ‘Freedom does not come easily. You have to snatch it. You have to sacrifice for it.’ Imran continuously talks of Jihad and a fight to the death against the state and the army, aware that there is no other option.  Imran has been hinting about a possible civil war unless his conditions are met. He mentioned in a TV interview in June last year, ‘We will see if they allow us to go towards elections through legal and constitutional means, otherwise this country will go towards a civil war.’ On occasions Imran has mentioned that a revolution is on the way. His accusations and threats, growing in intensity,pushed the army and the government to a corner compelling them to react,leading to his arrest.  Imran, currently protected by the courts, is facing new accusations daily, including charges for sedition and harbouring terrorists. For the common Pakistani, caught in an unending economic crisis, survival has become a challenge. In this period of darkness, Imran appears as a hope. His insistence of not leaving Pakistan and fighting to the end has given him a messiah like status. His speeches and promises have made the public believe that he will create a utopian medina state. His arrest shattered many dreams.  Few expected levels of violence which flowed, targeting army installations, pushing Pakistan’s most powerful institution on the backfoot. It also displayed cracks within the army’s elite leadership. The army responded in the only way it could, usingits power to break the fabric of Imran’s political party. On Imran’s release by the Supreme Court, it arrested PTI’s second and third rung leaders, followers in thousands and announced recommencing army courts to try protestors under the Army Act, all aimed at conveying to Imran as to what would follow, in case he did not heel.  Imran’s second rung leadership, post a short stint behind bars, where it was possibly lectured and blackmailed, has either gone silent or are leaving the party, aware they would not receive treatment similar to Imran, if they were re-arrested.This has left Imran with few backers to challenge the power of the state.  The fear within the ruling hierarchy of Pak (army and government) is the possible fallout on the next arrest of Imran. It is therefore creating conditions by reducing his stock of followers, handling internal discontent within the army, all of which Imran has absorbed.  When security forces surrounded his Lahore residence last week, Imran sensed his end was near. He began singing a conciliatory tune rather than challenging the state. Instead of accusing the army chief of being against him, Imran promised not to remove him in case he came to power. Imran also surrounded himself with journalists hoping to delay the inevitable.  Adding to his concerns is a depleted and subdued second and third rung leadership. The recent protest by supporters of JUI-F chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, outside the supreme court also sent a message that apart from Imran, others too can muster crowds, implying that in case of future violence, they will challenge Imran’s followers which could enhance violence levels.  The announcement of charging protestors under the Army Act was solely to restrict courts from intervening. Will the top court still attempt to stall the process before it commences is unknown. The decision to establish military courts may be ideal under current circumstances but is likely to enhance anger against the establishment as the first to face its wrath will be the common unprotected blind follower of Imran. The government, in desperation to stall Imran, has accepted the courts for the moment. Possibly at some future stage it may repent, as these very courts may be used against them and their supporters.  The battle between Imran and the establishment may not be in isolation, though it appears to be. It may also be to satisfy global partners, who view Pakistan and Imran with different lens. An unstable Pakistan heading into an internal abyss is not good news. The only institution which has provided some semblance of stability has been the army, despite all its faults, including turning Pak into a quasi-democracy, controlled by it.The IMF playing financial games is on account of the instability.  Imran has few global supporters. His flirting with Turkey’s Erdogan angered the Saudi’s, resulting in the then army chief, General Bajwa rushing to reset ties. The current army chief also has close ties with Riyadh having been a defence attaché there. So is the status with the Sharif’s. It is unlikely that Saudi will bail out Imran as they did to Nawaz and Musharaff.  For China, whose investments in Pak are substantial, a quasi-democracy with the army remaining all powerful is paramount. Governments may come and go but with the army being the guarantor of the CPEC, China is secure. Imran was anti-CPEC till forced by Bajwa to back it. Hence, Imran will get no backing from Beijing. The US too has never been pro-Imran, though 60 members of Congress have written to the Secretary of State on his behalf. For Washington, a powerful army is essential for stability of a nuclear-powered fundamentalist state.  The major concern within Pak is possible public reaction on subsequent arrest of Imran. While the army has pushed the PTI onto the backfoot by incarcerating and subsequently blackmailing its second and third rung leadership, reactions of the common man is unknown. How will the powerful veteran community as also the middle and lower rung of the army react remains a mystery. Pakistan may plunge into a civil war or the violence could be contained in a few days. Simplistically put, the end state is unpredictable.

"political assassination","2020-11-01","Not Discerned","{""Kabul"", ""Kabul"", ""Afghanistan""}","2023-05-22T05:35:20","Afghanistan has earned its status as a centerpiece of the global ‘Great Game’. It has been fought for, sought after for reasons ranging from its strategic location to huge in situ reserves of natural resources and reserves. Standing at the crossroads of Central-South Asia and Middle East, it is believed to be holding more than $ 1 trillion worth of untapped natural/mineral resources and metals.  For Pakistan, it has earned the repute of being its strategic depth owing to reasons ranging from use of the soil by India against Pakistan to cross-border terrorism. While India has capitalized on these threats post 2001 using USA-sponsored regimes in Afghanistan to launch its own hybrid warfare against Pakistan. The dossier released by Pakistan in November, 2020 proposed with evidence the existence of 66 terrorist training camps in Afghanistan that the report alleges were being used to wage terrorism and dismantle economic prospects of the former. Building upon prospects of state sponsored terrorism by India, it maintains that India has been actively involved in rekindling the fusion of Tehreek-eTaliban Pakistan (TTP) with its break away factions, Jammat-ul-Ahrar and Hizbul-Ahrar while also paying more than $820, 000 to TTP through its collaborators.  Owing to its strategic importance, India invested more than $ 3 billion in Afghanistan in about 400 economic projects it launched in the country. 150 projects were still underway when Taliban government took reins in Afghanistan in August 2021. During Ashraf Ghani’s government, India-Iran-Afghanistan Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) had been proposed, whereby India committed $21 billion to expand its Chahbahar project to Hajigak. It is pertinent to mention here that Hajigak holds 1.7 billion tons of untapped iron deposits out of total 2.2 billion tones that Afghanistan is estimated to be holding, placing Afghanistan among top ten countries with extractable iron reserves. About $11 billion worth of Hajigak iron and steel mining project was handed over to consortium of seven Indian companies, together with $ 2 billion commitments for developing supporting infrastructure including Chahbahar –Hajigak Railway. India will never give up on its planned and already attained investment in the country while for Pakistan, it is much favorable to bring in the major shift in its policy towards Afghanistan.  Pakistan, with the Taliban government stands on more favorable grounds contemporarily but owing to Afghanistan’s economic woes-about 28. 3 million people (2/3 of its population) need urgent humanitarian assistance in 2023, according Organization for Coordination of Humanitarian Relief (OCHR)-it is not unlikely for the country to shift alliances.  Pakistan has remained heavily invested in Afghanistan with respect to security affairs. It has been the foremost reason behind its independence from USSR in 1989 and is heavily engaged diplomatically to build interlinkages of the state with the international community for earning the humanitarian benefits for its people. A peaceful, prosperous, stable and connected Afghanistan serves the interest of Pakistan and hence the country continuously commits to pursue continuous and practical engagement with the interim Afghan government.  The atmosphere is now changing with realizations. In the latest Fifth China-Pakistan-Afghanistan Foreign Minister’s Dialogue, The Afghan interim government reiterated its commitment both with Pakistan and China that it would not allow any individual, group or party, including the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ETIM to use its territory against the neighboring countries. The format is of strategic importance in its focus on trilateral economic cooperationto fully harness Afghanistan’s potential as a hub for regional connectivity. Pakistan shall be prudent in this regard as it can reap magnanimous benefits from expansion of CPEC to Afghanistan, as proposed. Ad hocism must be avoided to maximize mutual benfit under such overtures in such a manner that national interest is attained.  For its part, Pakistan has spent more than $ 1 billion in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, and invested heavily in capacity building of Afghanistan, including 72 km Torkhum Jalalabad Road and 400 bed Jinnah Hospital worth $118. 8 million while also training 644 Afghan police and drug control officers, among others. Keeping up with its commitments of capacity building in Afghanistan, it has also been providing high-end assistance as that of road construction machinery, mobile hot mixers, generators, medicines, ambulances and trucks among others. More than $ 5 billion in in-kind humanitarian assistance has also bene provided.  Although such overtures intensify Pakistan’s standing in bilateral relations with Afghanistan but bilateral consolidation would require early completion of such projects as that of TAPI, CASA-1000, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan power transmission line among others. Such projects serve dual purpose for Pakistan: Afghanistan that protects the interest of Pakistan and regional consolidation that would mean raising Pakistan to higher pedestals when it comes to regionalism and hence International affairs.  How Afghanistan realigns itself socially and politically will have long-term consequences for the entire region and the world. States continue to seek their own vested interests in the process. It is long-term, strategic and holistically calibrated policy making and intense economic investment on bilateral and multilateral levels that can pit Afghanistan in favor of Pakistan as compared to India, in the long run.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vbW9kZXJuZGlwbG9tYWN5LmV1LzIwMjMvMDUvMjIvaW5kby1wYWstZ2FtZS1vZi1pbmZsdWVuY2UtaW4tYWZnaGFuaXN0YW4td2hvLWlzLXdpbm5pbmcv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9tb2Rlcm5kaXBsb21hY3kuZXUvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9pbmRvLXBhay1nYW1lLW9mLWluZmx1ZW5jZS1pbi1hZmdoYW5pc3Rhbi13aG8taXMtd2lubmluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2019-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T00:07:00","New York was a vital cog in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, but it’s California where those pushing for reparations to the descendants of enslaved people are making progress.  A task force in California has proposed a series of recommendations for compensating descendants of the formerly enslaved, including cash payments that could top $1 million, for lost wealth and opportunity dating to the state's birth in 1850.  The panel identified “Historical Atrocities” beyond slavery, touching on voting, housing, education, and mass incarceration, among other areas. In addition to the payments, it recommends a formal apology for state-sanctioned racism.  The future of the California proposals, which have been met with skepticism, is highly uncertain, but the effort is gaining attention back East, where “enslavement is a defining feature of New York City’s origin story,” as a 2022 report by the Montgomery, Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative put it. The Golden State, by contrast, was not technically a “slave state,” though it allowed enslavement to endure for many years.  “When people lead with the pessimistic question of, ‘This is not feasible, why are you wasting your time?’ we have no idea of what is feasible or not, tomorrow or the next day,” said Darrick Hamilton, the founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at The New School, and a member of New York City’s Racial Justice Commission. “The point is to commit to justice because it’s the right thing to do.”  The task force’s final report is expected to go to the California legislature this summer.  Here is a primer on reparations and where things stand.  Why is anyone talking about reparations?  The issue goes back to the earliest days of emancipation, with the promise of “40 Acres and a Mule” to formerly enslaved families by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. After President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, his successor Andrew Johnson reversed course and reparations remained illusory. But in recent years, the Black Lives Matter movement rekindled calls for reparations, as have journalists like Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose article, “The Case for Reparations,” in 2014 spurred a vigorous national debate.  This extended even to northern cities like New York, where historians say institutional racism and segregation deprived generations of Black families of wealth. And it isn’t just government institutions considering such action. The Episcopal Diocese of New York has set aside endowment funds for a future reparations project.  But California wasn’t a “slave state,” what’s the fuss?  California technically opposed slavery, but it flourished there nonetheless. In any case, the state task force was created in 2020 amid the racial reckoning that followed the killing of George Floyd. It held numerous public hearings and looked beyond slavery. It noted in its May 6 report that the state and its most powerful officials played a significant role in the subjugation of Black residents. “California — its executive branch, courts, and Legislature — denied African Americans their fundamental liberties and denied their humanity throughout the state’s history, from before the Civil War to the present,” the commission wrote in its report.  The state’s policies extended through the 19th and 20th centuries, and included practices such as over-policing, “separate and unequal education,” environmental racism and housing segregation, according to the panel. “In California, the federal, state, and local government created segregation through redlining, zoning ordinances, decisions on where to build schools and highways and discriminatory federal mortgage policies,” the commission.  Where's New York on reparations?  New York doesn’t have a reparations commission, but it isn’t for lack of trying or subject matter.  A bill to create a commission, tasked with confronting “the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery in the City of New York and the State of New York,” remains in committee in the state Senate. In 2021 the bill passed in the state Assembly, under sponsor Charles Barron. “Never in the history of New York state has that happened,” Barron said Friday.  The 2022 report by the Equal Justice Initiative found that by 1730, “42% of New York City’s white residents directly enslaved Black people. For most of the 18th century, enslaved people comprised approximately 20% of the city’s population.”  By 1771, according to the report, 33% of the residents in modern-day Brooklyn were enslaved Africans. By the 19th century, an estimated 40% of all revenue from the U.S. cotton trade poured into New York City, primarily through financial firms and shipping companies that managed the trafficking of human bodies.  Why is New York taking a backseat on this issue?  Close observers of reparations argue that the state’s reputation as a cultural frontrunner is often overstated.  “The perception of New York is that it is a leading state,” said Cynthia Copeland, a public historian who served as the co-chair of the Reparations Commission of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. “But often, I find through history, that New York is wanting to be very conservative, and kind of drags its feet.”  She noted that New York abolished slavery in 1827, well after other states had done so.  However, she added, “Once New Yorkers do determine that an issue is really of great importance, we really do put our feet to the fire and move things forward.”  What’s the biggest obstacle to reparations in California?  The biggest, according to critics, is the price tag. The commission hasn’t identified sources of reparations funding, which could exceed $800 billion in a state that has a $300 billion annual budget, and any recommendations would need to be approved by the state legislature. Gov. Gavin Newsom has already generated controversy by stating that “dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments,” remarks that were widely interpreted as an attempt to downplay the likelihood of large cash payouts.  But it isn’t just about the money: A 2021 poll by the Pew Research Center found that 30% of Americans favor reparations payments while 68% are opposed.  What about the federal government?  For many proponents, reparations is ultimately something that needs to happen at the federal level.  “The reality is that the federal government is the entity with both the moral authority and the monetary sovereignty to implement in full force a reparations program,” said Hamilton, the director of the Institute on Race and Political Economy at The New School.  However, he said, momentum builds at the local and state levels, and other scholars argue that states have been complicit in racial inequity.  “States had a lot of leeway in applying federal policies, so they bear a tremendous responsibility for federal wrongs,” said Jovan Scott Lewis, chair of the Department of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of California’s Reparations Task Force.  In any case, Congress has its hands full doing ordinary things, like paying its bills. Talks in Washington to raise the U.S. debt ceiling stalled on Friday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZ290aGFtaXN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL255LXBsYXllZC1hLWtleS1yb2xlLWluLXRoZS1zbGF2ZS10cmFkZS1idXQtY2FsaWZvcm5pYXMtbGVhZGluZy1vbi1yZXBhcmF0aW9uc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Arnolfo Teves Jr.  In the coming session, Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon (Ako Bicol party-list)—committee chairperson—said Teves’ application for asylum in Timor Leste will weigh in on the panel’s recommendation to the House plenary.  In an interview with DZBB on Sunday, Bongalon said the committee will convene on Tuesday, a day after the 60-day suspension earlier issued against Teves will expire.  He said they will discuss “the possibility to enforce whatever sanction or penalty to be recommended to the House plenary.”  The lawmaker said that in the House rules, there are two remaining sanctions left: Expulsion and “any penalty the committee may determine.”  Teves left for the United States in March and has repeatedly refused to come home, citing his fear for his life, despite assurances even from the Philippine president for his safety.  The Department of Justice has pointed to Teves as the mastermind behind the brazen assassination of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo last March 7. Complaints accusing him of murder have been filed before the DOJ just last week.  As the lawmaker from Negros Oriental continued to stay abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs said the government of Timor-Leste has rejected his application for political asylum—which, Bongalon said, in his view, can affect their committee’s discussion.  He said that seeking political asylum in a different country means “you are seeking refuge in a foreign country,” which may imply that Teves no longer believes in the Philippines ‘own government and justice system.’  No participation  Bongalon added the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges exercise general jurisdiction on all matters directly and principally relating to the duties conduct, rights, and privileges, immunities, dignity, integrity and reputation of the House.  Through this, the panel acquired jurisdiction to conduct a motu proprio investigation into Teves’ continued absence since this concerns the “dignity and reputation of the House,” the lawmaker added.  “In the case of [Teves], the issue is expired travel clearance. His stay outside the Philippines is no longer authorized by the House of Representatives,” Bongalon said.  Although the House has since adopted hybrid proceedings, Bongalon pointed out that Teves’ trip to the US is a personal trip that requires travel clearance.  “The function of a representative is to legislate laws. We cannot expect our representative to participate if he is not authorized or not actively participating in sessions and committee meetings,” he stressed. — Philstar.com/GAN (FREEMAN)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS90aGUtZnJlZW1hbi9jZWJ1LW5ld3MvYm90dG9tLWFydGljbGUtbGlzdC8yMDIzLzA1LzIyLzIyNjgxMDcvaG91c2UtZXRoaWNzLWNvbW1pdHRlZS1kZWNpZGUtdGV2ZXMtZmF0ZdIBgwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vdGhlLWZyZWVtYW4vY2VidS1uZXdzL2JvdHRvbS1hcnRpY2xlLWxpc3QvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi8yMjY4MTA3L2hvdXNlLWV0aGljcy1jb21taXR0ZWUtZGVjaWRlLXRldmVzLWZhdGUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Drawing attention to a past assassination attempt on his life, the cricketer-turned-politician expressed lingering concerns for his personal safety.  “Right now in Pakistan there is no rule of law.

During the interview, Imran expressed his puzzlement over General Munir’s apparent animosity towards him, stating, “I haven’t done anything to antagonise the army chief, but there is something he has against me which I don’t know.”  He accused the police of arresting around 7,500 protestors believed to be affiliated with his party.

"political assassination","2013-09-17","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T11:03:23","For the 19 months remaining in her term, Sen. Dianne Feinstein will have just one job: Show up to work and vote the Democratic Party line.  The bar for California’s 89-year-old senator has dropped that low as she returns from her nearly three-month absence while she battled complications from shingles.  The 39 million Californians Feinstein represents can’t expect one of the state’s most accomplished politicians to be an orator. Or to even meet and talk to constituents — virtually or in person. Or to engage in more than passing, sound-byte interviews with the media that often generate confusion and concern. California’s other senator, Sen. Alex Padilla, has done 38 long-form interviews this year and attended 15 events in California.  Feinstein won’t grill witnesses in committee hearings. She will read what her staff has written for her. At the first Judiciary Committee meeting she attended after returning to work, an Associated Press photo captured what her staff had written in large type for her to say: “I ask to be recorded as voting in person on the three nominees considered earlier.”  It has come to that.  She will have a hard time leveraging her lifetime of centrist stances to form coalitions with moderate Republicans, like she has done for much of her three decades in the Senate. Or to be an out-front advocate for gun safety as she once was. Or to be a check on the CIA’s excesses, as she famously did a decade ago, even when it meant staring down President Barack Obama, a fellow Democrat.  Those days are over for the pioneering politician — the first woman to be mayor of San Francisco and, along with Barbara Boxer, to represent California in the Senate. On her first day back to the Senate this month, Feinstein said “my doctors have advised me to work a lighter schedule as I return.”  That’s totally understandable. Nobody begrudges Feinstein her time to recover. But if she, her family and close circle of confidants believe she is well enough to return, California voters deserve straight, coherent answers on her condition.  And about everything.  My colleague Shira Stein reported that Feinstein’s office confirmed she has suffered complications from her shingles diagnosis, including Ramsay Hunt syndrome — characterized by facial paralysis and hearing loss — and encephalitis. The latter can cause confusion and disorientation, irritability, memory loss and cognitive impairment, Stein reported.  That diagnosis was apparently news to the senator.  CNN’s Manu Raju reported Thursday that Feinstein stated “she did not have encephalitis, saying it ‘really has never been diagnosed.’ ”  “It was a really bad flu,” she said.  No, it wasn’t.  Days after her return, reporters asked her about the ovation she received from her fellow senators after being gone for months.  “I’ve been here,” Feinstein said. “I’ve been voting. Please, either know or don’t know.”  Those conversations sound alarming. A more charitable interpretation might be that maybe Feinstein meant that her condition was like having a really bad flu. Or maybe she really is out of it. Voters can’t know because Feinstein has dashed off after these quickie D.C. hallway interactions before they are fully clarified.  Yes, now that Feinstein is back, Democrats are able to approve the more liberal judicial nominees who were stalled in the Judiciary Committee because of her absence. And her vote will probably be crucial to Democrats in the upcoming debt ceiling standoff.  But how much of a distraction will her reality-challenged comments be to Democrats? Feinstein’s staff might as well carry around mops for all the messes they’re going to have to clean up for the next year and a half.  Feinstein became one of California’s most popular politicians over the years in part because she often appeared to be a trusted, moderate voice of sanity in a state that occasionally lacks them. At her peak in 2001, 57% of voters approved of Feinstein, according to the Field Poll. In February that dipped to 35%, according to a Berkeley IGS Poll. The survey found that 64% of respondents were glad that she was not seeking re-election, including 60% of Democrats.  Hearing directly from Feinstein would go a long way to soothe fears about whether she can still do the job, but her office has rejected invitations for a long-form interview. The Chronicle and other outlets have reported that Feinstein is surrounded by a phalanx of aides who allow very little media access.  Her response is markedly different from that of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who was absent from the Senate after checking himself into Walter Reed Military Medical Center to be treated for clinical depression. Soon after he returned, he consented to multiple in-depth, often emotionally raw interviews.  Feinstein has yet ​​to agree to a sit down, in-person interview. California voters deserve at least that.  Until then, questions will continue to swirl around her illness and return — and how it affects the race to replace her in the Senate next year.  Last week, some outlets wondered why Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi’s eldest daughter, Nancy Corinne Prowda, has been by Feinstein’s side daily since her return to Washington. The New York Times wrote that “some have read Ms. Prowda’s involvement as a tacit endorsement by Ms. Pelosi of Ms. Feinstein’s decision to stay on, reasoning that it could give Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and Ms. Pelosi’s chosen candidate in the crowded race to replace Ms. Feinstein in 2024, a leg up.”  Pelosi spokesperson Aaron Bennett responded that Pelosi and Feinstein are longtime friends “and their friendship is personal, not political. Anyone who knows Senator Feinstein knows that her service in the Senate is entirely her own decision, and Speaker Emerita Pelosi would never suggest otherwise.”  Replied Schiff campaign communications director Marisol Samayoa: “Senator Feinstein is a valued colleague and friend of the congressman, and his concern over the last few months has been for her health, not the politics of it. He’s glad that she felt well enough to return, and that her work confirming judges and stopping a dangerous default goes on.”  Feinstein’s final months in public service don’t have to be this way. She could be more like another California Democrat who was out of office for months battling health ailments, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord.  DeSaulnier is one of few people who can provide a window into what it’s like to return to Congress after a long illness. DeSaulnier has done it twice. In 2015, the 71-year-old DeSaulnier took time off to recover from cancer. In 2020, he hovered near death after a fall where doctors gave him a 10% chance to survive. He spent two months in the hospital.  What was different — and refreshing in the often furtive and opaque world of politics — was DeSaulnier’s transparency with voters during both of those ordeals. He felt he owed it to his employers — the citizens of California — to be up front with them about his health.  “I’ve always maintained that, if I’m myself, and the voters aren’t comfortable with me, then I’m cool with that,” DeSaulnier told me. “But if I’m going to project something that I’m not, then I don’t really want the job.”  DeSaulnier learned that lesson during his first campaign for Concord City Council more than three decades ago (when he was a Republican, by the way). He was canvassing voters door-to-door with a reporter in tow. The journalist told him that he knew that his father, a former member of the Massachusetts legislature and later a Superior Court judge, was disbarred for grossly improper conduct and resigned in 1972 after being accused of accepting a $60,000 bribe. Years later, DeSaulnier’s father took his own life.  DeSaulnier ignored political advisers at the time who warned him that was all that voters would remember about him. Far from it. His transparency has been a key to his success. DeSaulnier went on to serve in local, county, state and federal offices.  He could have resigned from office after his near-death experience in 2020. But what kept him going was the response he got from his constituents in reaction to his openness about the struggles he was facing.  He remembers sitting in his Washington apartment with his son and daughter-in-law shortly after being released from the hospital, reading mounds of supportive letters and emails from people inspired by his journey.  “They were so genuine and emotive,” DeSaulnier said. He recalled the Catholic Mass sermons he heard growing up where the priest “would say, ‘If you want to live a good life, imagine yourself at your own funeral and what would you want people who cared about you to say about you.’ I could read what people wrote about me.”  DeSaulnier said that motivated him to get back to work.  “Whatever put me in this position and kept me alive, I wanted to respect it by getting back to work. Not just to get back just to get back to work, but doing it in a thoughtful and responsible way,” he said.  It would be great to hear — from Feinstein — what is motivating her to stay in office when she has nothing left to prove.  The other day, her longtime political consultant Bill Carrick told me that “she feels a sense of duty and commitment to serve out a term. It’s just her.”  Feinstein has felt that sense of responsibility since she was a child, the eldest offspring of a mother who suffered from then-undiagnosed mental illness, the protector of her younger siblings. She felt it when she was abruptly thrust into the mayor’s office in 1978 after the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk — just a short time after she was privately considering ending her political career.  “I’ve learned through all this — through death, through illness — this is what I’m meant to do,” Feinstein told me on The Chronicle’s “It’s All Political” podcast in 2018. “It sounds like I’m on some kind of messianic mission. That’s not the case. But you do figure out what you’re meant to do. I’ve tried to serve people.”  DeSaulnier is a friend and supporter of Feinstein, even though he is far more progressive. They shared a mutual close friend in the late Rep. Ellen Tauscher, one of few in Feinstein’s inner circle. He trusts his friends, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, to handle the situation deftly.  “She’s back. She’s voting. We’re moving people (confirming judges). I think that’s a good outcome,” DeSaulnier said.  But don’t Californians deserve more from their senator?  “I have a unique perspective because this could happen to anyone,” DeSaulnier said, before quoting the Bible. “ ‘Judge not, lest you be judged.’ She’s showing up.”  For the foreseeable future, that’s all California voters will get.  Note: An earlier version of this story misstated the length of time remaining in Sen. Feinstein's term. She has approximately 19 months left to serve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9qb2VnYXJvZm9saS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZlaW5zdGVpbi1kZXNhdWxuaWVyLXJldHVybi10by13b3JrLTE4MTA3NjIxLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T04:11:16","Treason has for hundreds of years been considered one of the most serious offences that a person can commit.  Whilst the criminal offence of treason dates at least as far back as Roman times, the vagaries and inconsistencies in what may amount to the offence are so vast and varied that, for the purposes of this article, we shall focus on when the legislation was enacted in England in 1351.  Vagueries and application  The ancient Roman words for treason, being ‘perduellio’ (generally high treason) and ‘maiestas’ (more common form of treason with several forms of spelling), varied confusingly in both definition and consequences over time.  However, this didn’t stop the English from reinstating Roman law when it suited them, as will later be explained.  This article will also take a look at some of the dynamics involved within the United Kingdom countries involving execution of royalty for treason in their individual quest for dominance from the late 1200s.  This includes one date when there was civil unrest not only in England but also the other UK countries involving King Charles 1 which is a story for another article which culminated in three civil wars.  The King was around for only two of them having been executed before the third one.  This will be followed by the outline of a number of other significant cases of treason which also ended in the execution of those who were convicted.  Within those dynamics we will draw attention to the colonisation of Canada where similar to other countries including Australia, the Indigenous peoples suffered in many ways. Particularly, the focus will be on the Metis Nation, one of three Indigenous peoples of Canada.  Origin and definition  The term treason is derived from Latin and Anglo-French language such as ‘Traditionem’ and ‘Treson’ or ‘Traison’ meaning to hand over or deliver by betrayal.  England in 1351 saw King Edward 111 give Royal Assent to the Treason Act which commenced about 14 years after the start of the 100 Year War against France.  Ireland got it in 1495 and next came Scotland much later in 1708. Wales had earlier been conquered in the late 1200s.  Treason is one of the rarest charges in legislation and still carries up to life imprisonment. In some countries ,the penalty is execution if convicted.  This crime includes significant offences against a country and/or its monarch by word or deed and includes spying, armed coups and incitement of wars.  Those who are involved in such actions are called traitors.  No death is a good death  Death by hanging within the British Empire was not a quick affair as it included torture by being dragged backwards by horses with the head on the ground to the gallows (place of execution).  The next process included hanging until close to death with the final indignation being the severing of genitals, removal of the heart and disembowelment.  Finally, what followed was decapitation with the body being quartered (cut into 4 parts) and the body parts put on public display in order to deter further treasonous acts by traitors to the Crown. Women were treated differently with being drawn and burned being the preferred method, apparently to protect their dignity.  Whilst the Treason Act 1814 (UK) changed the law in relation to the convicted male traitor to be hanged until dead, the heinous acts of dismemberment continued until 1870.  The women were no better off with the abolishment of being burned at the stake in the Treason Act 1790 apart from the fact beheading was the substitute and if one was really lucky, transportation was the punishment, particularly after the enactment of the Treason Felony Act of 1848.  Royal executions for treason  Sir William Wallace was a Scottish Knight who if alive today would have challenged Nicola Sturgeon for control of the Scottish National Party.  Sir William’s defeat of the English at the Battle of Stirling in 1297 paved the way for King Edward 1 to eventually add rebellion to the legislation of treason. Wallace was ultimately hung, drawn and quartered for High Treason in a place called Smithfield in London.  King Robert 1, otherwise known as Robert the Bruce was King of Scotland at one stage during the first war of Scottish independence.  His reign was from 1306 until his death in 1329. He was the victor of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 defeating King Edward 11’s English army and paving the way for Scottish independence in 1328 cemented by the Treaty of Edinburgh.  Robert the Bruce did not suffer execution for treason.  King Charles 1 ruler of England (and in essence Wales), Scotland and Ireland found himself the subject of a charge of treason against his own subjects after a decade long feud between he and his parliament from 1639 until his trial in 1649.  As legally the King could not be tried under the 1351 Treason Act as politicians have a won’t to do, they reinstated Roman Law which had a provision for a tyrant King to face a charge of treason.  The King was executed in 1649 in front of the Banqueting House in Whitehall London. One could not imagine a more squeamish setting had diners been present!  11 years later the monarchy was back in power with the son of King Charles 1 taking his father’s throne back and avenging Charles execution by gathering the regicides (those involved in the deliberate killing of a monarch in the form of a coup) and killing them all under the 1351 Treason Act.  This not only avenged his father’s death but sent a message certain to offer added protection to future monarchs. The Stuarts were back in town!  The cause of the initial feud between the king and parliament  The feud between King Charles 1 and his parliament involved money in relation to fight wars abroad and threatening his MPs that he would rule without parliament.  In addition, the King preferred the High Anglican form of worship which concerned the Puritan Protestants notwithstanding that his wife Queen Henrietta Maria of France was Catholic thus creating suspicion.  And on it went, the never-ending story of treason and executions with the 1351 Treason Act manipulated to suit those it served best. As indeed were subsequent Acts.  Most infamous acts of treasonable offences  Bonfire Night on each 5 November is celebrated by millions of people the world over and is regarded as a celebration of when the treasonable act of assassination of King James 1 was averted in 1605.  Guido (Guy) Fawkes ultimately convicted of High Treason who orchestrated the gunpowder plot to blow up the British parliament with the intention of killing the King is the reason for the celebration of Guy Fawkes night.  On this night the world skies light up in the glow of massive bonfires and a variety of colourful and sophisticated fireworks called roman candles – catherine wheels – fountains – mines – sparklers – repeaters and rockets are ignited which fly up into the sky.  The fireworks during the execution of Guy Fawkes and his co-conspirators were also enjoyed by thousands of spectators but of course not by the convicted. This was primarily because whilst alive the persons under sentence had their genitals sliced off and thrown into a fire before their very eyes, if indeed they were conscious.  Guy Fawkes though denied the King the satisfaction of this repulsive act of indignation of this part of his punishment by allegedly throwing himself from the gallows which broke his neck. It did not however stop the barbarous process from occurring.  Benedict Arnold  Despite earlier being regarded as an American hero of the American War of Independence, Benedict Arnold became a traitor who committed treason when he defected to the British Armed Forces around 1779.  Winning the war resulted in the establishment of the United States of America having achieved independence from the British Empire and forming a modern constitutional democracy.  Mr Arnold however never faced justice for his treason and indeed went on to fight against his country as a British army officer eventually retiring to England, dishonoured and disillusioned.  Canadian Indigenous peoples  The 1885 trial of a Canadian politician and leader of the Metis Nation Louis Riel who led two resistance movements against the Canadian government to preserve the Metis peoples rights – history – culture – language and lifestyle resulted in his execution for treason.  The Indigenous Metis are one of three constitutionally recognised Indigenous communities of Canada. He was hanged for High Treason but his legacy led to the Canadian government recognizing the Aboriginal peoples in the Canadian constitution where the Metis Nation was enshrined within it.  The other two Indigenous peoples are Indians and the Inuit.  In 1992, Canada passed a resolution recognizing Mr Riel as the founder of Manitoba with the Metis Nation ultimately being granted 1.25 million acres in Alberta, although they settled all over Canada and of course in many countries of the world.  Their language which is Michif and is a combination of Cree & French is currently endangered with fewer than several hundred Metis Nation citizens still fluent. However, programs are in progress to preserve their cultural language.  This is not far removed from what every colonised Indigenous First Nation Peoples could have experienced, including our own Australian Aboriginals and the potential dangers they faced with the enactment of the Treason Act, albeit several centuries later.  For history has shown that you didn’t have to lead an armed resistance movement against the government to face a charge of treason or many other criminal charges.  Lord Haw-Haw  1946 saw the prosecution of Lord Haw-Haw whose real name was William Brooke Joyce, an American born Fascist who assisted Germany during World War II by broadcasting Nazi propaganda and who was executed by hanging.  Julius and Ethel Rosenberg  American citizens and members of the Young Communists League, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of the treasonable charge of conspiracy to commit espionage (spying for the Soviet Union).  History appears to vindicate Ethel as being a traitor and only reports Julius as being a minor participant in treason, however this is countered by other historians quoting Soviet Union documentation said to have been released after the fall of communism.  This related to passing on to the Russians, US military electronic material from a radio factory associated with Julius’ employment as an electrical engineer at the Army Signal Corp engineering laboratories.  The charge however referred to providing information to the USSR in relation to the atomic bomb which Ethel’s brother was involved in and what was known as the Manhattan Project developing nuclear weapons.  Her brother David Greenglass turned informer resulting in his sister and brother-in-law being executed by the ‘electric chair’ in the notorious Sing Sing Prison in 1953.  The most infamous traitor or the most remarkable hero of human rights  Exposing to the world from 2010 heinous abuses of human rights, war crimes and corruption versus the risk to the national security of nations and individual agents of those nations.  UK Amnesty International, Le Monde, Time Media Choice and the Sydney Peace Foundation gold medal for peace with justice, were awards presented to Julian Assange which concur with President Obama’s Department of Justice comments on Wikileaks publishing of classified information which concluded with:  “such a prosecution would pose a severe threat to press freedom because there would be no way to prosecute Assange for publishing classified documents without also prosecuting the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian and others for doing exactly the same thing.  It would not and could not do so, consistent with the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment.”  This question has been and continues to be debated in many legal jurisdictions at the highest level with no clear result appearing imminent but still Australian citizen Julian Assange languishes in a British prison.  The United States, the country where Mr Assange is the ‘Most Wanted’ wasn’t always of this opinion. The Barack Obama 44th Presidency decreed that he was not America’s most wanted however President Obama’s sentiment didn’t last long.  The Donald Trump 45th Presidency decided that he was America’s most wanted as indeed does America’s current Joe Biden’s 46thPresidency.  Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard during her tenure stated that his actions were illegal, whilst the Australian Federal Police (AFP) commented that he had not broken any laws. Strong anecdotal evidence suggested by leaked National Security Agency (NSA) documents indicate that in 2010 Mr Assange was on what was called a US ‘manhunting timeline’ which was a reference to a clandestine national effort to capture or kill terrorists and others.  For the moment Julian Assange continues to languish in a British Prison awaiting his fate. For a detailed summary of Mr Assange’s predicament refer to recent SCL article titled ‘The Belmarsh Tribunal’.  Legal implications of being associated with treason  Australia, like that of many countries has Federal and State laws in relation to the offence of treason. The New South Wales perspective on this crime leaves nothing to the imagination about how serious this offence is regarded.  It is clear that any harm whatsoever to the King, his heir or any citizen representing the monarch in Australia (such as the Prime Minister and the Governor-General) in any overt or covert manner shall see such a person:  ‘guilty of an indictable offence called treason and liable to level 1 imprisonment (life); or imprisonment for such other term as is fixed by the court as the court so determines.’  Further, any person who helps someone whom to their knowledge is guilty of treason or intends to commit treason and doesn’t inform the authorities shall be guilty of an indictable offence with the penalty being:  ‘Life Imprisonment also or imprisonment for such other term as is fixed by the court as the court so determines.’  The current offence of treason in Australia  Treason is an offence under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), which is an offence that applies across the nation and carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.  To establish the offence, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that you:  Killed the sovereign, sovereign’s heir, governor-general or prime minister, or Harmed the sovereign, governor-general or prime minister leading to their death, or Harmed, imprisoned or restrained the sovereign, governor-general or prime minister, or Levied war, or undertook an act preparing for war, against the Commonwealth, or Instigated a non-citizen to invade the Commonwealth, or one of its territories.  Self-defence is a legal defence to the charge.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN5ZG5leWNyaW1pbmFsbGF3eWVycy5jb20uYXUvYmxvZy90aGUtY3JpbWluYWwtb2ZmZW5jZS1vZi10cmVhc29uLWRlZmluaXRpb24tZXZvbHV0aW9uLWFuZC1wb2xpdGljYWwtYXBwbGljYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2016-08-15","Not Discerned","{""Rajshahi"", ""Rajshahi"", ""Bangladesh""}","2023-05-21T18:20:31","By Sahidul Hasan Khokon: A video of a BNP leader, which is the opposition party in Bangladesh, is making rounds on social media where he is heard giving an open threat to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying 'Send Sheikh Hasina to her grave'.  Abu Sayeed Chan, a top BNP leader from Rajshahi, has publicly directed his activists for the 1975-styled assassination bid against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in an oblique reference to the gruesome massacre of almost her entire family in a military coup then.  advertisement  “No more movement to realise our 27-point or ten-point demands. Rather, our movement now should only revolve around one point- send Sheikh Hasina to her grave”, threatened Abu Sayeed Chan, convener, Rajshahi Zila unit.  Sheikh Hasina's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, and members of his family were killed in cold blood on August 15th, 1975, by senior army officers, which plunged Bangladesh into political chaos. The massacre resulted in a military regime running the country for a number of years, thereby suspending the democratic process.  The BNP leaders have been calling for the ouster of this government in the next three months without an election. After the video went viral, Bangladesh Awami League’s verified Facebook page posted the clip with a caption “BNP publicly threatens to assassinate our leader Sheikh Hasina”.

This latest round of threat came months after a Juba Dal leader publicly threatened to restage “another 1975 kind of incident"", pointing to the grisly massacre that saw as many as 19 family members of Sheikh Hasina including her father, mother, sister among others gunned down by a group of disgruntled army officers, and journalists believed to be backed by powerful countries.  “Take up arms and restage another 1975,” Abdul Kader Bhuiyan, secretary of the Volunteer Front, a wing of the BNP had threatened months back.  Sheikh Hasina has already survived more than 19 assassination attempts, including the grenade attack in 2004 on an Awami League rally, in which around 32 leaders and activists were killed. BNP’s acting Chairperson Tarique Rahman has been convicted by a court for his involvement in planning the grenade attack.  Calling Abu Sayeed Chan's statement a “pointer of death threat”, Bangladesh's Muktijuddho Mancha, has demanded the immediate arrest of the BNP leader.

"political assassination","2020-10-15","Not Discerned","{""Kingston"", ""Kingston"", ""Jamaica""}","2023-05-21T07:01:45","Last week’s flurry of diplomatic discussions in Kingston didn’t produce a breakthrough on how to help Haiti out of its worsening security crisis. Which only means that Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) have to hunker down further and not, as is too often the case, succumb to Haiti fatigue.  In this regard, a planned meeting in Kingston between CARICOM and Haiti’s political factions in Kingston must work overtime at helping to build internal consensus on the way forward. Jamaica must further assert leadership in this process.  As a close neighbour, Jamaica not only has a legitimate interest in Haiti’s internal security, but it is best suited among Port-au-Prince’s CARICOM’s partners to perform the role of honest-broker. Jamaica-Haiti relations haven’t historically been characterised by the angst that is often a feature of relations between Haiti and some of its other northern Caribbean neighbours.  It is significant, therefore, that Prime Minister Andrew Holness appears to have treated Jamaica’s involvement in the process not as a pro forma endeavour, but as a matter to which he has attached his specific imprimatur, notwithstanding the larger CARICOM frame within which the initiative is set.  GO FURTHER  The prime minister should, however, go further. He should appoint a highly respected and experienced former diplomat as his special representative/envoy on Haiti, charged with engaging with all political factions in the country, as well as the international community, to maintain momentum and more sharply inform the Jamaica/CARICOM response to the crisis.  Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.  Doing so wouldn’t mean the incapacity of Jamaica’s foreign ministry, and its leader, Kamina Johnson Smith, to deal with the Haitian question. Rather, the matter demands the type of urgent, dirty fingernails political engagement for which, given their many other obligations, Ms Johnson Smith and her technocrats are unlikely to have the time, or for which that machinery is best suited.  Haiti’s long-standing political crisis deepened with the July 2021 assassination of the country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, and the failure, since then, of political factions to settle on a process for the return to constitutional government and the restoration of democratic norms. The situation has worsened over the past year with the escalation of gang violence that has overwhelmed the capacity of the tottering state.  In this respect, Haiti, as was implied by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, during his visit to Jamaica last week, has a policing problem whose solution is more in the civil realm rather than a heavy-booted, militarily focused intervention that characterised previous interventions, of which Haitians, of most stripes, are suspicious. Policing has to be backed by political action to help foster trust among the country’s notoriously fractious political class and to build capacity to shore up the state.  Mr Guterres, as he reminded during his Kingston visit, has asked the Security Council to back support for equipment and training of Haiti’s national police and for the “the presence of an international robust police force to crack down on the gangs”.  Two issues primarily have so far confounded the secretary general’s effort. Many countries with the capacity to help are reluctant to do so. For some, Haiti isn’t an urgent or even important policy priority on which to expend political capital, especially if there is a possibility of becoming mired in a long, politically fraught operation.  LOW LEVELS OF TRUST  And there is, from the side of many Haitians, low levels of trust for the international community – born in large measure out of behaviour of outsiders, and undelivered promises of past interventions.  CARICOM, of which Haiti is a member, brings greater trust to the table. The community, however, without the capacity to undertake, on its own, the necessary policing action that must be in parallel with a political settlement. How these issues are reconciled, while also providing support for Haiti’s long-term development, remains outstanding.  At their meeting in Jamaica last week, CARICOM’s foreign ministers reiterated the community’s “continued commitment to stand with Haiti and leverage support from international partners to support efforts on the ground”.  A subsequent meeting between the regional ministers and the British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, declared a “commitment to working towards achieving durable solutions to the multidimensional crises affecting the Republic of Haiti … and promote continued international attention and support for Haiti towards the relief of the present suffering of the Haitian people”.  Obviously, wealthy nations, in particular those whose actions contributed to the pauperisation of Haiti and the undermining of its political and institutional development, have an obligation to economically support its transition and stability and democracy. Their active, on-the-ground involvement, however, would likely be fraught.  Fundamentally, Haiti is foremost a Caribbean and Latin American problem, to be solved primarily by the Haitian people with the support of their neighbours, who share many of the same issues. Which is why we repeat a previous suggestion that CARICOM, as part of the community’s initiative, place the Haitian issue formally on the agenda of the Organization of American States, seeking the hemisphere’s help in dealing with the internal security situation.  Brazil is the country that could readily muster a civil force of the required size and capacity for a policing operation. That would be potentially problematic given the experiences of many Haitians with Brazilian soldiers under UN’s command in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. However, the return of Lula as Brazil’s president offers a greater political and ideological alignment that would make a CARICOM-led initiative, with Brazilian support, not only palatable, but workable.  Prime Minister Holness and his Haiti envoy, should he adopt this suggestion, should quickly pursue this option.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvMjAyMzA1MjEvZWRpdG9yaWFsLWh1bmtlci1kb3duLWhhaXRp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Sullivan about the reportedly botched missile strike, which the Pentagon initially claimed was a successful assassination of a “senior Al Qaeda leader,” but later backtracked and launched an investigation. Sullivan said he could not comment on the matter until the Pentagon’s “full and thorough investigation” was complete – and instead touted President Biden’s record on military accountability.  “It was President Biden who stood up with Secretary Austin’s guidelines for this administration to ensure there would be accountability and oversight of any potential civilian casualties from counterterrorism strikes,” Sullivan said. “So far we do not have evidence to validate the claims being made in Syria.

International Tea Day is celebrated on May 21, with the aim of promoting the production and consumption of this infusion in the world and raising awareness about the importance of this plant to end hunger and poverty in the world.  Consult everything published about ephemeris in The voice.  In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly made International Tea Day official.  But since 2005 this anniversary has been celebrated in the world, thanks to countries like China, India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Turkey, Japan, among other large producers, who have wanted to captivate humanity with the many benefits it brings to health. this plant.  The origin of tea  Although the origin of tea is unknown for sure, the most internationally known legend is that of the Chinese emperor Shen Nung and dates back to the year 2737 BC.  As the story goes, the Emperor only drank boiled water for health reasons. One day, while he was heating this liquid under a tree, a strong breeze blew and some leaves fell into the bowl of water.  Shen Nung was amazed to see how the leaves colored the liquid, but what he liked the most was the exquisite flavor and aroma that it gave to the water. This is how the legend tells that tea arose.  Nobody knows if this story is reliable, but what is certain is that the origins of this drink go back more than 5,000 years. His contributions to health, culture, and socioeconomic development remain relevant today.  Today, tea is grown in highly localized areas, supporting more than 13 million people, including small farmers and their families, who depend on the tea sector for their livelihood.  International Tea Day is an opportunity to celebrate the cultural heritage, health benefits and economic importance of tea, while working to make its production sustainable from field to cup, ensuring that its benefits for people, cultures and the environment continue for generations.  TEA, THE MOST CONSUMED DRINK IN THE WORLD  After water, tea is the most consumed drink in the world, with six billion cups a day.  This drink generates an intense international commercial movement, which includes the five continents. According to data from the Ministry of Economy, the countries that consume the most tea are: China, with 28%; Viet Nam 5%; Indian 25%; Iran 4%; Kenya 10%; Indonesian 4%; Sri Lankan 9%; Türkiye 6%; Japan 2%  and Argentina 2%. The remaining 5% corresponds to the other countries.

"political assassination","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Guelph"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-20T07:20:18","Jurgen Mannhardt makes the drive between Millbank and Kincardine often, but this time took an unexpected turn.  When Mannhardt hit the road Monday, his trek was suddenly stopped. He saw a pregnant deer and one of its babies dead on the side of the road.  “I knew something got hit. And I thought it was something big,” said Mannhardt. “As I drove by, I looked over and I had seen some movement.”  Mannhardt couldn’t believe what happened next. As he approached, the mother deer laid there lifeless. Then, there was a sign of life. She was pregnant.  “A little head was poking out of the rest of it in a hole in a sac. And it was trying to get out and trying to get out and it just wouldn’t get free,” Mannhardt said.  Without thinking, he ripped open the amniotic sac the baby deer was still in.  “So I pulled it free and checked its legs and nothing was broken. It seemed to be fine,” said Mannhardt.  He loaded the little fawn into his truck and wrapped her tightly with his fleece jacket to keep her warm and to ensure she didn’t move. He carried on to Kincardine and called around to see where he could bring the tiny deer, all while dealing with the emotion.  Jurgen loaded the little fawn into his truck and wrapped her tightly with his fleece jacket to keep her warm. (Submitted/Jurgen Mannhardt)  “I mean, at the roadside, I was fighting tears because of the mother and the other baby. That really hit me hard,” Mannhardt said.  He got a hold of Hobbitstee Wildlife Refuge, who told him they could pick the fawn up that day at the Guelph Humane Society. So he went back in the car and drove two hours the opposite way.  Jordyn Moorehead is the wildlife care attendant who was on-shift at the humane society when the fawn was brought in.  “I was worried, of course, because of the trauma the mom and the other baby had sustained. I was kind of concerned the state the fawn was going to be in,” Moorehead said.  But to her surprise, the fawn was faring well, especially with the odds stacked against her.  “That’s the first time I’ve ever heard something like this happening,” said Moorehead.  That’s saying something considering The Guelph Humane Society cares for more than 1,800 sick, hurt or orphaned wildlife animals every year.

"political assassination","1898-05-23","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-20T22:29:00","May 23, 1898 – Blanche Charlet born in London; she was managing an art gallery in Brussels when the Nazis invaded Belgium in May 1940. She fled to England, and joined the Women’s Transport Service, but was soon recruited by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) because she was fluent in French, and was in the first training program for F Section (F for France) female agents. At age 44, she was one of the oldest SOE agents sent to France. Covertly landed on the French Riviera in Vichy France in September 1942, she reached Cannes, but her contact had been arrested, so she went on to Lyon, because she had been sent to replace Virginia Hall, an American who worked with both the OSS and the SOE there. However, Hall directed her to the Ventriloquist Network in the Sologne region of central France. Charlet's first task was to find a safe house where wireless operator Brian Stonehouse could transmit and receive messages. She found a rental house in a suburb of Lyon, then served as a courier between Ventriloquist’s leader, Philippe de Vomécourt, and Stonehouse. Charlet and Stonehouse were arrested in October 1942 as he was sending a wireless message to SOE headquarters in London. Many SOE agents were tortured and executed after their arrests, but Charlet under interrogation proved adept at portraying herself as a vacuous woman ignorant of politics, concocting elaborate stories about lovers and fainting when under pressure from her interrogators. In November 1942, she was sentenced to incarceration in Castres prison in southern France. The French-run prison was lax about security. In September 1943, Charlet was one of at least 37 prisoners who escaped, after stealing pistols and cell keys, and locking up or tricking the guards. Charlet and Suzanne Warenghem, a young French woman who had been a courier for the Pat O'Leary Escape Line, reached open country and a local farmer helped them reach a Benedictine monastery. They were hidden in the monastery’s guest house for two months before the monks could take them to an escape line which took refugees over the Pyrénées mountains to Spain, but heavy snow prevented them from crossing. Unable to reach Spain, Charlet and Warenghem, now in touch with SOE headquarters in London, went to Paris and then Lyon. Charlet was worried she might be recognized in Lyon, and traveled to the Jura Mountains near the border of Switzerland to work as a courier and guide for SOE. In April 1944, SOE arranged for Charlet and Warenghem to escape from France. They had to cross France again, to Brittany, where they were picked up on a beach by a small boat, and rowed offshore to a motor torpedo boat, a dangerous operation as the Germans were fortifying the French coast in anticipation of an Allied invasion. During their escape they were fired on, but their boat outraced German pursuers and they arrived safely in Plymouth in April 1944. In 1946, Charlet was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for ""services in France during the enemy occupation.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWtvcy5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzUvMjAvMjE3MDI0Ny8tV09XMi1NYXktMjAyMy1Xb21lbi1UcmFpbGJsYXplcnMtYW5kLUFjdGl2aXN0cy01LTE3LXRocm91Z2gtNS0yND91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249cmVjZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2023-04-13","Not Discerned","{""AnNajaf"", ""AnNajaf"", ""Iraq""}","2023-05-20T09:17:03","Share this article  As the final days of the holy month of Ramadan approached, Muqtada al-Sadr busied himself with preparations for his annual itikaf, a period of reflection to be spent in the great mosque of Kufa.  To those around him, it seemed clear he was trying to divert his attention away from events in the world outside the walls of his home in central Najaf’s Hanana.  It has been almost a year since the influential Shia cleric announced his withdrawal from politics. Over the past few months, as a new Iraqi government was formed without his participation, he resolutely refused to enter into any political dialogue or receive visitors trying to speak to him about developments or issues the country was facing.  Sadr’s entourage could see how difficult it was for Sadr to remain calm as he made his arrangements for the three-day Kufa mosque retreat. It was plainly difficult for him to stay away from the daily drama of Iraqi politics.  Sadr had just a few days before he was due to head to Kufa. He asked who would join him in itikaf, and what food they would be given for their days of reflection, one of Sadr’s close aides told Middle East Eye.  Everyone told him everything was as he wanted it and that there was nothing to worry about. But that wasn’t quite true.  On 13 April, immediately after the evening prayer, a short video began circulating on social media. In it, a bearded young man appears wearing black religious garb, his face hidden behind a black mask. The figure called on everyone to pledge their allegiance to Sadr, identifying him as the Mahdi, the awaited twelfth imam of the Shia who, it is believed, will appear as a saviour to bring justice to all.  The masked man said that the Kufa mosque would witness the launch of a “big campaign” to declare allegiance to Sadr during his stay there.  “We will pledge allegiance to him and announce that he is the awaited imam, and we will be under his banner and support him,” the man said.  “Do not let down the imam of your time. Give your allegiance to him and support him.”  Hours later, dozens of Sadr’s supporters, who call themselves “owners of the cause”, gathered in Hanana in front of his house to declare their allegiance.  To their surprise, Sadr’s guards did not greet them, instead assaulting the rapturous Sadrists and handing them over to the police, local sources told MEE.  Sadr already knew that there were some among the most devoted in the Sadrist movement that believe he is the Mahdi, and footage like the video of the masked man was not particularly unusual. But for some reason, the developments “provoked him a lot, and raised his fears”, Sadr’s aide said.  Rather than being a show of support, the video was seen as an attempt to destabilise Sadr.  “That was an explicit threat to Sadr’s life and a threat of chaos,” the aide told MEE.  According to the aide, whoever was behind the video wanted to provoke Sadrists into massing at the Kufa mosque and then confronting Shia clergy in Najaf, who would not accept the claim Sadr is their long-awaited saviour.  “These people are very dangerous and can carry out crimes in the name of Sadr,” he said.  If this analysis is correct, Sadr’s response showed he understood well what was at play and decided to distance himself from it as soon as possible.  He cancelled his itikaf, ordered most of his offices closed, and suspended his movement’s religious and social work for at least a year.  At least three prominent Shia leaders told MEE that “a malicious plan was behind that movement”, and that Sadr was indeed a target.  “It was an ideological game aimed at manipulating Sadr and inflating his ego. If he remained silent or responded to the game positively, then killing him became legitimate,” one of the leaders said.  “Whoever was behind this scheme, he was seeking to implicate Sadr and to force him in one way or another to take a stand.”  Since that day, Sadr has only been dealt further painful blows, both by his political opponents and people closer to home. It seems more than one player is trying to drag him out of his seclusion.  The fatwa loophole  In Shia jurisprudence, adult Muslims must choose a senior cleric to be their religious reference – or marjaa – and follow his fatwas and instructions in all matters of life.  Traditionally, that marjaa must be alive and known for his religious scholarship. But the two founders of the Sadrist movement, Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr and Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, stressed that a marjaa should be the most knowledgeable cleric available – alive or dead.  Grand Ayatollah Kadhim al-Haeri, who was a student of the first Sadr and guardian of the second, did not deviate from this line. In fact, he issued a fatwa allowing people to follow a dead marjaa, as long as they have the permission of a living one, like himself.  When Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr was assassinated by Saddam Hussein’s agents in 1999, the Sadrists began to follow Haeri spiritually and the slain Sadr’s son, Muqtada, politically.  Haeri also gave Muqtada al-Sadr permission to manage his father’s office and religious schools, as well as the funds raised through khums (obligatory religious charity) and donations.  This arrangement benefitted Sadr considerably and helped keep the Sadrist movement together under his leadership – particularly keeping the loyalty of youth born following his father’s death.  This situation changed completely at the end of August last year, when Haeri, who is based in the Iranian city of Qom, announced his “sudden and unprecedented” retirement “due to illness and advanced age”.  In his announcement, Haeri rescinded his permission for Sadr to manage the movement’s funds and activities.  “Sayyid Haeri’s sudden retirement confused Sadr and greatly embarrassed him,” Khalid al-Hamdani, professor at Najaf’s scientific seminary, told MEE.  “Retirement is not customary among Najaf clergymen … so everyone was surprised by it, including the offices of Sadr and Haeri himself. That retirement has impacted all the arrangements between Sadr’s and Hairi’s offices dating back to 2003.”  Haeri’s retirement prompted Sadr to suspend the work of the Sadrist religious schools and institutions, and he stopped receiving the khums.  Not only did he lose access to the hundreds of millions of dollars they brought in, he haemorrhaged followers as well.  Only adding to the “shocking” and “strange” nature of Haeri’s announcement, as a number of Shia scholars in Najaf described it, was the order for the marjaa’s followers to “obey” Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei instead.  “Herein lies the danger,” said a prominent Sadrist leader. Previously, Sadrists would be embarrassed following Khamenei spiritually, and therefore working with the Iraqi armed factions associated with the Iranian supreme leader.  But not only had Haeri embarrassed Sadr by associating him with Khamenei, who he had long kept a distance from, he had opened the door for Sadrists to consider other clerics as their marjaa rather than Muhammad Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr.  “Can you imagine what happened? The semi-closed circle, which Sadr was keen to keep the Sadrists inside, has broken, and this is what Sadr never expected to happen,” Sadr’s aide said.  Today, Sadr’s status is a hot topic of discussion, with Haeri’s announcement opening the door for the cleric’s Shia rivals to question his legitimacy at every opportunity.  Dozens of Telegram channels, WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages, some of them linked to Shia armed factions and others of unknown affiliation, have been heavily promoting the debate for weeks.  It seems clear that the real threat facing Sadr is political, not ideological, especially after his opponents, the Shia rivals in particular, have realised that his main source of strength is the same as his main source of weakness: Haeri’s fatwa.  In response, Sadr has tried to shore up his support.  On 29 April, he asked his followers to submit a written pledge signed in blood where they promised not to follow any religious scholar who has not been a longstanding Sadrist. They also had to vow not to join any “suspicious groups that want to undermine Iraq, the sect and the Sadrist movement”.  Sadr was keen to stress to his followers that his enemies had “malicious plans” aimed at dispersing the Sadrist movement and encouraging them to question their marjaa or leader – Sadr himself.  “Frankly, the issue is far from jurisprudence, religion and faith. It is a struggle over the Sadrist grassroots,” said a former Sadr aide, who a few years ago defected to an Iranian-backed armed faction.  “Questioning Sadr’s religious and ideological authority, and raising questions about the nature of the relationship between him and his followers, is one of the weapons used in the battle and we all know this.”  The former aide acknowledged the cleric relies heavily on the movement’s youngest generation but also said these youth remain committed to him spiritually and politically.  “Fortifying these people and keeping them under control, away from the influence of opponents, is Sadr’s chief goal right now,” he said.  Fraternal competition  Sadr’s fiercest opponents are his former companions: followers of his father and uncle, people he has gone into battle with.  Most prominent are Shia armed factions Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kataeb Hezbollah, who have ideological, demographic and territorial overlap with the Sadrist movement.  The three factions emerged from the same school of jurisprudence that was founded by the first Sadr leader, Muhammad Baqir, Sadr’s uncle and father-in-law.  This demographic and ideological crossover complicates the competition between the factions, making their fight even more cruel.  And the fraternal nature of their competition means the Sadrists, Asaib Ahl al-Haq and Kataeb Hezbollah know exactly how to undermine each other and tempt their fighters away.  This dynamic dramatically and publicly revealed itself earlier this month.  On 6 May, Sadr instructed his supporters to mark the annual anniversary of the assassination of his father later in the month.  Only those who had signed the pledges in blood were allowed to participate in the Najaf ceremony, provided they walk on foot from the outskirts of the holy city to the place where Sadr senior was killed.  Sadr’s stipulations and planned march were a message to his opponents, one of the cleric’s aides told MEE. He was showing his rivals that only he could move such vast crowds of devotees.  “The plan was for everyone to see the number of those willing to die for Sadr. We do not deny that the goal was to display our strength and our men,” the aide said.  Just days before the parade was due to take place, it was cancelled.  Sadr’s office distributed an audio recording of the cleric, in which he ordered everyone to stop preparations and close Sadr’s shrine in Najaf throughout the last week of May, when the anniversary was due to fall.  This was “the best punishment for this hypocritical group and those who support them among the corrupt and shameless militias”, Sadr is heard saying, using a common nickname he has for Asaib Ahl al-Haq.  No other reason was given. But developments in the southern governorates of Basra and Nasiriyah in recent weeks offer some clues.  Internal Sadrist correspondence seen by Middle East Eye shows in late April the central security branch of Saraya al-Salam, the Sadrists’ armed wing, ordered the expulsion of 18 fighters from the 304th Basra Brigade, without mentioning why.  A senior Saraya al-Salam commander in Basra told MEE that the fighters were believed to be defecting to Asaib.  Two weeks later, the same branch ordered the expulsion of Abu Hassan al-Daradji, a senior commander in Basra, on charges of “treason”, the correspondence shows.  Twenty-four hours later, websites linked to Asaib published pictures of Darraji accompanied by a number of the armed faction’s leaders, announcing his defection.  “Our information says that they paid him at least 2bn dinars [$1.5m] to defect from us, along with his unit,” the Saraya al-Salam commander told MEE.  It is not clear what material damage Darraji’s defection caused Sadr’s Basra units, but by the reactions of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, we can see it was a blow to morale.  Local Sadrist leaders in Basra told MEE that Daradji had been made commander of Asaib’s special missions team.  “They wanted to tell us that this was his reward,” the Saraya al-Salam commander told MEE.  Wanting Sadr back  The Sadrist retreat began in June last year, when, frustrated by his inability to form a government, Sadr ordered his MPs to resign from parliament.  That allowed Sadr’s Shia rivals in the Coordination Framework alliance to form the government of their choice. It seemed like an incredible coup for them. Months later, it appears more like a trap.  Iraq has witnessed a period of relative calm in recent months. Leaders of the Coordination Framework, which includes most Iranian-backed political forces and armed factions, have gone about their business without obvious concerns.  Yet Shia political leaders told MEE that fears are beginning to surface.  Some of the biggest concerns expressed by Framework leaders is that some of their partners in the Shia alliance are “encroaching” on their territory and have control over key institutions.  Essentially, the organs of state are a lucrative business for whoever controls them.  While Sadrists had powerful positions in government, anyone pursuing illegal and corrupt activities could accuse them of being responsible instead, giving them plausible deniability.  With that no longer possible, Sadr’s friends and enemies alike find they miss him and wish for his return to political life, “to relieve them of embarrassment and to provide them with the required cover for their illegal business”, as a Framework leader put it.  “Many international and local parties believe that Sadr’s presence outside the political process is more costly than his presence inside it, and it is time for him to return,” the Framework leader said.  According to the leader, Asaib Ahl al-Haq has begun taking more shares of the spoils of government than its partners are happy with.  “If it stays like this, this faction will turn on the rest and swallow them up,” he said.  “Others have become exposed and cannot proceed with their illegal activities without the presence of someone that they can use as a cover to throw the charge at.”  Sadr, the Framework leader said, is a “tool of deterrence” and provides a kind of protection for several parties.  “It cannot be said that only one player is behind everything that is happening with Sadr now, but it is certain that several international and local parties are seeking to bring him back to the scene,” he said.  “How and when will he return? This mainly depends on his ability to hold on.”  Source: Middle East Eye","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvY2ZtLmNvLnphL2hvdy1zYWRycy1mb2VzLWFyZS10cnlpbmctdG8tc3Vjay1oaW0tYmFjay1pbnRvLWlyYXFpLXB1YmxpYy1saWZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Still, eight years later, Mills faces another potential life sentence after an expressway shooting early on Sunday morning.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcmFkYXJvbmxpbmUuY29tL3AvY29jYWluZS1kZWFsZXItcHJpc29uLWVhcmx5LXByZXNpZGVudC1vYmFtYS1zaG9vdGluZy13b21hbi1jaGljYWdvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1948-12-03","Not Discerned","{""Delhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T06:00:06","The malaise afflicting Assam ever since the days of the Cabinet Mission and prior to it is the crisis of leadership. In the grouping plan of the Cabinet Mission for the proposed partition of the country, Assam was placed in group C, clearly destined to be merged into Pakistan, thus ringing the death knell to the Assamese identity. This stirred the Assamese soul. At this critical juncture, Gopinath Bordoloi, the chief minister (or PM), tried hard, but there was none to hear the plight of Assam. That was a cry in the wilderness. Despondent, Gopinath Bordoloi fell back. Fortunately for Assam Gandhiji, at this critical juncture, he was busy in the terror-ridden Nowakhali in Bengal. Bordoloi dispatched two senior Congressmen, Bijoy Chandra Bhagawati and Mohendra Mohan Choudhury, with a letter to the Mahatma. On reading the letter from Bordoloi Gandhiji, he remarked, “Assam must place her demand boldly. Otherwise, I will say Assam has no men but manikins. Emboldened by this letter, Bordoloi approached the Congress high command in Delhi and forcefully made the demand. This compelled the Congress leaders to take action in favour of Assam. It is because of the Mahatma that we are now citizens of India. I shudder to think what would have befallen us without Gandhiji’s timely intervention.    Earlier, as World War II broke out, the AICC passed a resolution asking all the Congress ministers to resign in protest against India’s participation with men and material in the war without the consent of the Indians. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, the then president of AICC, toured Assam and published a statement at Shillong: “Considering the special situation of Assam, the Assam Ministry should not resign”. But the Assam Cabinet, with Bordoloi at the head, resigned. Taking this opportune chance, the opposition Muslim League formed the alliance ministry with Muhammad Saddulla as the Chief Minister, which opened the flood gate for lakhs of Muslim infiltrators to enter Assam under the fake “Grow More Food” programme that has plagued the state till now. Even Lord Wavel, the Viceroy, taunted, “Whether it is Grow More Food or Grow More Muslims?” The colonial ruler took no action. In fact, as it is evident from “The Report on Assam in 1854” by a British judge, the early Britishers encouraged Muslim migration from East Bengal. They opened large tracts of virgin soil for jute cultivation in the interest of the company’s economy. With due reverence to the Lokapriya, it must be said that the resignation of the Bordoloi Ministry in this burning situation was a Himalayan blunder. This is the bruise Assam is still bleeding from: that flood gate.  Bordoloi’s successor, Bishnu Ram Medhi, the iron man of Assam, opened large tracts of Bahmaputra Chapori in Mangaldai for the indigenous people, just to resist the onslaught of the land-hungry emigrant Muslims. The motive of the League can be well understood from the advice of Jinnah to the restive Moinul Hoque Choudhury, secretary of the young group of the All India Muslim League: “Wait, I am going to offer you Assam on a silver platter.”  The same measure Medhi took was taken in other districts as well. He continued Bordoloi’s mission of peace in strife-torn Nagaland. A section of the social high-ups grew jealous of him for reasons best known to them. The erudite I.C.S. officer-in-charge of Nagaland, Satyen Borkotoky, working under him, wrote a libellous book against him that meant nothing but character assassination. It was quite unworthy of his talent. Besides, it was against professional ethics. Once, Nehru wrote him a letter asking him for the rehabilitation of two lakh displaced persons from East Bengal. Medhi wrote back, “There is not sufficient land for the indigenous people of Assam. So, the order cannot be carried out.” This incurred Nehru’s displeasure. Soon, an opportunity presented itself. A group of MLAs from Assam approached Nehru with the request to replace Medhi with another of their choice. The shrewd Prime Minister sent Medhi, the veteran politician, as Governor of Madras, thus making him insular in Assam politics, and instead sent Gandhian Bimala Prasad Chaliha, a Rajya Sabha MP from Assam. The long 14 years of his tenure saw a number of ‘Andolans’. When the political demand for Assamese as the state language arose in the Assembly in 1960, his reply was “Let the demand come from Cachar”. The reason for this was that he was defeated in the by-election from the Amguri constituency and then elected from Badarpur in Cachar. Whenever an important issue came up for discussion in the House, we read a line in ‘The Assam Tribune”: “The chief minister is slightly indisposed. He will not attend assembly today.’ What Bordoloi and Medhi did for the indigenous people of Assam was undone during the subsequent ministries only for the appeasement of certain groups. Sarat Chandra Singha, otherwise an honest and performing CM, asked back during the 6-year agitation, “Where are the foreigners?’ In India, Assam is known for agitation, or Andolon. But why? An able leader of all India’s stature with vision and foresight can stop an emerging agitation with convincing dialogue with the centre and can avoid all sorts of losses in the public, private, and government sectors. Dev Kanta Borooah rose to a height to be the president of the AICC but crash-landed. Less said of the AGP is better.  Whenever a critical issue linked to Delhi came up, e.g., a refinery, Assam could rally around only one stalwart of all India—the late Hem Barua, who could convince the parliament with his eloquent oratory and dash. It is sad to say that he fell victim to a political conspiracy. Yet Assam had the rare good fortune to have a distinguished barrister-at-law, Taroon Ram Phookan, who could put a British sahib to discomfiture with a single act. On seeing the dashing personality of Phookan for the first time in one AICC session in those days, Motilal Nehru, the stalwart Congress leader, uttered, “Oh, the tiger of Assam!” Unfortunately, he died in 1938. In the Non-Cooperation Movement of 1921–22, during his visit to Assam, Gandhiji was lodged in Phookan’s havely and performed the ‘Bilati Barjan Jajna’. What an irony of fate that the discomfitured hero of the Transval Railway Station of South Africa met the tiger of Assam in his own place! Had he been alive, he could certainly have filled the void created by the crisis of leadership in Assam.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlbnRpbmVsYXNzYW0uY29tL2VkaXRvcmlhbC9jcmlzaXMtb2YtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1pbi1hc3NhbS1hLWhpc3RvcmljYWwtcGVyc3BlY3RpdmUtNjUwMzU00gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VudGluZWxhc3NhbS5jb20vYW1wL2VkaXRvcmlhbC9jcmlzaXMtb2YtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1pbi1hc3NhbS1hLWhpc3RvcmljYWwtcGVyc3BlY3RpdmUtNjUwMzU0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Ibadan"", ""Oyo"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-20T16:52:18","In the ensemble of political actors in the contemporary politics of the Fourth Republic, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, easily stands out within the mix, and clearly far above others.  This is in terms of his unalloyed puritanism as the most detribalised and extremely excellent bridge builder, whose cosmopolitan worldview, humanistic creed of the universal brotherhood of men, and magnanimous large-heartedness, rebuff, and with unguarded effortlessness too, illusive segregationist trifles of race, tribe, ethnicity, religion, sex or distortively jaundiced vision of any sort.  This indeed is an aspect which even his sworn enemies will concede, and all so readily too, in conscionable sincerity, if they really would.  To be sure, during his memorable gubernatorial epoch in Lagos State, Tinubu ran an all-inclusive government, in which Ibos were regaled with key appointments in government, ranging from commissionership, local government chairmanship, supervisory councillorship, councillorship and even membership of the Federal House of Reps, and Lagos State House of Assembly.  You will agree with me, that in the medley of the heterogeneous diversities of tribes domiciled in Lagos State, Ibos constitute about the greatest numbers of tribal bloc. Empirical evidence availing illustrates in poignant clarity, that a good number of Igbo immigrants had decided to relocate to Lagos, in order to enjoy the health and educational amenities, which are not only excellent, but considerably liberal and devoid of discriminatory cleavages on tribal ground, or prejudicial conditionalities of any sort, to access.  And for the Igbos engaged in big-time businesses, one could well succinctly attest to the fact that successive governments in Lagos State, have often accorded them the optimum hospitality, as could ever be imagined.  However, under Tinubu, especially during his memorable gubernatorial epoch, our Igbo brothers have never had it so good, in terms of the conducive ambience they have continued to enjoy in Lagos State, surpassing in quantum measures, the milieu as extant in regimes prior to Asiwaju’s tenure as governor of Lagos State.  We needn’t overly elaborate on this feature, which is crystally self-evident, in terms of his spiritedly sustained, and of course intensified efforts, expended in integrating the Igbos into the mainstream of affairs, both in the sphere of political administration and governance and socially too, in the bid to instil a reciprocal sense of belonging which comfortably settles them to feel at home, as members of the same family, with the vast mass of natives of their home states, especially Lagos and Yorubas as a whole  This is why developments unfolding over the years, had signally expressed no cause for cheers, in terms of the inability of our Igbo brothers to reciprocate his markedly affectionate passion, through their patently unfriendly attitude, bordering on outright hostility, indubitably reckoned in the general mind, in their ever sustained and intensified consistency, ever before Asiwaju’s gubernatorial ascension, as a genetic staple of common behavior  Remember that it was no other personality than Oba Rilwan Akiolu, who sometime in 2015, summoned a meeting of Igbo leaders, during which he gave them a bitter piece of his mind, with regards to their broiling belligerence, notoriously stuck over the years, as a distinctively unique epaulette, perennially unleashed against their ever hospitable Yoruba hosts, and worse still, Tinubu, who presided as the political leader of the ruling party in the state, and who by that token, appertain to their chief host.  On this, could it be recalled, how a highly disturbed Asiwaju, quickly rallied the Ibos together, with a spiritedly passionate appeal, to assuage their aggrieved mind.  To be sure, Tinubu’s passion and manifest sense of kinship for the Ibos, going by the manner in which he had ostensibly gone beyond himself to accord them a filial sense of oneness, as an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, is simply amazing.  Indeed some of those privileged to be quite close to Tinubu, could divulge with competent authority, that quite on a good number of times, not a few of intensely concerned ones, had perennially essayed to awaken the renowned APC leader to the mortal danger, posed by the Ibos, particularly in Lagos State, citing their purulent pus of bad blood, bordering on intensely unbridled hate-mongering, despite all spirited attempts by Asiwaju to encourage and re-assure them from time to time, that not only are they an integral part and parcel of the community of Lagosians, but an esteemed and privileged one for that matter. However Tinubu in his characteristic quixotry and magnanimous large-heartedness had often dismissed such insinuations as mere figments of the imagination.  But today, Tinubu will need no one sounding the reveille for an intelligible cognizance of the message, visibly unfurled in it’s ominous augury.  This lamentable show of bad blood, which had quite lingered over the years, sadly attained a climax, the moment Asiwaju emerged at the recently concluded primaries as the APC flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election.  Right from that moment, hell was immediately let loose, with an orchestrated campaign of hatred and calumny, emanating from our Igbo brothers, becoming increasingly vicious, worrisome, and extremely alarming, bordering on something else.  Ordinarily and of course sincerely, one perceives nothing bad or odious with criticisms constructively offered, just as giving your mind, a free rein of expression in the public space, in as much as the laws of the land entrenches the inalienable right to free speech; however, the critical moment of departure, that it begins to negotiate an alarming descent to inflammatory hate words and a flurry of conflagratory verbiage, as our Igbo brothers have indulgently elevated to trivial pleasurable razzmatazz, then every right thinking Nigerian, and lover of peace, should be so verily concerned as to raising an eye brow, for the premium sake of peace, growth and unity of this potentially great nation.  No wonder, popular spectacles of fierce and bitter verbal exchanges between the shamelessly ungrateful Igbos on one hand and their highly considerate and hospitable Yoruba hosts, continue to greet the public space with disturbing ubiquity, just as the social media is ever awash with vitriols of all sorts, unleashed with unmitigated fury, by these overzealous dacoits of pan Igbo irredentism, giving a clear and undoubted impression that these are clearly the handiwork of hired hatchet men, at the behest of their “invisible” task masters, dictating the shot.  As we could all recall, it soon attained a most infuriating point that FolashadeTinubu Ojo, the Iyaloja-General, who also happened to be Asiwaju’s daughter, could not but chip in a piece of her mind, on the need for these ungrateful stock, to temper their vitriolic vituperations, daily being orchestrated, against the eminent Nigerian statesman, with unfettered restraint.  Indeed, it couldn’t have been anything but shock, an exceedingly severe one for that matter, when a group of Igbos, in an unwarranted rage of defiance, stirred tremors of warning that she was fanning the embers of wild belligerence; hawling, in a rave of uncontrolled lunacy, that they were ready, and indeed more than capable to respond squarely to any drum-beat of battle, as their hospitable Yoruba hosts might bring to bear in contest. Haba!  A curious aspect of the charade in progress, was that as Asiwaju was all this while, at the receiving end of the untramelled aspersions, perennially hurled by the Igbos, in their possessive fury of hate words, Atiku had all along remained virtually off their scurrilous purview, except for occasional scratchers, which in no way compared in severity, with the lethal verbal assault and sabre-rattling incendiaries increasingly being orchestrated against Asiwaju, with sustained and intensified angst.  Yet, this is a man, who as governor, presided over the affairs of Lagos, at a time, when the nagging question of high-frequency migration of the Igbos to Lagos State, attained a peak, continually stretching the existing infrastructure almost beyond the limit of endurance, thus keeping successive administrations sleeplessly on their toes in the herculean toilsomeness that grappled to cope with the increasingly alarming population explosion, daily being witnessed as a result of the accelerating incursion of people in quest of greener pastures, on account of it’s conducive ambience to flourishing endeavors.  Of course, it cannot be too often emphasized that Igbos constitute the most considerable chunk of this category. This is why their pestiferous and patently uncouth outpourings against Tinubu indeed heralds such a huge surprise, so to say.  Why is it, that Igbos incubate such pathologically inscrutable loathsomeness for their Yoruba brothers, perennially let loose, with frenetic ruthlessness and the most unimaginable vitriol on Asiwaju, who ironically happens ,in exceedingly befitting terms, to be their foremost benefactor and ardent lover of their progress?  During Asiwaju’s heroic reign as governor of Lagos State, he succeeded in lifting Lagos to hitherto unprecedented heights, while in the process, making the state, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose dynamic policies, spreading like an amazing contagion, were emulated with religious fervor, by other states, far and wide.  Why is it therefore, that our Igbo brothers would always with fervent impulsiveness be ready to throw reason to the dogs, ever haunting and hounding this unusually detribalized statesman, at their capriciously whimsical will, and woolly sentimentality, while literally looking less at the individual governors presiding in their own primordial states of the South-East?  Why is it that you come to Lagos; make huge fortune and big money, and yet, reserve nothing but sheer bilious angst and hate, for your accommodating hosts and their leaders, who hitherto have accorded you such a bossomly familial embrace devoid of any shred of discrimination?  If the governors in your respective native states of the South-East had done even a fraction of Tinubu’s accomplishments in Lagos, with the transformative impetus that has elevated it to one of the leading cities in Africa, would you dare have descended on them with such whorish pang of depredation, so terrifying to imagine. Pray. Why are Igbos so envious, panicky and intensely jittery even of the slightest shadows of the Yorubas?  Imagine again, the umbrage devoid of the traditional African deference for old age, quite in tune with the Igbo behavioral stereo-type, beffitingly evocative of the landmark “ranting of an ant” of Chuba Okadigbo, in his message to the Great Zik, with which they swooped on Wole Soyinka just for his reasoned elderly admonishment on the nutsy band of off-hook scoundrels, parading as pyrate fraters; consigning the cultivated virtue of home training to the dogs, in their reprobative burlesquing of the revered patriot and statesman?  Could you imagine their effusive gibberish rant answering quite in character with the monocultural racial herd in their wanton abrasiveness against the Yoruba-born globally acclaimed genius of all times, who dominates the global literary fraternity like a colossus, for no imaginable reason whatsoever? Imagine again, the latest in their primitive savage streak, displayed with untamed recklessness, in their churlish and petulant pepper-market jabbles unleashed in their brusquely uncouth mannerisms, against the global literary giant, just because of his latest post-election commentaries, in which he made very apt and cogent points.  In the same vein of bilious ingratitude, one recalls that Victor Adebunkola Banjo, a lieutenant colonel of Yoruba extraction, in a sacrificial fit of immolation, discountenanced the implicatory tag of a traitor, expectedly coming from his Yoruba kinsmen, to fight on the side of Biafra; but as it were to turn out, Ojukwu’s reciprocal code of appreciation, was an outright summary execution by firing squad, of that brilliant, charismatic and courageous soldier and intellectual.  Same with Adekunle Fajuyi, the then Governor of the old western region, who in an exemplary fit of chivalry, unprecedented in the annals of human existence, staked his life, by choosing to die with his guest and the then military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi ironsi. Yet our lgbo brothers will far from appreciate.  On this patrimonial inheritance of genetic anti-yoruba obsession, Chinua Achebe, fore-most exemplar of anti-Yoruba racial hatred, could poignantly be seen as taking the lead, as of course signally evident in the retrospective play-back, thirty seven years ago, when in the wake of the frabjous ambience heralding the exhilarating announcement of the Yoruba-born literary giant, he (Achebe)ascended the roof-top, with an unwarranted gaffe, that the global literary diadem, was by no implicit assumption, a caveat for the Asiwaju title of African literature.  Indeed, looking back decades ago; that moment of destiny that Soyinka bagged the Nobel literary diadem; unarguably a staggering all-time feat in the annals of black achievements, he had, even if unknown to him, unwittingly stepped on the wounded toes of the collective mass of envious and inferiority-ridden Ndigbos, who in turn, will never forgive him, just for that singular feat, which they had cherished with passionate fervor, that it should have belonged to one of them or a non-Yoruba rather than a Yoruba.  Indeed, Soyinka himself could not help but describe the banal effusion of the arch Igbo tribalist as “uncalled for and disappointing”. “I was a little bit disappointed, and didn’t see the necessity…that particular subject under contention didn’t relate to literature”, stressed the world renowned writer.  Even Soyinka himself, in an article personally written years ago, in an edition of this Day Newspaper, could again, not help but lament a conspiratorial wave of propaganda, insurgently saturating the public space; then championed by an Igbo-born professor; who animated by a weirdly hunch of diabolism, had mischievously sought to forge an interpretatively suspicious link between Achebe’s fatal accident, that rendered him mortally crippled, shortly after a particular edition of his birthday anniversary; to the gift of a live cow, presented to him on that particular occasion by Soyinka; ostensibly as an innocent well-intentioned goodwill gesture, to a comrade in the literary fraternity; but which the arch Igbo tribalist, and a supposedly enlightened professor, had in an unguarded magisterial whims effectively poisoned the vulnerable willing herd of fellow arch tribalists who in their bizarre flight of fancy, had came to construe in the grotesque coloration of occultic wickedness.  Yet, this was the same Soyinka, whose sacrificial immolation for the Biafran cause, in the thick of the civil war, earned him a harrowing 22-month ordeal in the gulag, during the Gowon era.  Again, Achebe would not allow any moment to slip by, without a paludal inveighing of Awo, as the ominous harbinger, paving the fenestra for the demonising incursion of the tribal monster, into the political firmament.  In the inexponible quibble of revisionism, we would all recall the ever unrepentantly chronic tribal bigot, who was so quick to the post, harassing Awo as the primordial agent of dispersal of tribal infiltration, advancing a rather meretricious make-belief that the reverred statesman of the Yoruba stock, it was, that engineered the parliamentary cross-carpeting that put paid to Zik, in oppiliating his visionary misadventure for the Leviathan premiership of the Old West.  Lamentably, his curious quirk for selective amnesia, would least avail to advert in reference to the doctorinaire chauvinism of the great Zik, as of course unfolded in his reprobative heresy, way back in 1949,that “….the god of Africa, has created the Igbo nation to lead the children of Africa from the bondage of ages.”  It is of course a popular staple of common knowledge, how Zik as the incumbent vice-gerent, in the NCNC, following the glorious demise of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay, would without qualms of conscience, cannibalise the NCNC as an exclusive inheritance, of which the Igbos were the sole legatees; a signally disturbing trend, which in turn elicited the vexatious discountenance of people like Adegoke Adelabu, who were verily uncomfortable with the unstatesmanly descent to base pertavinity.  At this juncture, I shall proceed to expound three signally illustrative instances, in which the defective strabism of Igbo leaders, Zik and Ojukwu in particular, in terms of their myopic preferences of political alliances, had not only draggled the larger mass of their collective filial kins into the excruciating marginalization conundrum, celebrated over the years, in inconsolable crocodilean canticles, but also in the process, dragooned the collective Nigerian nationhood into its contemporary tumult.  However, let me affirm, right before the narrative just about coming on the heels, that this does not in any way, vitiate a jot, the credible moral force, latent in Asiwaju’s fraternizing parley with a vastly enlightened North, as currently extant – contrasting in its progressive paradigm with the feudal fascism of the era of old; for which Awo desperately needed fellow progressive fraters in collaborative synergy; to square up to; for ultimate libertarian triumph, of the Northern Talakawas in an avowed visionary pursuit which unfortunately footled to failure for lack of a willing mate in response to the clarion call, for a united solidarous front, particularly from the strategic North.  Going down the memory lane,1959 to be precise, one recalls that Awolowo advanced an alliance overture towards Zik, premised on the logic that a combination of the Action Group, led by him, and the Zik-led NCNC, will overwhelm the Hausa-Fulani NPC,whose narrow feudal bent was clearly ill at variance with the vision of a united and virile Nigeria, and the liberation of the down-trodden, especially the highly pauperized Talakawas of the north.  Zik was crystally enamoured of Awo’s unassailable logic, or so it seemed. But dramatically, all of a sudden, Nigerians woke up one day, only to discover that the great Zik had indeed gone with the Hausa-Fulanis! Thus did the Hausa-Fulani NPC seize power, and promptly grabbed it as a much-awaited opportunity to annihilate Awo.  Of course, those who knew at that time, would easily recall Akintola’s machiaevillian deployment, being a willing myrmidon of the north, for a head-on collision against Awo, his erstwhile leader – as inspired and engineered by the Hausa-Fulani oligarchs, animated by a subterranean cant for a greater Lebensraum and hegemonic continuity – and the violent conundrum in the West; eventually culminating in the January 15,1966 military coup, master-minded by a cross-section of Igbo-born army officers, and the assumption of power by Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, as the first military Head of State, after the gruesome assassination of the then Prime-Minister of the federation, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and the then premier of Northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, a direct great grandson of Shehu Usman Dan Fodio.  The January coup, was to inspire the July 29 coup, spear-headed by the Hausa-Fulani elements in the army, in unconsolable revanche to the killing of Balewa and Ahmadu Bello.  Of course, the then ruling military Head of State, Major-General Aguiyi Ironsi, among sundry top army officers of Igbo extraction, also lost their lives in the retributive backlash of the same tribal-motivated coup, which in disastrously fatal turn, catalysed a massive wave of inter-tribal killings between the Igbos and Hausas;triggering the declaration of Biafra, by Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, and the inevitable consecution of a civil war; a gory celebration of blood bath, in which an estimated two million souls perished.  In yet another ominous turn, 1979 would again witness an unfortunate rehash of the same charade, as Awo again made an alliance overture to Zik, ostensibly premised on a mutual synergy between the Awo-led Unity Party of Nigeria ,on one hand, and the Zik-led Nigerian People’s Party, aimed at counteracting the Hausa-Fulani-led NPN,a feudal ideological resurgence of the Northern People’s Congress of the First Republic. Again, the entire nation woke up one day, only to discover that the Zik-led NPP had unabashedly flocked along, in parley with the Hausa-Fulani NPN, a feudal re-incarnation of the First Republic Northern People’s Congress.  Of course, we could all well attest to how the alliance fortified the NPN, which having ripped off on their fortune-hunting partners, the NPP, to install their men into principal offices in the legislature, now embarked on pleasurable binge of massive tyranny, as unfolded in the politically motivated mass killings of the Bakolori farmers in Sokoto, the deportation of the Majority Leader of GNPP,Alhaji Abdul-rahmam Shugaba, the terrifying tomfoolery of the 1983 elections,and the devastating quake and tumult,coupled with the demonic prodigality in public spending;a saturnalian frenzy of high-wire corruption, which again was to culminate in the Buhari-Idiagbon coup of December 31,1983.  Of course, as an intensely agitated Zik cried out, following the massive electoral chicanery, we would all recall the horrifying reckless rant of the notorious rantipole, ChubaOkadigbo, who unsurprisingly typical of his coprolitic gutter-rant style, which would go down as a locus classicus in intellectual hooliganism, dismissed the rightful democratic remonstrance of the great Zik as” the ranting of an ant”  Looking back, one could well affirm without any shred of doubt, that Zik’s preferential cohabitation with the then Northern People’s Congress at the time in question,was motivated by a pathologically embedded narcissism that he could use the benefit of an alliance with the then feudal Northern People’s Congress,to acquire greater leverage for his fellow Igbo brethren against the Yorubas,then renowned for their elevated notch of superior education.Unfortunately,as it would turn out on each occasion,none else,but the Igbos,came out the greatest losers as patently expressed in an unremitting pathos of mournful dirge,in their lachrymal canticles on marginalisation.  This unimaginable faux pas of history would also derive an unfortunate replication in the inexplicable choice that saw the Ikemba of Nnewi, Chukwuemeka Odimegwu Ojukwu who on his return from exilic sojourn in Ivory Coast, now Cote D’ivoire, had sought for a political party to enlist in, and found none, except the Hausa-Fulani NPN, thus betraying an arrant lack of grasp of the causative dynamics of history.  On what note does one therefore reckon with such big goof in cognitive dissonance, emanating from a supposedly learned Oxford-educated historian of an elevated Master’s degree cadre, as the Ikemba of blessed memory, one may ask?  Not until the devastating defeat he suffered in the Senatorial duel from Dr. Onwudiwe of the NPP, just as his party, the NPN, barely did reckon with him,did it eventually dawn on him that he was already demystified and his terror-value which hitherto had stared the Northern feudal oligarchs inwardly scared stiff, effectively defused.  Still on the Biafran warlord of blessed memory, it would well be apt and relevant at this point, to ask:”In taking recourse to the Hausa-Fulani NPN, as it were, at that time, whose interest was he serving? The collective interest of the Igbos or his own personal interest? If the interest of the Igbos, he should tell that to the marines.  Similarly, in a back-track reminder as might well be deemed for strategic emphasis, we would all witness the manner in which Zik had jettisoned two crucial and strategic overtures for progressive synergy, as advanced by Awo, firstly in 1959,and secondly in 1979, exactly twenty years after; and the catastrophic aftermath for the corporate national existence.  No wonder, Sir James Robertson, the last British governor-general of Nigeria, during the colonial era, daubed him in his memoirs, as mercurial, unpredictable and unreliable, while the Late Professor Ayodele Awojobi, the engineering genius of blessed memory described him categorically as ‘consistently inconsistent’.  Now pray: in taking recourse to the feudal Hausa-Fulani NPC, and NPN in 1959 and 1979 respectively, exactly 20years after, whose interest was Zik, indeed the Great Zik of Africa serving? National interest or the interest of his Igbo kith and kin? As for national interest, he could well tell that to the marines!  Ironically, going down the lane of history, one recalls with definitive clarity, that Zik actually rode to dominantly prosilient fame and eminence,on the political war-chest of the legendary Herbert Heelas Macaulay – the then leader of the NCNC,at a time that Zik held forte as the Secretary-General ¬¬– who at various public fora, openly expressed his passionate love for Zik, as his beloved son, in whom he was well pleased.  This in effect is to say that the wider national appeal which the Zik-led NCNC enjoyed after the demisé of Macaulay, erstwhile leader of the party, was largely due to the immense populist clout and towering larger-than-life imagery of the legendary Macaulay, who at the zenith of his fame and glory, bestrode the Nigerian political hemisphere like a colossus.  It was a tribute to these grave political miscalculations of the great Zik, that no less a personality than former Premier of the Eastern region, Dr. M.l. Okpara of blessed memory, recanted in agonizing lament, that he will regret till his dying day, his failure to advise Zik, to rather go with the Awo-led Action Group, as against the parochial expedience of the Hausa-Fulani feudal NPC.  Unfortunately, by the time the Zik-led NPP would negotiate a corrective ideological repentance for the progressive configuration, of “The Twelve Progressive Governors”, Awolowo’s brain-child in progressive synergy, which Zik had twice rejected, initially in 1959 and again in 1979,it was already too late in the day, as the looming surge of anarchy, had irrepressibly waxed beyond redemption, and could thus not avail as a viable counter-force to rebuff the incursion of the Buhari-Idiagbon duo, who on December 31st 1983, sprung forth to upstage the apple-cart of the corrupt and purulently decadent Shagari-led civilian administration of the second republic.  And in the case of Ojukwu, we would all recall, how having been politically demystified and deflated sequel to his attendant fiasco at the Senatorial election, he in angered repudiation of his erstwhile Hausa-Fulani allies, recanted in the fashion of a new convert to a doctrinaire proselytism of an East-West understanding fanatically propounded and propagated as a counter-force to the monolithic geo-political behemoth of the north.  Unfortunately, and on a tragic note of paradox, the average Igbo man would see nothing wrong in the political leaders of their own genitive breed, let alone the discerning cognitive intellect that essentially exposes these two key leaders of the Igbo tribe, in the context of the endemic faux pas in their choices and preferences borne of narrow personal and at best, tribal promptings, in terms of their dialectical linkage to the conundrum prevalently etched for decades, with increasing virulence on the polity; of which the Igbos were to come out the worse, arising from the seminal outpourings of the blighted vision of their own leaders.  On this, the Ghanaian statesman of blessed memory, Joe Appiah remarked in his autobiography, in which he exposed Zik as the veritable fugleman providing the primeval irritant for the irruption of the anti-yoruba racial hate, uncontrollably festering the general Igbo psyche.  Going down the lane of history, Appiah recalled the historic moment of the formation of Egbe Omo Oduduwa in London, and the conflagratory rhetorics immediately following on the heels, as Zik in the September 8 edition of the West African Pilot, thus issued the provocative cassus belli: “Henceforth, the cry must be one of battle against Egbe Omo Oduduwa, its leaders at home and abroad, uphill and down dale, in the streets of Nigeria and in the streets of London and the residence of its advocates’.  According to Chinweizu, a notable Igbo intellectual, “the testimony from a Ghanaian, who for many years, was a member and president of W.A.S.U in London, should give Igbos pause about the version of the Igbo-Yoruba cold war they had accepted. The key point is that the Ibo Union had been in existence before the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was founded. Yet Zik declared war on Egbe Omo Oduduwa. Why? If it was because the Egbe Omo Oduduwa was not pan Nigerian, then what of the pre-existing Ibo Union?”  “In other words, it wasn’t the Yorubas who introduced tribal unions and tribal politics into Nigeria but the Igbos. But whatever his reason, Zik was the one who declared war on the Yorubas; he was the aggressor”.  “With that aggression as background, the carpet-crossing becomes an understandable response to Zik’s declaration of war. If somebody who declared war on your people arrives to govern your homeland, what should your leaders do? Welcome him and let him govern or drive him out by any means necessary? The carpet crossing accomplished just that, and Igbos following Zik, the instigator of the response, I commend the Yorubas for defending themselves against aggression”.  “Zik’s conduct is an example of how Igbos can act without thinking of how their actions might look to those their proposed action might adversely affect. That is a weakness Igbos should be on guard against and should work to eliminate by extra self-awareness and constant self-criticism.”  “For seven decades we have paid for Zik’s aggression against the Yorubas. The cold war, which Zik started, made it possible for the British to install the NPC in power in 1959 when Zik refused to join with Awo to form the federal government. He explained it away by alluding to his distrust of Awo that stemmed from the carpet crossing affair. In other words, Zik is ultimately responsible for our disasters and oppression under the caliphate. But the pertinent issue at this time is that we, not the Yorubas, are responsible for the Yoruba-Igbo feud. We are not the innocent victims of Yoruba tribalism and hatred. That fact should inform our attitude in seeking reproachment with the Yorubas, especially now that we need a Yoruba – Igbo alliance to help create conditions.”  Unlike Achebe, whose world-view horrifyingly begins and ends with a segregationist chauvinism of pan Igboism, to the extent that he would see nothing bad in Zik, Ojukwu, and the primitively untamed Onyeama, but rather a blanket sweep sentiment of everything good, while in the obverse, he will faint blink an eye, before taking Awolowo, the foremost heroic symbol, to the cleaners on sheer sentimental illogic, which exposes his grossly deficient intellect – Soyinka on the other hand, had more than a sufficiently ample space to literally take the three-some to the hangers by virtue of their incredibly horrifying fumblings, sacrilegious deportments and heretic rantings and vituperations; but he would rather not plough that path, borne of his magnanimous large-heartedness and unifying propensity.  Similarly, he had the discretion to take on Achebe and his demented, warped, infantile and mediocre intellect, yet he would rather choose to lie low, actuated by sheer pacifist impulse and of course a macro-dimensional, all-encompassing vision of a united and indivisible Nigeria.  To be sure, as could not be too often repeated, Tinubu succeeded in lifting Lagos State to hitherto unprecedented eminence, thereby making it, not only the premier state of the federation, but also the benchmark of excellence, whose progressive, dynamic and pragmatic policies were emulated all over the federation.  In the libertarian struggle for democracy, he was prosiliently sui-generis as the hero of the struggle, as of course attested to, by the likes of Wole Soyinka, Colonel Nyiam, Dele Momodu, Kayode Fayemi, and even the Ayo Adebanjos, Abraham Adesanyas, Olanihun Ajayis among several others.  Besides, Asiwajus vast expanse of network built over the years, coupled with his personal charms, mobilisational and organisational acumen, his peculiar gift of the sixth sense, which his competitors could verily not match, are such rare but highly cherished treasures that money cannot buy.  But apart from the fact of his personal talent and endowment, is the law of Divine compensation, which is to say that Asiwaju is a man who had paid his dues.  As an arrow head of NADECO’s struggle for democracy under the totalitarian fascism of General Sanni Abacha, Asiwaju’s heroic role in this regard, will as much, demand an entire voluminous book to do justice to.  Of course, it’s a generally acknowledged fact of history that unlike the reactionary elements who would not give a damn in parleying with Abacha, Asiwaju refused to sell his conscience, but would rather negotiate a tedious journey to exile, despite the assurance by the management of Mobil, where he held forte as the Chief Treasurer, that he should not hesitate to retrace his step back to his plum job, if his romance with politics appeared bleak.  Evidence abound from the very horse mouth of people like Dele Momodu, Colonel Tony Nyiam, Kayode Fayemi, Bayo Onanuga and co, as to the immense sacrifice which Asiwaju made in assisting financially disadvantaged exiles whom he quartered in his houses both in the U.K .and the U.S., and even assisted financially, with regards to their daily upkeep.  At least, Bayo Onanuga did not mince words in divulging Asiwaju’s benevolent gestures in permitting him to draw a regular allowance of hundreds of dollars weekly, from proceeds issuing from Asiwaju’s Gas Station in Chicago.  Femi Ojudu, Osibajo’s Chief Campaign Man, similarly did reveal, how Asiwaju from his base in the U.S. was regularly remitting money for the payment of staff salary, and also for the daily running cost of PM NEWS and THE NEWS, at the harrowing moment when Abacha’s killer squad were let loose against the newspaper organization and it’s editorial staff.  Asiwaju did all these, despite the fact that he was not a shareholder of the organization. Rather, as a progressive politician and democrat to the core, he was solely fired by the zeal to boost the morale of the rank and file staff of the newspaper, in the struggle for democracy. The same thing Asiwaju did for TELL Magazine when things were direly so rough.  Similarly, Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, also narrated how at a point in time, as an exile in the U.S., Asiwaju embarked on the sale of Rice which involved a shuttle between Thailand and some African countries, while dedicating the proceeds from the business to the collective cause of the NADECO struggle.  Kayode Fayemi in his writings, also attested to this, in his remarks on how Asiwaju stretched his financial resources to the limit in the collective struggle for democracy.  The same incumbent governor of Ekiti State, also narrated the crucial role which Asiwaju as a member of the Board of Trustees of NALICON, founded by Wole Soyinka, at that era in exile, played in encouraging and convincing the Olof Palme Foundation, based in Sweden, to assist NALICON with the urgently needed fund for the establishment of the Radio Station which subsequently contributed in no mean measure, to a formidable propaganda armada which attracted international condemnation that increasingly debilitated and devastated the defences of the Abacha regime, making its eventual exit a matter of time, before the dramatic demise of the notorious military dictator.  At this juncture, the crucial point to be noted is that Asiwaju had barely spent two years as a senator, before Abacha took over. In this circumstance, a lesser mind would have wallowed in regret, cursing the day he went into politics; and would surely not hesitate in retracing his step back to his plum job, or fall headlong in romance with Abacha, just like a huge lots of members of his political class actually kowtowed at that time, while throwing honor and principles to the dogs. To be sure, it was apparent that Asiwaju was not looking forward to any gains. Rather, his main point of satisfaction consists in the fact that it was a worthy struggle.  In a nutshell, this is the democracy we all enjoy today. How many people ever bordered to imagine, the valley of the shadow of death, Asiwaju passed through in his struggle for civilian governance which we are all enjoying today, and how many of us who knew, do indeed appreciate?  All the political eaglets, neophytes and nonstarters, including state governors who had hardly spent 100 days in office, to whom an Angel had appeared and handed them the divine mandate to be president overnight, including those of them that Asiwaju made, where were they at that harrowing moment when Asiwaju was leading the battle from the trenches, far away in exile? How many members of the political class, who would not like to see even Asiwaju’s shadow, ever knew or appreciate or remember, as the case may be, what Asiwaju went through in those days; the dastardly vandalisation of his residence in Lagos and eight of his cars destroyed beyond repairs, the accusation that he wanted to plant a bomb at Ejigbo NNPC Depot, just because of his frontline involvement in the June 12 struggle, and how he escaped death by the whiskers by wangling through the borders of Benin Republic, for a harrowing life in exile?  Yet, Asiwaju never allowed his distinguished achievements in the struggle, to get into his head, through an overnight fancy for presidency.  Reliable authority even had it that on arrival from exile, Asiwaju in his characteristic selflessness, had actually intended to go for a Senatorial seat, but Afenifere top-notchers at that time, prevailed upon him to head on for governorship.  For close to thirty years, after he had been in politics, Asiwaju had refrained from announcing any ambition for presidency, rather, he had over the years, provided a platform for others like Falae, Atiku, Ribadu, Buhari and Co; to run for presidency, while in the process, risking his life, and everything dear to him, to accord them maximum support.  Imagine for instance, the immense role he played in the formation of APC, which eventually provided the platform for the fructification of Buhari’s passionate presidential ambition after three previously failed attempt which on a particular occasion, publicly drew tearful pathos of lament from him. For this, Asiwaju was bugged by some morally suspect media which obviously had kowtowed for the bargain of settlement; yet he refused to budge, until his unflagging support, inspired Buhari to a roller-coaster ride to presidential victory.  As an eminent political figure, an accomplished veteran of the battle for political liberty, a courageous leader of opposition, and arrowhead of the progressive forces, coupled with the fact that Asiwaju commanded more States in his own regional constituency more than any other politician could claim to command in their own respective regions, Asiwaju nevertheless conceded to Buhari.  Indeed in a more civilized clime, Asiwaju would have had no need to embark on any campaign spree or consultation. Rather, he would have been literally co-opted, without the slightest opposition, and with strong plea and persuasion too.  To be sure, people in Asiwaju’s class are rare. Not only is he an enigma, but an enigma within an enigma, the category that the Yorubas would describe as “Akanda Eeyan”. You can only toy with him at your own peril.  In all the geo-political Igbo-speaking states of the South-East, how many of Asiwaju’s contemporaries as state governors, command any conspicuity on the political radar, in astonishingly wide-berth comparison with Tinubu, who has continued to rise and rise like a meteor, to the enviable height which has deservedly earned him the treasurable eulogium of the ” Main Issue In Nigerian Politics”.  Imagine Igbos boasting that Lagos is no man’s land. Imagine the falsidical bunkum that they contributed the most in building Lagos. Why then do they not take recourse to their primordial native home and bring it to par with Lagos, after all charity they say, begins from home.  Familiar popular domiciles like Kaduna, Kano, Abuja, are notable spots with beehive ubiquity of Igbos. In other words, Igbos are virtually etched on the minutest space in these places; yet they would only tread cautiously, and would never stretch their luck too far, contrary to their licentious spoilt sport brag in Lagos, cashing in on the traditional hospitality of Yorubas and Lagosians in particular, stretched more than ever before, during the Tinubu era – in embrace of our Igbo brothers whom the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello would daub in the awry imagery of pathologicaly ungrateful usurpers.  All the excesses Igbos perpetrate in their host states, how many non-Igbos dare try an inch of that, in their own land, knowing Igbos for their characteristic hostile intolerance of non-Igbos in their own land.  When will Igbos rise above their genetically ingrained anti-yoruba hate and phobia, truculently unleashed this time around, on Soyinka and Tinubu, simply borne of their Leviathan stature and glowing distinction, waxing so discomfitting, dizzifying and unbearably unsettling in bewildering wide-breadth gap to their liluputian frame.  The magnitude of hate-words and outright rage of curses daily being unleashed on these great leaders of African continental and global renown by these over-zealous hordes of incurable anti-Yoruba Igbo haters, is not only amazing, but simply unimaginable, in this civilised epoch of modernity. It is amazing that Tinubu’s innocent biological offsprings are not even spared on this celebrative savage haul of unremitting outright curses.  The same treat of searing hate words, they also unleashed on Sam Omatseye. In one of the finest piece, ever written, the cerebral chairman, editorial board of the NATION newspapers marshalled a forensic psychosis of primeval savage deportment of the Igbo mass behavior in the dotting voyage to electoral destiny, come 2023; as a ready revanche; ever latent in the Igbo mass sub-conscious driven by a carthatic vent of the Biafran frustration.  No, sooner had the publication greeted the public space, than all hell, literally let loose on the highly endowed writer, courtesy of the unabashed herd of bigots, putting his precious life on the hanger with all manner of threats; which in turn elicited an outcry, from the larger mass of the Omatseye clan, pleading that nothing must touch their son.  But here are the same herd of over-zealous pleasure bullies making so much fetish of their miniature political god-head, who like Napoleon, can never be wrong and therefore above any reproof, or else Amadiora the mythical god of thunder, will descend in terrimotive wrath on the accuser  It is amazing that over fifty years after the civil war, Igbos would simply refuse to let go, as they continuously let loose the subdued pang of their latent Biafran frustration and segregationist chauvinism of anti Tinubu-Soyinka-cum-Yoruba hatred expressed through their primitively effusive farrago of empty balderdash  Just because they saw Tinubu as their main obstacle to the garrison conquest of Lagos State and the totalitarian circumambience of the larger Nigerian frame. Dear Ndigbo, why embroiled in a battle you know you cannot win, with all your soaring din of loud, but ineffectual pleasure stunt of empty grandstanding. Come may 29,2023, The great leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, will surely keep faith with history.  *Kola Johnson is a writer and journalist","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZnJlZWRvbW9ubGluZS5jb20ubmcvbmRpZ2JvLXNveWlua2EtdGludWJ1LWFzLW1ldGFwaG9ycy1vZi1hbnRpLXlvcnViYS1vYnNlc3Npb24tYnkta29sYS1qb2huc29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2021-01-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYorkCounty"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T23:55:22","When former US President Donald Trump waved as he and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., January 20, 2021. [Reuters]  When former US President Donald Trump was arraigned in a Manhattan court, I reflected about the historical route Kenya had taken.  It downed on me that although the US claims to be a leading democracy, just like Kenya, it has deep shades of plutocracy where monied individuals call the shots.  Kenya started off as an autocracy. President Jomo Kenyatta had absolute power over political, economic and social issues. His decisions were never subject to any internal or external legal restraint.  During the Mau Mau war, there were those who betrayed the course and sided with the colonial powers. They were home-guards. It is these individuals, who had acquired massive wealth and influence, that took over the reins of power. Kenya eventually transformed into an authoritarian rule pushed and propelled by plutocracy.  After many years of violent street protests, battles and deaths, long after the Cold War had fizzled out, Kenya ushered in multiparty democracy. But did this mean anything to the citizens?  Since 1991, the few wealthy and influential individuals and families have continued to control the country’s politics and economic power. They even control and influence the outcome of general elections. They work hard to viciously protect the wealth, land and property they have acquired over the years. Is it any wonder that our presidential elections have become a matter of life and death?  When Trump was elected the 45th President of the US in 2016, the primitive nature of US politics spewed out. Deep tribal and racial hatred began to flow out of the Super Power’s veins as the new American ‘dictator’ vowed to make America Great Again. Indeed, Trump brought out disastrous qualities found in three of Africa’s worst dictators; Idi Amin Dada, Francisco Macias Nguema and Jean-Bendel Bokassa.  Bokassa, the Central African Republic dictator possessed extreme greed and personal violence. Martin Meredith, in The State of Africa, says that Bokassa’s “excesses included 17 wives, a score of mistresses and an official brood of 55 children. He was prone to towering rages as well as outbursts of sentimentality; and he also gained a reputation for cannibalism.”  Trump may not have cannibalistic tendencies, but from his utterances, if given a chance, he can chew the entire black and Hispanic race from the face of the earth.  After toppling Uganda’s first President Milton Obote, military man Idi Amin Dada went on a brutal killing spree. Then in August 1972, Amin ordered Asians to leave Uganda within three months. Their properties were taken over by the army and Amin’s friends. Amin butchered thousands of civilians.  One of his wives Kay Adroa Amin was found dead, her dismembered body in the boot of a car. When Henry Kyemba, Amin’s Secretary to the Cabinet reported the discovery, Amin ordered him to have the dismembered parts sewn back to the torso. Kyemba, then arranged for Amin and his children to view the body.  In Equatorial Guinea, a politician of limited education and low mental ability, Francisco Macias Nguema, took over the country’s leadership in October 1968. He threw his country into what Meredith describes as “a nightmare of brutality and coercion that lasted for 11 years.”  Nguema hated foreigners and intellectuals. In February 1969, when on a visit to an urban centre, he discovered that Spanish flags were till flying there. His inflammatory speeches against the Spanish sent youth activists into the streets searching for Spanish victims. Nguema unleashed a brutal killing spree.  Assassinations in US and Kenya  The coming to power of Trump brought out so many similarities between Africa and the mighty US. I recalled that when the US was killing its own sons and daughters over civil and political rights in the 1960s, Kenya was also killing its loved ones.  In his memoir, For My Country and Flag, John Mwaura, a former legislator and ambassador, recalls his time as a student in the US during the 1960s. “I now look back at this historic moment and realise how privileged I was to be in America during the 60s. I realise how blessed I was to partly witness events of the civil rights struggle led by Rev Dr Martin Luther King and other civil right leaders. The black Americans were resisting racism and discrimination which were allowed in the Laws of USA, killing by shooting or lynching of blacks was normal and went unpunished.” Says Mwaura  Mwaura was in double shock. He had come from a British colony where suppression and mistreatment of black people by the settler community was as assured as sunrise. Kenya had just come out of a state of emergency. The pains and wounds of the Mau Mau war were still raw. He had assumed that America was the land of freedom where people would go about their business without care. “I was, therefore, shocked to find the same issues of blacks being mistreated by whites for no other reason but being black.”  The Atlanta-born Martin Luther King Jnr is regarded by historians as the most significant civil rights leader of the 20th Century. King graduated from Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester Pennsylvania in 1953. Two years later, he received his doctorate. It is in this same year that he became Pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. During that time, the local black community had staged a boycott of local bus companies because of the South’s strict code of racial segregation. The boycott lasted 382 days.  King arrested  King was arrested. His home was bombed. Eventually, the Supreme Court declared the bus segregation unconstitutional. It outlawed racial segregation on public transportation. His 1963 “I have a dream” speech, is considered one of the greatest speeches of the twentieth century.  It was made on August 28, 1963, exactly 100 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves. Martin Luther King Jr, ascended the marble steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. He told the enchanted crowd: “I am happy to join you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustices. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity. But one hundred years later, the Negro is still not free…..”  He went on; “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day, out in the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood…When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God’s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the Old Negro Spiritual; “Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last” The speech was electrifying. King pleaded with the black community not to pay evil with evil. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson asked Congress to ratify a tough voting rights bill in his State of the Union speech. King had launched a voter registration cause in Selma Alabama. When Congress stalled, King and more than 500 supporters marched from Selma to Montgomery to register African Americans to vote. Alabama police unleashed such violence on the marchers that the televised images shocked the country. Congress finally passed the Civil Rights Act of 1965 or the Voting Rights Act of 1965, on August 5 1965.  King was invited to Tennessee to support striking sanitation workers. He gave his famous; ‘I have seen the Promised Land’ Speech at the Mason Temple in Memphis on the evening of April 3. On April 4 1968 while standing on the balcony of the black owned Lorraine Hotel, he was shot in the neck. He died on the spot.  In 1965, three years before King’s assassination, Kenya’s Pio Gama Pinto was gunned down outside his gate. Pinto had started to poke holes into the acquisition of land and wealth by the new Kenyan leaders. Then in July 1969, another Kenyan leader Tom Mboya was shot and killed on the streets of Nairobi.  On Friday, November 22 1963, in Dallas, Texas, the tall, handsome, charismatic President of the United States of America, John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK), was shot dead. He was only 43. He was at the prime of his age and at the apex of his presidency. He became the youngest US president to die in office. JFK was killed by an assassin’s bullet as he rode in the motorcade through Dallas, Texas.  Kennedy had a bold vision and vital leadership qualities in challenging times. Kenyans who benefited from the Tom Mboya and Julius Gikonyo Kiano education airlifts, owe it to JFK. His personal endeavours ensured that young Kenyans received quality education and training to help steer Kenya’s leadership through the murky post-colonial waters. It is through the airlifts that Barack Obama Senior would fly to the US where he met, Ann Dunham, a white woman. The two got married and the world received Barack Hussein Obama, the first black President of the US.  JFK played a pivotal role in persuading whites about the importance of civil rights for black Americans who faced daily discrimination in many aspects of society. He successfully framed the civil rights debate as a historic struggle for basic civil and human rights for all citizens under the US constitution. He used his formidable communication skills to drive home messages.  On June 11 1963, JFK told Americans that the US was founded on the principles that all men were created equal. He said that all American students were entitled to attend public educational institutions, regardless of race. Discrimination, he said, affects education, public safety and international relations. The US, he argued, “cannot be preaching freedom internationally while ignoring it locally.”  JFK fought for and signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and set the stage for the subsequent passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. This landmark law fundamentally altered how blacks were treated in nearly all aspects of public life.  Tom Mboya, who was a close friend of JFK, was also gunned down. With his brilliance, charisma and oratory, Mboya would have become Kenya’s own Kennedy.  Political low for US  Decades after the JFK murder, America got its own version of Idi Amin, in the form of Donald Trump. An arrogant billionaire business mogul, Trump couldn’t hide his hatred for blacks and Hispanics. With huge following, Trump’s entry into the White House fuelled the White Supremacist movement. It reenergized the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). By the time he was running for re-election in 2020, Trump had lowered US political persuasions into raw third world types that are laced with racial and ethnic leanings. Businessmen and women were barricading their premises for fear of riots and hooligans looting of property.  Bands and gangs of different shades were arming themselves ready for street wars to defend their political affiliations. Trump even called certain leaders and governors to demand they alter election results. He threatened to hang onto power and refuse to handover when it was clear he had lost to Joe Biden.  On January 6 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the Capitol as Congress was certifying results of the November 2020 presidential election. Trump outlined a list of grievances against the media and some unsupportive Republicans. He made numerous false claims about how the election had been stolen from him.  “We will fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you are not going to have a country anymore. Because you will never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress does the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated. I know that will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make our voices heard” he told his cheering and chanting supporters who later invaded Congress.  Popularity surge despite cases  Court cases have started to haunt Trump. He is the first former President of the US to be arrested and arraigned. His arrest fueled debate on whether the case against him was justified or a witch-hunt against a Republican candidate.  Trump is accused of falsifying internal business records of his companies to conceal the fact that he paid 130,000 US dollars to a former porn star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about a sexual encounter she had with Trump nine days to the 2016 US election campaigns. Trump arranged through his lawyer to pay for her silence. The payments were made to aid Donald Trump’s campaign. His lawyer pleaded guilty to an election crime. Trump faces 34 felonies which, if convicted carry up to four years imprisonment.  Michael Ricci, a Republican Strategist says that, instead of losing favour, the case has led to an upsurge in Trumps popularity, placing the party in a very awkward position. Trump’s followers view the case as political persecution. “Trump is sucking oxygen out of all other Republican candidates” says Ricci  “The Georgia investigation raises a more serious case against Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the election results in Georgia.  He put pressure of Georgia officials to change election results. These are more serious criminal charges that will be preferred against Trump later in the year. No matter what he says. No matter what his supporters feel, Donald Trump is going to spend a lot of time in many court rooms even as he runs for President of the United States of America a second time.” Says Michael Isikoft of Yahoo News.  Yet, just like in Kenya, one can be a convicted criminal, or face serious legal charges, and still run for presidency. In 2013, Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto entered the presidential race while facing criminal charges at the International Criminal Court (ICC). The case against them eventually collapsed.  The Republicans don’t want Trump to be their standard bearer against Joe Biden in the 2024 Presidential race but they may be stuck with him.  Ryan Wiggins, a former Trump strategist says that: “The case has only super charged Trump. The man lives and thrives in chaos.” Since the case opened, says David Bolger a National Security Consultant, Trump has raised over 10 million dollars in his presidential campaign bid.  Bradley P Moss, an American lawyer says that Trump could easily run and win the presidency because nothing prohibits him from doing so.  Ryan Wiggins, who now works for the Lincoln Project, says she has been living in hiding since she parted ways with Trump. She receives constant death threats and her family is targeted. Ryan joined the Lincoln Project, which was formed in 2019 as an American Political Action Committee to prevent the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020. It comprises of former and current moderate Republicans.  Ryan notes that Trump is not a normal candidate. “His is a cult. His followers believe everything he says about witch-hunting. They live inside a bubble. They listen to conspiracy theories. I think it will propel him till he becomes a Republican nominee. I think it will help him in the Primaries and the general election” says Ryan  Ryan now has to work under cover and stay in hiding. She says she never knew that she would live to witness a day when one would live in hiding in the US because of one’s political affiliations or choices.: “When I started off as a political Consultant it was almost a boring job. It wasn’t dangerous. But now I get death threats constantly. They threaten to come for my children and family. The turmoil in the country now is so frightening and unfortunate that I prefer staying safe ”.  Trump’s presidency brought out the reality that the US is a plutocracy. In 2016, The Economist Intelligence Unit, downgraded the United States from a “full democracy” to a “flawed democracy” in its Democracy Reports, an annual study of the state of democracy around the world.  Earlier, in 2014, political scientists found that on average, the policies representatives pursue are not in fact dictated by public opinion, this is a mark of a flawed democracy.  Backsliding democracy  In 2021, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), classified the US as a backsliding democracy. Americas political system is broken. Lobbyists write laws while big money floods elections.  Ideally, decisions made in a democracy should reflect the needs and desires of the people. The US suffers a democratic deficit. The Congress normally follows and takes care of interests of the elite.  Just like in Kenya, the US will never be a true democracy because of structural issues and the government. So long as it sticks to the capitalist economy, the representative style of government that the US has, will hoodwink democracy. Representative governments do many times favour some people over others. Throughout global history, elites have always favored representative systems while revolutions push for democracy.  The US system has systematically favoured the owners of capital and large property, merchants and large land owners. The US constitution has for centuries protected private property and private ownership of productive resources like factories, farms and businesses. Some have argued that the system of checks and balances that the American founding fathers developed, was meant to protect the interest of elite few.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFuZGFyZG1lZGlhLmNvLmtlL25hdGlvbmFsL2FydGljbGUvMjAwMTQ3MzMyNy90cnVtcC1iZWZvcmUtY291cnQtc2ltaWxhcml0aWVzLWJldHdlZW4tdXMtYW5kLWFmcmljYW4tY291bnRyaWVzLW9uLXBvd2VyLWFuZC13ZWFsdGjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mirwaiz Molvi Muhammad Farooq was assassinated by unidentified gunmen at his residence in Srinagar on 21st May in 1990. On the same day, over 70 mourners were killed when Indian troops opened indiscriminate fire on his funeral procession in Hawal area of Srinagar. Twelve years later on May 21 in 2002, unknown attackers had shot dead Khawaja Abdul Ghani Lone when he was returning after addressing a gathering at the Martyrs’ Graveyard in Srinagar.  The APHC Vice Chairman, Ghulam Ahmed Gulzar, in a statement issued in Srinagar said, Mirwaiz Molvi Muhammad Farooq, Khawaja Abdul Ghani Lone and other martyrs of the freedom movement are the heroes of Kashmiri people. He said the Kashmiris on the martyrdom anniversaries of these leaders vow to accomplish the mission of their martyrs at all costs.  The APHC leader said that these noble souls sacrificed their lives for a great and sacred cause of freedom. He said, they were torch-bearers of freedom movement, and their struggle, teachings and sacrifices are role models for the future generations of Kashmir.  Ghulam Ahmed Gulzar said besides a visionary leader, Mirwaiz Molvi Muhammad Farooq was a great Islamic scholar, orator and preacher who through his powerful and soul stirring sermons educated and organized oppressed Kashmiris to raise their voice against the Indian oppression. He said Khawaja Abdul Ghani Lone was a prudent and outspoken leader who advocated peaceful existence between India and Pakistan. He said, this brave, courageous, fearless and heedful leader sacrificed his life for his belief in peaceful and pro-people resolution of Kashmir dispute. He appealed to the Kashmiris to held special prayers and pay homage to the departed souls.  The APHC Vice Chairman said, the assassination of these leaders was followed by the killing of many prominent scholars, intellectuals, human rights defenders, academics and social workers. The custodial deaths of iconic leader Syed Ali Gilani, Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai and Altaf Ahmed Shah are the recent examples of Indian brutality, he added.  Ghulam Ahmed Gulzar said India under a well-planned conspiracy is eliminating pro-freedom leaders to render the ongoing Kashmir freedom movement leaderless. He said that almost all APHC leaders are languishing and rotting in jails in inhuman conditions. He said most of these leaders including APHC Chairman Masarrat Aalam Butt, Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Milk and Aasiya Andrabi have been kept in death cells without any medical care and other basic facilities. He appealed to the UN, International Committee of Red Cross and other human rights bodies to come forward to save the lives of these Kashmiri political prisoners.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rbXNuZXdzLm9yZy9rbXMvMjAyMy8wNS8yMC9hcGhjLXBheXMtdHJpYnV0ZS10by1taXJ3YWl6LW1vbHZpLWZhcm9vcS1raGF3YWphLWdoYW5pLWxvbmUtb24tbWFydHlyZG9tLWFubml2ZXJzYXJpZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Soleimani, head of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was killed in a US drone strike ordered by then-US President Donald Trump in neighboring Iraq in January of 2020.  Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks when addressing a commemoration ceremony in the central province of Isfahan.  Commenting on Tehran's revenge for the US elimination of Soleimani, Salami said Iran threw the first ""slap"" by launching missiles at US Ain al-Asad base in the Iraqi province of Anbar just a few days after Soleimani's death.  ""The second slap is nothing but the US gradual pullout from the region,"" the commander said, noting the ""third slap"" has not been delivered yet.  Iran has long vowed to avenge Soleimani’s death. In 2020, it issued an arrest warrant against Trump and asked for Interpol's aid in detaining him in the killing of Soleimani.  Interpol swiftly rejected the request, saying its guidelines for notices forbids it from ""any intervention or activities of a political"" nature.  Last year, Iran announced it seeks to prosecute 127 suspects, who were not named, for involvement and cooperation in the elimination of Soleimani.  White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan later warned that Iran will face severe consequences if it attacks Americans, including any of those it sanctioned.  Also in 2022, an animated video published on the website of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei depicted the assassination of Trump.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbG5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8zNzE3MjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-11-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T14:00:00","President Lyndon B. Johnson is one of American history's most enigmatic figures. Although he is rightly criticized for bungling the Vietnam War, he was also one of the most productive progressives to ever inhabit the White House. Thanks to his knack for parliamentary maneuvering, Johnson passed some of the most important liberal legislation in American history: the landmark civil rights laws of the 1960s, Medicare, Medicaid, consumer protections, federal funding to education and the arts and protecting the environment. Even today, many young progressives admire Johnson for his ability to succeed in accomplishing humanitarian goals.  ""He forgot the fundamental political fact that for everyone who might possibly love a news photographer, there are perhaps millions who unquestionably love a dog.""  Yet once upon a time, the same man who is admired today for his War on Poverty was derided by many of those same activists for seemingly abusing his pet beagles. In the process, he inadvertently helped empower the animal rights movement.  The incident of canine cruelty occurred on April 28, 1964. Johnson had only been president for five months, but he had impressed members of both parties with his strong, soothing leadership in the immediate aftermath of President John F. Kennedy's assassination (which had put Johnson in the White House). As he casually strolled across the White House lawn with a group of guests, he decided to show off his two beagle puppies, Him and Her. Johnson wanted Him to bark, and so he held Him up by the ears.  ""But I'm glad that the owner never missed him,"" Johnson recalled, ""because I surely would if he left me.""  A photographer snapped a shot, which appeared in newspapers nationwide shortly thereafter. Then, all hell broke loose.  The Humane Society of Texas publicly denounced Johnson, proclaiming ""Ears are for hearing, not for pulling,"" while newspaper editorialists, television commentators and casual citizens alike also expressed their contempt. Although Johnson would go on to be elected in November by one of the largest landslides in history, the ear-pulling incident was nevertheless remembered as a rare gaffe from his early days in office. Privately, Johnson swore that he would punish the journalists who broke the story by giving them ""the silent treatment,"" insisting that pulling on dogs' ears was a healthy way to encourage them to bark. (Experts agree: It is absolutely not, and you should never do it.)  From a historical standpoint, the tale says a great deal about the evolution in American attitudes toward animal rights. Only a few decades earlier, president Theodore Roosevelt was celebrated throughout the nation for his epic safari expeditions, which featured the slaughter of many animals that today are endangered. Roosevelt's attitude toward animal rights was a seeming paradox: He had countless pets upon whom he endlessly doted and was an ardent conservationist, but he also enjoyed hunting and taxidermizing the exotic animals that he studied. At the time, the American public adored him for it, seeing no contradiction in creating the teddy bear to celebrate Roosevelt sparing an injured bear's life and ignoring that he had delegated its execution to his hunting companion.  Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist.  Of course, hunting wild animals and injuring one's own pets are quite different, at least in the minds of most people, but nevertheless the reality remains that Roosevelt was able to unironically present himself as an adorer of animals even as he built much of his image on butchering them. Johnson, who was also a hunter, could not display similar callousness toward animals in front of the prying public's eyes without facing backlash.  Indeed, to some extent Johnson did benefit from the same image of macho-ness that Roosevelt cultivated: A day after the event, a pro-Johnson editorial in the Greensboro News and Record enthused, ""Lyndon Johnson can get the ears of both beagles and businessmen, and make them like it."" Yet New York Times columnist Arthur Krock summed up an equally sizable chunk of opinion with the observation, ""When the other day he lifted his pet beagle by the ears to please the news photographers he forgot the fundamental political fact that for everyone who might possibly love a news photographer, there are perhaps millions who unquestionably love a dog.""  To be fair, there is more to Johnson's story than him simply being a clod when it came to dogs. While Johnson likely was extremely narcissistic, he was not a psychopath and genuinely enjoyed being around dogs. As a poor country boy in rural Texas, he regularly played with both his own dogs and stray dogs in his neighborhood. That is why Johnson was so excited when the litter of beagle puppies was born during his vice presidency, in the summer of 1963, and he enjoyed teaching children about the proper way to pet beagles. Johnson was surrounded by beagles during his presidency, including such vivid personalities as Edgar (bequeathed to him by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover) and Little Beagle (so named for obvious reasons).  Lest one thing Johnson only liked beagles, he famously befriended a stray mutt named Yuki (Japanese for ""snow"") that had been picked up by one of his daughters. Johnson instantly identified with the dog and took him everywhere, even training him to sing on command and impressing the British Ambassador by howling in synchrony. Johnson's connection with Yuki was so strong that after his presidency, he recorded a single called ""LBJ: Dogs Have Always Been My Friends"" where he admitted that he was worried Yuki's original owner might one day find him.  ""But I'm glad that the owner never missed him,"" Johnson recalled, ""because I surely would if he left me.""  If there is a lesson here, it is that people can sincerely love their dogs and still make mistakes as dog owners. In order to be a good dog owner, it is not enough to simply care for your dog; you have to listen to other people, some of whom know more about dogs, when they provide you with instructions about their welfare.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIwL3RoaXMtbGliZXJhbC1waWNrZWQtdXAtaGlzLWRvZy1ieS10aGUtZWFycy0tYW5kLWl0LW91dHJhZ2VkLWFuaW1hbC1yaWdodHMtYWN0aXZpc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Khan, 70, is Pakistan's most popular politician and his arrest on corruption charges last week, following months of political crisis, prompted his supporters to pour onto the streets of several cities.  Violent clashes erupted with police, government buildings were set on fire and military installations damaged, with at least nine people killed in the unrest.  Open criticism of the military, which has staged three coups and heavily influences domestic politics and foreign policy, is rare in Pakistan's political mainstream.  ""We have ample amount of evidence to present to any inquiry that the arson and in some places, shootings were done by (intelligence) agencies men who wanted to cause mayhem and blame it on PTI so the current crackdown would be justified,"" the party said in a statement.  ""PTI believes that identification of elements involved in this unusual incident of violence and chaos through a credible investigation is inevitable,"" the statement said.  It did not offer any evidence for the claim.  More than 7,000 people have been detained or arrested since the unrest broke out.  At least 19 senior PTI officials have been arrested, some in overnight raids on their homes, after being accused of instigating the violence.  The PTI statement came a day after top commanders vowed to try those involved in damaging military installations in military courts.  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whose government has vowed to rearrest Khan, said he would open more anti-terrorism courts to try people accused of anti-state behaviour during the protests.  The independent Human Rights Commission Pakistan said it was“deeply concerned by reports of random arrests and cases filed arbitrarily against PTI workers across Pakistan”.  “A distinction must always be made between those resorting to violence and non-violent political workers,” it said in a statement this week.  Khan's arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court's chief justice and he was later released and granted protective bail.  He has been tied up in dozens of legal cases since being ousted in April 2022, a frequent hazard for opposition leaders in Pakistan.  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of huge rallies challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, many analysts and politicians said it was with the backing of the generals.  Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass over foreign policy and other issues.  In opposition, Khan has made explosive claims about the military's involvement in politics, including that it plotted with the United States to oust him from power and that senior officials planned a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  He has offered no evidence to support his claims but named a senior intelligence services general and Sharif as being responsible for the attack.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbWVuYWZuLmNvbS8xMTA2MjgxOTU1L0V4LVBha2lzdGFuLVBNLUtoYW5zLVBhcnR5LUJsYW1lcy1JbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtQWdlbmNpZXMtRm9yLVZpb2xlbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Notably, Tytler, who has been a key accused in the riots, is charge-sheeted for his alleged role in inciting, instigating, and provoking the mob assembling at Gurudwara Pul Bangash at Azad Market in Delhi, according to sources.  The Congress leader's name in the Central agency's fresh chargesheet comes after the latter recorded the voice sample of Tytler, after getting ""fresh evidence"" in the case. According to sources, several relevant sections under IPC have been filed against the Congress leader. Notably, earlier in April, Tytler arrived at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in the CGO Complex where experts collected his voice sample.  CBI names Jagdish Tytler in fresh chargesheet  It is pertinent to mention that the case pertains to the riots at Gurudwara Pul Bangash in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. The central agency had filed three closure reports so far, however, it had reinvestigated the case of the killing of three victims-- Badal Singh, Thakur Singh and Gurcharan Singh near the Gurudwara in North Delhi, after a court in December 2007 refused to accept its closure report.  Notably, the case against Tytler was one of the three cases the Nanavati Commission had ordered to be reopened by the CBI in 2005. The Commission has named Tytler as one of the organisers of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.  1984 anti-Sikh riots  The anti-Sikh riots of 1984 were a series of violent attacks that occurred in India following the assassination of Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984. Then-PM Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for Operation Blue Star, a military operation carried out at the Golden Temple in Amritsar earlier that year to remove Sikh separatists.  After the assassination, widespread violence erupted primarily in the national capital, but also in other parts of India, targeting Sikh individuals, businesses, and gurdwaras. Mobs, allegedly incited by political leaders, targeted Sikhs, resulting in widespread killings, looting and arson. The violence continued for several days, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Sikhs and leaving many more injured, displaced, and traumatised. According to official records, about 2,800 Sikhs were killed across India, including 2,100 in Delhi  The 1984 anti-Sikh riots are considered a dark chapter in India's history and have been widely condemned as an instance of communal violence and human rights abuses. The failure of the authorities to effectively intervene and protect the Sikh community during the riots has been a subject of criticism and controversy. The victims and their families have been seeking justice and accountability for the perpetrators involved in the violence.

According to Deadline, John Travolta and Al Pacino join a star-studded cast helmed by award-winning director David Mamet to create Assassination, a film that imagines what could have actually happened to spur the John F. Kennedy assassination.  While John Travolta and Al Pacino would be enough star power to man a movie of this caliber on their own, Assassination is gearing together a fully star-studded cast that will also include The Lord of the Rings’ Viggo Mortenson, Heist’s Rebecca Pidgeon, singer and actress Courtney Love, and controversial actor Shia LaBeouf. The six actors set to star in this political thriller boast an incredible combined collection of accolades as Pacino won an Oscar for his performance in The Godfather, and Travolta and Mortenson were both nominated for Academy Awards for their performances in Pulp Fiction and Green Book, respectively. Additionally, LaBeouf is a BAFTA winner for his performance in Honey Boy, while Pidgeon was nominated for an NBR Award, and Love was nominated for a Golden Globe.  David Mamet, the director of Assassination, is just as undeniably talented as John Travolta, Al Pacino, and the rest of the cast. Mamet is a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright whose work has been nominated for a Tony Award, multiple Academy Awards, and Golden Globes, and he is a BAFTA nominee. He is most well-known for penning the 1997 political dramedy Wag the Dog starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert DeNiro.  Arclight Films Chairman Gary Hamilton says that the stars have aligned for Assassination, claiming that the film “is a riveting and gripping thriller set in a pivotal period in American history, brilliantly crafted by Mamet – it’s an absolutely fantastic project.”  John Travolta in Pulp Fiction  While there has been no announcement yet on who John Travolta, Al Pacino, and the rest will play in the film, a synopsis for the political thriller has been released. Based on the true events of the JFK assassination, the movie will re-imagine his death and be told as though the assassination were a hit ordered by the kingpin of the Chicago mob as payback for Kennedy’s betrayal towards the crime organization after they helped him get elected to office.  In many ways, the upcoming John Travolta and Al Pacino film is inspired by director Oliver Stone’s political thriller JFK released in 1991. The Warner Bros. film was based on the books On the Trail of the Assassins (1988) by Jim Garrison and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy (1989) by Jim Marrs, which examined many conspiracy theories, including the idea that the mafia supported Kennedy. Mamet co-wrote the script for Assassination with Nicholas Celozzi, who is the grandnephew of Chicago mob kingpin Sam Giancana, the mafia leader the script suggests ordered the hit on JFK.  Assassination is being created for the Cannes market and currently does not have a slated release date as it is still in the pre-production process. In the meantime, John Travolta and Al Pacino have remained busy in Tinseltown, and both have several upcoming projects in the works. Next up for Travolta are The Shephard, Mob Land, and Cash Out, which are all in post-production and set to release soon, while Pacino’s Knox Goes Away and Billy Knight have also wrapped production and are in the post-production phase as well.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS9lbnQvam9obi10cmF2b2x0YS1hbC1wYWNpbm8tbW92aWUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Pakistani foreign office said the visit by Israeli authorities was part of a series of recent Israeli actions that were disrespectful to Muslims around the world.  “Pakistan strongly condemns storming of Al Aqsa Mosque by a member of the Israeli occupation authority and members of the Knesset under protection of Israeli occupation forces,” it said in a statement.  “Violation of the sanctity of one of the holiest sites in Islam constitutes yet another reprehensible event in a series of escalatory Israeli actions disrespectful to religious sentiments of over 1.5 billion Muslims around the world.”  The visit came as tens of thousands of Israeli nationalists marched through the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem’s walled Old City under heavy security in an annual event that drew condemnation from Palestinians.  The parade is the main celebration on Jerusalem Day, when Israel marks its capture of Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The event has become a show of force for Jewish nationalists and, for Palestinians, a blatant provocation meant to undermine their ties to the city.  Despite fears the event could spark a renewed violence following days of cross-border fire with Palestinian militant fighters in Gaza last week, the march ended with no major security incidents.  Pakistan once again called on the international community to take immediate action to put an end to Israeli transgressions in the occupied Palestinian territories since the beginning of this year.  “We reiterate that such acts are inconsistent with the right to freedom of expression and religion or belief of the Palestinian people, defying all humanitarian and human rights laws and norms,” the statement read.  “We reaffirm unstinted support for the Palestinian cause, and renew our call for a viable, independent and contiguous Palestinian State, with pre-1967 borders, and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital being the only just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue.”  ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNjkyNi9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Now the former solicitor and academic is chief executive of the Legal Defence Union has transformed that life-long love of books into a novel of his own.  Fresh from the publication of The Berlin Gambit, Angus-based writer David O’Donnell gives the impression that he still can’t quite believe his luck in securing a publishing deal for his debut novel.  Reading and the nuance of language have always been at the heart of his life and career, from the fond memories of borrowing his, “four permitted books from Coatbridge Public Library,” to his legal career. “I suppose the skill of a lawyer is writing,” he points out, “and I’m hoping that the way The Berlin Gambit is written will engage the readers.”  Legal beginnings  “I was lucky enough to get enough Highers to study law,” says David, who was the first person in his family to go to university. “My family weren’t academic in any way, but equally they were a very loving and supportive family.”  Looking back, he says that reading and trips to the library were: “probably vital to me as a child. My parents didn’t have enough money, certainly, to buy me four books a week.” He recalls discovering Enid Blyton, and then devouring natural history books, “there wasn’t a lot of natural history in Coatbridge, so I guess that was my escape,” he laughs.  Later, it was the world of JRR Tolkien that had him reading into the wee small hours.  “Probably the most influential author was Alistair MacLean (author of thrillers and adventure stories such as Where Eagles Dare and Ice Station Zebra) I thought he was wonderful – I would take his books home and I was up to probably two or three in the morning!”  For his own debut, David has chosen to delve into the fascinating and horrifying era of Germany’s Third Reich. Based around real historical events including the assassination of high-ranking Nazi Reinhard Heydrich in 1942, The Berlin Gambit follows the story of ordinary German police investigator Rolf Schneider as he is tasked with investigating Heydrich’s death and finding some important secret papers.  The author says that although he has never visited Berlin, “I have been to Germany a number of times and it fascinated me. I have spent many years reading about the Nazis’ rise to power and trying to understand how that could have happened.  “Then there was also the story about secret files that Heydrich held on senior members of the Nazi Party – that was the starting point for the novel.”  When fact meets fiction  With historical fact acting as the bedrock for the story, David then introduced the fictional character of Rolf Schneider. “He could be any non-political German living in the Third Reich,” he explains, adding that he represents, “people who turned a blind eye, who just got on with their jobs, thinking ‘it’s nothing to do with me’.”  Schneider’s investigation takes him on a journey across Europe and into a tangled web of corruption and secrecy within the Reich. He can no longer escape asking himself searching questions about what is going on in the world around him.  Buoyed by the fact that The Berlin Gambit was accepted by the Polygon imprint of Edinburgh-based Birlinn, the first publishing house he approached, David has certainly taken to writing like a duck to water. “I’ve got more than the bug, I’ve got a draft sequel all ready!” He laughs. “It follows on from The Berlin Gambit but is quite different and I introduce new characters.”  The Berlin Gambit by David O’Donnell, £9.99, Polygon is available now.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvdXJpZXIuY28udWsvZnAvbmV3cy9hbmd1cy1tZWFybnMvNDM1NDEyMC9ib29rcy1kYXZpZC1vZG9ubmVsbC1vbi1oaXMtdGhyaWxsaW5nLWRlYnV0LXRoZS1iZXJsaW4tZ2FtYml0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The scandal first emerged in January 2018, accusing then opposition leader Sharif of ordering cancelation of a contract given to successful bidder, M/s Chaudhry Latif and Sons, for the Ashiana-i-Iqbal housing scheme, that led to the subsequent award of the contract to Lahore Casa Developers, a proxy group of the Paragon City Private Limited, resulting in a loss of Rs193 million.  Sharif was also accused of directing the Punjab Land Development Company to assign the Ashiana-i-Iqbal housing project to the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), which awarded the contract to Lahore Casa developers, causing a loss of Rs715 million and the ultimate failure of the project.  But the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in its report on Saturday said that no loss was made to the national kitty, neither did PM Sharif get any financial benefit from the project, according to local media reports.  “It is proved beyond any doubt that the treasury didn’t suffer any loss,” Pakistan’s Geo news channel quoted NAB as stating in its report.  “No evidence of misuse of powers was found against Shahbaz Sharif.”  NAB also cleared co-accused, including bureaucrats Fawad Hasan Fawad and Ahad Khan Cheema, and Kamran Kiani, brother of former army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kiani, of any wrongdoing in the matter.  Last month, an accountability court had issued notices to NAB seeking its reply on Sharif and Cheema’s pleas for acquittal in the case.  In its reply submitted to the accountability court on Saturday, NAB stated that Sharif had referred the matter of awarding the Ashiana-i-Iqbal project to M/s Chaudhry Latif & Sons to the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment “in accordance with law with no malafide intent,” which ultimately led to the cancelation of the contract.  “The accountability court should decide on Shehbaz Sharif’s plea for acquittal according to the law,” the NAB report concluded.  The development comes more than a week after the anti-graft body cleared Sharif, his family members and others in two cases registered against them for laundering money and possessing assets beyond their known sources of income.  Former premier Imran Khan has repeatedly accused the shaky coalition government of PM Sharif of using influence to get the names of treasury members cleared by the authorities in graft cases.  The latest report is expected to spark a controversy in the South Asian country, which has already been embroiled in political and economic crises for months.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNjk2Ni9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The incident took place in Swat which was once a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban, formally called the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), before security forces launched a military operation in 2009 to reclaim the area. Pakistani Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai also survived an assassination attempt in the same valley after she was shot in the head by a TTP militant in 2012.  The police constable, identified as Alam Khan, was deployed to provide security to a public school before the shooting incident. The provincial administration of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), where Swat is located, constituted an inquiry committee to investigate Khan’s motives and run a background check on him to see if he had links with any banned militant outfits.  “Constable Alam Khan has confessed to the crime twice, once during the initial police investigation and the second time when he was brought before a judicial magistrate,” Swat’s district police officer (DPO) Shafiullah Gandapur told Arab News.  “He told the judicial magistrate and the police that some evil thoughts had crept into his mind and it was devil who made him do it.”  Gandapur added the inquiry committee constituted by the KP government visited Swat to probe the case during this week.  “The committee has almost completed its investigation and the draft of its findings will soon be submitted to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration,” he said.  The DPO informed Khan would also undergo a psychological evaluation.  “This is a high-profile case and we want to investigate it fairly and transparently,” he added.  Meanwhile, the family of Ayesha Abid, who lost her life in the shooting incident, expressed shock at the senseless act of violence.  “On that day, my niece was making excuses since she did not want to go to the school, but her mother forcibly sent her,” Hayat Ali, Abid’s uncle, told Arab News.  He informed the five-year-old had been enrolled in playgroup at the Sangota Public School only a few months ago.  “She was alive while she was taken to hospital,” he added. “[I cannot imagine what] pain she was going through while she was on her way to the Saidu Teaching Hospital.”  “We don’t want justice only for ourselves but for everyone,” Ali said. “We have lost our child, and she will not return even if [the police] kill the person who is in their custody.”  The KP government ordered the police to carry out psychological evaluation of all law enforcement personnel on security duties following the incident, adding the procedure must be repeated twice a year.  Gun violence targeting children is rare in Pakistan.  However, nearly 150 people, mostly students, were killed in 2014 when TTP militants attacked a school in Peshawar, the capital of KP province.  Since then, the authorities have deployed police at schools across the country, especially in the volatile northwest where the Pakistani Taliban have stepped up attacks on security forces in recent months.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzA1Ni9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mangoes hold great popularity among the people of Pakistan, and their export helps generate millions of dollars in revenue. Additionally, they serve as a cultural symbol and a diplomatic tool, aiding the government in strengthening international connections.  “The mango export season started today with the first air shipment to Europe,” Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of the All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association, told Arab News. “The first shipment through sea will depart the country on May 22. It will go to the United Arab Emirates and other gulf countries like Oman and Saudi Arabia.”  Ahmed said 50 percent of Pakistani mangoes were exported by sea, 35 percent by land, and 15 percent by air.  He informed that Pakistan’s mango export target was 125,000 metric tons during the current year, adding it would help the country earn about $100 million.  “Pakistan’s main export destinations are the Middle East and Europe and around 40 percent of our mangoes exports go to the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Iran,” he added.  Ahmed informed last year was not good for mango exports due to the climate change that led to unprecedented monsoon rains and heavy floods. He added the situation brought down mango production by about 50 percent, making the country export only 90,000 metric tons.  “Pakistan’s average annual production is about 1.88 million metric tons, but last year it was impacted by about 50 percent,” he said. “This year, we are expecting around 20 percent reduction in the overall yield which is expected to be around 1.44 million metric tons.”  He asked research institutes and provincial agriculture departments to devise a strategy to deal with the adverse impact of climate change on the crop since it was becoming a regular feature.  “They should introduce new varieties of mangoes which can sustain emerging weather trends and raise awareness among mango growers about how to avert the negative impact of the climate change,” he added.  Ahmed also pointed out the deteriorating law and order situation in the country also posed challenges to exporters.  “In Pakistan, 70 percent of mangoes are produced in Punjab, and if a single day of delivery is disrupted, it impacts our export target since ships and cargoes do not wait,” he added.  Muhammad Azhar Sheikh, managing director of Iftikhar Ahmed and Co., which exports the fruit to the Middle East, said the UAE was the hub for Pakistani mangoes.  “The bulk of Pakistani mango exports go through the UAE to other Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and others,” he said.  Sheikh added the varieties which were liked the most in the Arab countries included Chaunsa, Sindhri, Banganapalle, Dasheri and Anwar Ratol.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyYWJuZXdzLnBrL25vZGUvMjMwNzAwMS9wYWtpc3RhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2019-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T04:30:00","On May 3, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive on combatting corruption. The initiative promises to address the disappointment expressed by many Maltese that EU membership did not extend to secure the standards of integrity we see in political life on the continent.  As the story of Joseph Muscat’s suspicious €500,000 from Vitals unfolds, it is clear to all that EU accession did not contribute at all to cleaner politics in Malta.  The new EU directive just announced has the potential to change that. But while the initiative is a step in the right direction, the effectiveness of the proposed provisions must be improved if we want a concrete impact on the ground in Malta.  Given the craftiness of corrupt operators on these islands, devising webs of accomplices and accounts across the globe, a new EU law must include mechanisms designed to overcome what has so far eluded us notwithstanding the good number of laws designed precisely to tackle corruption locally.  The commission’s target of “building a culture of integrity” would be welcomed in Belgium for example, where the secret services snooped Eva Kaili and her associates, catching them red-handed with bags of cash. In Malta, on the other hand, the Pilatus Bank chairperson flew away, unquestioned, with the smoking gun while the notion of public ‘integrity’ lies at a level where the government bulldozes a law through parliament so that it can choose the referee who is to decide on ‘standards’.  The commission says it wants to engage in “carrying out information and awareness-raising campaigns” against corruption. How will we go about that with our own PBS? The local courts already condemned PBS for bias against the PN. Did the reporting change after that? Will they cover every detail with the Muscat and Konrad Mizzi meltdown like the independent media? We all doubt that.  The proposed EU directive, in fact, builds on a presumption, which in Malta is indeed rebuttable, that the provisions decided at a European level will find the cooperation of a police force ready to apply the law. That is not the case here. In Malta, we needed Bernard Grech and Adrian Delia to tell the police commissioner to act against the 37 people mentioned in the Vitals/Steward court judgment that exposed how the public sector is literally in bed with corrupt politicians and businesses.  The proposed directive aims to set up “specialised anti-corruption bodies” that enjoy “adequate resources and training” to act against “obstruction of justice and illicit enrichment”. Fine words. But with Malta’s police commissioner, nolle prosequis have become the order of the day. They’re issued with liberal abandon as are the ‘mistakes’ in the prosecution of corruption cases. Police officers dealing with corruption resign in succession while corrupt politicians enjoy unadulterated impunity while flaunting their unexplained wealth.  Indeed, in Malta we seriously need a legal instrument for unexplained wealth. As yet in Malta we do not have a law allowing the police to delve deeper into prima facie illicit gains. Muscat’s €485,000 from ‘consultancies’, for instance, merit closer investigation. That is one area where the commission proposal may have the potential to stir the waters as Brussels is expected to push for a number of provisions to be harmonised in all EU jurisdictions.  EU accession did not contribute at all to cleaner politics in Malta - Peter Agius  Maybe Prime Minister Robert Abela will find it harder to give the impression of taking action with Ursula Von der Leyen than he did after the publication of the inquiry into the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia. That inquiry in fact suggested that a new legal instrument for unexplained wealth be introduced in Maltese law. In 2021, the PN proposed such a legal instrument among 12 initiatives it lodged in parliament, only to be shot down by Abela.  Those 12 bills are fundamental if we want a fair society where corruption is shunned by all rather than promoted, even flaunted, as is the case right now. The proposed directive has the potential to reactivate momentum for changes to our criminal code. We need more than changes to the law, however. We need to ensure that the authorities are effectively forced to act upon legal provisions. This is precisely where the proposed directive is weak: in Malta we already have the legal instruments but the police seem to refuse to use them.  A main weakness of the proposed directive is precisely the fact that it is a directive and, hence, it leaves it in the hands of the Maltese government to transpose and implement in Malta. We need this law to be a regulation instead. An EU regulation would be directly enforceable without government intervention. Moreover, an EU regulation would, contrary to a directive, give every citizen the direct right of recourse to the courts to hold the Maltese government to account on corruption.  The proposed EU corruption law has just been submitted and more than a year of negotiations in the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in expected. In all probability, it will be again on the agenda of the new European Parliament elected in a year’s time. The MEPs you choose in June 2024 will be the ones to propose amendments to this law and ensure that Europe empowers us to act against corruption in Malta and across the Union.  If you choose to support me as an MEP candidate, I will do my utmost to see that this law has stronger teeth to bite the likes of Muscat and Mizzi and make a difference in Maltese politics. Like you, I want a fairer society where politicians decide only with the common good in mind.  I want civil society and citizens to be empowered to seek action and answers by the police and the political class. I want journalists to be unfettered in their investigative journalism not blocked in a room in Castille.  Corruption attacks the very heart of our society. I will fight it at every turn, not just with strong words but with concrete action, with renewed energy and the intelligence needed to turn ideals into fruitful actions.  Peter Agius was head of the European Parliament’s Office in Valletta and a member of European Parliament president Antonio Tajani’s cabinet. He is contesting next year’s MEP elections with the Nationalist Party.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L3N0cm9uZ2VyLWV1LWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tbGF3LjEwMzIxNzPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Komal Tariq*, Sannia Aziz*  After the September 11 attacks, terrorism became global. Terrorism and extremism culminated in Pakistan after 9/11 and a catastrophic security situation (Malik 2005, 23).in a fear based oppressor assault, a huge number of individuals kicked the bucket and numerous others were harmed. The circumstance in this nation is awful, however in FATA and KPK, the savagery proceeds. Pakistan needs participation and solidarity in the nation in these troublesome conditions. By and large, the security circumstance in Pakistan is decaying each day and steps must be taken to address this issue. The Bush routine gave budgetary help to the Pakistani armed force to dispatch psychological oppressor tasks in the ancestral zone. Security in Pakistan has been shaken and security issues have emerged. To battle the spooky powers that undermine Pakistan’s national security, Pakistan has turned into an accomplice in the battle against psychological oppression. Security in Pakistan presently has an extensive rundown of security challenges, including the death of Osama container Laden, the Raymond Davis scene, Pakistan’s doubt of the United States and worldwide forces, the talk about the nation. “Do it once more “enrolled by the Indians in Balochistan and the atomic fear monger compromises Pakistan? That is the reason Pakistan, an atomic nation, has been ousted by the war against psychological oppression. Pakistan has not had the option to perceive the transitory penance it has made to the United States in the battle against fear mongering and has dependably been the objective of US analysis.  In addition, in South Asia, India has been declared a strategic partner, not Pakistan. Suicide bombings have increased in Pakistan when terrorism suspects are kidnapped at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and there is no safe place. While Pakistan is more volatile than before during the first decade of the war on terrorism. More than 500 blows were killed and Pakistani security was destroyed. More than 35,000 have died. The growing threat to Pakistan’s national security must be eliminated in the current situation. This weakens Pakistan’s roots and also damages its national and international image. Pakistan has highlighted its costs as a partner in the fight against terrorism on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the tenth anniversary. Wall Street newspapers reported missing important information in the United States, which showed that Pakistan was facing serious security problems (21,672 civilians and 2,750 soldiers and 8,571 wounded). For Pakistan, this is a serious problem and this security problem has not been resolved. This not only destroys Pakistan’s internal security infrastructure, it also damages them economically. While Pakistan is a war partner, US leaders and their region have always considered it a safe haven for terrorism. Pakistan is considered in India and Afghanistan as a terrorist base and supports terrorism in that country. Due to the high death rate in Pakistan, drone attacks are responsible. External attacks on Pakistani civil society and sovereignty were ignored for the first time in their history. Tensions have also increased between Washington and Islamabad. This attack with drones kills civilians in tribal areas instead of terrorists. . This isn’t just an infringement of human rights, yet in addition an infringement of Pakistan’s power. The Arial assault increments ancestral male radicalism and produces antimicrobials. Specifically, in the United States and the West, blow-back has expanded. The Pakistani money related division assesses the $ 2.1 billion of the war on fear based oppression that influences the Pakistani economy. Notwithstanding lessening FDI, a vile security circumstance negatively affects fares and generation. The State Bank of Pakistan said that FDI was decreased by 54.6 percent in 2010, causing lost $ 1.18 billion. Due to internal security, unstable policies and the terrorist threat. Our government cannot enter into new agreements with foreign stakeholders in the current scenario. Due to suicide bombings and the government’s stable security policies, the deterioration of the security situation in the country is creating fear and chaos for the population.  The exchange has fallen. Due to Pakistan’s geostrategic position, Pakistan’s job in overcoming the Taliban and discovering shelter on the Afghan outskirt is significant. Relations between the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the innate zones of Pakistan are compelled to act. In 2003, under the Musharraf routine, Pakistan propelled a counterinsurgency task driven by FATA. The commencement was an extraordinary calamity, not awful after the beginning of the activity. Pakistan has been blamed for episodes at the outskirt crossing, in spite of the war against US delegates in the area. After the war against fear based oppression, numerous Uzbeks, Tajiks, Yughiers and Chechens came to Pakistan and attempted, with the Taliban alliance in the nation, to destabilize Pakistan. These incorporate medications, the supply of complex weapons, kidnappings of individuals for their activities against security powers and assaults on innate security powers, a noteworthy danger to Pakistan’s security. This is only a bad dream for Pakistan since its commitment has set Pakistan in a security situation as opposed to killing current dangers. Destitution is expanding in the FATA in Pakistan, prompting fanaticism and frail open request. The Taliban and Al Qaeda are utilizing this circumstance. Impeded young people were procured and utilized to serve the state, which undermined state security. Education in Pakistan is also influenced by the war on terror. The operations of the Taliban and Al Qaeda burned and destroyed more than 190 schools in Pakistan. Pakistan has the highest level of illiteracy. The Taliban have banned the education of women in tribal areas. In addition, 42% of children’s schools were destroyed. Almost 150,000 people are unemployed and 8,000 are employed. Absence of education is additionally a security issue for Pakistan. This has lamentable ramifications for the strength of the legislature and the fate of instruction.  Pakistan and its people continue to face worldwide economic limitations because of their geostrategic position and their current political condition. The nation currently faces the following strategic constraints.  The motivating change in the Indo-U.S relations has left flow results on Pakistan amongst the 1990s. It was period of seclusion for Pakistan. US showed astonishing strategy of troubles over the atomic undertaking of Pakistan and strength to crop Pakistan to move back its atomic structure.

Implications of Changing Geo-Strategic Environment in the Region  Different investigators have that point of view that 21st century is for the Asians. The South Asian zone is has on a different zone or you can say on different perspective .The nations like India and china are making money linked mammoths. The events shifting in the kind have flow proposals on the world general and Pakistan especially as a significance of closeness with China and India. Events like Afghan occupation by the Russian and the 9/11 have made Pakistan important for the US interests.  “Pakistan is” The U.S game-plan in the locale is to create triangle of China, India and Pakistan. China is seen as the enemy in the range, India is seen as the key straightforwardness and Pakistan as an elaboration in the War on Terror. U.S slant towards India has key thing to contain China in the territory. Irrespective, China has become low profile, and game-plan of quiet organization in the area, and the world allowed moving around freely. “In 1990s U.S gave due thought on three basic examinations. One the atomic effects were enabled of both India and Pakistan. The Kargil in 1999 that in this manner military supernatural happening was happened in Pakistan in October 1999. The visit of American President to South Asia recognized remarkable change of course of action towards South Asia.”  After the Cold War; U.S has become two dimensional method towards South Asia strategy. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union does not have vital criticalness in the U.S. System towards South Asia; rather, Subcontinent is seen by America from a typical point of view and in this way, controls India and Pakistan substitute. Second, U.S. interests and risks to those interests are from inside rather than from outside the area. Cash related liberalization, non-expansion and larger part control government movement changed into the chief US course of action focuses in South Asia.  The motivating change in the Indo-U.S relations has left flow results on Pakistan amongst the 1990s. It was period of seclusion for Pakistan.

Around the end of 1990s, America’s tilt towards India shows up a point of view change in the relations of both the appealing bigger part lead councils of the connected with common governments after chilly war.  The rising vitality of America in India can be found in the running with activities. Firstly, America creates regulated correspondence with India including boundless, areas money related relations political procedure military sharing.

In any case, U.S has corresponding its relationship with India the “fundamental atomic arrangement” is remarkable affectability toward the entire field. As exhibited by the military overseers the game-plan will release new atomic race in the locale and will exaggerate the night out of force in the South Asian zone. As displayed by the new U.S National security strategy; “For setting up night out of force which upgrade opportunity, is impelled that all countries finish the vocation of dependable status. Those plasticity admiring nations must battle on anxiety. Those countries who need overall setting must attempt to help with the control of weapon of mass walloping.” Since America is hurting the measures of its own methodology in the south Asian region just to get its critical endpoints in the South Asian reach. It is seen that the post 9/11 has turn out badly the security scene of the South Asian district .The nations in the range expected that would join the U.S drove war on worry to get their clever reasons for interest. India indicated uncommon offer to strengthen in the war because of get its position in the South Asia. Pakistan has its own particular sort of interests by joining the war case: to secure its key resources and ensuring its Kashmir approach.  Globalization an Emerging Threat to Foreign Policy of Pakistan  Globalization is test rather than open gateway for under make nations like Pakistan. As showed by the academics of globalization just those nations which are financially solid and politically sensible can make due in this fundamental world. “Each country has its guideline as per its surroundings that sticks nation to set up and execute its remote approach to manage securing its national vitality for inconveniences and opportunities that a general achieve gives it.”  Incredible game-plan of augmentation in world economy is making of inclusive instruments and standards as the central reason of all economies. In fact, there are rules of financial procedure, cash related straightforwardness approval and bit structure, and retreats, communal, link and the whole draw up of different fields. It surmises a taking a look at of game-plans of individual nations by joining in the limitation of business division and strategy manager need to drive forward in like manner of predicting their methods to manage worldwide by superb straightforwardness.  Keeping in connection the above confirmations of globalization, Pakistan needs to change its political framework, to flourish its cash related performance, and to set out the key sections like extraordinary suggestion and keep up standard of law to stay instructed concerning the new test of globalization. In south Asian point of view, where India is a threat not in setting of arm race but rather moreover with respect to monetary rivalry in the range and the world allowed to move around willingly. India is a making budgetary giant with china in the South Asia. It similarly and steeply affects the approach matters of Pakistan; in light of the path that in the globalized world cash related rewards of nations are before trade premiums.  *Komal Tariq: Master in International Relations and Senior Teacher of Social Studies at Educators.  *Sannia Aziz M.Phil.

"political assassination","1966-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Ibadan"", ""Oyo"", ""Nigeria""}","2023-05-20T23:54:35","Turbulent anger of Obidients landed on Lamidi Apapa last week. By the time their anger petered out, Apapa had lost his cap to a God-knows-who. Esu Elegbara, the trickster deity of the Yoruba people, it will seem, lives in caps. Though most of the exploits of Esu exist in myths, Yoruba constructed a pantheon of beliefs that implicate the Esu as divisive and full of tricks. One of such, sauced in mythology, was translated into a very sobering track by ace Yoruba Awurebe musician, Alhaji Dauda Akanmu Adeeyo, popularly known as Dauda Epo Akara. Famous for his anecdotal offerings affixed to virtually all his songs, Adeeyo got this sobriquet, for which he was more known by than his actual name, while he was a pupil in primary school. His uniforms were always soaked in bean cake oil called Epo Akara.  The Ibadan maestro entitled the track under reference Itan Ore Meji – the tale of two friends – in a parent album he called My Mother. Like Epo Akara, in 1987, Donald Cosentino, a lecturer in the Folklore and Mythology Programme of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote an article for The Journal of American Folklore which he entitled Who Is That Fellow in the Many-Colored Cap? Transformations of Eshu in Old and New World Mythologies (Vol. 100, No. 397. Jul. – Sep., 1987). In it, he also situated the Esu as author of dissent, “an exponent of ceaseless rearrangements” and a dissembler. Esu, said Cosentino, is a counterpart to Ifa, who the Yoruba see as the Lord of Divination and through whom sacrifices and propitiations are made to God for peace in the world.  Epo Akara and Cosentino’s narratives are not dissimilar. The two of them began this folklore thus: There existed two friends who were so fond of each other and inseparable. They were objects of discussions by the whole village. In fact, sang Epo Akara, won ki ja, won kii ta – they never had a word of disagreement since they began their friendship from their infancy. So, one day, Esu swore to cause irreparable discord between them. The object he cast for that dissention was a cap. So the Esu sowed a multicolored cap, something in the mould of Dolly Parton’s coat of many colours. The colours, says Cosentino, have been “variously described as red and white; red, white and blue; or red, white, green, and black.”  Epo Akara, however, put the colours of the cap as white and black. So the Esu transformed himself into an irresistibly dressed, handsome young man in dainty Aso Oke and Sanyan cap. As the two friends sat in a foyer chattering, Esu walked between them and in the words of Cosentino, “put his pipe at the nape of his neck and hung his staff over his back.” As Esu walked past the two friends, in the rendering of the Awurebe musician, the first friend called the attention of his pal to the cap, which he said was black. Once he had money, the friend remarked, it would be his delight to buy it – bi mo ri’ru e, ma ra’kan, Balarabi, Wali Muhanmonda. The friend fired back, insisting that the cap was white and insulted the other friend by asking if he was blind – ab’oju re o ri’ran? Then, a very deadly brawl ensued between the duo as they came to blows.  While Epo Akara insisted that, having achieved his dissembling aim, Esu transformed himself into who he was and settled the quarrel, Consentino argued that the tiff came to a halt when the disputants were brought to court. In court, the scholar said, Esu confessed to his trick, boasting that “sowing dissension is my great delight.” In the rendering of the Folklore and Mythology scholar, Esu then fled. As he fled, Esu lit fire along the way, mixing up all the possessions of fleeing townsfolk. He also tested and exposed friendships along the way, thereby creating and destroying wealth. He then laughed at the ignorance of the people about his innate destructive nature.  Nigeria’s Labour Party, (LP) it will seem, is where Esu Elegbara has made his temporary home now. Last week, the party’s internal tiff reached a cancerous level at the Presidential Election Petition Court in Abuja. In the glare of the whole world, the timely intervention of police officers prevented miffed supporters of Peter Obi from skewering the flesh of the party’s Acting National Chairman, Apapa. Apapa and Julius Abure, hitherto suspended national chairman of the party, were embroiled in a leadership tussle. This led to blood-baiting hounds, suspected to be sympathetic to the Abure faction of the party, pouncing on Apapa. The wolves had prevented Apapa from addressing the press and shoved him dangerously off television cameras. In the process, one of them took off Apapa’s cap. He later took possession of it.  Speaking at a press conference after the attack, the 73-year old Apapa rained curses on the person who removed his cap. He had said: “My cap is here as you can see it. It was not burnt, and the boy who removed my cap will suffer it in his life. I saw him, he’s a young chap. He’ll never grow old by God’s grace. He deserves it, you know why? I didn’t use cutlass on him.”  Were Apapa’s curses of Janus colour and texture as that of Adedara Arunralojaoba, Ijesaland’s – domiciled in Osun State – most evocative musician who sang Adamo music during his lifetime? Janus, you know, is the Egyptian binary god with two faces. Some installments away, I narrated this Adamo musician’s encounter with another musician, Ayinla Omowura, in Ilesa in the 1970s. Omowura’s drums began to get torn in subsequence as he set out to sing at a live gig where he and Adedara had been invited. In the words of Arunralojaoba, on arriving the bandstand to take over the evening belt of entertainment of invited audience, Omowura had been drunk to stupor with his assumed musical superiority. Speaking to Dele Adeyanju, a renowned broadcaster, in an interview, the Adamo musician had attributed the torn drums to God fighting his battle for him and not any traditional African spiritual attack. Adedara was known to have at one time been a member of the Ogboni fraternity. So, were the torn drums God’s own way of fighting for Adedara against his adversary, or the scenario was a product of metaphysical invocation?  The removal of Apapa’s cap reminds me of the same violence and indignity suffered by Chief Bola Ige, ex-governor of old Oyo State, in the hands of sponsored miscreants like those hooligans in the LP. It was at the height of the intra-party sabre-rattling of the Alliance for Democracy (AD). At a ceremony held on Saturday December 15, 2001 where Olusegun Obasanjo’s late wife, Stella, was conferred with a chieftaincy title by the Ooni of Ife, wolves suspected to be in the herd of Iyiola Omisore, erstwhile Deputy Governor of Osun State, pounced on Ige in similar cavalier but blood-baiting manner Apapa was to witness almost 22 years after. They seized the cap of the man, known as Arole Awolowo – Chief Obafemi Awolowo’s heir – caps which, unlike Apapa’s, he was never to set eyes upon again.  Five days before this, an attempt to impeach Omisore was held at the Osun State House of Assembly. Odunayo Olagbaju, believed to be one of Omisore’s Rottweilers, was at the forefront of the disruption of the impeachment proceedings. Allegations were rife that Olagbaju was also the coordinator of the violent seizure of Ige’s cap. Four days after the attack on Ige, Olagbaju was mysteriously assassinated in Ile-Ife. Exactly four days after Olagbaju’s assassination, Ige was also taken out in what appeared like cult-like revenge killings. Today, Omisore is Southwest progressives’ highest-ranking national official, representing the Yorubaland which venerated Ige as an avatar.  Beyond their ethno-cultural implications as significant aspect of dressing and fashion, caps also have mythic qualities among the Yoruba especially. Aside caps’ aesthetic and symbolic elaboration of the body, they are also seen as weapon in the hands of Esu. The cap perhaps gained that relevance due to the renowned place that the head has in African epistemology. The head receives special aesthetic attention as a result of its spiritual and biological importance. Among the Yoruba, the head, called Ori, is a site of spiritual intuition and destiny. It is as well a harbinger of a man’s reflective spark of human consciousness. It is an Orisa, or god, of its own and is not only venerated but worshipped. To acquire a balanced character – iwa-pele – the Yoruba believe that the individual, working in tandem with this Orisa, can achieve this desirable personality. When he does, the individual then receives an alignment with his Ori, the divine self. People whose destinies are skewed are advised to worship their Ori whose variant among the Igbo is chi. So, when a cap, the decorative ornament of the head, is rudely removed as was done to Ige and Apapa, Yoruba see it as bad omen, symbolizing a rude yank-off of the human person.      Immediately after the seizure of Ige’s cap, some knowledgeable elders in sorcery and witchcraft opined that there existed causality between the cap’s removal and his eventual killing. For a people who use metaphysics as human agency to explain what the common eyes cannot penetrate, when Ige eventually died, the narrative of the connect between the removed cap and his death took front burner. So, in the seizure of Apapa’s cap, was Esu Elegbara on the usual roller-coaster of his famous trickster prowess, or does the act just symbolize a fatality to either Apapa, the Labour Party or the boy who bit the bullet by removing the cap?  The chief accusation against Apapa is that he is the Esu Elegbara in the Labour Party who this destructive god lent his heart for a fee. As Epo Akara and Cosentino narrated in their works, could Apapa be the modern or Nigeria’s political party version of the trickster deity, who is sowing dissention in the party? Ask those who are ranged against him to explain why, they will tell you that Apapa has received humongous bribe from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to act as the Judas within the party. On an Arise television interview last week, Apapa asked those who leveled such allegations to provide evidence. Again, in his insular trickery, I saw Esu Elegbara laughing rambunctiously. Do those who give bribes leave traces? Should those who also leveled such allegation against this old man sincerely do this without providing evidence? Are they themselves the Esu, being on the payroll of Abure, to ensure that Apapa is fought to a standstill?  Precedent is however on the side of those who accuse Apapa of acting the script of the APC. Nigerian politics is so enmeshed in indignity and amorality that virtually all those who engage in it possess scarred souls like the devil’s. They even tell you that politics and morality are in perpetual enmity. If you observe, the highest fusillade of attacks, both judicial and verbal, from the APC to any party, is towards the Labour Party. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its commissars receive scant attention of that party. It must believe that that party is already mortally wounded. APC, peopled by a commune of scavengers, vultures and deadly hit-men, will logically rent an Apapa for a dissembling assignment. It is because the If I must hanker a guess, it must be because the LP poses the greatest social threat to the legitimacy that APC needs, not necessarily during the current judicial process but after it. Thus, employing an Esu Elegbara within the fold of the LP for this dirty job is a politically wise decision for a party whose men, in the name of politics, will kill their mother and rope their father for the murder without batting an eyelid.  Esu Elegbara seems to be on the trail of the Labour Party and is not relenting yet. At the tail end of last week, until the clarification given by the court, the Federal High Court in Kano was reported to have declared the votes polled by the Abia State governor-elect, Alex Otti, Labour Party’s only state governor in the last general election, as wasted. It however reportedly refrained from nullifying the certificate of return issued by INEC to the governor-elect. A newspaper later on published the clarification of the court, stating that it denied annulling the election of the governor-elect.  If you think it is only in LP that Esu Elegbara wrecks its havocs, you are mistaken. In the PDP, he began his life-sworn disruption and destruction, as they say, as a pre-election cancer. By the time Atiku Abubakar and his party realized that Esu was in cahoots with the party, Elegbara had destroyed all the cells within the body of the party, finally and permanently retiring the Adamawa-born politician from his serial quest for the Nigerian presidency.  Elegbara, it will seem, is on his way to the APC as we speak. From reports, the party is on its way to a political liaison with Musa Rabiu Kwankwaso, New Nigerian People’s Party (NPP’s) presidential candidate. President-elect, Bola Tinubu, was reported to have met the NPP boss for political talks in Paris last Monday. There is the need for enough senators to complete the circus of a pliable National Assembly. I imagine the mind of Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Kano State governor, at the moment. The Nigerian politician, in pursuing his persuasion that politics and morality are not friends, devised what is labeled a “no permanent friends, no permanent foes” lexicographic feature of politics. But, must politicians be indistinguishable from serial adulterers? Esu Elegbara must be somewhere now, devising his next trickery. Will he wear Ganduje like an apparel?  Soji Adesida takes a rude bow  April 28 was a particularly bad day for the Adesida royal dynasty of Akure. That day, their son, Anthony Adesoji Adesida, a.k.a. Stag, was killed during a brawl in the state capital. A Prince and Pastor, he had sought armistice between two feuding personalities at the venue of a party. One of them, consumed by a deadly anger, had shoved him off violently. Stag hit his avuncular head on the naked, coarse floor. As his head made jangling crack on the irreverent concrete cement floor, little did aghast onlookers know that the amiable, personable and affectionate Adesida had just a few minutes left to keep a reunion appointment with his Creator. He was 65 years old.  Soji Adesida is dead. The news reverberated round the ancient city of his birth, Akure and Ibadan, where he nested as place of domicile and work for decades of his life. In those decades, he cultivated a commune of friends who, today, are still mourning his departure. He sowed imperishable seeds of affection in their lives.  Adesida’s Akureness was what I first encountered. He had been told of his Akure brother who was in a seeming adulterous liaison with the pen and was causing some uproar in the public sphere, he told me. So, when we met, Adesida was all over me. His dotting brotherhood reminded me of Baba Saliu. In a panegyric for this friend of his, my musical god, Ayinla Omowura, had lauded Saliu’s father who he said, whenever he saw him, it was a case of a human being intoxicating the other like the searing laceration that liquor gives the stomach – bi Baba Saliu ba ti ri wa, eniyan pa ni, o j’oti…  Each time Stag read my piece, he proudly and exhilaratingly announced that his Akure brother had penned “the wonder.” In a piece I did last year on Polaris Bank, he tackled a staff of the bank who had a dissenting opinion from mine. He eventually linked her up with me so that I could impugn her stand. Such was the texture Stag was made of. You could imagine how downcast I was to be told that such a wonderful brother had been killed.  This Friday, Akure will stand still for one of its own as Stag is lifted down the vault of a rude earth that would be unconscionable enough to demand to swallow the remains of such an affable man. We will however erect a cenotaph for this great Akure son in our hearts. On it, we will engrave this epitaph: Here lies a man who lived and died Akure.  Rest in peace, brother.

"political assassination","1954-10-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T18:40:12","In 1954, after years of successfully smearing innocent people, ruining lives and careers, Wisconsin Sen. Joseph McCarthy launched a new attack against an unlikely target — the U.S. Army.  Unlike his other victims, the Army had the power and influence to fight back.  McCarthy accused the Army of having weak security at one of its top-secret facilities. In response, the Army hired well-known lawyer Joseph Welch to defend the country’s oldest service branch against those allegations. During a public hearing, at which Welch testified, McCarthy accused one of Welch’s junior attorneys of having ties to the Communist Party, with no evidence to back up the charge.  Welch responded with words that have gone down in history as the ultimate putdown for bullies like McCarthy. “Until this moment, senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.”  McCarthy tried to fight back, but Welch stopped him. “Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You have done enough. Have you no decency?”  Have you no decency?  With those four immortal words, McCarthy’s popularity in the country disappeared overnight and he was censured by his fellow senators. Rebuffed by the media that helped create him, he died in disgrace just three years later.  His brand of character assassination has now become known as McCarthyism.  Now, in the beautiful North Idaho community of Coeur d’Alene, Welch’s indictment “have you no decency” applies to Brent Regan, chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee. After years of smearing political opponents, Regan hit a new low in the recent non-partisan library board election.  Incumbents Judy Meyer and Regina McCrea were running for re-election. I don’t know McCrea, but I have worked with Judy Meyer for a decade as chair of Idaho Business for Education’s Panhandle region.  Judy is an institution and community treasure in Coeur d’Alene. She has served on the North Idaho College board of trustees, served as president of the State Board of Education, still serves on the board of Idaho Public Television, has donated millions of dollars to make her community a better place to live and served on the library board for 30 years.  At the age of 81, when most people retire from public service, Judy ran for re-election to the library board because she is concerned about those who want to ban books. She wanted to prevent Regan and his book-banning minions from taking over the board just as they took over the North Idaho College board and drove it to the brink of oblivion.  Tuesday, Judy lost her race for re-election to the board after Regan’s Kootenai County GOP committee sent out a letter accusing Judy and McCrea of allowing “graphic books with text and pictures describing every imaginable sex act to be purchased and displayed to children.”  The letter went on to say, “These books are so explicit that if you were to give them to a child, you would be committing a crime.”  Regan’s group also paid for a video in which they accused the library board of failing to protect children from “harmful media and reading material.”  In the video, a young girl comes home from school and tells her mother, who is washing dishes, that at the library a woman read a book to the children. The girl tells her mother that the book had “moms and dads and there were kids” and they were “doing things like kissing each other and some of 'em didn’t have any clothes on.”  The video goes on to show the shocked mother turning to her daughter.  “Mommy,” the child asks. “What’s anal sex?”  At that, the shocked mother drops a plate, and it shatters on the floor.  The video ends by urging people to vote for the candidates running against Judy and McCrea.  Let’s be clear, Judy Meyer is no groomer. Judy Meyer would never allow children to be exposed to sexually explicit books. She is a mother and a grandmother and a pillar of decency and virtue. She has dedicated her life to serving her community. She and her husband of more than 57 years were just honored in the Spokane business newspaper as “icons” of the Coeur d’Alene community.  This time, Regan and his minions jumped the shark. To paraphrase Joseph Welch’s immortal words, his cruelty and recklessness hit a new low. He has demonstrated, in a most public way, that he, indeed, has no decency.  Coeur d’Alene is one of the most beautiful towns in the United States, nestled along the banks of Lake Coeur d’Alene. It is populated by many good people who love their community. It has known good times and bad times, like when it had to fight and defeat a group of neo-Nazis that plagued the area. Thousands of outsiders have flocked to the community because of its lakeside beauty and thriving economy.  But, in the last few years, a heavy darkness has descended over Coeur d’Alene, thanks largely to people like Brent Regan. They have infected the community with a poison that has spread like wildfire. Coeur d’Alene is now a place where truth, love, respect, civility and goodwill go to die.  Coeur d’Alene is at risk of losing its wonderful community college, the oldest in Idaho, because Brent Regan backed far-right candidates who took over the board of trustees. It has already lost many good public servants who, like Judy Meyer, were smeared. Now it is about to lose its community library to book censorship. One has the haunting feeling that the recent library election is proof positive that the community is close to losing its soul.  One wonders when a majority of people in the blessed lakeside community will collectively tell Brent Regan and his minions that enough is enough.  One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan and his ilk that their cruelty knows no bounds.  One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan himself, in no uncertain terms, that he has no decency and that his brand of character assassination has no place in their community.  The scary truth is, if they can character assassinate a community icon and an 81-year-old grandmother like Judy Meyer, nobody’s reputation is safe.  Regan and the KCRCC can tarnish anyone, no matter how innocent they are.  When the good citizens of Coeur d’Alene finally decide to send Brent Regan and his acolytes packing, then, and only then, can they start rebuilding the beautiful, welcoming and loving community that once was the jewel of North Idaho.  • • •  Rod Gramer is president and CEO of Idaho Business for Education.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vY2RhcHJlc3MuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjAvbXktdHVybi1ncmFtZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"political assassination","2023-05-23","Not Discerned","{""Pasig"", ""Manila"", ""Philippines""}","2023-05-21T05:28:00","House ethics panel to discuss possible further sanctions vs Teves on May 23  Negros Oriental 3rd District Cong. Arnolfo Teves Jr. holds a press conference with Atty. Ferdie Topacio in Pasig City on Thursday (January 12, 2023) to plead for his family's safety after receiving reports of an alleged police raid in his residence to seize evidence on his alleged connection to e-sabong.  MANILA, Philippines — The House of Representatives Committee on Ethics and Privileges will convene on May 23 to determine its recommendation, which may include further sanctions, on the continued absence of suspended Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. (Negros Oriental).  In the coming session, Rep. Raul Angelo Bongalon (Ako Bicol party-list)—committee chairperson—said Teves’ application for asylum in Timor Leste will weigh in the panel’s recommendation to the House plenary.  Related Stories House suspends Teves for 60 days for failure to return to PH  In an interview with DZBB on Sunday, Bongalon said the committee will convene on Tuesday, a day after the 60-day suspension earlier issued against Teves will expire.  He said they will discuss “the possibility to enforce whatever sanction or penalty to be recommended to the House plenary.”  READ: House may consider new disciplinary action for Teves after suspension  The lawmaker said that in the House rules, there are two remaining sanctions left: Expulsion and “any penalty the committee may determine.”  Teves left for the United States in March and has repeatedly refused to come home, citing his fear for his life. This is despite assurances even from President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos for his safety.  The Department of Justice has pointed to Teves as the mastermind behind the brazen assassination of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo last March 7. Complaints accusing him of murder have been filed before the DOJ just last week.  As the lawmaker from Negros Oriental continued to stay abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs said the government of Timor-Leste has rejected his application for political asylum—which, Bongalon said, in his view, can affect their committee’s discussion.  He stressed that seeking political asylum in a different country means “you are seeking refuge to a foreign country,” which may imply that Teves no longer believes in the Philippines ‘own government and justice system.  No participation  Bongalon stressed that the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges exercise general jurisdiction on all matters directly and principally relating to the duties conduct, rights, and privileges, immunities, dignity, integrity and reputation of the House.  Through this, the panel acquired jurisdiction to conduct a motu proprio investigation into Teves’ continued absence since this concerns the “dignity and reputation of the House” the lawmaker added.  “In the case of [Teves], the issue is expired travel clearance. His stay outside the Philippines is no longer authorized by the House of Representatives,” Bongalon explained.  Although the House has since adopted hybrid proceedings, Bongalon pointed that Teves’ trip to the US is a personal trip that require travel clearance.  “The function of a representative is to legislate laws. We cannot expect our representative to participate if he is not authorized or not actively participating in sessions and committee meetings,” he stressed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9oZWFkbGluZXMvMjAyMy8wNS8yMS8yMjY3OTQ2L2hvdXNlLWV0aGljcy1wYW5lbC1kaXNjdXNzLXBvc3NpYmxlLWZ1cnRoZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLXZzLXRldmVzLW1heS0yM9IBgAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vaGVhZGxpbmVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMjEvMjI2Nzk0Ni9ob3VzZS1ldGhpY3MtcGFuZWwtZGlzY3Vzcy1wb3NzaWJsZS1mdXJ0aGVyLXNhbmN0aW9ucy12cy10ZXZlcy1tYXktMjMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1948-08-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T01:03:40","He was the man who showed the saffron brigade its space under the sun.  One of the most widely circulated videos of former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on YouTube revolves around his speech in Parliament on intolerance and how a portrait of Jawaharlal Nehru was removed from the corridors of the Ministry of External Affairs. It was done by someone in the hope Vajpayee would be pleased. But that was not the case. Vajpayee—despite his animosity against India’s first PM—did not like the idea of the missing portrait. The following day the portrait was back in its place. Speaking about it in Parliament, Vajpayee said politics is all about tolerance and that is something Indian politics is missing. In some ways, a new biography titled “Vajpayee: The Ascent of the Hindu Right 1924-1977” by Abhishek Choudhary highlights some of the intricate characters of the person who had a mind of his own and even questioned the effectiveness of the much-publicised Quit India movement of Mahatma Gandhi (read Congress). I am told this tome is the first of a two-part volume published by Picador.  So how would you analyse this one, which the publishers are claiming as the most definitive biography of the former PM and BJP supremo, a man who showed the saffron brigade its space under the sun with his magnanimity and ideas? I remember having met him once briefly when the Indian cricket team was headed for Pakistan in 2004. Vajpayee posed with the cricketers and wrote on a bat that was meant to be gifted to Gen Pervez Musharraf. Vajpayee scribbled, Match Nahin, Dil Bhi Jitiye (Not just matches, win hearts also). I am told Gen Musharraf, who died in Dubai on 5 February 2023, had treasured the bat for many years.  Choudhary says Vajpayee was a man of strong beliefs and would not mind changing his political stance even if he had been opposed to it at some stage of his life. For example, his relationships with both Nehru and Gandhi went through the highs and lows. And at the end, Vajpayee told his confidants that he learnt solid lessons of nation-building from both because both had interests of the nation uppermost on their minds. The book, thus, makes it clear that Vajpayee started his political career by openly opposing some of Gandhi’s strategies. And that Vajpayee was also critical of Nehru on many occasions. Yet, he admired both of them. Let me pick up some lines from an essay Vajpayee wrote way back in 1947 and reproduced in the book: “Whereas the second world war was a time to strengthen ourselves militarily, the opportunity was wasted on individual satyagraha which ended, as always, with sitting purposelessly in the jail.”  “World War I fuelled the Pan-Islamist ambitions of Indian Muslims. Around this time, Gandhiji, along with the Ali brothers, frequently invited the Afghans to invade India. But fortunately the Gandhi-Muslim conspiracy got noticed, and thus 30 years ago that disgusting attempt to convert India into Pakistan was thwarted,” wrote Vajpayee about Gandhi.  But then, see the change in Vajpayee when he says the following in 2002 while inaugurating a street named after Gandhi. Vajpayee makes it clear that Gandhi’s teachings continued to be relevant in the 21st century. “Throughout his life, he (Gandhi) preached and practised mutual tolerance and understanding among people belonging to all the religions of the world. In this, he echoed the age-old conviction of India’s civilization that truth is one, the wise only interpret it differently,” he said. Some of Vajpayee’s letters and essays were reproduced by pro-right publications and also by Panchajanya, the mouthpiece of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In the Indian epic Mahabharata, Panchajanya is the conch shell used by Lord Krishna to herald the start of the battle between the Pandavas and Kauravas at Kurukshetra.  The book gets deep into the mind of Vajpayee and tries to highlight what he thought was right and what he thought was wrong. For example Gandhi’s fast-unto-death in January 1948 drew some severe criticism from Vajpayee, claims the author relying on his research from several right-wing publications and books. But eventually, claims the book, Vajpayee emerges as a solid politician and a mature parliamentarian who earned accolades from politicians cutting across party lines.  Vajpayee, however, managed to evade arrest when RSS was banned after Mahatma’s assassination in 1948. But he slowly emerged from the shadows and was seen as a democrat whose ethos was cemented in RSS ideology. It was an interesting dual personality of Vajpayee.  And then, look at the way Vajpayee described Nehru in the United Nations, saying in total admiration: “There was a flutter in the assembly and all delegates moving here and there rushed to their respective seats. Pandit Nehru was in his white Gandhi cap, Coca-Cola coloured sherwani, the invariable red rose, and churidar pyjamas.” The author makes it clear that Vajpayee was proud of Nehru, and proud of almost anything and everything Nehru did at the UN. “His confident manner of address, his clear and perfect accents, his well-formed turns of expression,” everything impressed Vajpayee.  The author writes brilliantly about Vajpayee’s visit to the UN and then, checking out museums and art galleries in New York, also the night clubs where he was accompanied by a young IFS officer, M.K. Rasgotra. It seemed modernism was seeping into the young politician who was opening up to the changes sweeping the world.  And then, almost in the same tone, the author says it was the same Vajpayee who felt Hindutva was the only genuine model of secularism and slowly, yet steadily, he adapted himself to the new world of the BJP. In short, he stamped the seal of Hindutva on India. It was a far, far cry of the person who was initially against the Ram Temple movement but the same man who encouraged Lal Krishna Advani to go on the rathyatra.  There were times when he was stubborn; he wanted the UP government to ban children of 16 years and below from watching films. It was almost like the Marxists banning English till Class IV in government schools in Bengal. Said an enraged Vajpayee: “Cinema is one of the reasons for the decline in the moral character of India’s youth; and since the government controls the cinema industry, it bears the responsibility entirely. For an annual income of merely 60-70 lakhs, no civilised nation would like to see its future citizens degraded.” Many felt Vajpayee did not like the Raj Kapoor starrer Barsaat, and even influenced some ministers to stop its screening six months after the movie’s release.  The author, whose brilliant research makes the book immensely readable, says Vajpayee was against any extreme form of religion. But at times he was weak and displayed his weakness when it came to members of his extended family and their business interests. There are many such examples in the media.  I cannot make out the reason for the book to hit the stands now, and then another one to hit the stands sometime later. There are multiple books on Vajpayee already in the market, right? Or is it that someone is trying to send some subtle messages to the current dispensation, making them aware that tolerance is the only way forward?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uL3ZhanBheWVlLXRoZS1tYW4td2hvLXdhcy1yZWFkeS10by1saXN0ZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1965-02-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T14:06:58","On the 98th anniversary of his birthday this month, the Militant is featuring a selection from Malcolm X, Black Liberation, and the Road to Workers Power by Jack Barnes, national secretary of the Socialist Workers Party. Barnes said that “Malcolm X was a revolutionary leader of the working class in the United States.” The excerpt is from “He spoke the truth to our generation of revolutionists.” Barnes’ speech was a tribute to Malcolm two weeks after his assassination in Harlem Feb. 21, 1965. Copyright © 2009 by Pathfinder Press. Reprinted by permission.  Malcolm was the leader of the struggle for Black liberation. He was, as stated at his funeral by Ossie Davis, our Black shining prince, the manhood of the Harlems of the world. To his people he first and foremost belongs.  But he was also the teacher, inspirer, and leader of a much smaller group, the revolutionary socialist youth in America. He was to us the face and the authentic voice of the forces of the coming American revolution. He spoke the truth to our generation of revolutionists.  What attracted revolutionary youth worldwide to Malcolm X? More important, what often made youth who listened to him — including youth who are not Black — start down the road to becoming revolutionists? … [H]e spoke the simple truth — unadorned, unvarnished, and uncompromising. …  Malcolm asked the Black American: Who taught you to hate yourself? Does he hate himself? Who taught you to be a pacifist? Was he a pacifist? Who said Black people cannot defend themselves? Does he defend himself? Who taught you not to go too far and too fast in your fight for freedom? Did he stand to lose something by the speed of your victory? Who taught you to vote for the fox in order to escape from the wolf? What does the fox give you in return? …  Though Malcolm X came from the American ghetto, spoke for the American ghetto, and directed his message to the American ghetto first of all, he became a figure of world importance, and developed his ideas in relation to the great events of world history in his time.  If Malcolm X is to be compared with any international figure, the most striking parallel is with Fidel Castro. Both of them belong to the generation that was shaped ideologically under the twin circumstances of World War II and the monstrous betrayals and defaults of Stalinized Communist parties. These men found their way independently to the revolutionary struggle, bypassing both Social Democracy and Stalinism.  Each started from the struggle of his own oppressed and exploited people for liberation. Each embraced the nationalism of his people as necessary to mobilize them to struggle for their freedom. Each stressed the importance of the solidarity of the oppressed all over the world in their struggle against a common oppressor.  Fidel did not start out as a thoroughgoing Marxist or as a revolutionary socialist. Like Malcolm, he was determined to pursue the national liberation of his people by “whatever means necessary” and without any compromises with those with any stake in the status quo.  Fidel Castro’s dedication to political independence and to economic development for Cuba led him to opposition to capitalism. So, also, Malcolm’s uncompromising stand against racism brought him to identify with the revolutions of the colonial people who were turning against capitalism, and finally to conclude that the elimination of capitalism in this country was necessary for freedom. Just as Fidel Castro discovered that there can be no political independence and economic development in a colonial country without breaking from capitalism, so Malcolm had come to the conclusion that capitalism and racism were so entangled in the United States that you had to uproot the system in order to eliminate racism.  Malcolm’s Black nationalism was aimed at preparing Black people to struggle for their freedom. “The greatest mistake of the movement,” he said in an interview in the February 25 Village Voice, “has been trying to organize a sleeping people around specific goals. You have to wake the people up first, then you’ll get action.”  “Wake them up to their exploitation?” the interviewer asked. “No, to their humanity, to their own worth, and to their heritage,” he answered.  Everything he said to Black people was designed to raise their confidence, to organize them independently of those who oppressed them, to teach them who was responsible for their condition and who their allies were. He explained that they were part of the great majority — the nonwhites and the oppressed of the world. He taught that freedom could be won only by fighting for it; it has never been given to anyone. He explained that it could be won only by making a real revolution that uproots and changes the entire society.  Thus it is not surprising that many who considered themselves socialists, radicals, and even Marxists could not recognize and identify with Malcolm’s revolutionary character. They could not recognize the revolutionary content of this great leader clothed in the forms, language, and dark colors of the American proletarian ghetto.  Even with all his uniqueness and greatness as an individual, he could not have reached this understanding unless the conditions in this country were such that it was possible. Even though no one can fill his shoes, the fact that he did what he did, developed as the revolutionary leader he was, is the proof of more Malcolms to come.  He was a proof as Fidel is a proof. Fidel stood up ninety miles away from the most powerful imperialism in the world and thumbed his nose and showed us, “See, it can be done. They can’t go on controlling the world forever.”  Malcolm went even further than Fidel, because Malcolm challenged American capitalism from right inside. He was the living proof for our generation of revolutionists that it can and will happen here.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWlsaXRhbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvbWFsY29sbS14LXRvbGQtdGhlLXVuY29tcHJvbWlzaW5nLXJldm9sdXRpb25hcnktdHJ1dGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Minsk"", ""Minsk"", ""Belarus""}","2023-05-21T01:51:05","The free world was alarmed in April this year when Putin made global headlines by announcing an agreement with Minsk to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory.  When a leading politician and former spy dies in mysterious circumstances, friends and colleagues are bound to be worried. So it was last November, when Vladimir Makei, Belarus’s foreign minister “passed away suddenly”, according to Belarusian media, amid claims that he was in secret contact with the West over the war in Ukraine and was preventing President Vladimir Putin from incorporating Belarus into Russia. Friends confirmed that the 64-year-old Makei had looked perfectly healthy in the days leading up to his “heart attack” and was not known to be suffering from any chronic illness. His death occurred days before he was due to attend an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe meeting in the city of Lodz to meet key Western politicians and officials—a session from which Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov was banned. Following the meeting in Poland, Makei was due to have a scheduled meeting with Lavrov, amid Russian suspicions over his back channel liaising with Western interlocutors.  Such was the concern in Minsk of the death of the second most important man in Belarus, that the country’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, ordered the replacement of his cooks, servants and guards, for fear of assassination. Lukashenko’s children were given extra security. As one close associate is alleged to have said, Lukashenko fears his supposed ally is arranging “a magnificent funeral” for him. Lukashenko knows full well Russia’s known ability to poison a man so that everyone thinks that he’s died of natural causes.  Fast forward to last week and the world’s media was entertained to the sight of President Lukashenko struggling to speak and unable to walk less than a quarter of a mile alongside President Putin in Moscow’s Red Square during the Victory Day walkabout on 9 May. Last Sunday, Lukashenko missed a major state celebration for the first time, sparking further speculation that the 68-year-old dictator is seriously unwell. Lukashenko normally speaks at the annual National Flag, Emblem and Anthem Day, but this year his prime minister, Roman Golovchenko, read the message on his behalf. There was no mention of the reason for Lukashenko’s absence, five days after he appeared unwell in Moscow.  On Monday, Belarus’ state news agency, Belta, reported that Lukashenko had inspected an air force installation and a photo was posted to the presidential website showing him standing stiffly in a military jacket, clearly in pain, taking a salute from an officer. The message was clearly designed to dispel rumours and reports that Lukashenko was seriously ill—although a bandage was strapped to his left hand. On 9 May, in Moscow’s Red Square, his right hand was bandaged.  Alexander Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, has led Belarus since 1994, stifling any dissent with brutal repressions in a country of 9.3 million people. Belarus’ Soviet-style economy has for decades heavily relied upon cheap Russian energy and loans, which Moscow has generously granted on multiple occasions. In August 2020, after Lukashenko “won” a sixth term in an election that was widely denounced as rigged, there were months of unprecedented protests in the country. The government responded with a violent crackdown, arresting more than 35,000 people, with thousands brutally beaten and raped while in custody. Scores of independent media organisations have been shut down, thousands of activists have fled the country, resulting in Lukashenko’s government being hit with crippling sanctions by the United States and the European Union. Fellow autocrat, Vladimir Putin supported Lukashenko in suppressing the demonstrations, and in return, the Belarusian leader threw his weight behind Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.  The free world was alarmed in April this year when Putin made global headlines by announcing an agreement with Minsk to station Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, a move widely viewed as a further escalation in Putin’s sabre-rattling tactics as he attempts to discourage the West from continuing to arm Ukraine. The nuclear expansion will also advance the Kremlin’s goal of consolidating informal control over the country. While Putin was at pains to stress that this decision was in response to a direct request from Lukashenko, few were convinced. Instead, news of the planned deployment simply served to underline Belarus’ status of a client state of Russia. Just as Vladimir Putin is determined to control Ukraine’s political destiny, if not its territory, so he is seeking to pursue Russia’s historic tradition of seeking security in empire, which at a minimum, includes Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  Even without nuclear weapons on its soil, Moscow has exerted considerable military influence over Minsk because of the presence of so many Russian troops on its territory. While Lukashenko has so far managed to avoid Belarus being sucked into Russia’s war in Ukraine, he allowed the country to be used as a staging point for the invasion fifteen months ago. He also provided Moscow with munitions long before agreeing to the staging of nuclear weapons on his territory. Earlier this year Lukashenko threatened that should Belarus be attacked, the country is “ready to wage war alongside the Russians”.  With this level of support, why would President Putin wish to take the dramatic step of formally annexing Belarus? In February this year a clue appeared. A leaked document from the Kremlin’s Directorate for Cross-Border Cooperation, revealed plans to merge Russia and Belarus into a single Moscow-controlled union state by 2030, in effect a total takeover of Belarus’s political, economic and military spheres. Observers believe that Lukashenko’s demise or retirement could hasten the timetable for this takeover of Belarus by some form of direct or hybrid operation by the Kremlin.  The potential advantage for Moscow would be not only an additional 48,000 troops provided by Belarus’ army, but also the prospect of up to 1.5 million military personnel outside of the armed forces, according to State Secretary of the Belarusian Security Council, Alexander Volfovich. This could also be supplemented by an additional 150,000 volunteers from a newly formed territorial defence force, ordered by Lukashenko last February. With the urgent need to provide more recruits for Russia’s ailing venture in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin might consider this a worthwhile gambit, given the Kremlin’s strategy of “recruiting” far from Moscow or St Petersburg. The last thing he wants to do is aggravate the elites of these important cities by enlisting their youth for almost certain death in Ukraine’s “meat-grinder”.  Although Putin might be tempted, he would be taking a considerable risk in pursuing this path. Two months ago, Chatham House carried out an extensive survey and discovered that only 3% of Belarusians supported joining the conflict on Russia’s side. There is already robust Belarusian partisan activity aimed at sabotaging the war effort and memory is strong of the 2020 revolt following the stolen election. In fact Lukashenko only narrowly survived the state-wide protests three years ago because of the considerable brute force provided by Russian security forces. Any attempt by Putin to take over Belarus following Lukashenko’s incapacity or demise would be met by similar fierce resistance and again require considerable Russian forces to overcome, forces which are now tied up in Ukraine.  Lukashenko, like Putin, has no obvious successor who could continue his notorious regime. Unlike Russia, however, Belarus has a strong opposition waiting in the wings for the moment to return and take back the country. Its leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was widely recognised the true winner of the 2020 elections. Lukashenko immediately locked up any remaining opposition and Tsikhanouskaya subsequently fled to neighbouring Lithuania, where she currently heads an active opposition council, recognised as Belarus’s official government-in-exile.  Lukashenko’s illness has therefore provided Putin with a dilemma. The Russian president would most likely be glad to be free of Lukashenko, given their strained relations over recent years, not least due to the latter’s habit of holding out on granting concessions sought by Russia. Should Putin decide not to act after Lukashenko’s demise, however, a successful takeover of Belarus by Tsikhanouskaya’s opposition group would be a serious blow to his ambition in reviving Russia’s greatness and influence over the near abroad. He couldn’t allow this to happen, and all bets are on Putin annexing Belarus when Lukashenko naturally, or unnaturally, departs this world.

"political assassination","1968-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Juneau"", ""Alaska"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T05:02:51","We must think globally to transform our country into a value-added, export-led economy that sells goods and services to the rest of the world.  I have a confession: When the sectoral debate dates were announced, and the Leader of the Opposition Business showed them to me, I shrugged and gave them back to him. I was not interested this time around. I had felt that we waste our time coming annually to speak and have no way of making any impact, mainly because the process is backward.  In other words, I believe these presentations should be done before the estimates of expenditures to inform where our priorities should be for the next financial year, while establishing a modern bipartisan vision for our country, taking the best suggestions from both sides and coming to a consensus on how the plans to achieving the vision should be funded.  So, yes, I was indifferent to presenting at another annual sectoral debate.  But, despite my reluctance and frustration, I also recognised that it is in moments like these that one has to dig deepest and muster every ounce of courage to get back up again, regardless of personal emotions and feelings.  Why? Because courage has a responsibility.  It may be perceived as unreasonable, and often it requires us to do what's right versus what's expedient, even if it means we should stand alone on our principles. But courage has an obligation to pave new roads, especially for the generations coming behind us — so that when we are gone they can say: ""They were ahead of their time.""  So, last week I boldly rose again in the Lower House of Parliament for yet another moment — perhaps my last moment — because Jamaica and improving the lives of all Jamaicans is more important than my indignation of resignation to say nothing, especially now.  The truth is the world's geopolitical tectonic plates are shifting daily, impacting human connections globally. Historically, they've been significant moments when they moved. However, those periods were precise, exacting, and loud. They would stop the world. For example, Hitler's invasion of Europe, the assassination of John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison, and the attack on the World Trade Center are a few in our lifetimes.  Most recently, it was the novel coronavirus pandemic that altered our existence as we knew it. But, unlike those previous events, which gave us pause for greater self-reflection to regroup and move forward toward better human connectivity, after COVID, things have gone right back to normal, with events moving simultaneously in real-time at an extreme pace.  Today, neither race, geography, class, capital, or global political leadership can stop events from spiralling because of social media.  From Black Lives Matter (BLM), the unending war in Europe between Russia and Ukraine, LGBTQ+ rights, global banks 'too big to fail' crashing, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), global inflation, and right beside us a civil war in Haiti.  There are so many displacing events that have audiences worldwide perplexed. Those who are not disturbed are apathetic and dissonant. I believe these consequences in human behaviour have created gaps in how we live with one another globally, and right here at home, similar to a matrix (alternate universe) that people gravitate to.  Jamaicans are frustrated from hustling daily, waiting on their elected leaders to deliver good water and road, and worrying about how far their salary will carry them for the month.  Many of us, as Members of Parliament, are frustrated, too, recognising how long it takes to deliver essential development to the people who elected us.  Jamaica has been pursuing the same path for a long time without real, meaningful results for our people. Yes, all the statistics indicate that our macroeconomic indicators are heading in the right direction. Our balance sheet seems to be on the right track. Yet significant economic growth still eludes us, and it is all too marginalised, which negatively impacts the purchasing power of most of our people for far too long.  If we continue more of the same it will give us more of the same. I've said repeatedly that we will never have real economic growth and prosperity for our people if we only sell to our 3 million population. We must think globally to transform our country into a value-added, export-led economy that sells goods and services to the rest of the world.  When we look at the changing skyline in Kingston we see massive capital expenditure on commercial and residential construction. But we don't see the economic base which will support the salaries needed to purchase these places and rent the buildings. Without real value-added industries this expenditure is not sustainable.  This capital needs redirection into new and innovative industries that will give Jamaica a global competitive edge. The economic model we have been chasing, expecting small businesses to grow into medium-sized businesses, and, in the long term, become big businesses, is not working!  We cannot compete in trade with small businesses on the world stage. In other words, we cannot ask nor expect small farmers to supply international markets unless we restructure our entire agricultural mindset and have processing plants urgently that meet international standards creating the demand for small farmers to supply.  Our habitual thinking has remained the same. We are holding on to old beliefs and systems that haven't allowed us to make quantum leaps forward as a country. We only have faith in the familiar; never looking for the paradoxical move, never breaking down probable boundaries, and never radically challenging all the odds to present a better version of ourselves.  Our responsibility as policymakers is to create the economic climate and mindset that will grow the Jamaican economy in a way that increases the per capita income for all our citizens. The time to act is now. It is time we take the risk and invest our capital in value-added agriculture, medical/wellness tourism, casinos, and Jamaica as the creative entertainment hub of the world are industries we should aggressively build out.  This is where effective leadership comes in. First, we must have the courage to quell anxiety, reveal the bigger picture, and explain why it is essential to pursue it, seeing uncertainty as an opportunity to shape the future fate of Jamaica.  I am grateful for my opportunities. Thirty years ago I graced the world's stage labelled Jamaican and won. I was born, schooled, and given all my life thus far to Jamaica.  I am Jamaican first — every time — blessed with a feisty courageous spirit, a fierce character imbued with acts of mobilisation with an assertive and unapologetic resolve, and defiant in the face of overpowering opposition that no one should ever bludgeon into acquiescence. My hope is to improve my life and the lives of others.  I am not unique; all of us have this within us. So even though the world is changing rapidly, this is critical moment for us to reset and reposition who we are and what we want.  We have a moment to start listening again, to start acting, to be unabashed about who we are and what we believe in. A moment which must rekindle our soul for global humanity and give our people connected hope for a better future to feel calm about their activism, yet emboldened to fight for causes greater than ourselves as we eschew the hypocrisy of political correctness while building industries to compete globally.  There is a fierce, urgent moment now, and we must seize it. We must have the courage to think big and compete globally. If we continue to turn a blind eye and not care about changing our habitual mindsets to make a quantum leap on behalf of Jamaica then the republic we all seek may look and feel like one belonging to a banana variety.

The HRW pointed towards the mass arrest of PTI supporters in connection with riots and said that more than 4,000 people have been detained and many have been charged “under vague and overbroad laws prohibiting rioting and creating threats to public order”.  Pakistani authorities should release all those held for peaceful protest or supporting political opposition and respect the due process rig­hts of all those detained, said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director.  “Anyone committing violence should be appropriately charged and their due process rights respected,” she said, adding, “Fundamental guarantees of peaceful protest and due process should not become casualties of Pakistan’s political conflict.”  The issue of crackdown on PTI supporters was also the highlight of Mr Khan’s speech, as he urged the powers-that-be to ‘save’ Pakistan as the country was heading towards the ‘point of no return’.  In his address through video link, the PTI chief said he was ready for a “minus-one formula” (him leaving the party) but asked the establishment to explain how it would benefit the country.  He then posed the election question to the establishment, asking how polls in October would help Pakistan. “Will the economy grow better or inflation will go down,” he asked.  Mr Khan claimed that the nation was heading towards a point of no return as the rule of law and Constitution had been suspended in the country and the “law of necessity” prevailed in Pakistan.  He said innocent people, protesting peacefully, were being thrown behind bars and asked under “what law this all is happening”.  The PTI chairman again demanded an inquiry into the May 9 riots to identify “real culprits” and played several video compilations, showing “how police disappeared and how people disembarked from army trucks and provoked the peaceful protesters to go violent”.  At the Corps Commander House in Lahore, Dr Yasmin Rashid and her sisters were crying hoarse that PTI protesters should not go inside, he said, adding PTI leaders in Peshawar were also asking for peaceful protests.  He said the government was not ready to talk about the death of 25 “innocent unarmed civilians” and peaceful protesters were being picked up on the basis of geo-fencing.  “Geo-fencing explains any person’s presence on the given location but not their involvement in any sabotage activity,” he asserted.  He said the government should identify the “saboteurs and share their whereabouts and, if found to be PTI workers, he would himself ask them to appear before the courts”.  The PTI chairman rejected the propaganda that he did not condemn the attack on the Corps Commander House as well as other state buildings. “When I was produced before the Chief Justice of Pakistan a couple of days later I condemned all kinds of violence as this was never my political philosophy during my 27-year political career,” he said.  Call to US lawmaker  Meanwhile, Mr Khan sought the intervention of a US lawmaker for “upholding of rule of law, constitution, and fundamental rights” in Pakistan.  In a Zoom conversation with US Congresswoman Maxine Moore Waters, he said it would “go a long way if someone like you Maxine gives a statement for the upholding of rule of law, constitution, and fundamental rights in Pakistan”. The purported clip of the meeting was leaked on social media. Mr Khan is heard saying the country is passing through “critical times and bizarre situations”.  “My government was removed by the former army chief as he conspired with the people in power right now,” he said and explained that “the army establishment, including secret agencies, is very powerful here”.  The PTI chief is heard saying he would appreciate it if Ms Waters would give a statement against the violation of fundamental rights and desecration of the rule of law and the constitution in the history of Pakistan. “Your statement will go a long way in helping us since it will make a lot of waves in the country,” he said.  Blaming the establishment and government, he can also be heard telling the congresswoman that his life was in danger and in one of the assassination attempts, his leg was injured. Mr Khan told Ms Waters that his party faced the “worst crackdown in the history of Pakistan as no other democratic country had faced such a violation of fundamental rights”.  ‘Anti-US narrative’  PML-N leaders and members of the cabinet took exception to Mr Khan’s conversation with the US lawmaker and said the so-called ‘anti-US’ narrative of Mr Khan was negated in light of this conversation.  PM’s special assistants Attaullah Tarar and Malik Ahmed Khan told a presser that earlier Mr Khan was saying his government was toppled by the US and now he was asking its lawmaker to help him. The PML-N leader said the requests to the US showed that the “cipher story was concocted”.  Mr Tarar said Imran Khan was saying that the country was facing the worst human rights situation at present. “What does he want? Does he want all those involved in the attacks on military installations should not face trial? If we let them go then the enemy will attack tomorrow,” he claimed.  Malik Ahmad said as the law was taking its course against those involved in riots, Mr Khan was “seeking help from abroad”. “The democratic people of PTI are not being arrested,” he said.

This comes at a time when the government is taking tough stands against his supporters and party workers who stormed the houses of senior Army officers in Pakistan.  The purported audio revealed that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief was asking the US lawmaker to raise her voice against ""human rights violations” in Pakistan, the report said.  In the audio clip, Imran Khan can be heard informing Maxine Moore Waters on the situation in Pakistan and urging her to issue a statement in his support.  “I received three bullets in one assassination attempt. My government was removed by ex-army chief [General Qamar Javed Bajwa] because the military establishment is very powerful here. He conspired with people who are in power currently and toppled my government,"" Khan was heard telling Maxime in the purported audio clip.  “We just want a statement highlighting the [crackdown] and that would really help us. If someone like you Maxine speaks up it makes a lot of waves,” he added.  Khan was arrested by the paramilitary Pakistan Rangers at the Islamabad High Court premises on May 9, which triggered unrest across the country. For the first time in Pakistan's history, protesters stormed the army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi and also torched a corps commander's house in Lahore.  Law enforcement agencies have arrested over 7,000 PTI workers across Pakistan, 4,000 of them from Punjab. Khan, the cricketer-turned-politician, was ousted from power in April last year after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership, which he alleged was part of a US-led conspiracy targeting him because of his independent foreign policy decisions on Russia, China and Afghanistan.

"political assassination","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Rawalpindi"", ""Punjab"", ""Pakistan""}","2023-05-21T02:05:04","WASHINGTON: Only 16 per cent of Pakistanis believe that their local economy is getting better, which is the lowest in the region except for Afghanistan, says a Gallup survey report released this week.  The survey by Gallup World Poll shows how the unrest in the country is rooted in its economic woes, as the national economy gets from bad to worse.  Underlining the causes of this nationwide despondency, the survey notes that perceptions of corruption in Pakistan have hit record highs, living standards have plummeted and millions are struggling to meet their basic needs. Sindh is hit the hardest by this economic slump.  “Except for Afghanistan, where the economy has crumbled since the Taliban’s takeover, Pakistan ranks lower than all other countries in the Asia-Pacific region in perceptions of improving economic conditions,” the report’s authors Hashim Pasha and Benedict Vigers point out. “It’s (also) one of the lowest points on record.”  Economic downturn is being felt hardest in Sindh  A record 86pc Pakistanis perceive corruption to be widespread in the country’s government and 80pc believe that corruption in businesses has also reached record highs.  Highlighting the link between the recent political turmoil and a long-running economic crisis, the authors point out that in recent years, Pakistan’s economy has seen record inflation, soaring commodity prices, and significant declines in foreign investment and remittances.  Catastrophic floods in the latter half of 2022, partly overlapping the timing of Gallup’s fieldwork in Pakistan, also caused an estimated $15 billion in economic losses. “Imran Khan’s arrest — and the subsequent civil unrest it sparked — have added to the economic misery, as the rupee’s valuation against the dollar dropped to a historic low,” the report argues.  “Recent mass protests coupled with an ongoing constitutional crisis have compounded the already chronic sense of instability in the South Asian nation and have made its efforts to avoid a sovereign default more precarious.”  Referring to previous surveys, the authors argue that at the start of Imran Khan’s term in 2018, Pakistanis were far more likely to think their living standards were getting better (49pc) than getting worse (20pc).  Pakistanis’ outlook has worsened every year since; fast forward to the most recent measure, and the tables have flipped. In 2022, 19pc Pakistanis said their living standards were improving, and 48pc said they were getting worse. Over the same period, Pakistan has seen one of the largest drops worldwide (30 percentage points) in the percentage of adults saying their living standards are improving.  The report notes that the spiralling economy has left millions struggling to meet their basic needs. More than four in 10 (44pc) of those surveyed said they found it difficult to afford food at times in the past year.  The survey also shows that Pakistani women (51pc) are more likely to be affected by the economic slump than men (36pc). The proportion of Pakistanis who struggled to afford shelter also shot up in 2022 to 32pc, one of its highest points on record.  According to the survey, the economic downturn is being felt hardest in Sindh, where a mix of high vulnerability to climate change and decades-long rule by the feudal lords has contributed to its lagging behind Pakistan’s other provinces. In a comment on the current political crisis, the report notes that “the country is on the brink of default, and its future is deeply uncertain.”  “Imran Khan’s arrest has created the most widespread public anger since the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007 and has widened the gulf between civil society and state institutions.”  The report argues that the quality of life in Pakistan is unlikely to improve “as long as a sustainable political solution remains elusive.” And unless it happens, people of Pakistan will continue to believe that they live in a corrupt system,“ the report warns.

"political assassination","2015-10-15","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T10:00:00","Logic would suggest that her luck would have to run out at some point, but Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has surprised us time and time again, retaining her central position in Argentina’s political ecosystem. She’s the brightest star in a galaxy that is quickly fading, as society becomes increasingly annoyed by the political goings-on, which makes her endurance all the more commendable from an objective point of view. Argentina, of course, isn’t a quasi-democracy where autocrats can barricade themselves in the presidential palace, relying on intelligence agencies and security forces to keep adversaries at bay. The general rules of play agreed upon in 1983, with the return of democracy, have pretty much been respected, and both Peronists and anti-Peronists have essentially stayed within their bounds. It is in that context that Fernández de Kirchner is looking to once again pick out a surprise strategy from her political playbook, only that this time it is probably at her moment of greatest weakness. Her internal struggle is difficult to imagine as she battles to keep the pan-Peronist Frente de Todos front from a humiliating third place in this year’s presidential election, failing to make the run-off and consolidating a cycle of political decline originating probably around her second presidency. With Juntos por el Cambio chastising themselves itself as Horacio Rodríguez Larreta and Patricia Bullrich duke it out in public, it appears that Javier Milei is the only one left with nothing to lose.  A naïve reader of Cristina’s latest letter, one of her preferred methods to communicate her musings to followers and fans, could believe that she is writing in exile, forced to leave or pay with her life like many in Argentina’s violent past. Attempting to draw a parallel between the “proscription” of Peronism in the mid-20th century during a time when political violence meant guerrilla warfare in the streets of the nation’s cities, state-sponsored terrorism against the population and a vast array of human rights violations, the vice-president confirms she’s renounced any potential candidacy this year, given it will be blocked by the bloodthirsty “Judicial Party.” It’s not just judicial persecution, but an all-out cultural war against Peronism and Kirchnerism also waged by the ferocious mainstream media, culminating in an attempted assassination she has somehow linked to her political opponents. The other narrative thread carrying Fernández de Kirchner’s political pitch is the immoral nature of the International Monetary Fund’s bail-out of the Mauricio Macri administration, which is part of an international plot to put Argentina on its knees so that foreign financial interests can plunder our riches.  She’s quite convincing. In some sort of way she is in exile, forced to live a life of limited exposure to everyday pleasures, like eating at a restaurant or going to the cinema, given the level of rejection she generates in a large portion of society. In those regards both husband Néstor and arch-nemesis Mauricio have been more successful than CFK – both were able to walk the streets relatively freely, something Macri still does. As mentioned previously in this column, Cristina’s political renunciation was nothing more than the acknowledgement that winning a presidential election was statistically impossible and would cause more harm than good for her political cause. The same could be said of Macri, but CFK has folded it into the Kirchnerite political narrative requiring an epic battle against an all-powerful army which has rigged the odds against her.  This latest renunciation, which is at least the third time she’s confirmed it, comes as “the Movement” begs her to run. And here is where one must tactically observe what the vice-president is doing, because a run for the Senate in the Province of Buenos Aires would almost guarantee her a seat while giving a boost to Governor Axel Kicillof, the “prodigal child,” in his contested bid for re-election. There appears to be no obvious reasons as to why the Judiciary would block her candidacy on similar grounds as they’ve done in San Juan and Tucumán, while the many corruption cases against her — at least one with an initial conviction — are far from final sentences which would truly rule her out. Retaining the governorship of Buenos Aires Province while trying to come in second in the national election must be what is guiding CFK’s decision-making process.  According to esteemed sociologist and political analyst Eduardo Fidanza there is a substantial probability that the Frente de Todos won’t make it to the run-off this year, a turn of events which would be unprecedented. Speaking at a livestream for Perfil’s digital subscribers this week, the founder of political consultancy firm Poliarquía noted that the rise of ultraliberal economist Milei could relegate the Peronists if the lead in polls materialises into votes, something impossible to concretely predict at this juncture given the nascent nature of the phenomenon. The firebrand economist counts on the benefit of speaking to an irritated and disillusioned society tired of the “caste,” as Javier Milei has dubbed the political class. It doesn’t really matter at this point that his political platform includes the privatisation of health and education, unfettered organ-buying and the legal carrying of firearms, or even that his running-mate is a dictatorship denialist. Or that, as many suggest, he’s being financed by all sorts of different actors, from Peronist leaders to leading businessmen, all looking to capitalise on the effects of his shining star.  Coming to Milei’s aid unwittingly is Juntos por el Cambio. The opposition coalition is fragmented as hawks (Bullrich) and doves (Rodríguez Larreta) engage in a damaging primary that, according to Fidanza, has shaved several percentage points off their voting intentions, which are expected to go mainly to Milei. While CFK is doing everything in her power to try and remain competitive, Juntos’ supporters should be worried that they appear to be doing everything to sabotage their own chances, even if the projections suggest they will take the electoral bout. In their favour is the coalition structure which allows JxC to pick up votes outside the Bullrich-Larreta tandem, in part due to the affiliation of the Unión Civic Radical and its offshoots. At the same time, their strategic allegiance with José Luis Espert, a former ally of Milei, could help them retain some hardliner votes, even if it also affects Bullrich.  Argentina’s political class is lost in a difficult maze. At one end is Milei, who seems to have jumped out of the maze to play under his own rules, which are the rules of right-wing populism that are so effective. Frente de Todos is trying to figure out how to minimise the damage of an almost guaranteed defeat, while Juntos por el Cambio is acting as if they’d already won the election. All of this promises to further dampen the social mood.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYmF0aW1lcy5jb20uYXIvbmV3cy9vcGluaW9uLWFuZC1hbmFseXNpcy9wb2xpdGljcy1pbi1hLWxhYnlyaW50aC5waHRtbNIBUmh0dHBzOi8vYmF0aW1lcy5jb20uYXIvbmV3cy9hbXAvb3Bpbmlvbi1hbmQtYW5hbHlzaXMvcG9saXRpY3MtaW4tYS1sYWJ5cmludGgucGh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Jan Stocklassa is a former diplomat for the Swedish foreign ministry who has spent the last 10 years investigating Palme's murder.  He was doing research for a book when he came across a trove of materials compiled by Larsson, the author of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, who had quietly spent years trying to find the killer before he died in 2004.  ""The murder of Olof Palme has been on and off in people's minds for 37 years,"" Mr Stocklassa tells Sky News.  ""It's always there, and it's sort of a wound that starts to heal and then gets torn up again.""  Delicate timing  The assassination came at a time when, as leader of Sweden, Palme was walking a dangerous tightrope between the two superpowers: the US and the Soviet Union.  Advertisement  The USSR was eyeing expansion - something America and the West were desperate to keep Sweden away from due to its geographical and strategic importance.  Controversially, Palme sought to keep Sweden as a neutral, non-aligned country and, crucially, one that was not in NATO.  So it was at a delicate time for Sweden that Palme was assassinated, possibly changing the course of his country's history.  Image: Olof Palme was killed as he and his wife walked home from the cinema  ""The political situation changed a lot and I don't think we realised it then"", Mr Stocklassa said. ""Sweden was trying to create this third possibility between the Soviet Union and the US and help all small nations to be able to run their own destiny.  ""And that one bullet in the back of Olof Palme has changed that immediately.""  Now, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sweden has abandoned its decade's long position of neutrality and is set on joining NATO.

What was that like?  ""Scary,"" he says. ""I went to Cyprus to meet this Swedish spy living in northern Cyprus because he wanted to avoid extradition.""  Mr Stocklassa says he used a fake name to meet the spy and didn't know who to trust, even the police.  But he said entering the world of spooks was a ""rush"" that you can get ""drawn into or addicted to"".  Image: Jan Stocklassa has been investigating the assassination for more than a decade  After a decade of research, Mr Stocklassa says the assassination still remains unsolved - but he says he has built on Larsson's work and has a theory.  ""I'm not saying who I believe was actually pulling the trigger, I have a theory on that,"" he says.  ""But more importantly, you can see the actual forces behind it, with the South Africans using a Swedish middleman and using Swedish right-wingers as helpers and possible scapegoats or patsies.  ""That's the theory that Stieg (Larsson) believed in, and I strongly believe in. I'm even convinced about it.""

Episode one is available to watch on catch up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2t5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcGllcy1pbnRyaWd1ZS1hbmQtYW4tdW5zb2x2ZWQtbXVyZGVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpbmctdGhlLWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb24tb2YtYS1zd2VkaXNoLXByaW1lLW1pbmlzdGVyLTEyODgzMzYz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"political assassination","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Srinagar"", ""JammuAndKashmir"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T02:00:49","On May 21, 1990, three young men came to meet Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq at his home in Srinagar. It was nothing out of the ordinary: the Mirwaiz, Kashmir’s head priest and one of its most influential political leaders, received visitors as a matter of everyday routine. Except, this morning’s young visitors were assassins. They fatally shot the Mirwaiz and got away.  The assassination shocked Kashmir and, although support for the separatist struggle was at its peak, it could have led to a public backlash against the armed separatists, who were suspected to be the assailants. That did not happen. Instead, public anger was directed at the government. The reason: as thousands of agitated people carried the Mirwaiz’s body in a procession from the hospital to his home, they were fired at by the Central Reserve Police Force near Hawal in Old City, killing at least 60 and wounding scores. The government, led by Governor Jagmohan, claimed that the CRPF had come under fire from within the procession and retaliated.  The government justification for firing further muddied the waters. In his book My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir, Jagmohan would assign the blame to his police chief N S Saxena, arguing that if he had gone himself or sent a strong police contingent with the procession, the killings of the mourners would have been averted. “His conduct, to say the least, was highly irresponsible, particularly in the context of my instructions,” Jagmohan claimed. “An officer of his seniority was expected to provide leadership and show initiative on such occasions”.  The Mirwaiz’s was Kashmir’s first major political assassination. The murder and its aftermath eventually led to Jagmohan’s ouster as Governor.  The assassination was investigated by the CBI, which said that it was planned by Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan and executed by their operatives Ayub Dar, Javid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat. Bangroo and Shigan were killed in gunfights with the security forces not long after. Dar was caught and sentenced to life in prison. Last week, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Bhat were arrested, after 33 years on the run.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jb2x1bW5zL3RoZS1taXJ3YWl6cy1raWxsaW5nLWFuZC13aHktaXQtd2FzLWEtd2F0ZXJzaGVkLW1vbWVudC1mb3ItamstODYyMDMxNS_SAXVodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvY29sdW1ucy90aGUtbWlyd2FpenMta2lsbGluZy1hbmQtd2h5LWl0LXdhcy1hLXdhdGVyc2hlZC1tb21lbnQtZm9yLWprLTg2MjAzMTUvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mr Putin had a huge underground bunker built beneath Gelendzhik Palace, according to plans posted online by the engineering firm in charge of the project, with a network of tunnels lying around 50 metres under the surface.  The complex, first reported by Business Insider, is thought to have been constructed for protection in the event of a revolution or war and was built before Russia took over Crimea in 2014.  The £1bn palace is located on a verge overlooking the sea and takes up a 190,000 square-foot area. It even has its own church, ice rink, casino and hookah lounge.  (Alexei Navalny)  The labyrinth of hidden tunnels was revealed by jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, after the defunct Russian construction firm Metro Style posted the diagrams on its website in the early 2010s to show off their work.  The bunkers appear to have a ventilation system, sewerage and a fresh water supply, while the walls are 15-inch concrete shells, as shown in the diagrams.  There is also an elevator shaft that connects the complex to the two tunnels, as revealed in one diagram - and the lower one has a walkway to the beach, as well as cable racks that could be used to bring electricity, lighting and fibre-optic cables to a command post.  Meanwhile, exits from both tunnels can be seen on the cliff face rising up from the sea to the palace.  Exits from both tunnels can be seen on the cliff face (Alexei Navalny/YouTube)  “This tunnel set-up has all kinds of safety and security,” said Thaddeus Gabryszewski, who is a structural engineer familiar with defensive structures and reviewed the diagrams for Business Insider. “There’s a fire system. There’s water, there’s a sewer. This is intended for someone to survive or escape.”  The engineering company described the project as an “underground complex for a resort” in Gelendzhik, the town closest to the Russian president’s palace, and it stretches across 6,500 square feet.  Speaking to Business Insider, Michael C Kimmage, who is a former State Department official and worked on Russia and Ukraine policy, said: ""Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia.  “So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by-elections, he is going to seek to maximise his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  There is also an elevator shaft that connects the complex to the two tunnels, as revealed in one diagram - and the lower one has a walkway to the beach (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  The diagrams were taken down from Metro Style’s website in 2016, but they were still visible on the Wayback Machine, which is an archive of online content.  Then they were circulated in a community of so-called ”diggers”, which are a group of Russian citizens who visit and document forbidden sites.  An anonymous digger who said he was part of a group called “Sect Z” told Business Insider that he was sharing the images “because we are tired of Putin’s stupid face and want to show his paranoid underground transport”.  The bunkers have a ventilation system, sewerage and a fresh water supply, while the walls are 15-inch concrete shells, as shown in the diagrams (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  The diagrams were taken down from Metro Style’s website in 2016, but they were still visible on the Wayback Machine, which is an archive of online content (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  Last month, a protection officer for Mr Putin defected and called the Russian president a “paranoid war criminal”.  Gleb Karakulov, 35, who served as an engineer in the Federal Guard Service (FSO) presidential communications unit, claimed last month that Mr Putin opts to stay “in his bunker” rather than make trips because he is so paranoid about an assassination attempt.  The Russian president also allegedly travels with a 2.5 metre high box to prevent his secret talks from leaking and Western bugging.  Mr Karakulov claimed that the Russian president is isolating for a fourth year in a row, out of fear of becoming infected with Covid-19, and staff can only work in the same room as him once they have been in isolation for two weeks.  Mr Putin does not use a mobile phone or the internet, meaning his knowledge of events is filtered via the secret services - and what he watches on state-controlled Russian TV, according to Mr Karakulov.  The diagrams were circulated in a community of so-called ‘diggers’ , which are a group of Russian citizens who visit and document forbidden sites (Wayback Machine / Metro Style)  Speaking about the war in Ukraine, Mr Karakulov issued an appeal to officers to come forward with evidence about Mr Putin as a “war criminal,” saying the war is “beyond the pale” and “defies reason”.  When the organisation of opposition leader Mr Navalny initially published an expose of the Russian president’s Black Sea palace in 2021, thousands of Russians protested, holding up gold-painted toilet brushes in reference to a £700 utensil allegedly found in the residence.  Opposition leader Alexei Navalny published an expose of the Russian president’s Black Sea palace in 2021 (Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)  Mr Putin has denied owning the palace. Meanwhile, his billionaire childhood friend claimed that the property belonged to him not the president, who he said had nothing to do with it.  But the palace, which is surrounded by 17,000 acres of woods, is constantly protected by Mr Putin’s security team and protected by a no-fly zone – and the Kremlin failed to explain why this was the case if the president does not live there.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL3B1dGluLWJ1bmtlci1zZWNyZXQtdHVubmVscy1ydXNzaWEtYjIzNDE5NTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Essentially, appointments into offices should be done in a way that gives every part of the county a sense of belonging, which is an antidote to agitations. The Anglican Diocese On The Coast, Ondo State gave the advice at the First Session of its 10th Synod held at the Cathedral Church of Ebenezer, Ilutitun in Okitipupa Local Government Area last weekend. The Diocesan, the Rt. Rev’d Oluseyi Pirisola, in his charge, thanked God for keeping the nation united and peaceful in the face of happenings that could have torn its fabrics into pieces. He urged relevant authorities to address the rapidly falling value of the naira that has made the prices of goods and services to go beyond the reach of most Nigerians. The Synod lamented the resurgence of cruel killing of innocent citizens after the general elections, urging security agencies to work harder to tackle the menace. The Anglicans called for revival of the nation’s refineries for optimal production, revival of agriculture and agro-allied companies as well as provision enabling environment for businesses to thrive so as to create employment opportunities for the people. They commended President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for removal of railway and electricity generation, distribution and transmission from the Exclusive Legislative list thus allowing the state government to build and operate these amenities. The state governments were advised to quickly take advantage of the change of this policy to develop their own areas. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was admonished to study the complaints against the conduct of the 2023 general elections with a view to improving upon it in future elections for transparency and peace in the nation’s democratic process, just as the Federal Government was tasked to do everything within its power to avert constant strike in the universities. The Synod themed ‘The God who Hears, Cares and Intervenes’ was attended by eminent citizens, including Obagberume of Igbodigo, Oba Ebunoluwa Aiyeku; Halu of Ode Aye Kindgom, Oba Williams Akinlade; Majuwa of Morubodo Kingdom, Oba Ernest Idepefo; Gen. Olu Bajowa (rtd) represented by Chief Olu Akinbo; Prof Monone Omosule and Dr. (Mrs) Omosule of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife; Senator Boluwaji Kunlere (Chancellor) and Price Fioye Bajowa, former secretary to Ondo State government. Others are Bishop of the Diocese of Ile Oluji, the Rt. Rev’d Abel Ajibodu; Bishop of Idoani Diocese, Rt. Rev’d Oludare Agara; Vice Chairman, Okitipupa Local Government, Chief Ola Iwaeni; Mr Duro Olatunji, former Chairman of Briscoe Motors and former Chancellor, Barrister Timothy Akinyeye. To alleviate the negative impacts of unemployment in the socio-economic life of the citizens, especially the youth, the government was advised to give priority attention to the problem, just as it urged job seekers to acquire 21st-century skills that can easily fetch them gainful employment. Diocese On The Coast lamented high level of corruption and suggested that the menace be tackled through reformation of public administration and public finance management and strengthening the role of auditing agencies; creation of pathways that would give citizens relevant tools and social empowerment skills and opportunities to engage and participate in governance; provision of incentives for the general population to boldly report cases of corruption; intentional and adequate funding and strengthening of the bodies that prosecute corruption cases, EFCC and ICPC; and promotion of transparency and access to information. The church urged the Federal Government to end the epileptic power supply in the country which has forced many companies to relocate to neighbouring countries. Ondo State government was commended for laudable projects executed across the state, noting the establishment of the Amotekun Corps for safety of life and property and the Okitipupa-Igodan Bye Pass for improved transportation system within Ondo South axis. The delegates also praised the government for payment of salaries and pensions up to date, urging that the same attention be given to gratuities. The church, however, decried payment of salary in instalments by the government. As the state prepares to elect a new governor in 2024, the Synod appealed that the campaigns should be issue-based, devoid of calumny and character assassination and the election proper should be violent-free. The delegates decried continued darkness in Ondo South comprising Okitipupa, Irele, Ilaje and Ese-Odo Local Government areas due to disconnection from the national grid since 2014 and called for the intervention of the state government and other stakeholders to save the economy and socio-economic life of the affected places. The state government was advised to put pressure on the Federal Government to fix failed roads, including the Orita-Ilado to Gbagada Bridge, to reduce the economic wastage that farmers suffer on account of the bad condition of the roads.

The spokesperson dismissed any official or unofficial connection between Iran and the arrestees, stressing that the popular relationships between the citizens of the two countries are “heartfelt, emotional, historical, religious and even family-based.”  “The government of Azerbaijan should not attribute such deep-rooted and historical bonds of its nationals to security issues or associate them with neighbors.”  Kanaani noted that every government has the inherent right to take action against the law-breaking citizens, but made it clear that Baku’s move to arrest and imprison many citizens by making the allegation of connection with Iran is inadmissible and unacceptable.  Azerbaijan’s interior ministry, security service and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement on Tuesday that at least nine Azeri nationals have been arrested, suspected of being “linked to Iranian secret services and of plotting a coup and assassinations”.

WE’RE TOLD SEVERAL CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS HA  Advertisement Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office details previously unknown complications from shingles illness Share Copy Link Copy  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's office said Thursday that she is suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a complication from the shingles virus that can paralyze part of the face, and that she contracted encephalitis while recovering from the virus earlier this year.Feinstein, 89, had not previously disclosed those medical details, though she said in a statement last week that she had suffered complications from the virus. The longtime California senator returned from a more than two-month absence on May 10 after weeks of questions about her declining health and whether she would be back in the Senate at all.Adam Russell, a spokesman for Feinstein, said that the encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, ""resolved itself shortly after she was released from the hospital in March."" Feinstein continues to have complications from the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Russell said.Russell confirmed the two complications after the New York Times first reported them, raising questions about whether she had been hiding the extent of her illnesses. Upon her return last week, Feinstein was using a wheelchair and noticeably thinner, and has appeared confused at times when speaking to reporters or being wheeled through the halls.""The senator previously disclosed that she had several complications related to her shingles diagnosis,"" Russell said in the statement. ""As discussed in the New York Times article, those complications included Ramsay Hunt syndrome and encephalitis.""Feinstein's face has appeared partially paralyzed since she returned to the Senate, stirring some speculation about whether she had had a stroke. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a complication that occurs when the shingles virus reaches a facial nerve near the ears. It can also cause hearing loss.Encephalitis can also be caused by shingles. The swelling of the brain can have a number of different symptoms, including personality changes, seizures, stiffness, confusion and problems with sight or hearing, according to the Mayo Clinic.Aides to Feinstein said last week that she is still recovering from her illness and would operate on a reduced schedule. Since she has returned, she has missed some votes where she was not needed. On Wednesday, for example, she missed the first three Senate votes of the day but appeared for the last two, in which the margin was much closer.Feinstein has faced questions for several years about her clearly declining health and her mental acuity. In February Feinstein said she would not run for re-election in 2024.But some Democrats have pushed for her to leave sooner. A member of the California congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, called on her to resign as she stayed away from Washington for more than ten weeks, and several other House progressives have echoed his call. And Senate Democrats were increasingly anxious during Feinstein's absence as they were unable to confirm some of President Joe Biden's judicial nominees with a narrow 51-49 majority. Video above: Sen. Feinstein returns to the Senate after absenceAs Democrats worried, Feinstein made an unusual request to be temporarily replaced on the Judiciary panel while she remained out of the Senate. But Republicans last month blocked a vote, saying there was little precedent for a temporary committee replacement and that they didn't want to help Democrats confirm the most partisan judges. Others said they thought Democrats were unfairly trying to push her out of office.Two weeks later, Democrats said that Feinstein would return to Washington.A senator for more than three decades, Feinstein has had a groundbreaking political career and shattered gender barriers. She was the first woman to serve as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the 1970s and the first female mayor of San Francisco. She ascended to that post after the November 1978 assassinations of then-Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk by a former supervisor, Dan White. Feinstein found Milk's body.In the Senate, she was the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2dG0xMy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9kaWFubmUtZmVpbnN0ZWluLXJhbXNheS1odW50LXN5bmRyb21lLXNoaW5nbGVzLWNvbXBsaWNhdGlvbnMvNDM5NDE3NTnSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy53dnRtMTMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL2RpYW5uZS1mZWluc3RlaW4tcmFtc2F5LWh1bnQtc3luZHJvbWUtc2hpbmdsZXMtY29tcGxpY2F0aW9ucy80Mzk0MTc1OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The commander of Unites States Central Command says that the Department of Defense lacks the ability to see the full picture of terrorist threats that could come from Afghanistan. He indicated that there is a need for new airborne intelligence platforms capable of remaining aloft in the region for extended periods of time. He also said that there is a need for increased intelligence collection – both signals and human intelligence.  ISKP. The Islamic State Khorsan Provice (ISKP) continues to mount attacks against Taliban officials and civilians in Afghanistan. The high-profile attacks include assassinations and bombings. ISKP could also strike U.S. or Western interests abroad within six months if they prioritized such attacks.  Diplomacy. U.S. diplomats continue to engage with the Taliban to promote U.S. interests. Issues under discussion include the safety of U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, relocation of U.S. Afghan allies, economy, terrorism, and human rights.  Assisting Afghan Allies (SIVs). The State Department is reported to have provided permanent consular staffing in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Pakistan to improve Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) and refugee processing. The Department of State issued 5,616 SIVs this quarter.

Assad described the bloc’s 32nd summit, hosted by Saudi Arabia, as a historic opportunity to address crises across the region without foreign interference. It was the first time Assad was addressing the organization since Syria’s membership was suspended in 2011 amid a foreign-backed militancy to topple the government in Damascus. Syria returned to the Arab League earlier this month. That followed normalization of ties between Syria and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah  The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, confirmed on Friday that ""Tel Aviv"" and other cities of the Zionist entity ""are within the range of our rockets and the bullets of our fighters.""  During a speech at the festival commemorating the martyrs of Operation Avenging the Free in the city of Saida, south Lebanon, Al-Nakhalah said, ""We meet today to honor a great group of martyrs and leaders who were killed in the treacherous aggression and to honor the two martyrs, Commander Khader Adnan and Commander Ali Al-Aswad, and everyone who ascended to martyrdom in Operation Avenging the Free.""  The PIJ memorizes the names, faces, and wills of the martyrs and will convey their names, titles, and dreams to future generations, he said.  Al-Nakhalah continued, ""Someday, we will inevitably write the names of the martyrs on the walls, mosque, and gates of Al-Quds,"" stressing that ""the enemy's illusions of strength and arrogance will be shattered when faced with the Palestinian people's will, ability, and determination to uphold confrontation and fight until victory is achieved.""  The PIJ Secretary-General underlined that the Palestinian people will not hesitate to offer sacrifices and that ""our martyrs are the ones who lead our path in achieving a balance of power with the enemy,"" stressing that the success of Operation Avenging the Free came ""with the blessing of the martyrs' spilled blood and the preservation of the unity of the Palestinian people.""  Al-Nakhalah said the movement stood strong and fought despite the martyrdom of commanders, fighters, and whole families, stressing that the PIJ has proven to the enemy that it is always ready ""to fight successive battles in defense of our people and to prevent our blood from being spilled.""  He warned the Israeli occupation that the PIJ's response to any assassination ""will be strong, clear and painful,"" stressing that ""Tel Aviv and other cities of the Zionist entity are within the range of our rockets and the bullets of our fighters.""  Operation Avenging the Free new chapter in life of Palestinian people  Al-Nakhalah pointed out that despite ""all the difficult circumstances and the imbalance of military power in favor of the enemy, our people are still fighting,"" adding, ""We have steadfastly and patiently fought major battles in defense of our identity and adherence to our rights, and our cause has remained alive.""  The PIJ chief considered that the occupation wanted to cast a shadow ""over our cause with politics and wars, but today we stand stronger and more determined to adhere to our rights and Al-Quds.""  He said Operation Avenging the Free ""is a new chapter in the life of our people, a chapter of unity, and a chapter for the integration of the Resistance with all its different factions.""  Al-Nakhalah pointed out that Operation Avenging the Free ""is a great day for the PIJ and for the people who stood united in defiance of the Zionist aggression.""  He said PIJ top commanders were martyred, leaving behind a legacy of fighters ready to engage in any battle necessary, adding, ""We are the people of jihad and resistance.""  The Palestinian leader explained that after the assassination of martyr Khader Adnan and Al-Quds Brigades commanders, ""the enemy thought that we would let their martyrdom go unanswered, but our fighters went out to rearrange the equations again,"" stressing that ""our battles prove that our nation can triumph over the Zionist project that conquered it and was the cause of its dependence and weakness.""  He pointed out that the Palestinian people were able to ""rub the enemy's nose in the dirt and shatter its arrogance more than once, and Operation Avenging the Free is the greatest proof of that.""  Al-Nakhalah said the Egyptian-mediated ceasefire entered into force ""based on the approval of the Palestinian and Israeli parties.""  ""Didn't anyone wonder who this Palestinian side is?"" he said.  He stressed that the Palestinian side is the ""PIJ - one faction that has nothing but its fighters and a people standing behind it and a Resistance that embraces it.""  He noted that one faction fought on the battlefield and negotiated to stop the aggression and obliged the enemy to stop its crimes, even if it does not commit to that later.  He continued mockingly, ""Where is the arrogance? Where is the invincible army? Where is the power of Israel and its rejection of international resolutions?""  Arab summit must assume its responsibility toward the Palestinian cause  Regarding the ceasefire, the Secretary-General of the Islamic Jihad Movement said the enemy was lying claiming that it ""withdrew from the negotiations, and this is not true. It is us who put off the negotiations more than once.""  He added that on the fifth day of the aggression, ""we presented the text of the agreement and preconditioned them either the enemy accepts it or we withdraw from the negotiations.”  “Our nation possesses capabilities that exceed by far the capabilities of the enemy, but all it lacks is the will to fight and the will to stand strong,” he further added.  Al-Nakhalah explained that the Zionist entity, despite ""possessing all the material elements of strength, it does not possess the [spirit of the] fighter we have.""  Reflecting a state of realism, the Resistance leader said, ""We do know that we have great challenges ahead and we are very well aware that one or more battles will not be able to achieve all our goals and aspirations, but ""our previous battles and today's Operation Avenging the Free have put us on the right track, and we have set out in that direction with no intention to stop.”  In this context, PIJ Secretary-General stressed that the Palestinian people are ""the vital element in the equation of struggle standing up to the balance of power,” adding that the nation today has a rare opportunity, which it must seize if it is serious about supporting the steadfastness of the Palestinian people.  Al-Nakhalah stressed that the Arab League Summit currently being held in Jeddah must ""assume its responsibility toward the Palestinian cause and the suffering of the Palestinian people,"" adding that ""the unity of our people and the Resistance forces is of paramount importance, and we must preserve and strengthen it.""  He also pointed out that ""the Palestinian Resistance can fight the enemy and defeat when it receives strong and permanent support,"" adding that ""the position of our brethren in Hezbollah, represented by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's speech, was highly appreciated by the Resistance and our people.""  In conclusion, Al-Nakhalah stressed that ""the permanent [presence] of the joint room and its willingness to enter the battle was an important factor in shortening the days of the aggression,” calling on the Resistance fighters wherever they may be to stay away from any tools and means that the enemy can use to locate them.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3RlbC1hdml2LW90aGVyLWlzcmFlbGktY2l0aWVzLW5vdC1mYXItZnJvbS1yb2NrZXQtcmFuZ2U6LW5ha9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-10-10","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","2023-05-19T11:00:00","Open this photo in gallery: Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza sits on a bench inside a defendants' cage during a hearing at the Basmanny court in Moscow, on Oct. 10, 2022.NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP/Getty Images  Brandon Silver is an international human-rights lawyer and director of policy and projects at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. Irwin Cotler is a former minister of justice and attorney-general of Canada and special envoy of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Community of Democracies for Vladimir Kara-Murza. Bill Browder is the chief executive officer of Hermitage Capital and head of the Global Justice for Sergei Magnitsky Campaign.  Russia tried to kill Vladimir Kara-Murza twice. His would-be assassins now hold him in a Moscow prison.  After miraculously surviving two poisonings by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Russian democratic opposition leader nonetheless courageously continues his anti-Putin advocacy and opposition to the brutal war in Ukraine. For this, he now languishes in a Russian prison, sentenced to 25 years in jail. This is the harshest prison sentence ever meted out to a political prisoner in Vladimir Putin’s Russia.  Mr. Kara-Murza is one of Russia’s most eloquent and erudite advocates, a regular presence in parliaments around the world, making the case for solidarity with Russian civil society and support for its people in the struggle against Mr. Putin’s authoritarianism. In the process, he made our countries safer and more humane, exposing the proceeds of corruption and criminality corroding our economy and democracy, and providing tools to redress it. He was instrumental in the adoption of Magnitsky legislation around the world, ensuring that these human-rights violators cannot enjoy the freedoms abroad that they deny their citizens at home.  Some of the first individuals to be sanctioned under these laws that Mr. Kara-Murza initiated are now the ones directly overseeing the prison in which he is arbitrarily detained, and his unjust persecution and prosecution that underpin it. If that wasn’t Kafkaesque enough, these are also the very same Russian officials responsible for the murder of Sergei Magnitsky in jail, and the subsequent assassination attempts on Mr. Kara-Murza for pursuing sanctions against them for this crime. He would not survive a third poisoning at their hands, the risk of which grows every day he remains in their custody.  The democratic world has been the beneficiary of Mr. Kara-Murza’s brilliance, and should match his courage in opposing Mr. Putin with an abiding commitment to securing his freedom.  Canada has led the charge, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau personally announcing at the G20 summit the implementation of targeted Magnitsky-style sanctions on all those involved in the case. This follows high-level engagement from Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, who has anchored clear public statements with concrete diplomatic action. In a politically fractious environment, support for Mr. Kara-Murza’s case is a rare point of consensus, with every Canadian political party leader and Parliament as a whole standing in solidarity.  It is poetic justice that one of the main authors of our Magnitsky laws should have them used to help secure his freedom, and other jurisdictions are following Canada’s lead. The United States recently cited Canada’s important stand when announcing its own sanctions against Mr. Kara-Murza’s oppressors, with Britain following shortly thereafter.  To rid the world of Putin, we must support Russian heroes like Vladimir Kara-Murza  Canada can continue to be a global trendsetter in pursuing the natural next step: honorary citizenship.  Mr. Kara-Murza’s case is an emblematic one. As a leading voice of the democratic opposition – a journalist, dissident, human-rights activist and political leader with an unimpeachable record of public service – he has spoken out on behalf of the over 24,000 people who have been arbitrarily arrested in Russia. As the most dedicated and visible spokesperson for Russian political prisoners until he became one himself, elevating Mr. Kara-Murza’s case will equally give voice to all those others unlawfully detained.  This spotlight would give lifesaving protective cover from the worst dangers and deprivations that grow in the darkness of Mr. Putin’s dungeons. It would also give hope to those in their most desperate moments, showing these courageous prisoners that they are not forgotten, and that Canadians stand with them in their struggle for democracy and against Mr. Putin’s crimes.  Such a move would also directly counter the Putin regime and advance Canada’s interests. By elevating such cases, we would be underscoring that Russians oppose Mr. Putin and his war of aggression, and thereby also undermine Mr. Putin’s aggressive propaganda campaign in that regard.  But it also tells a bigger story, of the dangers of authoritarianism and human-rights abuses, and the costs of inaction.  It was Mr. Kara-Murza who repeatedly warned us that internal repression is inextricably linked to external aggression. When Mr. Putin assaulted Chechnya; when he invaded Georgia; when he annexed Crimea; when he bombarded Syria; and when he was engaged in murdering and maiming dissidents and journalists, it was the inaction of the international community that not only indulged this culture of corruption and criminality but also incentivized a culture of impunity. This is what paved the path to the full-scale aggression against Ukraine.  For an enduring peace to prevail, not only must Ukraine receive the fullest extent of military, economic and diplomatic support to drive out Mr. Putin, but so must Russian civil society. A democratic post-Putin Russia would mitigate against the resurgence of tyranny that has been a source of terror in Russia and the region since the time of Czarist pogroms, through Soviet totalitarianism, to Mr. Putin’s current authoritarian mafia state.  Taking action on emblematic cases like Mr. Kara-Murza’s highlights and gives hope to all those other cases of freedom fighters courageously confronting the Russian regime. As Mr. Putin puts in prison all those who oppose the war – such as Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a seven-year sentence for speaking truth to power and calling Mr. Putin’s invasion the criminal war that it is – and killing journalists and human-rights defenders who seek to expose this truth, democratic governments should provide them a lifeline. Honorary citizenship for Mr. Kara-Murza would do just that.  For those few others who have evaded imprisonment in Russia, Canada can provide a pathway to actual citizenship. The Czech Republic, for instance, has provided 600 emergency visas to Russian journalists at risk. Canada can do the same for all those independent media and human-rights defenders forced to flee to continue their essential work unmasking the corruption and criminal abuses of Mr. Putin and his cronies.  As Mr. Kara-Murza recently wrote from prison, “It’s not only about moral support (although the significance of that is difficult to overstate). Sustained high-level advocacy from democratic nations has helped secure the release of prisoners of conscience all over the world. … Few political accomplishments can compare in importance to returning freedom to those unjustly deprived of it.”  We owe this to Mr. Kara-Murza, and to all Russians putting not only their livelihoods but their very lives on the line in opposing Mr. Putin’s brutal dictatorship and destructive war. In recognizing Mr. Kara-Murza with honorary citizenship, advocating for the release of political prisoners, and offering emergency refuge for those at risk of becoming prisoners, we can honour their sacrifice, sustain their courage, and support our shared vision of a free and democratic Russia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLWNhbmFkYS1jYW4taGVscC1ydXNzaWFuLWRpc3NpZGVudC12bGFkaW1pci1rYXJhLW11cnphLWJ5LWdpdmluZy1oaW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But, like many fascists since, they discovered that the very people they declared subhuman were actually full of talent, intelligence and drive. Unfortunately, it didn't stop their murderous campaign. But it did allow one female test pilot, Countess Melitta von Stauffenberg, to save most of her family.  And if von Stauffenberg is tickling your memory but you can't remember why, she was related to the famous Colonel Claus von Staffenberg of Operation Valkyrie fame. She even took part in the attempted assassination of Hitler with him.  Here is the story of Nazi Germany's greatest test pilot who was actually a Jewish woman  Born and educated as Melitta Schiller  Melitta Schiller came into the world around 1905 in Krotoschin, Prussia. Her father, of Jewish descent, served in the Prussian civil service. Her mother was a protestant, and both were ethnically German. After World War I, the newly formed Poland was inhospitable to most Germans and the family moved to Germany.  Melitta proved herself in athletics and mathematics and moved in 1922 to study science and the mathematics of aviation. She shone in school, inventing prototype instruments and testing them herself. She went into the aviation industry and became a pioneer of propeller design and rocket propulsion despite a crash landing in France. Farmers who rushed to her aid reportedly kept asking her where the pilot of the plane was because they couldn't believe it was a woman.  During the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, Schiller's employer fired her under pressure. About the same time, she attracted the eye of Count Alexander Schenk von Stauffenberg and married, becoming a countess herself.  The countess returns to the air  The woman now known as Litta von Stauffenberg quickly found new employment as her flying skills were well known. She achieved the rank of test pilot and worked on experimental planes and techniques.  The Third Reich pressured von Stauffenberg into service for them. Litta quickly proved herself as a test pilot for dives and did work essential to the development of the Stuka dive bomber. She routinely flew a dozen or more dives per day and provided information on how to improve the plane and dive techniques.  Litta didn't do this out of the kindness of her heart or out of patriotism. She hated Hitler and the Reich. But her family's safety explicitly rested on her successes as well as her brother's, Otto. In 1943, Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering awarded her the Iron Cross Second Class. In 1944, the Third Reich declared her, her brother Otto, and their two sisters to be ""equal to Aryans"" in the eyes of the Reich.  Stuka Ju 87Ds in October 1943.  An attempt on Hitler  But the countess knew what her work was enabling. And the continued subjugation and murder of millions of Jewish people in the Holocaust weighed heavily on her. Her brother-in-law, the German army Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, came to her with a proposal. If he could put together a plan to kill Adolph Hitler, would she deliver him to and from the assassination?  Melitta quickly agreed, but there was a wrinkle in the plan. Hitler's headquarters was remote and had bad options for landing strips. She was confident she could do it with a Fieseler plane, named for a stork. But Fieseler planes are slow and require frequent re-fueling. It was a terrible choice for escaping an assassination.  Claus ended up making the attempt without her, smuggling a bomb in a briefcase into a staff meeting with Hitler. He managed to place it properly and get away, but someone moved the briefcase behind a table leg after he left. The table leg absorbed a lot of the blast and Hitler survived.  The fallout  Two of Melitta's brothers-in-law, Claus and Berthold, were suspected of being part of the plot and were executed. Claus died by firing squad and Berthold was executed by strangulation. Melitta, her husband, and her parents were all arrested.  Melitta was soon released, however. The Nazis treated her loved ones relatively lightly in prisons and concentration camps, but the threat was clear. If Melitta ceased her work, slowed, or became a suspect of another assassination attempt, she and her family would be quickly executed.  Melitta continued her work, inventing a number of new devices and assisting in multiple plane designs, including the Messerschmitt-262 jet fighter. She used her medals and what prestige remained to get permission to visit family in concentration camps and prisons. In one case, this let her get better treatment for Claus's widow and children, including a daughter born after Claus's execution.  But as the Allies came to liberate Europe from the Nazis, they found Melitta in the air. On April 8, 1945, while Melitta flew to visit her husband, an American fighter spotted her. He quickly shot down her unarmed trainer aircraft. Countess Melitta von Staffenberg died of her wounds a few hours later.  While much of her work unfortunately benefited some of the worst people imaginable, Melitta was a pioneering and brilliant woman whose successes proved the folly of the Nazi's ridiculous racial views.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJldGhlbWlnaHR5LmNvbS9oaXN0b3J5L25hemktZ2VybWFueXMtZ3JlYXRlc3QtdGVzdC1waWxvdC13YXMtYS1qZXdpc2gtd29tYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sonko is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday in a legal showdown that has sparked tensions in the West African country.  His trial opened on May 16 but was immediately adjourned until May 23 after he failed to attend.  ""The day I am given guarantees, I will come to Dakar and on Tuesday I will be in court. If all the (security) conditions are met, I will be there,"" he said in an interview on television Friday night.  In Dakar, the police ""made me suffer violence, brutality. My house is barricaded and they tried to assassinate me,"" he said in the Wolof language, accusing the authorities.  ""I am chased everywhere. I was injured. My activists receive tear gas canisters or are arrested by the hundreds. The judicial institution must not be the armed wing of the executive to eliminate a presidential candidate"" for the 2024 elections, he added.  Sonko, president of the PASTEF-Patriots party, came in third in the 2019 election against incumbent Macky Sall, and intends to stand again next year.  Sonko said he did not receive a summons for his trial over the alleged rape of an employee at a beauty salon where he went for a massage.  The 48-year-old, who was also recently sentenced to a six-month suspended prison sentence for defamation and insults against the tourism minister, has denied the charge.  He says the legal cases against him are a plot aimed at barring him from contesting the 2024 vote.  Supporters of Sonko clashed with police on Monday and Tuesday in the southern city of Ziguinchor, where he is mayor.  There was also unrest in the capital Dakar and elsewhere. Authorities reported three deaths but the connection with the clashes was not clear.  Political tensions have also been stoked by Sall's refusal to rule out running for a third term as president, a move his opponents say would be unconstitutional.  Story continues  Senegal is traditionally a beacon of stability in troubled West Africa, but in recent years has been buffeted by turbulence that has at times turned deadly.  When Sonko was arrested in 2021, several days of protests left at least 12 people dead.  mrb/rr/mtp/dva","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc2VuZWdhbC1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWxlYWRlci1kZW1hbmRzLXNhZmV0eS0wMzEyMDg3MTUuaHRtbNIBWWh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC9zZW5lZ2FsLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tbGVhZGVyLWRlbWFuZHMtc2FmZXR5LTAzMTIwODcxNS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Edwin Onno van Ingen, 58, was added to a list established in 2021 by the U.S. which freezes the assets of anyone accused of providing support to the Russian military or the country's economy. It also punishes those participating in various acts of corruption on Russia's behalf, like interference in the elections of a U.S. ally, cybercrime, transnational corruption, undermining political stability, or participated in an assassination of an American or American ally.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury said in a press release that Van Ingen ""is a primary Europe-based procurement agent for Russian laboratories focused on nuclear weapon design and development as well as research on advanced conventional weapons technologies. Russia’s intelligence services often task Van Ingen to solicit offers and procure technologies such as advanced manufacturing, scientific, and measuring equipment. Van Ingen then approaches manufacturers and resellers and, in many cases, helps mask the real end-user of the equipment being bought and helps organize the equipment’s transshipment to Russia.""  The update was discovered by Dutch publication Follow the Money. Van Ingen told the publication he was very surprised when they informed him of the sanction. ""What you say is completely new to me."" A review of records maintained by Open Sanctions showed that Van Ingen is the first Dutch citizen to be added to one of the U.S. sanctions lists. He told Follow the Money that his father did business in Russia for decades. After he died, the younger Van Ingen picked up where he left off, but stopped making deliveries to Russia after the war began.  Van Ingen also does not try to evade restrictions by sending shipments to intermediary countries, like China or Turkey, he stated. He runs several Dutch businesses, including a business material wholesaler, and providing company administration to small businesses. Follow the Money said he also owns mediation firm Ronin Management BV, for which he was sanctioned. The company has an estimated balance sheet reflecting about 10 million euros.  “I have never done anything that the Ministry of Economic Affairs does not know about,” he told the publication. ""I was not approached by anyone from the U.S., nor by The Hague,"" he added. ""I'm getting negative attention now, this is what the U.S. is making of it, but I haven't done anything wrong."" His other companies have also been sanctioned, specifically Pro Rata Solutions B.V. and Delta Technical and Scientific Instruments B.V. Like Van Ingen, these were sanctioned under Executive Order 14024. The names were among those added to a list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control strictly because of Van Ingen's involvement. Neither he nor his companies can do business with an American entity, the Treasury Department said.  ""I haven't been able to think about the consequences yet,"" Van Ingen stated.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIzLzA1LzE5L2ZpcnN0LWR1dGNoLWNpdGl6ZW4tYWRkZWQtdXMtc2FuY3Rpb25zLWxpc3QtdGFyZ2V0aW5nLXJ1c3NpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-06-01","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:43:00","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Leaders with the Jackson Convention Center are taking over management of the facility in-house, cutting ties with the company that’s been in charge of it for more than two years.  On Friday, the Capital City Convention Center Commission announced that it was taking over operations of the facility, saying they’re following a pattern similar to other cities.  “OVG stabilized the center after the COVID-19 pandemic and we are thankful for their partnership,” Commission Chair Fred Banks said. “But now, we are excited to move into a new chapter with Cherre Miller as general manager.”  “Her experience and expertise in running facilities, specifically the JCC, is unmatched.”  Miller was tapped to take over management of the center recently. She was unavailable for comment Friday afternoon.  Commission attorney Charlene Priester said the decision to end its agreement with OVC was amicable and had been in the works for months.  “OVG and the Convention Center have been in talks about the center’s financial difficulties for a while now. I believe it was in early April when they reached a final decision,” she said.  OVG, also known as Oak View Group, is a venue management firm based in Los Angeles.  The company was hired to take over the struggling convention center in 2020, according to the Northside Sun.  It was not known how much time OVG had left in its contract or how much the city would have to pay to end the agreement.  “There are still some fees owed to OVG and we are working out the details now,” Priester said. “They did make an investment in Jackson.”  The center will now be managed by convention center employees, who will be overseen by the commission and Visit Jackson, the city’s tourism bureau.  “No employees are losing their jobs,” Priester said. “One person asked to be transferred with OVG and that was accomplished.”  The decision to end the agreement is a cost-saving measure for Jackson and the Convention Center itself, which was struggling financially even before the COVID pandemic.  “Since COVID and the shutdown of the entire nation, we’ve had struggles trying to operate in a manner that kept all the bills paid,” Priester said. “But the Convention Center has made great progress in trying to come out.”  She pointed to the Two Rivers Black-Tie Gala, a benefit for Tougaloo College held at the center on May 5, as well as the upcoming Voices of Courage and Justice event, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, slated for June.  The Jackson Convention Center opened in 2009, years after the completion of the Telcom Center on Pascagoula Street, the Clarion-Ledger reported at the time.  It was billed as a venue that could help revitalize downtown Jackson and generate new business for the capital city.  However, efforts to fulfill those promises have been hampered by the lack of an adjoining convention hotel and poor parking.  Last summer, former convention center manager Mark Arancibia told WLBT at least one event organizer was considering leaving Jackson if the parking situation was not improved.  Convention center parking is located across the street from the 330,000-square-foot facility.  The uneven concrete slabs that characterize the lot stand in stark contrast to the modern building, with large plate-glass windows and a contemporary design.  The Capital City Convention Center Commission is partnering with Visit Jackson to manage the convention center. The work previously was done by a third-party management firm. (WLBT)  Yolanda Clay-Moore, director of communications with Visit Jackson, told WLBT other event organizers won’t consider Jackson at all because of the lack of an adjoining hotel.  “When we answer the question, that we don’t have a connecting property, that automatically ends all further talks of having that event in our city,” she said.  The city is hoping to rectify that situation. This spring, Jackson issued a request for proposals/qualifications for companies to conduct a feasibility study and market analysis of the Central Business District in downtown Jackson to determine if the area could support a hotel and parking garage.  Three companies responded to the city’s request and those proposals were being evaluated, Jackson Director of Communications Melissa Faith Payne said in late April.  Once those proposals are reviewed, a vendor will be chosen to move forward with the work, she said.  In the meantime, the city’s tourism officials are hopeful the decision to manage the facility in-house will mean more events and more visitors coming into Jackson.  Said Priester, “We believe, like other cities that self-manage, this not a bad pivot.”  Want more WLBT news in your inbox? Click here to subscribe to our newsletter.

"assassination","1842-11-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T23:06:01","This was the fifth time that she had been attacked since her 1837 ascension to the throne. Media accounts often emphasised her coolness. The Morning Post reported that ""her Majesty betrayed no feeling of alarm"" and had the ""complete self-possession"" to courteously acknowledge groups of cheering spectators as her carriage made its way back to Buckingham Palace.  This description of the Queen as resilient, unflappable, and committed to duty chimes with her popular image, both then and now. Victoria's famous quote – ""we are not amused"" – may never have passed her lips, but it has come to symbolise the sangfroid of the Queen and the mood of an era. Many people imagine the 19th Century as a time of repressed emotions, while others celebrate its supposed stoicism. (Read more about the origins of the ""stiff upper lip"".)  Despite her public façade, Victoria's personal journals reveal an emotional side. Looking back on the attack from the safety of Buckingham Palace, she wrote that it now seemed ""like a horrid dream"". As her account of the incident unfolded, fear and confusion gave way to anger, and she came to see the ""outrage"" as ""the most disgraceful and cowardly thing that has ever been done"". Victoria wasn't the only one to feel some emotion. Prince Albert was ""dreadfully shocked"", while Sir George Grey, the home secretary at the time, arrived at Buckingham Palace ""greatly distressed & in tears"". In the hours after the attack, Victoria was still ""shaken, nervous, & unable to eat"".  Still, she ventured to the opera where joyful crowds threw their hats in the air and serenaded her with spontaneous renditions of ""God Save The Queen"". While not all Victorians were enthusiastic monarchists, attacks on the Queen prompted these outpourings of emotion. As Victoria herself quipped, ""it is worth being shot at to learn how much one is loved"".  Her determination not to hide away in the wake of the attacks was typical of Victoria in her younger years. Back in 1842, a teenage boy named John Francis had pointed a pistol at her carriage as it drove up Constitution Hill. Albert spotted him, but Francis didn't fire and managed to slip away. Knowing that a potential assassin was on the loose, Prime Minster Robert Peel urged the Queen to stay at home while his new police force hunted the attacker. Victoria refused. The next evening, she and Albert rode out in their open-top carriage flanked by guards but still exposed. Sure enough, Francis made another attempt, this time managing to fire his pistol at the royal couple moments before being seized by a policeman. Victoria emerged unhurt, but it could have ended very differently.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vZnV0dXJlL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMzA1MTktaG93LWFzc2Fzc2lucy1yZXZlYWxlZC1hLWhpZGRlbi1zaWRlLXRvLXF1ZWVuLXZpY3Rvcmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-11-03","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-19T12:16:47","It seems that Saudi Arabia still considers the improvement of relations with Damascus as a realistic option and a way to guarantee its wider regional interests.  Saudi Arabia is no longer waiting for America's green light in regional positioning, though this does not mean crossing the American red line.  Riyadh and Damascus were in rival camps in the 1950s and 1960s. After 1963, Syria's relations with Saudi Arabia have undergone periodic fluctuations. After the challenges in the 1980s, the two countries' relations improved in the 1990s, but the assassination of Rafik Hariri in Lebanon, and Riyadh's support to the anti-government factions in Syria (2008) soured bilateral relations.  Despite improved ties in 2009, Saudi-Syrian relations deteriorated after the start of the war on Syria. Saudi Arabia severed its ties with Syria by closing the embassy in Damascus and expelled the Syrian ambassador in 2012. However, the signs and events of the past year indicate improving relations between the two countries.  Developments such as stopping critical statements by officials, stopping media criticism by both countries, sending a delegation from Syria to the Saudi capital, the presence of the Syrian Tourism Minister in Riyadh, and Bashar Al-Assad's meeting with the Saudi delegation in Damascus, have been signs that point to the clear improvement of relations between the two countries.  The recent visit of Prince Faisal Bin Farhan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia to Damascus after the visit of Faisal Mekdad, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria to Jeddah was the first very important event in the process of normalization of relations since 2011.  International and regional political motivations and variables  In fact, further multipolarity attempts were detected in the international system; meanwhile, Riyadh was taking new steps toward Moscow and China. All these developments have played an important role in normalizing the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia. Part of the recent negotiations for the normalization of Saudi-Syrian relations were held in Moscow, and China welcomed the agreement of Saudi Arabia and Syria to reopen the embassies.  Russia has tried to reduce tensions and encourage Saudi Arabia to support the readmission of Syria to the Arab League, which softened Riyadh's position toward Syria. In another dimension, less presence in the Middle East is in Washington's favor, and Washington has paid attention to evaluating its policies toward Damascus by maintaining sanctions and avoiding the normalization of relations.  However, Saudi Arabia is no longer waiting for America's green light in regional positioning, though this does not mean crossing the American red line. In fact, the return of the Saudi Arabian ambassador to Syria does not constitute a violation of US sanctions.  Saudi Arabia's normalization with Iran has also played an important role in improving relations between Riyadh and Damascus. The agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran, with the mediation of China and its multilateral consequences in the Middle East, accelerated the improvement of Syrian-Saudi relations.  In addition, the previous compromises between Yemen-Saudi Arabia, Egypt-Qatar, Egypt-Turkey, Qatar-Bahrain, etc., each, in turn, have been motivations for improving Riyadh-Damascus relations. Strengthening Egyptian-Syrian relations is also an incentive for the return of Syrian-Saudi relations.  Apart from this, the change in the approach of the Arab countries regarding Syria and the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between countries such as the UAE, Jordan, etc. with Syria has made Damascus and Riyadh more eager to reopen their embassies and resume flights. Also, the increasing will of countries for Damascus to rejoin the Arab League (which suspended Syria's membership in 2011), has pushed Riyadh to reduce tensions with Damascus. The Arab League's decision to readmit Syria after 12 year, was an important symbolic victory for Damascus with the help of Riyadh.  Since the summer of 2017, and following the Riyadh summit, Saudi Arabia has gradually separated itself from the Syrian opposition. From Damascus' point of view, cutting off financial aid to the militias and Riyadh's, ""open and realistic policies"" are in the interest of Syria. In fact, the reduction and disconnection of Riyadh's communication with the opposition of Damascus have led to the restoration of relations and focus to ""maintaining the unity of Syria"".  In addition, greater rapprochement regarding the integrity of Syrian lands, the return of Syrian refugees, the provision of sufficient infrastructure, the beginning of the reconstruction of Syria by providing Arab and international aid, and the expulsion of Turkish forces from Syria away from Resolution 2254, have all improved relations. With a new approach toward Syria, Riyadh wants to close the case of Saudi detainees in Syria. This cooperation can lead to other dimensions of anti-terrorism security issues. Like Egypt and the UAE, Riyadh hopes to limit the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood through its cooperation of Damascus.  Economic and cultural motivations and factors  Despite the difference in the type of systems, both countries have an Islamic-Arab identity. This can improve the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia, so a gradual improvement in relations based on Arab commonalities could be an opportunity for Syria and Saudi Arabia in the region.  Damascus will need Saudi lobbying and assistance to reduce US sanctions against Syria and allow investment in the country. Even now, Damascus hopes Riyadh will help in the reconstruction of Syria, create conditions for the return of Syrian refugees, provide sufficient infrastructure, and start the reconstruction of Syria by providing Arab and international aid.  In fact, by improving and normalizing relations, Saudi Arabia and its allies can contribute to the reconstruction of Syria with a significant investment. Also, improving relations helps to provide a suitable platform for more trade between Syria and the Arab world.  Before 2011, Saudi Arabia was one of the most important trading partners of Syria. Saudi Arabia also wants to focus on domestic projects with the aim of diversifying its economy and increasing its exports. In this situation, the volume of trade can be increased by reviving direct flights and consular services and political rapprochement.  The perspective of relationships  Syria and Saudi Arabia are taking steps to open consular services and flights between the two countries. It seems that Saudi Arabia still considers the improvement of relations with Damascus as a realistic option and a way to guarantee its wider regional interests.  In the meantime, the slow improvement of diplomatic, economic, tourism, and cultural relations and the continuation of talks to improve ties provide the basis for a step-by-step return to the 1990s level of relations. But ties are still far from complete normalization, and the conclusion of a bilateral strategic agreement requires the overcoming of multiple challenges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hbG1heWFkZWVuLm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlcy9hbmFseXNpcy9tb3RpdmVzLWFuZC1mYWN0b3JzLWluZmx1ZW5jaW5nLXRoZS1pbXByb3ZlbWVudC1vZi1zeXJpYW4tc2HSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The series has seen a steady increase in viewership ratings since its premiere on April 26 and has become an impressive addition to Lee Do-hyun, Ra Mi-ran, and Ahn Eun-ji’s career roster.  Episode 5 of The Good Bad Mother ended with Kang-ho’s assassination attempt while Young-soon visited the village chief for medicines for her intense stomach pain.  It also gave viewers an adorable flashback of Kang-ho and Mi-joo’s relationship and the breakup. Sam-sik also returned to the village, while CEO Song sent his men to find a hidden ace that would give him an upper hand over Oh Tae-soo.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 introduces a health issue that the mother-son duo might never recover from. While Mi-joo gets back on her feet, Kang-ho gets left behind. However, The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also showcases how the local villagers treat her like family despite all the fights and misunderstandings.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6: Kang-ho and Young-soon face an unsolvable problem  Aya @suhyeokz poor himndosks    #TheGoodBadMotherEp6  kangho was literally almost killed but his mom just thought it was just an excuse bc of saja's mess in the housepoor himndosks kangho was literally almost killed but his mom just thought it was just an excuse bc of saja's mess in the house 😭😭 poor himndosks#TheGoodBadMotherEp6https://t.co/Ff2vjVwUHK  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 opens with CEO Song’s trusted men devising a plan to search for evidence in Kang-ho’s house. The two sneak in but soon hear Kang-ho at the door. They hide in a cabinet and hear Kang-ho scolding Lion, the piglet, as he believes Lion created the mess because the house is also covered with poop.  A man on a motorcycle enters Kang-ho’s house and attempts to kill him. He fails as the CEO Song’s men leap from the closet and try to chase him down. They see a tattoo on the assassin’s arm but fail to catch him. Young-soon returns home and sees the mess. Kang-ho recalls everything that happened, but she thinks he was making up stories to cover up for Lion and scolds him.  On the other hand, CEO Song is frustrated that his men couldn’t find the original copy DNA test of Oh Tae-soo’s secretary’s child at Kang-ho’s place. The duo tells him about the assassination attempt, and CEO Song orders them to protect Kang-ho.  jia @yseouland    glad atleast they were there so oh taesoo's man didnt get to kill him    #TheGoodBadMother  Ep6 so song woobyeok people came to kangho's house bcos they were searching for something but end up being in the closet hiding as kangho entered the houseglad atleast they were there so oh taesoo's man didnt get to kill him #TheGoodBadMother Ep6 so song woobyeok people came to kangho's house bcos they were searching for something but end up being in the closet hiding as kangho entered the house 😂glad atleast they were there so oh taesoo's man didnt get to kill him#TheGoodBadMother#TheGoodBadMotherEp6 https://t.co/AH9ICXd5Av  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also makes Sam-sik return to the village as he is unable to stay out of trouble. His employer finds him at a port and asks him for compensation of 100 million won for the brawl at the gambling den. After some back and forth, he jumps into the water and escapes.  Meanwhile, the Artist, Baek Hoon-ah, visits the chief villager, Son Yong-rak’s house. It turns out that the duo were classmates. After catching up, he talks about having trouble with Young-soon.  Young-soon tells Kang-ho that she’s going to the marketplace while they both watch the news about the foot-and-mouth disease. Kang-ho quietly says that he will see Young-soon later then. Young-soon smiles fondly and says that he always used to beg her to take him with her.  As Kang-ho tries making excuses, Young-soon says she knows he wants to play with Ye-jin and Seo-jin but asks him to stay out of trouble. Things look bright for Mi-joo in The Good Bad Mother episode 6 as Geum-ja gives her passbook and stamp to Mi-joo, asking her to open her own shop. Mi-joo is emotional and thankful. She goes to the town to search for a place she can rent.  Meanwhile, Kang-ho ends up following Mi-joo to town after he sees her accidentally drop her wallet. He goes to the location Mi-joo had asked the AI on her phone and searches for her. Mi-joo meets with a real estate agent. Young-soon is also in the same neighborhood, buying shoes for Kang-ho. She sets her eyes on a plain white canvas shoe and tells the shopkeeper that she’ll return for it soon.  Hoon-ah, the musician, tries to get the locals to go against Young-soon in The Good Bad Mother episode 6 as he also visits Geum-ja. He seems to have a plan to have people on his side. On the other hand, Young-soon buys supplements for the locals and three months’ worth of indigestion medicine.  Mi-joo goes door-to-door to ask people for a space to open her nail shop. She stops in front of an aquarium and remembers Kang-ho. The present Kang-ho sees her standing but loses her as a vehicle blocks his view.  Mi-joo reaches an agricultural chemicals shop to buy herbicide. She notices a small space in the shop. She advises an elderly lady on how to take care of her nails, and her friends strike a deal by letting Mi-joo open a shop-in-shop with the chemical shop owner.  A thief tries to steal Mi-joo’s wallet from Kang-ho’s jacket but fails as Kang-ho catches him by throwing an apple at him. He repeats, “hit a home run or strikeout,” which was the motto of CEO Song unknowingly.  Other shopkeepers around the incident pick a fight with Kang-ho to compensate them. Mi-joo sees the altercation and intervenes. Young-soon also stumbles upon them. She then drives the duo home.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also shows glimpses of Kang-ho remembering his memories in bits and pieces. In the car, Kang-ho repeats “Bar Exam Meal,” which is the name Mi-joo embroidered on Kang-ho’s lunch bag. She is shocked to hear it while Young-soon beats him, as she thinks he said a bad word.  Aya @suhyeokz    #TheGoodBadMotherEp6    the way he's trying to ask mijoo for help from his mom the way he's trying to ask mijoo for help from his mom 😭#TheGoodBadMotherEp6https://t.co/5uJ5beq9Oy  Young-soon apologizes to Mi-joo for her past behavior when she blamed her for Kang-ho missing his CSATs. She hands him the supplements for Geum-ja. Mi-joo shares words of encouragement with Young-soon.  Meanwhile, The Good Bad Mother episode 6 hints a bit at the local villagers being charmed by Baek Hoon-ah. Hoon-ah tricks them into believing that he will create a massive concert hall in Jou-ri, giving everyone a chance to boost their business. The locals agree to protest against Young-soon’s pig farm. Young-soon hears this when she goes to give them supplements but is heartbroken.  She goes to the farm as one pig goes into labor. Kang-ho is left on his own to deliver some of the supplements, and he delivers them at Sam-sik’s place. Nearby, he tries to fish for Mi-joo. Sam-sik, unknown to Kang-ho’s troubles, sees him.  We then see a flashback where The Good Bad Mother episode 6 reveals what went wrong between Sam-sik and Kang-ho. Sam-sik meets Kang-ho at a company dinner. The stark difference in class is apparent between the two. Kang-ho is naturally frustrated with him. Sometime later, Sam-sik is seen pleading with Kang-ho for help. However, he refuses to do so.  liesel @eunjiniverse  Ep6 ok we all know samsik is such a silly guy and talks too much all times but he just genuinely asked kangho how has he been here 🥲 #TheGoodBadMother #TheGoodBadMother Ep6 ok we all know samsik is such a silly guy and talks too much all times but he just genuinely asked kangho how has he been here 🥲 #TheGoodBadMother#TheGoodBadMotherEp6 https://t.co/MpBiYYSuu8  Cut to the present, Sam-sik and seven-year-old amnesiac Kang-ho get into a verbal fight. Kang-ho goes to the twins to get the help of their scary father. Mi-joo opens the door, and the kids talk to him as well. Learning that he is alone for the night, as Young-soon would stay at the farm for the pigs’ birth, they invite him to dinner.  Aya @suhyeokz    2. the way yejin calls him ""kangho oppa? uncle kangho?"" but still consider him as a friend    3. her saying ""how dare him do that to my friend?

Mi-joo is teary-eyed and tells Kang-ho never to meet them. Kang-ho asks Mi-joo if he was ever a bad person to her. As she doesn’t reply, he says that he thinks he was.  Meanwhile, village chief Yon-rak finds the bagful of supplements Young-soon got him and feels bad. Elsewhere, CEO Song’s men try searching the pig farm for evidence. They stumble upon Young-soon and lie about starting their own farm. As they begin to leave, Young-soon falls down in pain.  Kang-ho wakes up in the middle of his sleep, sensing something is wrong. He calls for Young-soon but gets no reply.  On the other hand, Mi-joo takes turns patting Ye-jin and Seo-jin and seems lost in thought. Geum-ja remembers the day Mi-joo and Kang-ho were born and how it sealed her and Young-soon’s friendship. She is also reminded of Young-soon reciprocating the support when Geum-ja’s husband passed away.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 also shows the heartbreaking backstory of Young-soon. In a flashback, we see a young Young-soon packing a gimbap for her brother, mother, and father, who were going to her dad’s company picnic. The family seems to have a close bond. However, as Young-soon turns, the car gets into a devastating accident that leaves her alone.  Remembering the past, Young-soon wakes up in a cold sweat. The next morning, Kang-ho searches for Young-soon everywhere, like she had taught him to. He calls her as a last resort, and we see a nurse answering the phone.  On the other hand, the locals betray Hoon-ah and do not participate in the protest against Young-soon’s pig farm after giving him excuses.  Meanwhile, a doctor asks Young-soon about her family members several times. Youn-soon smiles and says there’s no one with her and asks the doctor to tell her her diagnosis. The doctor reveals that Young-soon has stage 4 stomach cancer.  Young-soon is in denial and continues to laugh, repeating that she only had indigestion. The realization strikes, and she begs on her knees to save her, as Kang-ho needs her.  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 ends with Kang-ho racing towards a pale Young-soon in the hospital. He falls from the wheelchair after bumping into a guy. Young-soon tries to lift him up, but her body fails her. Dejected and angry, she yells at a confused Kang-ho to get up on his own and walks away.  리리 ♡ 🐷⚽️ @blueskypallette  Ep6  #TheGoodBadMother Kangho and his lost face when his mom told him to get up on his own.. bcs youngsoon made up her mind, as she diagnosed to be sick. she cannot be near and help kangho all the time.. this is so sad and why this trope #TheGoodBadMother Ep6 Kangho and his lost face when his mom told him to get up on his own.. bcs youngsoon made up her mind, as she diagnosed to be sick. she cannot be near and help kangho all the time.. this is so sad and why this trope 😭#TheGoodBadMotherEp6#TheGoodBadMother https://t.co/j6lSHjN67f  The Good Bad Mother episode 6 brought forth a twist that not many expected. With a limited time on Earth, will Young-soon see Kang-ho return to his past self? Who will take care of Kang-ho once Young-soon leaves him? Will Kang-ho ever remember the sacrifices his ""bad mother"" made for him?  The Good Bad Mother is a 14-episode series that airs every Wednesday and Thursday on Netflix.

"assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:27:32","'National Enquirer'  ""Sex Creep Trump Buys Melania's Silence!"" Declares the front page.  Days after being branded a sex offender and fined $5 million in a civil trial, former president Donald Trump allegedly wants to appear happily married for his 2014 run at the White House. Only a week after stablemate 'Globe' reported that Melania was ""moving out"" in a trial separation, the 'Enquirer' now claims their ""$3.2 billion divorce drama"" is on hold, after Trump bought her off with a ""new deal on his will, prenup & allowance!""  In exchange for Melania's public support, Trump has reportedly given her an improved prenup deal, more spending money, and boosted the inheritance bequeathed to their son Barron, aged 17.  If the story is true, Melania is gambling big on Trump regaining the presidency. If he fails, he risks greater exposure to numerous criminal lawsuits, which could put him behind bars, bringing his empire crumbling down, making it hard for Melania to get any money amid a likely flood of creditors.  ""What Her Majesty Really Thought About Meghan.""  The Queen privately called Duchess Meghan ""evil,"" an unnamed source told Britain's 'Spectator.'  Apparently this raised eyebrows because it's not the sort of language the Queen typically used. Perhaps it was meant as a compliment?  ""New Daddy De Niro Hears Wedding Bells!""  At the age of 79, with the birth of his seventh child by his latest lover, why would he do that?  ""Docs Destroyed Meg Ryan's Face!""  The 'Enquirer' thinks she's had too much plastic surgery. The actress's rep calls such stories ""completely fabricated.""  ""Hollywood Horror Show! Strikes may spell end of today's TV!""  With brazen self-interest, the rag tells readers: ""It's time to put down the remote and subscribe to The National Enquirer,"" because ""the crippling writers' strike may be the death knell for television as we know it.""  Right. We're entering the dawn of a new age of tabloid journalism, rising from the ashes of outmoded television.  ""CIA Assassins Took Out JFK!""  A week after claiming that vice present Lyndon B Johnson had President Kennedy killed, the rag quotes Robert Kennedy Jr claiming there is ""overwhelming evidence"" that the CIA was ""involved"" in the assassination. RFK Jr is a leading anti-vax campaigner, so he's clearly adept at reasoned argument and weighing the facts.  ""Hollywood Braces For Foxx Farewell!""  Actor Jamie Foxx's daughter says he's recovering from a health scare and playing pickleball; the 'Enquirer' says he is ""beyond help"" as friends prepare their ""final goodbyes.""  Someone's got it wrong.  'Globe'  ""Epstein Dirty Diaries Found!"" screams the cover.  The late convicted billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's diaries allegedly reveal his ""A-list inner circle.""  But Epstein pals Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Bill Gates are apparently not mentioned in his diaries, which record planned meetings with lesser luminaries such as current CIA chief William Burns, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Swiss banking CEO Ariane de Rothschild, and MIT's Noam Chomsky. But there's nothing to suggest that any of them were involved in any of Epstein's sex crimes, or had anything other than business dealings with him. American Symphony Orchestra conductor Leon Botstein, named in the diaries, claims he met Epstein in an unsuccessful fundraising bid.  Shocking.  Or, as the 'Globe' puts it in its headline: ""The Worms Under Epstein's Rocks!""  ""Tom Cruise Falls Hard For Sexy Shakira!""  They met at the Miami Grand Prix on May 7, which is enough for the 'Globe' to be hearing wedding bells.  ""King Hits Meghan Where It Hurts!""  Rather than a swift tolchock to the face, King Charles has allegedly inflicted maximum suffering on Duchess Meghan . . . by making a cameo appearance with Queen Camilla on 'American Idol.' (That's old-school TV, of the sort soon to vanish from the face of the tabloid-dominated Earth.)  ""He delivered a very direct message to the Sussexes: Don't mess with me!"" says an unnamed ""palace source,"" who must surely have lost his or her mind. ""It was a master-stroke of one-upmanship.""  As if Meghan would feel threatened because Charles is appearing on television.  ""The royal gloves are off,"" a ""senior courtier"" supposedly said. ""He has taken control and is showing his rebel son and daughter-in-law who's boss.""  Do 'Globe' readers seriously believe this is how courtiers talk? 'Globe' reporters clearly think so.  ""Beyoncé Hubby Dogged For Paternity Test.""  A 30-year-old Jersey man claims to be Jay Z's love child, and is seeking a paternity test. The case has already been rejected by the New Jersey Supreme Court, and another man is named as father on the claimant's birth certificate. It's hard to imagine why Jay-Z won't agree to a paternity test.  ""Is This Ancient Statue Proof of Time Travel?""  The 'Globe' displays a photo of an ancient Greek funerary relief from the Getty Museum in California, which ""appears to show woman using laptop computer.""  Or, as the Getty puts it: ""a woman reaches out to lift the lid of a shallow box held by an attendant.""  Someone's got it wrong.  'People'  ""What Really happened to Anna Nicole Smith?"" asks its cover story.  More than 16 years after the model's drug overdose death, a new documentary tells the same story we've always heard, but also questions whether her childhood was quite as traumatic as she had claimed.  Her friend and former lover, Missy Byrum, states bluntly: ""She made a lot of stuff up."" Smith allegedly had a moderately happy childhood, but appropriated Byrum's own tales of childhood abuse as her own.  Byrum, a fellow stripper who claims she lived with and married Smith, says she walked away when Smith's drug habit became overwhelming: ""She needed more love than any one human being could give her.""  ""Halle Bailey's Big Splash!""  The star puts a ""fresh spin"" on Disney princess 'The Little Mermaid.' ""Fresh spin"" meaning she's Black. It's not as if her Ariel is a misunderstood trans mermaid with body dysmorphia hailing from the wrong side of the reef.  ""Sting – Songs of My Life.""  The 71-year-old rocker reveals what songs meant to him when he wrote them. 'Every Breath You Take' ""could be sinister, or it could be quite warm and sweet and nice . . . Whatever your interpretation is is perfectly valid,"" he says. Yes, that song played at so many weddings is about a possessive stalker; Sting's just too polite to say.  'Us Weekly'  'The Little Mermaid"" is this week's cover girl beneath the headline: ""Halle Bailey Makes a Splash.""  The aquatic star talks about fame and overcoming racism in the Disney role.  ""Ariel helped me find my voice,"" she says. Being cast as the lead in a Disney movie will also do that to you.  Thankfully we have the crack investigative team at 'Us Weekly' to tell us that Rachel Weisz wore it best, that David Hasselhoff is ""dying to go to China because I want to see if they'd recognize me"" – apparently said without any trace of irony, or any semblance of self-awareness – and that the stars are just like us: they eat junk food at sports games, paradoxically read the ingredient labels on food packages, and ride the subway. Scintillating, as ever.

Tiger Eye PI said in the statement that one of its investigators, Ahmed Suale, was killed on the same day he had had engagements with the Attorney General’s office on his testimony against the accused person in this same case, so it is not prepared to lose any more of its investigators.  Nyantakyi is facing prosecution following an undercover investigative documentary by Tiger Eye PI, which captured him taking bribe and engaging in influence peddling.  ADVERTISEMENT  Read the full statement by Tiger Eye P.I below:  NYANTAKYI AND LAWYERS TO SEE ANAS’S FACE BEFORE COURT PROCEEDINGS  RE: REPUBLIC V. KWESI NYANTAKYI AND ANOTHER  1. Tiger Eye P.I has taken notice of the ruling by the High Court sitting in Accra to allow undercover journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas to testify wearing mask in open court on condition that he shows his face to the accused person in the judges’ chambers first.  2.Anas had earlier agreed to testify as a witness for the prosecution in the above styled case after Ahmed Hussein Suale was gruesomely murdered, on condition that his identity is protected.  ADVERTISEMENT  3.Anas’s request for the protection of his identity stems from his role as an undercover agent and the real and elevated risk that revealing his identity to the accused person will severely compromise his physical security and personal safety.  4.It should be recalled that the late Ahmed Hussein Suale, a star witness in this case, was assassinated in broad daylight in 2019. His assassination occurred on the same day that he had had engagements with the Attorney General’s office on his testimony against the accused person in above styled case.  5.Prior to his gruesome murder, the late Ahmed Suale had been threatened with death by Mr Kwesi Nyantakyi and had been the subject of callous media attacks for his role as a star witness in the case, culminating in the revealing of his identity on national television and social media by Mr Kennedy Agyapong, the MP for Assin-Central constituency.  6.As much as Anas is willing and ready to testify for the prosecution, doing so under the condition specified by the court, presents a clear and present danger to his security and safety, especially because of the issues chronicled above.  7.Under these circumstances, prudence requires that he declines the invitation to endanger his life and accordingly declines the invitation to reveal his identity to the accused person in the judges’ chamber or any other place.  ADVERTISEMENT  8.Tiger Eye endorses the position of Anas and states that it is proper and wise to err on the side of caution to avoid any potential attack on another of its investigators.  9.Tiger Eye’s position is further buttressed by the unrelenting, coordinated, and well-financed media and other campaigns by private and State actors to undermine its operations and the Anas principle, which stand in their way of amassing corruption and social injustice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bHNlLmNvbS5naC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ktd29udC10ZXN0aWZ5LWFnYWluc3QtbnlhbnRha3lpLWJlY2F1c2UtaW0tbm90LXByZXBhcmVkLXRvLXNob3ctaGltLW15LWZhY2UtYW5hcy92NTQya3h00gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB1bHNlLmNvbS5naC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2ktd29udC10ZXN0aWZ5LWFnYWluc3QtbnlhbnRha3lpLWJlY2F1c2UtaW0tbm90LXByZXBhcmVkLXRvLXNob3ctaGltLW15LWZhY2UtYW5hcy92NTQya3h0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interactive session with journalists, Mr Khan said, ""Today, a Punjab government delegation came to meet me, and they gave me eight names, who they said were wanted men."" Everyone in the PTI was currently wanted, he added.  ""The authorities have apprised me of conducting a search operation at Zaman Park's residence, but I have refused to do so. They can come as per permission given by the Lahore High Court (LHC),"" he maintained.  The LHC ordered to form a two-member government team comprising a lady police officer,and the PTI member to aid for the search operation, he said.  Mr Khan asked for evidence regarding his party's involvement in the May 9 violence, saying that if anyone from the PTI was involved, he will help [the police] catch them.  Read also: Police arrest PTI leader Imran Ismail in Karachi  But this is not the case, adding that this is being done to crush PTI,he said. How could they arrest 7,500 people, he questioned. ""There are videos of Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Yasmin Rashid asking people to be peaceful,"" he claimed.  Claiming the arrests of PTI leaders and workers were a crackdown against the PTI, Mr Khan added, ""This is not happening for the enforcement of law in the country. All this is happening to crush the party"".  He claimed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was isolated, Mr Khan said, “A political party or a leader becomes isolated when he does not have the support of the people"".  Mr Khan was of the view that the government would be charged under Article 6 for delaying the polls in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  Speaking about the Supreme Court (SC), Mr Khan claimed, ""Despite all the differences in the apex court, all judges agree on the point that elections should be held within 90 days"".  Believing that the government was ""petrified"" of elections, the deposed premier said, ""The PDM is afraid of holding elections because it lost the by-elections despite the support of stakeholders. Now it [PDM] is running away from the elections"".  ""The government is looking for ways to plan to bring me and the PTI into conflict with the army,"" Mr Khan maintained.  Earlier today, Mr Khan reiterated that he would not bow down to anyone.  Taking to Twitter, the deposed prime minister fired a fresh salvo at the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), saying, ""PTI and its supporters have been subjected to the worst crackdown and terror today"".  He said that the kind of demonstration that was taking place in the current regime did not happen even during the tenure of Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.  On Thursday, Mr Khan lambasted his political opponents and asked the nation to stand up for its rights.  Taking to Twitter, the ousted premier slammed the PDM, saying, ""A gang of thugs and criminals is dominating the country"".  He lamented, ""Amidst the deep economic woes and challenges faced by rising unemployment, the rulers are using their power to eliminate the country's leading political party through a fascist approach.""  - Embattled Imran vows to keep fighting -  PTI chief Imran Khan said he will keep fighting for the sake of“real freedom” even if he was left alone.  His statement came as prominent PTI leaders including former federal minister for national health services Aamer Mehmood Kiani and former federal minister for environment Malik Amin Aslam announced quitting the party citing the party’s involvement in May 9 attacks on “security installations” as reason, with others demanding Mr Khan to condemn the attacks openly.  At an interactive session with journalists at his Zaman Park residence, he said “Don’t you dare think that I’ll step back due to pressure”. If two assassination attempts had failed to push him back, he added, know that he would keep standing.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZHVueWFuZXdzLnR2L2luZGV4LnBocC9lbi9QYWtpc3Rhbi83MjUwOTItRW1iYXR0bGVkLUltcmFuLXNheXMtZWZmb3J0cy11bmRlcndheS10by0vLy8nY3J1c2gvLy8nLXBhcnR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Delivering a speech at the book launch of his title ""Centres of Power: My Years in the Prime Minister's Office and Security Council"" at India International Centre, New Delhi, the former career diplomat who had also served as Advisor to PM on Foreign Affairs from 1981-1986 said ""domestic reasons play a very significant role in international diplomacy"" while talking about New Delhi's stand on Gulf War.  Remembering his days at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) where he served as an advisor to both former PM Indira Gandhi and his son Rajiv Gandhi, Gharekhan said, ""Indira Gandhi was not a difficult person as it was shown. She was both kind and tough and always respected the opinions of the officials.""  ""But Rajiv Gandhi was different. His style of working was very different from his mother's. Rajiv Gandhi many a time was not very happy with IK Gujral's stand on several issues. He did not like when someone used to tell him that this is our policy which was decided by her mother, Indira Gandhi. He did not specifically like the term 'your mother', he further added.  Speaking on IK Gujral, Gharekhan said, ""When the Gulf War happened and Saddam invades Kuwait, IK Gujral was visiting Moscow, Iran and thought Saddam is India's friend. He thought Saddam could fight and win against the US and its allies. This was very embarrassing for us. And many of the officials at the MEA back then tried to sober him (IK Gujral) down. ""  Gharekhan, while talking about Indira Gandhi's assassination, pointed out that when the former PM was assassinated, ""there was no ambulance and that she was taken to the AIIMs in a private vehicle. At the hospital, there were no senior doctors to attend her and only junior doctors attended her. That was extremely terrifying and should not have happened.""  Gharekhan was sharing the dais with former Vice President Hamid Ansari, ex-Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, former Ambassador and External Affairs Minister K Natwar Singh and former Foreign Secretary M K Rasgotra who is 99 years of age.  While speaking during the launch of the book, Hamid Ansari said PM Indira Gandhi's main concern was China and she wanted that India should not remain unrealistic on China in the international arena. Quoting a few lines from the book, he said, ""PM Indira Gandhi did not share the same equation with the Soviet Union as her father Nehru used to do. She was trying to please the United Kingdom and was very keen to attend Prince Charles's wedding but got disappointed when she failed to attend it.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldHZiaGFyYXQuY29tL2VuZ2xpc2gvc3RhdGUvZGVsaGkvaW5kaWFzLXN0YW5kLW9uLWlyYXFzLWludmFzaW9uLW9mLWt1d2FpdC13YXMtZW1iYXJyYXNzaW5nLWV4LWVudm95LWdoYXJla2hhbi9uYTIwMjMwNTIwMTA1MTIwMDk1MDk1ODgw0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0dmJoYXJhdC5jb20vYW1wL2VuZ2xpc2gvc3RhdGUvZGVsaGkvaW5kaWFzLXN0YW5kLW9uLWlyYXFzLWludmFzaW9uLW9mLWt1d2FpdC13YXMtZW1iYXJyYXNzaW5nLWV4LWVudm95LWdoYXJla2hhbi9uYTIwMjMwNTIwMTA1MTIwMDk1MDk1ODgw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-03","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T20:06:00","First published by Common Dreams  The Pentagon said earlier this month, without providing evidence, that a U.S. drone strike in northwest Syria killed a “senior al-Qaeda leader.”  But U.S. military officials are now beginning to walk back the claim as the victim’s family insists the father of 10 had no connections to terrorist organizations and was herding his sheep when he was slain by a Hellfire missile on the morning of May 3.  Lotfi Hassan Misto, a 56-year-old former bricklayer, has been identified by his family as the victim of the drone strike, The Washington Post reported Thursday, citing interviews with the man’s brother, son, and several people who knew him.  “They described a kind, hard-working man whose ‘whole life was spent poor,'” the Post noted.  The operation that killed Misto, the Post reported, “was overseen by U.S. Central Command, which claimed hours after the strike, without citing evidence or naming a suspect, that the Predator drone strike had targeted a ‘senior al-Qaeda leader.’ But now there is doubt inside the Pentagon about who was killed.”  One unnamed U.S. military official told the newspaper that the Pentagon is “no longer confident” that the strike killed an al-Qaeda leader. Another official said that “though we believe the strike did not kill the original target, we believe the person to be al-Qaeda.”  The entire U.S. drone program, including the process by which officials choose their assassination targets, is shrouded in secrecy, and activists argue the program should be shuttered in its entirety.  Often described by the Pentagon as “precision” attacks, U.S. drone strikes have killed thousands of civilians in recent years—deaths that U.S. officials typically refuse to even acknowledge, let alone apologize for.  The Biden administration did apologize after killing 10 members of an Afghan family—including seven children—in a 2021 drone strike in Kabul, but the U.S. has yet to uphold its pledge to compensate the survivors. A U.S. Central Command report on the strike indicated that military officials knew the attack likely killed civilians but initially lied about it in public.  The aftermath of the May 3 drone strike in northwest Syria appears to be following a similar trajectory.  On the day of the deadly strike, the watchdog Airwars published an initial assessment noting that a “60-year-old male civilian was killed by a declared U.S. drone strike on the outskirts of Qurqaniya,” immediately disputing the Pentagon narrative.  Airwars pointed to a tweet from a Syrian journalist who said that contrary to CENTCOM’s statement, the man killed was a civilian with “no connection with any organization, neither now nor previously.”  Video footage given to the Post shows “a dozen people standing nearby” as aid workers arrived at the scene of the drone strike earlier this month, the newspaper reported.  “Most stare in shock,” the Post observed. “Some cry.”  Nearly a week after the strike, a CENTCOM spokesperson said the U.S. military was “aware of the allegations of a civilian casualty” and determining whether “further investigation is necessary and how it should proceed.”  Misto’s brother told the Associated Press at the time that the U.S. military’s claims that Misto had terrorist connections were “absolute lies,” decrying his killing as “an injustice and an aggression.”  “If they claim that he’s a terrorist, or that they got someone from al-Qaeda, they’re all liars,” Misto’s brother told the Post.  Analysts told the Post that the family’s insistence that Misto had no terrorist ties appears highly credible.  “Very quickly after this strike, the White Helmets came out and identified the individual with his name and his profession,” said Charles Lister, the director of Syria and Countering Terrorism and Extremism at the Middle East Institute.  “Locals came forward to say, this guy’s always been a farmer. He’s never had any political activities; he’s never had any affiliation with armed groups,” Lister added. “The pace and breadth of such pushback was actually quite unusual.”  Citing Jerome Drevon, a senior analyst on jihad and modern conflict with the International Crisis Group, the Post noted that “typically, when al-Qaeda leaders are killed, sympathizers announce their deaths online as a celebration of martyrdom.”  “If the victim was a lower-level member of the organization, groups may not announce their death, he said, but people close to them will, often saying how they were connected to the group,” the newspaper reported. “In this case, Drevon said ‘there was nothing.’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmx1eC5jb21tdW5pdHkvamFrZS1qb2huc29uLzIwMjMvMDUvYW1lcmljYW4tZHJvbmUtdGVycm9yaXNtLWtpbGxzLWZhdGhlci1vZi10ZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Tabatinga"", ""Amazonas"", ""Brazil""}","2023-05-20T03:09:50","Former Head of Brazil’s Indigenous Protection Agency Charged with Indirectly Contributing to Murders in the Amazon  The former head of Brazil’s Indigenous protection agency, Marcelo Xavier, has been charged with criminal acts of omission that indirectly led to the murders of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips in the Amazon last year. The federal police have accused Xavier of failing to take steps to protect Funai workers in the Amazon, which contributed to the crimes. Xavier was appointed by former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro in July 2019 and was removed from his position in December after Bolsonaro lost the presidential election to leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.  The accusation against Xavier is based on the legal concept of dolus eventualis, which refers to a person being aware of the risk of a crime taking place but failing to act to prevent it. Another senior Funai official, Alcir Amaral, was indicted on the same charges. Pereira worked for Funai until he was removed from his post in late 2019, two weeks after he helped lead an operation targeting illegal miners in the remote Javari Valley region where he and Phillips were killed. At around the same time, one of Pereira’s Funai colleagues, Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, was shot dead in the city of Tabatinga. After that still unsolved assassination, Xavier was reportedly warned of the risk of further violence in the region but failed to act.  Pereira and Phillips were killed on 5 June 2022 after coming under attack while travelling down the Amazon after a four-day reporting trip looking at the situation facing Indigenous communities in the Javari region. Their bodies were found after a 10-day, Indigenous-led search. Xavier sparked fury in the days that followed the men’s disappearance, wrongly insinuating that Phillips and Pereira had entered an Indigenous territory without government permission. A judge later ruled that the two men never entered Indigenous lands, conducting interviews outside the borders of the Portugal-sized territory.  Neither Xavier nor Amaral made any immediate comment about the accusations. Writing on Twitter last August, Xavier claimed the murders were being manipulated by leftist opponents of Bolsonaro’s government. Prominent left-wing politicians and Indigenous activists welcomed reports of the charges against Xavier. The leftist lawmaker Guilherme Boulos denounced the former government’s “criminal omission”. “Under Bolsonaro’s command, Funai was warned of the risks Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were running and did nothing!” Boulos wrote.  Since Lula took office in January, Funai has undergone a radical shake-up. It is now run by the Indigenous activist and politician Joênia Wapichana, while a ministry for Indigenous peoples has also been created under the leadership of another prominent Indigenous politician, Sônia Guajajara. In an interview with The Guardian last year, the former Funai chief Sydney Possuelo said Bolsonaro’s anti-Indigenous actions meant “Indigenous people have never faced a worst moment in Brazilian history… because we are talking about a deliberate policy that comes from the president himself who gives cover to criminals and trespassers”. Possuelo accused Bolsonaro of turning Funai into an “anti-Indigenous agency”, adding: “In the Bolsonaro era, everything has become so dangerous because you have a pre-planned policy that stems from the presidency and spills out into every single other government institution.”  Three fishers are being held in high-security prisons while a judge prepares to rule on whether they will face trial by jury: two brothers called Amarildo and Oseney da Costa de Oliveira and a third man called Jefferson da Silva Lima. A fourth man, a shadowy figure suspected of running an illegal fishing network in the Javari Valley region, was named as the mastermind in January, although he has yet to be formally charged.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iYWx2aWxsYWdlc3BhY2UuY29tL3VrL2Zvcm1lci1oZWFkLW9mLWJyYXppbHMtaW5kaWdlbm91cy1hZ2VuY3ktY2hhcmdlZC1mb3ItYnJ1bm8tcGVyZWlyYS1hbmQtZG9tLXBoaWxsaXBzLW11cmRlcnMv0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHZpbGxhZ2VzcGFjZS5jb20vdWsvZm9ybWVyLWhlYWQtb2YtYnJhemlscy1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLWFnZW5jeS1jaGFyZ2VkLWZvci1icnVuby1wZXJlaXJhLWFuZC1kb20tcGhpbGxpcHMtbXVyZGVycy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1990-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T09:28:56","On May 21, 1990, at around 10:00 am, two visitors arrived at Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq’s residence in Nageen. Simultaneously, three young individuals, aged 18 to 25, claimed to have a scheduled appointment and gained entry after the initial visitors left. Molvi Farooq’s secretary, Syed Rahman Shamas, and another security guard, Mohammad Maqbool, were present in a separate room. The young individuals spent 15 to 20 minutes with Molvi Farooq before he was shot with a 7.65 pistol, sustaining severe injuries to his head, shoulders, and abdomen.  Due to the severity of his condition, Molvi Farooq was immediately transferred to SKIMS Hospital in Soura. Medical professionals performed surgery, but unfortunately, he succumbed to his gunshot wounds at 12:25 pm.  In a momentous news conference on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, the Jammu and Kashmir Police delivered a breakthrough in the long-standing case of Molvi Farooq’s assassination. After 32 years, the two elusive terrorists responsible for the murder were finally captured.  Since that fateful day on May 21, 1990, these terrorists had evaded capture by hiding in different countries like Nepal and Pakistan. But their days on the run came to an end when they returned to Kashmir a few years ago. The terrorists, identified as Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and Javaid Ahmad Bhat, known as Ajmal Khan and Bilal, were finally brought to justice. Out of the total five terrorists involved in this heinous act, Abdullah Bangroo and Rahman Shigan met their deserved fate earlier during encounters with security forces in the 1990s. The wheels of justice continue to turn, leaving no room for these terrorists to escape the consequences of their actions.  Throughout the years, a deliberate narrative perpetuated by Pakistan’s ISI, their paid secessionists, intellectuals, and self-proclaimed champions of civil liberties has sought to conceal the truth surrounding the killers of Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq. Instead of openly acknowledging that the murderers were terrorists, armed and financially supported by our neighbouring country Pakistan, they cunningly labelled them as “unknown gunmen.” This was a calculated deception aimed to manipulate the world and the people of Kashmir into believing that it was the Indian state responsible for Molvi Farooq’s murder, rather than the terrorists sponsored by Pakistan. The truth, however, remains resolute: Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq was ruthlessly murdered by terrorists aligned with pro-Pakistani terrorist groups like Hizbul Mujahideen and Hizbula. These terrorist organisations branded him as an Indian agent due to his participation in a purported political process aimed at achieving peace with the Indian government. Blinded by their warped ideology, the Pakistani-sponsored terrorists callously executed him, silencing a voice advocating for dialogue and reconciliation. It is imperative to recognise the malevolent forces at play, orchestrating acts of terror to fuel separatism and undermine peace in the region.  Pakistan’s reprehensible actions knew no bounds, as they even targeted the funeral procession of Molvi Farooq. Infiltrating a procession of 20,000 to 25,000 mourners from Soura, terrorists orchestrated a meticulously planned assault. As the funeral procession made its way towards Rajouri Kadal, it was intercepted by the CRPF forces near Islamia College in Hawal. What ensued was a nightmarish display of violence, carefully engineered by the terrorists. They instigated confusion and chaos, hurling stones at the CRPF personnel, while armed terrorists within the procession unleashed a hail of gunfire from AK-47 rifles, attacking the CRPF picket at Hawal. This horrific incident resulted in the loss of over 60 innocent civilian lives, with more than 200 individuals sustaining grave injuries due to the crossfire. The event, now known as the deadliest massacre in Kashmir, was a calculated scheme masterminded by Pakistan.  The truth, however, was twisted and distorted, as people were falsely led to believe that the Indian state was responsible for the assassination of Molvi Farooq and intentionally carried out a massacre during his funeral procession. The reality is far more sinister and implicates Pakistan in orchestrating this heinous act, aiming to instigate unrest and manipulate public sentiment. The consequences were dire, as a perpetual cycle of hate and warfare against India engulfed the Kashmiri region. Molvi Farooq’s assassination served as a catalyst, but it was only the beginning. Pakistani-backed terrorists orchestrated countless political and civilian killings, plunging the situation into deeper despair.  On April 1, 1993, Dr Abdul Ahad Guru, a pioneering Kashmiri cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon, fell victim to a merciless terrorist attack. And on June 19, 1994, Qazi Nissar, a revered religious scholar and educator, met a similar fate. These were just a few examples of the countless lives ruthlessly snuffed out by terrorists supported by Pakistan. Yet, the entire secessionist and pro-Pakistani ecosystem propagated a twisted narrative. The killers were not mere unknown gunmen, but ruthless terrorists. Yet, a web of deceit was cunningly woven to sow confusion and falsely paint India as the culprit. The aftermath of such deceitful narratives was nothing short of catastrophic. The youth, deceived by false information, took up arms and waged a misguided war against their own country. Grave after grave was dug, as innocent lives were sacrificed for a hollow and fabricated cause.  Three decades have passed, and justice continues to elude the victims of countless killings. Among them are the brutal murders of Kashmiri Pandits, including KL Ganju, his wife Serwanand Kaul Premi, Mahant Keshav Nath, Tika Lal Taploo, NK Ganju, Prem Nath Bhat, Ajay Kapoor, and many others. These innocent lives were tragically snuffed out by terrorists like the JKLF Chief Yasin Malik, yet their quest for justice remains unfulfilled.  In the face of overwhelming evidence, the truth was callously sacrificed, and a false narrative persisted. Blame was unjustly shifted onto former Governor Jagmohan for the exodus and killings of Kashmiri Pandits. However, the reality is starkly different.  The long-awaited arrest of the killers of Molvi Farooq after an agonising 32 years sends a resounding message: The Indian state possesses unwavering political will, superiority, and the necessary resources to apprehend the terrorists sponsored by Pakistan. This monumental achievement serves as a firm declaration from the authorities that Jammu and Kashmir will no longer be left vulnerable to the machinations of subversionists, terrorists, and fundamentalists.  The impact of such breakthroughs reverberates across the public sphere, leaving an indelible imprint on the collective consciousness. It has become undeniably clear that terrorists can no longer evade the consequences of their monstrous crimes. Moreover, those who have actively or passively participated in these acts of terror will not escape scrutiny.  The writer is a Srinagar-based Journalist and columnist.

"assassination","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:20:14","May 17, 2023 By Michael Weymouth  As gun violence continues unabated in our country, it has become clear that the Republican Party has no intention of doing anything about it, short of offering thoughts and prayers to the victims’ families. That and a plethora of useless bromides such as “the only thing to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”  The roots of the modern gun debate go back to the 1963, Kennedy assassination, when Democratic senator Thomas Dodd from Connecticut introduced legislation restricting the sale of mail order rifles. Shortly thereafter President Lyndon Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, and in 1994 President Bill Clinton signed the Assault Weapons Ban, which lasted ten years. It was allowed to expire under President George W. Bush. As a result, 20 million assault weapons are now in the hands of American gun owners.  It is clear that the Democratic Party has done its best to limit the sales of assault weapons, as well as to legislate common sense gun laws, while the Republican Party has done nothing but oppose them.  It hasn’t always been this way.  In fact, two of the icons of the Republican Party actually held opinions about gun control that were diametrically opposed to positions held by today’s Republican Party.  Chief Justice Warren Burger, a Nixon SCOTUS appointee said of the Second amendment, “The gun lobby’s interpretation of the Second Amendment is one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American people by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime. The real purpose of the Second Amendment was to ensure that state armies-the militia-would be maintained for the defense of the state. The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon he or she desires.”  One can hardly imagine that opinion coming from today’s Supreme Court, which has adhered to a much narrower interpretation of the Second Amendment. Compare the Court’s recent ruling that allowed New York citizens to openly carry guns, to comments made by President Ronald Reagan in 1967: “There is absolutely no reason why out on the street today a civilian should be carrying a loaded weapon.”  Burger’s and Reagan’s comments beg the question: what happened to the Republican Party?  The answer is the NRA and its 5 million members, most of whom vote solid Republican, and, as Burger pointed out, the gun industry’s lobby, which contributes millions of dollars to Republican politicians each year. The result is a constant Republican drumbeat that Democrats want to take away all guns. This is total hogwash.  In the meantime, American children fear going to school and their parents fear they will never see them again as their kids board the school bus in the morning.  Today’s Republican Party has a lot to answer for and hopefully they will wake up to the damage they have done by failing to deal with this important issue. A good start will be for every American voter to condition his or her vote on how committed a candidate is to revisiting the Second Amendment and how it might be amended to better serve and protect the American people.  There should be no greater motivation than the fact that there have already been 202 mass shootings in 2023, more than one a day.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmdoYW1hbmNob3IuY29tL29waW5pb24tdGhlLXNlY29uZC1hbWVuZG1lbnQtZnJhdWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

There was no immediate U.S. response to the allegations from Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council, which is chaired by Putin. Washington has previously denied involvement in at least one of the killings he mentioned.  Putin has accused the West of unleashing a proxy war aimed at toppling him and carving up Russia's vast natural resources following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, something Moscow calls ""a special military operation"".  A series of showcase attacks and mysterious assassinations inside Russia, far from the front lines in Ukraine, have raised concerns over domestic security, even more so after a drone attack on the Kremlin itself.  Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent Russian nationalist, was killed in a car bomb in August; pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, was killed in a bomb last month; and nationalist writer, Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bomb earlier this month.  Russia also accused Ukraine of attacking the Crimean Bridge last October and accused the West of being behind blasts on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September.  Patrushev was cited by the state TASS news agency as saying all the attacks ""were planned and carried out with the coordination of the U.S. special services"".  ""The terrorist attacks committed in Russia are accompanied by an information campaign prepared in advance in Washington and London, designed to destabilise the socio-political situation, and to undermine the constitutional foundations and sovereignty of Russia,"" TASS quoted Patrushev as saying.  Story continues  The United States and its allies, who cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab, say they want Ukraine to defeat Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power.  The State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Patrushev's remarks.  U.S. intelligence agencies believe parts of the Ukrainian government authorised the attack that killed Dugina, the New York Times reported in October.  'RISK RISING'  Although President Joe Biden has warned that a direct military confrontation between the NATO military alliance and Russia would trigger World War Three, the Kremlin says the West is already fighting against Russia.  The United States and Britain have denied Russian claims they were involved in the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines. Ukraine has never claimed responsibility for the attack on the Crimean Bridge.  Washington said earlier this month it was a lie that the United States was behind the drone attack on the Kremlin.  As a former Soviet spy who has known Putin since the 1970s, Patrushev - who has accused the ""Anglo-Saxons"" of sabotaging Nord Stream in what he has called a terrorist attack - is seen by Western diplomats as having a major influence on the Russian leader.  Patrushev's pronouncements give an insight into thinking at the Kremlin's top levels, they say.  ""The risks of terrorist acts, including the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, at critical and potentially dangerous facilities have increased significantly,"" Patrushev said.  He said Ukrainian saboteurs within Russia were likely planning further attacks.

The article had listed Chicago-based blogger Jeffrey Camras, as the author, who is described in the bio as a person with a “deep love for the Jewish people and the state of Israel”.  “In order to right a wrong, in order to make peace and move forward, Palestine must be obliterated,” Camras wrote, adding, “It is an affront to society, morality, humanity. It represents lies and antisemitism, oppression and terror. Nothing more.”  He also wrote,  “No one cares about the Palestinians. Care for them solely exists in the form of Anti-Israel advocacy, NOT Pro-Palestinian support. “Israel (and you the reader) needs to put its faith in the Torah and Hashem in order fulfill our destiny. Establish sovereignty over Har HaBayit. Do this today! .. Conquer remaining biblical lands in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. Do this diplomatically or militarily.”  In a previous article – still on the Times of Israel page – entitled “A Halachic Solution Is a Diplomatic Solution”, also published in The Times of Israel blogs section, on April 18, Camras wrote: “To change the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we must transform the conflict from a national one to a religious one.”  The latest article was published on Thursday afternoon, around the same time that thousands of Israeli Jewish extremists took part in a provocative parade in the occupied Palestinian city of East Jerusalem, chanting racist slogans such as ‘death to the Arabs.’  It was unclear when the article was removed from the website, but according to the version of the piece accessed by the Palestine Chronicle in the digital library Internet Archive, the entry was posted on Thursday, May 18, at 3:32 PM.  Some Israeli officials and parliamentarians took part in the so-called ‘Flag March’, including far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Israeli Minister Yisrael Katz.  In his speech at the rally, Katz called for the assassination of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.  “Yahya Sinwar should also know that if he dares to do so (meaning targeting the march), his fate will be the same as his friends in Islamic Jihad,” a reference to the assassinations carried out by Israel during its latest bombardment on Gaza.  Meanwhile, the US State Department condemned the “outrageous and unacceptable” violence and racism displayed at the Israeli Flag March.

According to transcripts obtained by and reported on The Mercury News, Becker allegedly admitted to fellow Councilmember Suds Jain that he leaked the grand jury report, titled ""Unsportsmanlike Conduct."" The report was highly critical of Becker and several other councilmembers, accusing them of voting in favor of the interests of the San Francisco 49ers who have had well-document tensions with the city over Levi's Stadium.  While Becker has maintained his innocence and pled not guilty to leaking the report per an article from The Mercury News earlier this month, testimony from campaign volunteer David Andre suggests Becker was, in fact the leaker and had also attempted to blame Mayor Lisa Gillmor for distributing the documents. The councilmember allegedly even showed up at Andre's doorstep on the day his phones and computers were seized by the district attorney's office, leaving the volunteer ""nervous"" and ""disturbed,"" per today's The Mercury News story.  As reported by ABC7 News, the indictment has fueled controversy in Santa Clara, with Mayor Gillmor and some residents calling for Becker's resignation. Several council colleagues, however, have defended him and are advocating for letting the legal process play out.  Meanwhile, questions remain around the extent of the 49ers' influence in the city. The team provided millions of dollars into Becker's mayoral race and other local elections, according to a San José Spotlight piece on the topic. Santa Clara Vice Mayor Kevin Park referred to the situation as a ""political assassination"" and called for an independent review and potential involvement from the state Attorney General.  The grand jury report, a 61-page document, accused five councilmembers, including Becker, of unethical ties to the 49ers and for putting the team's interests above those of the city. It was leaked to several media outlets in October 2022, before its official release. Falling in line with the alleged setup orchestrated by Becker, sources in the San José Spotlight's report claimed that Mayor Gillmor forwarded a copy of the confidential report to her private email account, which at the time raised questions about her involvement in the leak and the possibility that she shared the report with others. It is unclear whether the sources were in fact the framing now coming to light.  Moreover, the Santa Clara Police Officers' Association played a significant role in the events, as it had launched a website containing excerpts from the grand jury report and started a social media campaign against Becker. The association had spent tens of thousands of dollars to support Mayor Gillmor's re-election campaign.  In light of these developments, Councilmember Becker's case has taken on new dimensions, adding further twists to an already complex legal and political drama. While the outcome of the case remains uncertain, the impact on Santa Clara's politics is undeniable, as the city grapples with the powerful influence of the 49ers and the potential for further political turbulence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vaG9vZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc2FudGEtY2xhcmEtY291bmNpbG1hbi1hZG1pdHMtbGVha2luZy1hdHRlbXB0aW5nLXRvLWZyYW1lLW1heW9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2019-07-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T10:40:04","Haiti is a failed state that continues its descent into violence, anarchy and humanitarian disaster. Bishop Dumas reflects on the UN's appeal to the international community to launch a multi-lateral mission to help the people respond to escalating gang violence.  By Jean-Charles Putzolu and Linda Bordoni  Widespread gang violence has plagued Haiti for nearly two years as rival gangs battle for control in the power vacuum created by the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenal Moise.  Prime Minister Ariel Henry’s attempts to chart a political transition for the poor Caribbean Island nation have failed and widespread gang violence impedes access to healthcare, has closed schools and worsened food insecurity. Haitians are taking the law into their own hands and a wave of vigilantism is heightening the country’s already sky-rocketing levels of violence.  The situation is such that the United Nations is pushing for an international force to be sent to Haiti to respond to the violence.  Haitian Bishop Pierre-André Dumas of Anse-à-Veau spoke to Vatican Radio about the critical situation and about how the Church is struggling to support and reassure the people.  As violence affects all sectors of society, Bishop Dumas said, “at the level of the local Church, at the level of my diocese, we try to be among the people and to reassure them that violence will not have the last word.”  “We also work to ensure that there are many places for listening, sharing and dialogue so that people may regain confidence,” he said.  Gang violence  Regarding the widespread levels of violence in certain neighbourhoods or lawless areas, the Bishop explained that even children and very young people are forced to join criminal street gangs. However, he added the population is starting to react.  “Gang members are becoming afraid and it is said that insecurity has changed sides,” he said, adding that it is crucial that chaos and anarchy be curbed.  “I believe that the police, as such, have a very important role to play, so that people are able to regain confidence and to show that the State exists and is organised,” the Bishop said.  Meanwhile, he added “On our part, our advocacy aims to help people to welcome the other as a brother, to make sure that fraternity is really lived. But above all, we must not take the law into our own hands.”  Asked how families can try and protect their children and prevent them from being recruited into street gangs, Bishop Dumas said it is necessary to start from the beginning.  A man carries his son as they search for cover amid gang violence in Port-au-Prince  The consequences of poverty  “We have reached this point because for a long time, we have seen children abandoned in the streets, children left to themselves, to their own devices, without a family,” he said that all too often “extreme poverty has pushed families to abandon their children.”  It is these children, he continued, who have been given weapons by politicians.  “These young people have taken up arms, they have grown up and they are moving away from these politicians, thinking that they can earn money on their own. So they kidnap and hold people for ransom, and to get paid they use a lot of violence. Sometimes they torture people,” he explained.  What is needed, he said, is to reinforce family values, create jobs for young people, and promote integral human development for the country.  A makeshift refugee camp set up by residents escaping gang violence in Port-au-Prince  Regarding the authorities’ lack of capacity to fight the street-gang phenomenon, Bishop Dumas said that Haiti has been in an extremely delicate political situation for a long time.  “There was no stability and the whole dynamic of the tourism sector broke down,” he said.  We are at a time, he added, that the Haitian people need accompaniment, not decisions that come from outside, but solutions that come from within.  “The people must assume responsibility, become protagonists of their own history and accept to pave the way for future generations. Every time a solution is imposed from elsewhere, it lasts a few years and then we end up back where we started,” he said.  “Every time a solution is imposed from elsewhere, it lasts a few years and then we end up back where we started.”  The right kind of support  This appears to be in contraposition to the UN proposal that an international intervention force be sent into Haiti. Bishop Dumas reiterated his opinion that Haiti must be “accompanied” with the right kind of support.  The UN Secretary-General, he noted, has been asking for this intervention for a long time, and the international community is aware that Haiti will not be able to find a solution alone.  “At the same time, not just any kind of intervention is possible. We really need to support, consolidate, professionalise and reform the police, and make them much more effective and efficient,” he said.  I believe, he added, that we have reached a point where we really have to take action: “It’s not for me to say yes or no to an international force, but I think we have the right to accompany the population in a concrete way, to help them find solutions and to ensure that nations agree to find a way out and help Haiti to get back on its feet, to stabilise, to take charge and, at the same time, to help the people regain the dignity it once had; a people who helped the world put an end to the atrocity of slavery.”  “Help the people regain their dignity.”  The desperation of Haitians displaced by gang violence","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhdGljYW5uZXdzLnZhL2VuL2NodXJjaC9uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDUvaGFpdGktYmlzaG9wLWR1bWFzLXZpb2xlbmNlLXVuLWludGVydmVudGlvbi1pbnRlcnZpZXctcG92ZXJ0eS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T14:01:23","When San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins announced that her office would not file charges against security guard Michael Earl-Wayne Anthony after he shot and killed Banko Brown at a Downtown Walgreens, part of her reasoning rested on the strength of Anthony’s potential self-defense case.  “In a self-defense case, the defendant would likely be able to use [Brown’s] past record,” said the District Attorney’s Office in an analysis of the case that led to the controversial decision not to charge Anthony. Usually, such evidence can be countered by similar evidence of violence in the defendant’s past, but that is not the case for Anthony, according to the analysis.  In Brown’s case, the DA’s report was alluding to criminal history that includes a 2019 guilty plea Brown entered for felony robbery after stealing from another Walgreens, on Mission Street, according to newly reviewed documents obtained by The Standard.  Brown had two prior second-degree robbery convictions, court records show. On Dec. 19, 2016, Brown—who was then 17 years old—was convicted as a juvenile and sentenced to state prison for that offense. It's unclear how many years Brown was sentenced to.  Then Brown was arrested on March 27, 2019, and charged again with second-degree robbery. He pleaded guilty in that second offense to stealing makeup from the Walgreens at 2690 Mission St.  Second-degree robbery is essentially shoplifting with physical contact, such as what occurred before Anthony shot Brown, say legal experts.  Brown was ordered to stay away from both the store and the security guard who witnessed the crime, Elias Omba Mulembo.  Brown was on probation until July 11, 2022, soon after which he was arrested twice: once for false imprisonment on Aug. 12, 2022, and once for domestic battery on Aug. 4 of the same year. Both cases were dismissed under Jenkins.  Despite the district attorney’s reliance on Brown’s prior convictions, several legal experts said that this history would likely have played little role in a prosecution against Anthony.  “I think those are details that favor the guard, but I don’t think they’re defining,” Tony Brass, a former San Francisco assistant district attorney, said of Brown’s past convictions.  Even if the guard had known of those convictions before the fatal shooting, it is unlikely that would have helped in his defense, Brass said.  A memorial is set up for 24-year-old Banko Brown outside of a Downtown San Francisco Walgreens where a vigil was held for him on May 1. Brown was shot and killed by an armed security guard at the 825 Market St. location of Walgreens on April 27. | Morgan Ellis/The Standard  Attorney John Burris, who is representing Brown’s family in a civil suit, agreed, saying that Brown’s past cases should have no bearing on why the DA did not pursue charges against Anthony.  “I don’t think those prior cases in and of themselves would justify using deadly force,” he said. “If you use that as a basis not to charge, that's a character assassination.”  The only reason past cases would be admissible is if Anthony had prior knowledge of those cases, Burris said.  Brown was shot and killed by Anthony on April 27 after trying to leave a Walgreens in Downtown San Francisco with several items he allegedly stole. Video shows Anthony stopped Brown and the two briefly fought before separating. Brown then left the store and turned to face Anthony, who shot him once. Anthony later told police he feared for his life because Brown had threatened to stab him.  No weapon was found on Brown, a Black trans man, whose death protesters say sends a message that LGBTQ+ people are not safe in San Francisco.  Anthony, who is also Black, had not brought his baton to work that day and does not own pepper spray or a taser, according to the interview he gave police after the shooting.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3Nmc3RhbmRhcmQuY29tL2NyaW1pbmFsLWp1c3RpY2UvYmFua28tYnJvd24ta2lsbGluZy13aGF0LXJvbGUtZGlkLWhpcy1wYXN0LXJ1bi1pbnMtd2l0aC13YWxncmVlbnMtc2VjdXJpdHktcGxheS1pbi1kYXMtZGVjaXNpb24tbm90LXRvLWNoYXJnZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, this is false: a voiceover in the clip, which shows images of both countries’ leaders, discusses the deteriorating relations between the neighbours. It also features an audio translation of an article by international media exploring whether Ethiopia and Eritrea could be drawn into a war in Sudan.  The post has been shared more than 150 times since it was published on May 11, 2023.  “War broke out between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Shabia left Humera. A Prosperity Party leader has been assassinated,” it says.  “This news item is for May 8, 2023. You can watch our full report on our Habesha Broadcast YouTube channel,” adds the post, which includes a 60-minute video.  Screenshot of the false post, taken on May 16, 2023  Shabia is an informal name for the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF). The armed group fought for the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia until the former broke away in 1991.  Humera is a town in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, which borders Eritrea and Sudan. The town was heavily affected by the recent war in northern Ethiopia.  Souring relations  Ethiopia and Eritrea renewed their relations (archived here) in 2018, ending decades of conflict over a border dispute.  Eritrea also fought alongside the Ethiopian army against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in a devastating two-year war that ended after the warring parties agreed to a peace deal (archived here) in November 2022.  However, international experts warn Eritrea could undermine the peace deal to push its own interests, while tensions have also been on the rise between its leader, Isaias Afwerki, and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed (archived here).  However, the video doesn't contain any content showing clashes between Ethiopia and Eritrea in May 2023.  No footage  The video features a female narrator who discusses various issues related to Ethiopian politics.  In the first eight minutes, she introduces a post written by an Ethiopian activist called Girma Kassa and then proceeds to read it.  Story continues  Using a keyword search for “Girma Kassa” on Facebook, AFP Fact Check found the post was published on Facebook on May 8, 2023. The headline in Amharic translates to “News of a war in the Amhara region”.  It claims an armed conflict had broken out between local militia and government forces in Ethiopia’s northern Amhara region.  The voiceover continues, saying: “There has been fierce fighting between Amhara popular forces and forces loyal to Abiy and Berhanu Jula in North Shoa, Ataye and surrounding areas earlier today.”  The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission reported (archive here) on May 4, 2023 that clashes occurred between federal government forces and local armed groups in multiple places in the Amhara region.  Unrest had started in early April when the Ethiopian federal government decided to disband armed regional forces.  The Facebook video also features a news report which asks whether Ethiopia and Eritrea could be dragged into the war in Sudan, which broke out in April 2023.  A search for the keywords “The role of Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Sudanese war” led to an Al Jazeera article published on May 6, 2023 (archived here).  The narrator reads part of the article while also opining about the roles of Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Sudanese war.  The narrator then jumps to another news item about the alleged assassination of a member of the ruling Prosperity Party in Ethiopia’s Afar region. The party issued a statement on its official Facebook page on May 7, 2023 about the killing of a regional official by unidentified armed men (archived here).

The recent statements made by the Minister of the Environment, Miguel Ceara Hatton, regarding the “cleaning” of approximately 600 employees in the entity, do not align with the payroll records available until March, as the transparency portal does not provide the most up-to-date information.  In June 2022, the ministry had three payrolls (fixed, temporary, military), totaling 4,610 employees, with a total expenditure of RD$25,604,622. Less than a year later, in March 2023, under the leadership of a new minister, the number of employees decreased to 4,438, but the amount of money allocated for their payment increased to RD$31,379,334. Therefore, when comparing the numbers, the employee count decreased by 172 individuals from June to March, while the amount of money allocated for payments increased by RD$5,774,712.  Additionally, the Ministry of the Environment’s transparency portal showed two additional payrolls in March compared to June, labeled as “Substitute Personnel” and “Interim Personnel.” In response to the minister’s comments, journalist Guillermo Gómez refuted the claims made by Ceara Hatton, who mentioned the discovery of a journalist managing a payroll exceeding one million pesos upon his arrival.

In the months immediately following the issue of the field orders, approximately 40,000 former slaves settled in the area designated by Sherman on the basis of possessory title. 3 10,000 of these former slaves were settled on Edisto Island, South Carolina. 4 In 1866, following Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson effectively rescinded Field Order 15 by ordering these lands be returned to their previous Confederate owners. Former slaves were given the option to work for their former masters as sharecroppers or be evicted. If evicted, former slaves could be arrested for homelessness under vagrancy clauses of the Black Codes. Those who refused to leave and refused to sign sharecrop contracts were threatened with arrest. Although restoration of the land to the previous Confederate owners was slowed in some cases by court challenges filed by ex-slaves, nearly all the land settled was returned by the 1870s. As Eric Foner writes, “Johnson had in effect abrogated the Confiscation Act and unilaterally amended the law creating the [Freedmen’s] Bureau. The idea of a Freedmen’s Bureau actively promoting black landownership had come to an abrupt end.” 5 The Freedmen’s Bureau agents became primary proponents of labor contracts inducting former slaves into the sharecropping system. 6 Among the lands that were repossessed in 1866 by former Confederate owners was the Maxcy Place plantation. “A group of freed people were at Maxcy Place in January 1866. . . . The people contracted to work for the proprietor, but no contract or list of names has been found.” 7 The one-acre piece of land at 8060 Maxie Road, Edisto Island, South Carolina, was part of the Maxcy Place plantation. This land was purchased at market value on August 6, 2018, by 8060 Maxie Road, Inc., a nonprofit company formed for the sole purpose of buying this land and recording a restrictive covenant on its use. This covenant has as its explicit purpose the restriction of all development and use of the property by the owner. The property is now appraised at $0. By rendering it legally unusable, this restrictive covenant eliminates the market value of the land. These restrictions run with the land, regardless of the owner. As such, they will last indefinitely. As reparation, this covenant asks how land might exist outside of the legal-economic regime of property that was instituted by slavery and colonization. Rather than redistributing the property, the restriction imposed on 8060 Maxie Road’s status as valuable and transactable real estate asserts antagonism to the regime of property as a means of reparation. 8060 Maxie Road is not for visitation. 1 Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877, updated ed.

Cameron Rowland, an acclaimed artist known for conceptual projects involving bureaucratic structures, ready-made objects, and more, has found an institutional home—for now, at least—for one of their biggest projects to date.  In its most basic form, the work, Depreciation (2018), constitutes an acre of land on Edisto Island, South Carolina, that is now being placed on extended loan to the Dia Art Foundation, which is known for its deep holdings of Minimalist and Conceptualist art. But like many other Rowland pieces, this one unfolds a complex history dealing with structural racism, land ownership, and power.  Edisto Island is one of the many South Carolina landmasses that were set aside for freed enslaved people on January 16, 1865 as part of a policy more familiarly known as “40 acres and a mule.” Contemporary historians have regarded the policy as an effort to stave off the possibility of a revolt by the formerly enslaved.  Some 10,000 subsequently people settled on Edisto Island, but their situation did not last long. In 1866, after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson revoked the policy more formally known as Field Order 15, leaving the door open for Confederate owners to repossess their land, including the site of the Maxcy Plantation, which occupied Rowland’s one-acre spot and some of the surrounding area.  Rowland’s piece of land, 8060 Maxie Road, was purchased by a similarly titled nonprofit. It has now been placed under a restrictive covenant, which allows for the control of how the land is used. According to their description for the work, 8060 Maxie Road is now valued at $0, and the public cannot visit it.  The project is in keeping with past works by Rowland, who is currently the subject of a show at the MMK Frankfurt in Germany. For one particularly memorable show at New York’s Artists Space in 2016, for example, they sourced furniture produced by Corcraft, a company that relies upon the labor of inmates to produce its goods, and re-presented them at Artists Space, along with related documentation.  Often, Rowland’s work is not available for acquisition by institutions, bucking the traditional mode by which art enters museum collections. Instead, they make their pieces available on loan, typically with stipulations that are disclosed to the general public. Depreciation is listed as being on “extended loan” to the Dia Art Foundation.  Though the land itself is not viewable, Dia promised to exhibit framed documents related to Depreciation at its Chelsea gallery.  “Dia’s stewardship of Depreciation continues our founding mission of forging sustained collaborations with artists to ensure the legacy of their work that, physically or conceptually, is often beyond the scope and scale of the conventional museum or gallery model,” director Jessica Morgan said in a statement. “While many of the other works that make up our constellation of locations and sites engage the physical encounter between the viewer, the work, and their surroundings, Depreciation instead probes the idea of site in an entirely different manner.”  For many years, Dia’s galleries have been filled predominantly by works by white men—the Richard Serras and Michael Heizers of the world. Morgan has stated that one of her goals is to change that, a project of which the loan of Depreciation appears to be a part.  Rowland will have a 2024 solo show with new work at Dia:Beacon. It will be organized by Dia curator Jordan Carter, who said in a statement with Matilde Guidelli-Guidi that Depreciation “critically shifts Land art’s terms of engagement and proposes new urgencies, stakes, and possibilities within the institution and the field.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvY2FtZXJvbi1yb3dsYW5kLWRpYS1hcnQtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1lZGlzdG8taXNsYW5kLWRlcHJlY2lhdGlvbi0xMjM0NjY5MTEzL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvY2FtZXJvbi1yb3dsYW5kLWRpYS1hcnQtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1lZGlzdG8taXNsYW5kLWRlcHJlY2lhdGlvbi0xMjM0NjY5MTEzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

U.S. Magistrate Judge David Hennessy said Jack Teixeira had ""breached his obligation"" to protect U.S. national security information.  Jack Teixeira has his second pre-trial release hearing in a federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts.  During the first hearing a month ago, his attorneys argued that other people accused under the Espionage Act have received bail and assured the judge that Teixeira wouldn't try to leave the country.  However, prosecutors used Teixeira’s online messages to suggest he was a threat to others.  In one post, he said he would ""kill a lot of people"" to ""cull the weak.""  This comes on the heels of a Justice Department filing that said Teixeira had been warned about mishandling classified information months before his April arrest.  According to internal memos filed in court, prosecutors said that the 21-year-old had received instructions in September to stop observing and taking notes on classified intelligence information. Despite this warning, he was cautioned once more in October. In February, Teixeira was apprehended once again for accessing information that the memo stated was ""not related to his primary duty and was related to the intelligence field,"" the Associated Press reported.

"assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Manhattan"", ""Kansas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T12:09:00","They nearly died! They made the whole thing up! The royal family was trying to Diana them! They’re incorrigible attention-seekers who exaggerated to try and get British taxpayers to pay for their security costs!  Public reaction to news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the duchess’s mother had been in a “near catastrophic” car chase with paparazzi in New York on Tuesday evening has been divided, to say the least. Some people seem to think that the severity of the incident has been inflated in an effort to drum up sympathetic PR for the Sussexes, at a time when they’re mired in several lawsuits about their privacy and security. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly, for example, accused the pair of “exaggerating, because they like being in the public eye”.  Others, citing the obvious echoes of the paparazzi chase that killed Princess Diana in 1997, are horrified at how close the Sussexes came to death. Look on social media and you’ll also find wild conspiracy theories that a crafty King Charles engineered the whole thing and it wasn’t so much an accident as an assassination attempt.  The passionate and polarized response to Tuesday night’s incident is hardly surprising. Harry and Meghan have devoted fans and equally devoted haters; they can’t so much as eat a cheese sandwich without inspiring a string of unhinged reactions. Nevertheless, the range of responses to this particular event is remarkable: even the people directly involved seem to have very different recollections of what happened.  Let’s start with how the Sussexes characterized the chase. On Wednesday a spokesperson for Prince Harry said that the three passengers had been “involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers”.  Chris Sanchez, a member of Prince Harry’s security team has corroborated this description of events. “The public were in jeopardy at several points,” Sanchez told CNN. “It could have been fatal.”  The New York Police Department, meanwhile, characterized the incident as “challenging” rather than catastrophic. “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrests in regard,” an NYPD spokesperson said.  New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, while condemning the paparazzi as “reckless” and “irresponsible”, similarly characterized the incident as less dramatic than the Sussexes described and cast doubt on the supposed time-frame. “I would find it hard to believe that there was a two-hour high speed chase,” Adams said. A fair point since a two-hour high-speed chase in Manhattan is near impossible unless it’s 4am on a Sunday or Vin Diesel is behind the wheel. However, as Adams noted, even a 10-minute pursuit would be “extremely dangerous in New York City”.  Whatever happened, the real hero of the hour is Sukhcharn Singh, the yellow cab driver who was chauffeuring the threesome. Singh seems remarkably relaxed about his role in shuttling the Sussexes to safety. (Bear in mind that it probably takes a lot to faze a New York cab driver.) Singh told CNN that he didn’t feel under threat by the encounter with photographers but Harry and Meghan looked “nervous and scared”. He also told the Washington Post that the incident lasted 10 minutes. “I don’t think I would call it a chase,” Singh said. “I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn’t like a car chase in a movie.” Still, added Singh, he could understand why his famous passengers were terrified. “You know, my feelings were normal, but I’m sure their feelings were more intense because of what his mom, Princess Diana, died in a crash running away from the paparazzi,” he said. “So I think their emotions must have been higher.”  And that’s really the crux of it, isn’t it? We all react to high-pressure situations in different ways, based on our personal histories. It is perfectly natural that Prince Harry would be traumatized by being aggressively pursued by the paparazzi. Nobody has any right to dismiss or diminish his response to what must have been a very triggering situation. You don’t have to particularly like Harry and Meghan to be disturbed by the constant vitriol directed against them, particularly from the British media. And you don’t have to be a Harry and Meghan cheerleader to feel disturbed at how they were treated by the royal family. Who, by the way, have kept conspicuously quiet on the car chase.  Anyway, if there’s a happy ending to come out of all of this I hope it’s that Singh gets a cameo in the next Fast and the Furious movie.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2RpZC1oYXJyeS1hbmQtbWVnaGFuLWV4YWdnZXJhdGUtdGhlaXItY2F0YXN0cm9waGljLWNoYXNlLWl0cy1jb21wbGljYXRlZNIBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2RpZC1oYXJyeS1hbmQtbWVnaGFuLWV4YWdnZXJhdGUtdGhlaXItY2F0YXN0cm9waGljLWNoYXNlLWl0cy1jb21wbGljYXRlZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:30:36","House Republicans have launched a probe into the soaring number of terrorism suspects who’ve been detected trying to sneak into the U.S. under President Biden, calling it a “clear national security risk” and demanding Homeland Security cough up its plan for stopping the surge.  House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer is leading the effort, joined by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green.  They pointed to the 96 people on the terrorism watchlist who’ve been caught at the southern border over the past seven months — by far a record pace — and said if that many are being detected, it begs the question of how many more are getting through.  “There is a growing risk that dangerous aliens with terrorist ties are making it across the border into the United States. This is a clear national security risk. We need to know that the Department of Homeland Security is making every effort to handle the risks presented by gotaways with potential terrorist ties,” Mr. Comer, Kentucky Republican, said.  The administration, in previous communications to Congress, has assured lawmakers that those caught at the border with terrorism-related records are “detained and removed.” But Mr. Comer and the other chairmen pointed to CBP’s website, which says they “may” be detained and removed “to the extent possible” under law and policy.  The lawmakers on Friday asked Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to explain what that means and to reveal any blockades on detaining terrorism suspects.  DOCUMENT: Letter to DHS  They also pointed to the 1.5 million illegal immigrants known to have entered and evaded capture — the so-called “gotaways.”  “We fear these known gotaways could also include illegal aliens with terrorist ties,” the chairmen wrote to Mr. Mayorkas.  Homeland Security said in a statement that it would answer the letter “via official channels, and the Department will continue to respond appropriately to Congressional oversight.”  The 96 people were caught by Border Patrol agents as they came across the U.S.-Mexico boundary. Their identities triggered hits in the government’s terrorism screening database, or TSDB, which is commonly referred to as the terrorism watchlist. The watchlist includes known and suspected terrorists and people believed to be associates of those individuals.  Homeland Security said terrorism designations are a snapshot in time and suggested some of those listed on the watchlist were placed there as part of organizations the U.S. no longer feels a threat.  Seven months into the fiscal year, agents have already nearly matched the full total for 2022 — which itself shattered previous records.  Sixteen terrorism suspects were apprehended in April alone. By contrast, the entire four years of the Trump administration saw just 11 apprehensions total.  The chairmen asked Mr. Mayorkas to turn over the immigration files and detention history of all illegal immigrants caught at the southwest border who were flagged by the TSDB during the Biden administration.  They also asked for Homeland Security’s estimates of terrorism suspects within the population of gotaways.  Claims of terrorists sneaking over the border came into stark view last year when the FBI accused an Iraqi man of trying to orchestrate an assassination plot against former President George W. Bush, using an Islamic State hit squad he planned to sneak in over the southern border.  The FBI said Shihab Shihab ran a smuggling operation, and in a conversation with an FBI informant claimed he had already smuggled two Hezbollah operatives in, charging them $50,000 apiece.  Shihab, who came to the U.S. in 2020 on a visitor’s visa and then filed an asylum claim, pleaded guilty last month to attempting to provide material support to terrorists for his role in the assassination plot. He is awaiting sentencing.  The terrorism numbers are striking not only in their volume but also in what they say about the immigration debate.  Two years ago, when GOP leaders visited the border during the early days of the Biden surge, they revealed they’d been told by agents of terrorism suspects being caught. Democrats accused them of lying, and fact-checkers swung into action to question their account.  Last year, however, Customs and Border Protection began to publish the numbers online every month. And the GOP claims were fully born out.  Pieces from CNN and PolitiFact purporting to fact-check the GOP claims remain online, uncorrected, as of this writing, even though the public data has been available for a year.  • Stephen Dinan can be reached at sdinan@washingtontimes.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b250aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb21lci1zYXlzLXJpc2luZy1udW1iZXItb2YtdGVycm9yaXNtLXN1c3BlY3RzLWF0LS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a rare coincidence, it took place 4 years later to the day of when Kirchner announced Alberto Fernández as the Frente de Todos coalition candidate for the 2019 elections.  In the main studio, she sat across from Pablo Duggan, the TV anchor in charge of conducting the interview for his show, Hard to tame (Duro de domar, in Spanish), and talked about a variety of subjects: the economic situation and the agreement with the IMF, the failed assassination attempt against her, as well as the upcoming elections and the chances of the Frente de Todos (FdT) coalition.  Expectations were high in the days and hours leading up to the interview. Last Friday, Cristina Kirchner published a letter on her website saying she would not be running for president, or any other office. Kirchner had accused the judiciary and the Supreme Court of imposing a “political ban” not only against her but the Peronist party as a whole.  Kirchner reiterated that she will not run for any elected office in the upcoming elections. “What I published the other day is very clear,” she said, despite repeated requests from her followers for her to reconsider.  Even though she acknowledged that the love and affection between them is strong, Kirchner never wavered in her commitment, and said she hoped “the children of the decimated generation will be the ones to follow,” in reference to the descendants of the political activists and militants that were persecuted and disappeared by the 1976-1983 dictatorship.  Here are some of the most important definitions she gave on economy, elections, and the Judiciary in the interview, which went on for almost an hour and a half:  “In a dual-currency economy, the debt in dollars worsens the balance of payments constraint.”  “[The Macri government’s agreement with the IMF] was outrageous.”  “The agreement with the IMF will need to be reviewed.”  “We need to discuss how to get out of the dual-currency economy with all the political parties that have parliamentary representation.”  “If we want to win the elections, we have to get society to fall in love with us again.”  “The Frente de Todos government was better than what an eventual second term of Macri would have been.”  “Being able to eat four times a day is neither ideological nor populist.”  “The 2023 elections are going to revolve around an electorate separated in three parts,” in reference to the Frente de Todos coalition, the Juntos por el Cambio coalition, and the La Libertad Avanza party.  “One third of the electorate is voting out of anger,” referring to the popularity of right-wing candidate Javier Milei.  “In these elections I will play the role I have always played, as a political activist, in order to help bring about what I think will be the best for the Argentine people.”  “My daughter needs me, and if something were to happen to me, she would suffer greatly.” Her daughter Florencia Kirchner has had repeated health problems. She was hospitalized in Cuba between 2019 and 2020, and Kirchner visited her on several occasions. The Argentine media has published intimate information about Florencia and even went as far as directly blaming CFK for her daughter’s health problems. This generated a condemnation by journalists’ associations.  “Luckily, I didn’t see when the gunmen pulled the trigger. The [failed assassination attempt] shocked and changed me. I never thought something like that could ever happen again in Argentina.”  “The Supreme Court is a device of persecution.”  “[The Judiciary] is coming for the democratic system.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYnVlbm9zYWlyZXNoZXJhbGQuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL25hdGlvbmFsLXBvbGl0aWNzL2NyaXN0aW5hLWtpcmNobmVycy1maXJzdC1pbnRlcnZpZXctaW4tc2l4LXllYXJzLWhlci1tYWluLWRlZmluaXRpb25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was the first time the former PEN president was seen in public since he was severely wounded by a knife attack in August 2022. At 75 years old, the “Satanic Verses” author has survived numerous death threats and assassination attempts throughout the years in response to his literature.  Rushdie took the stage at the event held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in front of 700 guests. He wore a pair of glasses with the right lens tinted black to protect his right eye, which was blinded in the knife attack. He began his speech with a lighthearted flare.  More from Variety  “It’s also kind of terrifying to come on stage after Lorne Michaels, John Mulaney and Colin Jost. It would be a foolish person who tried to tell a joke,” he said, noting Michaels, who was among the night’s main honorees.  “I wanted to say, ‘Hi, everybody.’ It’s nice to be back, as opposed to not being back, which was also an option. But I’m pretty glad the dice rolled this way.”  Amidst cheers and applause from the crowd, Rushdie recognized PEN and the power and importance of the organization.  “The attack on books, the attack on teaching, the attack on libraries in, how can I put this—Florida—has never been more dangerous, never been more important to fight,” he said. Rushdie spoke about the recent lawsuit that Penguin Random House and PEN America have brought against a Florida School Districts.  Rushdie then addressed the 2022 attack, saying, “I’m being awarded a courage award, but the true courage was not shown by me.”  “After I was attacked, the first person who ran to defend me was Henry Reese,” he said. “Henry, a man in his seventies, ran at my assailant, who is 24 years old with a knife.” He went on to acknowledge the rest of the people that came to his rescue that day.  Story continues  “The courage that day, was all theirs. I never knew their names, I never saw their faces, but that large group of people, I owe my life to.”  Rushdie ended his speech with a message: “Terrorism must not terrorize us.

"assassination","2019-05-01","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T19:32:00","A roundup of conversations we're having daily on the site. Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.  A hush came over Mt. Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem as a choir sang a four-part harmony during their rendition of “People Get Ready,” a song composed in 1965, the year following the March on Washington and President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.  In front of the singers was a congregation mourning the loss of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old man who died on May 1, after Daniel Penny, an ex-Marine, placed him in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway train.  Following his death, demonstrators took to the streets in protest, with some jumping onto subway tracks and shutting down intersections, resulting in the arrests of multiple people.  Penny, 24, has since been charged with second-degree manslaughter. His attorneys have previously said that their client didn’t intend to harm Neely and “could not have foreseen his untimely death.”  Hundreds of people came to the church Friday to pay their respects and express their condolences.  Attendees included Dr. Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered Neely’s eulogy, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado and Yusef Salaam, one of the Central Park Five, a group of teenaged boys wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989.  Sr. Pastor Johnnie M. Green, Jr. conducted the ceremony. He previously led the funeral service for Neely’s mother, Christine Neely, after she was killed in 2007.  During his address, Sharpton vowed to continue fighting for people struggling with homelessness and mental health difficulties.  Until change happens, Sharpton said, “There will be no justice, there will be no peace,” leading the crowd to erupt into chants of “No justice! No peace!”  Sharpton took issue with Penny being described as a good samaritan by some, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who encouraged his Twitter followers to donate to Penny’s legal defense fund last week. The fund has garnered over $2.6 million in donations.  “A good samaritan helps those in trouble,” Sharpton said. “They don’t choke them out.”  The reverend also criticized officials for releasing Penny from custody the night of Neely’s death, after officials questioned him about the incident.  Neely spent most of his late teens and early 20s imitating Michael Jackson to the amusement of tourists and subway commuters, before a lack of housing and mental health issues took over his life.  Mildred Mahazu, his great-aunt, spoke during Friday’s ceremony, but her comments were brief.  In an interview with ABC News, she described her nephew as a “very, very sweet person.”  “He liked to be loved and he loved people.”  When asked what justice looks like for her family, Mahazu appeared unsure, though she stated that she believes Penny should “make some time” for his actions.  “He don’t need to walk a free man,” she continued.  “Why would you put your hand around someone’s neck and choke them when you know they would die in less than two to three minutes?” she asked.  “That means murder.”  After the ceremony, family members made their way to Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, N.Y. for a private burial service.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbGl2ZS5jb20vcmVja29uLzIwMjMvMDUvaGUtbGlrZWQtdG8tYmUtbG92ZWQtYW5kLWhlLWxvdmVkLXBlb3BsZS1qb3JkYW4tbmVlbHlzLWZ1bmVyYWwtaG9ub3JzLTMwLXllYXItb2xkcy1saWZlLmh0bWzSAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWxpdmUuY29tL3JlY2tvbi8yMDIzLzA1L2hlLWxpa2VkLXRvLWJlLWxvdmVkLWFuZC1oZS1sb3ZlZC1wZW9wbGUtam9yZGFuLW5lZWx5cy1mdW5lcmFsLWhvbm9ycy0zMC15ZWFyLW9sZHMtbGlmZS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-10-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:56:25","In 1954, after years of successfully smearing innocent people, ruining lives and careers, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy launched a new attack against an unlikely target – the United States Army. Unlike his other victims, the Army had the power and influence to fight back.  McCarthy accused the Army of having weak security at one of its top-secret facilities. In response, the Army hired a well-known lawyer, Joseph Welch, to defend the country’s oldest service branch against the allegations. During a public hearing at which Welch testified, McCarthy accused one of Welch’s junior attorneys of having ties to the Communist Party with no evidence to back up his charge.  Welch responded with words that have gone down in history as the ultimate put down for bullies like McCarthy. “Until this moment, senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness.”  McCarthy tried to fight back, but Welch stopped him. “Let us not assassinate this lad further, senator. You have done enough. Have you no decency?”  Have you no decency?  With those four immortal words McCarthy’s popularity in the country disappeared overnight, he was censured by his fellow senators, rebuffed by the media that helped create him, and died three years later in disgrace. His brand of character assassination has now become known as McCarthyism.  Now, in the beautiful North Idaho community of Coeur d’Alene, Welch’s indictment “have you no decency” applies to Brent Regan, the chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee. After years of smearing his political opponents, Regan hit a new low in the recent local non-partisan library board election.  Two incumbents, Judy Meyer, and Regina McCrea were running for re-election. I don’t know McCrea, but I have worked with Judy Meyer for a decade as chair of Idaho Business for Education’s Panhandle region.  Judy is an institution and community treasure in Coeur d’Alene. She has served on the North Idaho College board of trustees, served as president of the State Board of Education, still serves on the board of Idaho Public Television, has donated millions of dollars to make her community a better place to live, and has served on the library board for 30 years.  At the age of 81, when most people retire from public service, Judy ran for re-election to the library board because she is concerned about those who want to ban books in the library. She wanted to prevent Regan and his book-banning minions from taking over the library board just as they took over the North Idaho College board and drove it to the brink of oblivion.  On Tuesday, Judy lost her race for re-election to the board after Regan’s Kootenai County GOP committee sent out a letter accusing Judy and McCrea of allowing “graphic books with text and pictures describing every imaginable sex act to be purchased and displayed to children.”  The letter went on to say, “These books are so explicit that if you were to give them to a child, you would be committing a crime.”  Regan’s group also paid for a video in which they accused the library board of failing to protect children from “harmful media and reading material.”  In the video, a young girl comes home from school and tells her mother, who is washing dishes, that at the library a woman read a book to the children. The girl tells her mother that the book had “moms and dads and there were kids” and they were “doing things like kissing each other and some of ‘em didn’t have any clothes on.”  The video goes on to show the shocked mother turning to her daughter.  “Mommy,” the child asks. “What’s anal sex?”  At that, the shocked mother drops a plate, and it shatters on the floor.  The video ends by urging people to vote for the candidates running against Judy and McCrea.  Let’s be clear, Judy Meyer is no groomer. Judy Meyer would never allow children to be exposed to sexually explicit books. She is a mother and a grandmother and a pillar of decency and virtue. She has dedicated her life to serving her community. She and her husband of more than 57 years were just honored in the Spokane business newspaper as “icons” of the Coeur d’Alene community.  This time Regan and his minions jumped the shark. To paraphrase Joseph Welch’s immortal words, his cruelty and recklessness hit a new low. He has demonstrated in a most public way that he, indeed, has no decency.  Coeur d’Alene is one of the most beautiful towns in the United States, nestled along the banks of Lake Coeur d’Alene. It is populated by many good people who love their community. It has known good times and bad times like when it had to fight and defeat a group of neo-Nazis that plagued the area. Thousands of outsiders have flocked to the community because of its lakeside beauty and thriving economy.  But in the last few years a heavy darkness has descended over Coeur d’Alene, thanks largely to people like Brent Regan. They have infected the community with a poison that has spread like wildfire. Coeur d’Alene is now a place where truth, love, respect, civility, and goodwill go to die.  Coeur d’Alene is at risk of losing its wonderful community college, the oldest in Idaho, because Brent Regan backed far-right candidates who took over the board of trustees. It has already lost many good public servants who, like Judy Meyer, were smeared. Now it is about to lose its community library to book censorship. One has the haunting feeling that the recent library election is proof positive that the community is close to losing its soul.  One wonders when a majority of people in that blessed lakeside community will collectively tell Brent Regan and his minions that enough is enough. One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan and his minions that their cruelty knows no bounds. One wonders when they will tell Brent Regan in no uncertain terms that he has no decency. That his brand of character assassination has no place in their community.  The scary truth is, if they can character assassinate a community icon and an 81-year-old grandmother like Judy Meyer, no one’s reputation is safe. They can tarnish anyone, no matter how innocent they are.  When the good citizens of Coeur d’Alene finally decide to send Brent Regan and his acolytes packing, then, and only then, can they start rebuilding their town into the beautiful, welcoming, and loving community that once was the jewel of North Idaho.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkYWhvZWRuZXdzLm9yZy92b2ljZXMvaGF2ZS15b3Utbm8tZGVjZW5jeS1hcHBsaWVzLXRvLWJyZW50LXJlZ2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The attack occurred late Wednesday in the community of Source Matelas, north of the capital of Port-au-Prince, police said.  “This criminal act is beyond reprehensible and will not go unpunished,” Haiti’s National Police said in a statement Thursday, adding that officers will not be intimidated.  A video circulating on social media showed the policeman’s body while alleged gang members mention the name Izo, leader of the “5 Seconds” gang, as one of them posed with the victim.  Also Wednesday, unidentified assailants opened fire on a car carrying anti-corruption judge Jean Wilner Morin, who survived the attack. Haiti's Communications Ministry said Friday that the attack occurred in the upscale suburb of Petionville. The agency describing it as “heinous and criminal"" and noted that it would not stop Morin from carrying out his duties.  Gangs are estimated to control up to 80% of the capital and have seized control of communities north of Port-au-Prince that previously were considered safe as they continue to grow more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.  More than 21 police officers were killed in the first three months of the year, according to the U.N. That number has risen, with another three killed in early April as the U.N. chief and others press for the immediate deployment of an international armed force that Haiti's prime minister requested in October to quell gang violence. But no one has shown any interest in leading such a force.  Haiti’s National Police is severely understaffed and under resourced, with some 13,200 active-duty officers serving a country of more than 11 million people. The international community has provided police training and equipment including armored vehicles paid for by Haiti's government, but several of these have been seized by heavily armed gangs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vSW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93aXJlU3Rvcnkvb2ZmaWNpYWwtc3VzcGVjdGVkLWdhbmctbWVtYmVycy1raWxsLWhhaXRpYW4tcG9saWNlbWFuLWFtaWQtOTk0NTU1OTLSAXdodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9JbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dpcmVTdG9yeS9vZmZpY2lhbC1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtZ2FuZy1tZW1iZXJzLWtpbGwtaGFpdGlhbi1wb2xpY2VtYW4tYW1pZC05OTQ1NTU5Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She is trying to get the book removed from Orange County's high school libraries.  ""This one was brought to me by a parent at a different county in Florida, so I looked on Orange County Public Schools website to see if it was in Orange County Public Schools, and it was - in five high schools here,"" she said.  Assassination Classroom tells the story of a smiling space alien with tentacles who destroys part of the moon, then starts working as a schoolteacher. The alien is nearly immune to Earth weapons but challenges the students to try killing him while at the same time becoming a beloved educator to the group of misfit students.  Huntley's own children don't go to public schools but says she's concerned about what message the book gives the ones who do.  ""I thought to myself first of all, we're very concerned about school safety. At the same time, we're also concerned about we need to recruit more teachers and retain them. And a message like this in the book is not helping that situation,"" she said.  The Orange County Public Schools website shows the district is currently reviewing the request to pull the book from shelves. Officials said there was no timeline for this process. Danny Morales, with comic book store The Collective, said the book was meant to be a satire.  ""Over the course of time, they actually start to love him, because their grades get better, their prospects in life get better, so it actually does have some real learning, it's not just like a deadly class type of thing,"" he said.  A parent in Osceola County was also trying to get the book removed from school libraries there.  FOX35 contacted publisher VIZ Media for their take on the situation, we haven't heard anything back, yet. Morales said high schoolers who took time to read the book may be able to see the story in its intended context.  ""It's set up for teens, it gives it the teen rating.

Of the people killed this year, 68 have been women.  Carlos Jaramillo Silva, president of Tijuana’s Business Council, says the high murder rate continues to generate a bad image for the city.  “This draws a lot of attention, it’s a crisis even though there’s a lot of work going on to lower the homicide rate,” he told the El Sol Newspaper in Tijuana.  Jaramillo is calling for a new strategy when it comes to fighting crime on the streets.  “We need to know what every police agency is doing, we can’t have all of them essentially doing the same thing,” he said.  He also said the high murder rate has yet to have a “big negative impact on attracting new business and investments to the city,” adding that he is concerned with the growing problem of extortion, when businesses are forced to pay cartels a tariff to stay in operation.  Tijuans had more than 2,000 homicides in 2022. According to figures published by the state prosecutor’s office, the city recorded 2,014 homicides in 2020. In 2019, a little more than 2,200 homicides were recorded in Tijuana, well short of the 2,499 in 2018.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T00:42:00","John Yang: Well, we`re going to be hearing a lot more from Donald Trump in the days to come. The field vying to challenge him in the Republican presidential nomination race is growing. Today, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott filed the necessary paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, and he says he`ll make what he calls a major announcement Monday in Charleston. And on Wednesday, Florida governor Ron DeSantis is suspected to say that he`s running.  In recent days, DeSantis and the current frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, have been exchanging increasingly pointed barbs. Trump mocked the governor after two DeSantis-backed candidates ended up losing in Tuesday`s elections. And on the other hand, The New York Times reported that DeSantis has privately told supporters that Trump can`t win in 2024.  Carl, what`s this race going to look like? Are they going -- these are two politicians whose careers have really been intertwined. They`re sort of playing in the same lane, going after the same voters.  Carl Hulse: And Trump would say he made Ron DeSantis his endorsement in the Florida governor`s race. It`s just going to be a very messy battle.  I think DeSantis might be happy that other people are jumping into this race, and it sort of might dilute a little bit of the Trump effect on him. I do think that`s interesting that other people have seen what`s happened, have seen how it`s gone with DeSantis, and still say, you know what, I`m willing to jump in there and take on the former president. I do think it`s just going to be a free for all, though.  And Donald Trump is really great at character assassination, and he`s going to apply those skills to Ron DeSantis.  John Yang: Could what DeSantis is doing, could it work, going after the same voters, sort of trying to be trying to be Trumpism without Trump?  Carl Hulse: Yes, I think that`s his message, right, Trump can`t win. I do think there`s a lot of Republicans in the Senate who also believe that and are worried about Trump.  I do think, though, that you`re going to see Trump use this feud that DeSantis has had with Disney against him and say, this guy is not good for business and try to scare away donors.  Fin Gomez: Sorry. Yes. DeSantis hasn`t even launched his campaign yet. As you said, it`s expected next week. And he`s lost momentum, though. He`s lost momentum over the last several weeks, over the last several months, in part because he has not engaged with Donald Trump. And some of his supporters have said, like jump in already, like counter, right?  So, I think that once that happens, I think after next week, I`ve been told by some folks in DeSantis world that that will increase, that he will get more vocal towards the former president, but it will turn this cycle, I believe, into a vicious one. It will be a brutal, brass knuckle cycle, and worse perhaps than we`ve seen since 2016.  John Yang: How will -- you say DeSantis is going to get more active. But what contrast will he try to draw with President Trump?  Fin Gomez: Well, frankly, he has been leaning into this card of being the best person to embody the Trump-era policies for the Republican base without having the Trump baggage. I think you`re going to see more of that. He`s been tweaking him, as we`ve seen. He`s been increasing it, increasing his criticisms.  But at the same time, because of that lack of momentum, as Carl touched upon, we have been seeing more potential contenders, say, even this past week, from the mayor of Miami to the North Dakota governor, to others saying they are considering seriously considering runs and jumping into the presidential freight. And a lot of that is because DeSantis has lost momentum over the last few weeks.  John Yang: So, that`s their hope there. That`s what fuels these sort of long shot candidacies, that`s how they think they could win?  Fin Gomez: Yes, that and in part because they`re still, despite of his positioning of Trump`s positioning as this frontrunner. And I think most national polls, there`s an average national polls, that show that he`s up by 30 points over DeSantis right now. But because there are still these looming investigations with Jack Smith and the others, Fulton County, that perhaps that this trajectory is not sustainable. And so the more they enter into the race, they feel they could they could change, it could evolve and they could get a chance. And, frankly, I think a lot of them are relying on that. We`ll see what happens.  John Yang: Turning to the Democratic side, Kayla, Vice President Kamala Harris` profile seems to be rising in recent days. Is there some strategy behind that?  Kayla Tausche: Well, in short, yes, John, because her profile had receded to behind the scenes. Her aides had complained that the issues with which she was tasked were low-profile issues and she was set up to fail essentially because they were issues that were not designed to succeed. Now, in recent weeks, she`s taken the helm of the administration`s messaging on abortion rights.  And in recent weeks, she`s also taken the lead on some debt ceiling strategy as well. She was in the meeting with congressional negotiators this week after not being in the meeting last week. She held a briefing for reporters yesterday talking about the consequences of default. And then even today, while she was visiting a philanthropic facility in California, she made comments that made news about the debt ceiling suggesting that giving some of the reasons behind the pause.  And so the White House has seemed to make a concerted effort to put her out there. And it`s because the attacks from the other side are expected to discuss President Biden`s age and the fact that Kamala Harris, the vice president, is just a heartbeat away from the presidency. And so her record is expected to come under attack just alongside the presidents. And they want that to be unassailable and they want her to be shown being in the lead, hand in glove with President Biden on a lot of these issues.  John Yang: The Republicans could be saying she could be president sooner rather than later, given the president`s age?  Kayla Tausche: Yes. I mean, that`s what they`re anticipating the message to be because of the attacks on President Biden`s age. And so they`re gearing up for that. And even just her appearances in President Biden`s ads and some of his high-profile events so far, it`s very clear that they`re raising her profile to show that she would be an able leader if anything were to happen to President Biden to try to nip those attacks in the bud even before they start.  John Yang: Seung Min, the campaign also released a strategy memo, and, interestingly, listed the states where they thought they can be competitive in 2024. Anything in that memo surprise you?  Seung Min Kim: It was really interesting how they specifically singled out North Carolina and Florida as two states where they will try to be active and play in as compared to the states, the swing states that they laid out that were so successful then back in 2020. Because if you look at the states, a lot of them are very familiar to us, such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona clearly were pivotal states for the President in 2020 and also, frankly, in 2022 as well, in the midterms.  But North Carolina and Florida caught my eye. Florida, for us, when I started covering politics, Florida was a solid swing state. Now, it is clearly a red state considering, especially looking at Governor DeSantis` resounding re-election victory last November. But it is someplace where they see at least it`s worth investing money.  And in North Carolina is really interesting as well. It is a state where the demographics could be pretty ripe for Democrats to take that state again after losing it to Republicans the last couple of presidential cycles. And I do think that`s another state where abortion, which has been such a key issue in the midterms, we just saw the Republican-led legislature override Governor Cooper`s veto of, I believe, a 12-week abortion ban.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T22:59:02","A former Orange County police chief-turned-yoga instructor and conservative activist, in the run-up to his federal trial for Jan. 6 Insurrection-related criminal charges, has filed an unusual written court motion raising seemingly rhetorical and conspiracy-oriented questions about everything from the JFK assassination to the recent firing of Fox News host Tucker Carlson.  Alan Hostetter, a former San Clemente resident who briefly led the La Habra Police Department, is serving as his own attorney and recently waived his right to a jury in order to be tried by a federal judge in a trial scheduled for early July. Hostetter is accused of conspiring with Russell Taylor, a Ladera Ranch entrepreneur, and four alleged far-right militia members from Riverside County in the lead-up to the Jan.6 breach of the U.S. Capitol.  In response to a routine procedural prosecution filing related to what evidence will be admitted at trial, Hostetter on Thursday, May 18 filed a lengthy motion that cites the Socratic Method before listing dozens of pages of questions, beginning with “What if everything we were ever taught about our history, our government, and the world in which we live is a lie?”  The bulk of the questions center on conspiracy theories raised by other Jan. 6 defendants and some conservative media members and politicians regarding the alleged role of federal agents and informants and “antifa” in the Capitol riot, as well as the historical actions of the FBI and CIA.  See also: List: These Southern California residents are accused of taking part in the Capitol riot  At one point in the filing, Hostetter asks whether “BLM/Antifa burned down half the big cities in this country, including Washington D.C. only months before” Jan. 6. Citing his broadcast of “video footage helpful” to Jan. 6 defendants, Hostetter also asks “Might that be why Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox News?” And in referencing Ashli Babbitt, the protestor shot and killed by an officer during the Capitol breach, Hostetter asks “Does the word Babbitt appear in the English dictionary?”  Hostetter is facing a variety of federal charges, including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding, as well as disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted area.  Some of his questions seem far afield of Jan. 6.  At one point Hostetter wrote, “Do we now know our own government assassinated JFK?” In another portion of the filing he asked, “What are some occult symbols and meanings of the 1939 movie, ‘Wizard of Oz?’ “  The motion ends with a lengthy first-person narrative from Hostetter about having a religious awakening in 2021 during a morning walk on the beach that he writes turned him away from alcoholism.  The filing comes about a month after Taylor, Hostetter’s main co-defendant, admitted to organizing a group of “fighters” to travel to the U.S. Capitol, part of a plea deal in which Taylor has agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTkvZXgtbGEtaGFicmEtcG9saWNlLWNoaWVmLWFsYW4taG9zdGV0dGVyLWNpdGVzLWNvbnNwaXJhY3ktdGhlb3JpZXMtaW4tamFuLTYtcmVsYXRlZC1maWxpbmfSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xOS9leC1sYS1oYWJyYS1wb2xpY2UtY2hpZWYtYWxhbi1ob3N0ZXR0ZXItY2l0ZXMtY29uc3BpcmFjeS10aGVvcmllcy1pbi1qYW4tNi1yZWxhdGVkLWZpbGluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Tim Walz sat down to sign two new gun restrictions into law, Rachael Joseph was at the back of the large pack of supporters, holding aloft a framed black-and-white photo of her late aunt, Shelley Joseph-Kordell.  ""This has been a long time coming,"" Joseph said. Her aunt was fatally shot at the Hennepin County Government Center in 2003 by someone who purchased a gun at a show for $60 without a background check, Joseph said.  When Walz walked into the crowded reception room to sign the $3.5 billion public safety bill, he said, ""There's a reason the room is full because a vast majority of Minnesotans have been waiting too damn long for this.""  The new law expands background checks for gun sales at shows and transfers and creates a red-flag-style provision allowing family or law enforcement to petition a judge to take guns away from someone determined to be mentally unstable.  ""Minnesota is a better state,"" Walz said after sitting down to sign the bill with former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., at his side. Giffords survived an assassination attempt in 2011 near Tucson, but was left with a traumatic brain injury. She resigned from Congress in 2012 and started an organization called Giffords to promote gun control.  ""Be bold. Be courageous. The nation is counting on you,"" Giffords said.  She was one of many speakers at the event, some of them emotional, including Melissa Kennedy, a physician at the Buffalo Allina Health Clinic. She was there on Feb. 9, 2021, when a patient with mental health issues showed up and started shooting, killing Lindsay Overbay, a medical assistant with two young children.  Kennedy was wearing a gold necklace with 755 engraved on the front, the clinic's street number, and Overbay's initials on the back. Kennedy also wore a red T-shirt signaling her involvement in the national gun safety group Moms Demand Action.  The physician mentioned her three young children and said the fight isn't over. ""You will continue to see these red shirts show up and be fierce advocates for gun reform,"" she said.  Andre Locke Sr., left, father of Amir Locke, and Amir’s uncle Andrew Tyler shared an embrace after the bill signing. Amir Locke was fatally shot by Minneapolis police.  Not celebrating Friday was Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus lobbyist Rob Doar, who said in a statement that the bill had ""no Republican support and bipartisan opposition. Rather than address the root causes of gun deaths, Minnesota is attacking the Constitutional rights of Minnesota's peaceable gun owners.""  He said the gun caucus ""remains committed to engaging in meaningful dialogue on policies that are truly effective in reducing firearms-related deaths, not the unconstitutional and ineffective policies being passed into law today.""  Also speaking at the signing was Senate Judiciary Chair Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, who couldn't pinpoint a starting date on the gun provisions, saying they would take time to establish after the law takes effect July 1. He noted that he has been working on gun measures since 2002 and nodded to the DFL victories in November.  ""Elections matter,"" he said.  ""For me, it's a policy matter,"" he added of the new law. ""For a lot of people, it's a lot more than that.""  Richfield Police Chief Jay Henthorne spoke on behalf of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association, saying the gun changes won't prevent all violence but they will help.  Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said he grew up evading gun violence on the south side of Chicago. ""I had to take this moment to do something, to take some action,"" he said.  While the signing was focused on the gun measures, the new public safety law holds many other dramatic changes for the criminal justice system.  It includes the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act (MRRA), allowing prison inmates the possibility of cutting time off their sentences through education, training or treatment. It sets up a Clemency Review Commission and no longer requires Board of Pardons decisions to be unanimous.  Republicans have denounced the bill, calling the MRRA provision a ""get out of jail free card."" The new system is expected to take more than a year to set up.  Among the other changes, the new law prevents peace officers from joining or supporting hate or extremist groups. It also puts extreme limits on the use of no-knock warrants. And it creates new crimes of organized retail theft and car-jacking in a similar approach to federal racketeering laws. Strip searches of juveniles also will be restricted.  Other items in the sweeping law are a new Office of Missing and Murdered Black Women and Girls, and a requirement that hotel rooms have carbon monoxide alarms.

"assassination","2023-09-12","Not Discerned","{""Beirut"", ""Beirut"", ""Lebanon""}","2023-05-19T20:00:33","Imad Mughniyeh was responsible for more American deaths in terrorist attacks before the devastating 9/11 bombings and was able to outsmart not only the CIA but also the Mossad. Making matters even more difficult was the fact that no one knew what he looked like. By 2001, he was on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist list with a $15 million bounty for information leading to his arrest. The reward was later bumped up to $25 million. He ultimately appeared on the most wanted list in 42 countries before he died was assassinated at the age of 45 in a car bombing in 2008.  Showtime’s new limited series “Ghosts of Beirut” shines the spotlight on the terrorist and the CIA and Mossad’s attempts to capture him. The Washington Post’s national security reporter Shane Harris recently conducted a Zoom conversation with co-creators Greg Barker and Avi Issacharoff and star Dina Shihabi.  “He’s one of the most fascinating characters I’ve ever come across,” said Barker. “He was a man who from ages 19, 21, outwitted the CIA and the Mossad and rose to incredible prominence in the Middle East as a key player in the region from nowhere. And he drove the agency and Mossad kind of crazy because they couldn’t find him. And his story plays out over two-and-a-half decades.”  And in Barker’s opinion, Mughniyeh shaped the modern CIA “from what happened in the 1980s, which resonates in the mid-2ooos. So, he was complicated. He was a guy from a poor family, a poor neighborhood, who started working as a bodyguard to Yasser Arafat in Beirut in the late ‘70s, early 80s. Kind of when the PLO left Beirut he sort of found an opening and was also recruited by Iranian intelligence, kind of stepped into a void and exploited that to his own ends and became, I think, sort of more powerful and more influential at an extremely young age than he ever imagined.”  It is shocking to learn just what terrorist events Mughniyeh was involved in.  “There’s the initial suicide bombing on an Israeli base in Tyre [Lebanon},” said Barker, “soon followed by an attack , a massive attack on the United State embassy in 1983 in Beirut, which killed hundreds of people and wiped out the entire CIA station at the time including-well I won’t give it away-one of the very, very prominent CIA officers who was on the cusp of what he hoped was a Middle East peace plan, a regional peace plan. You think about the Beirut hostage crisis in the ’80s, it was all Mughniyeh, including the kidnapping of the CIA U.S. station chief, William Buckley, which sort of brought the agency to its knees. And then he was a military strategist, so he was the architect of Hezbollah’s military strategy.”  Issacharoff explained the differences between Mughniyeh and Osama bin Laden. “Bin Laden was in a very twisted way talented in what he did. But Imad Mughniyeh was one level up if not two levels up. He was so sophisticated and smart and clever. He was very careful about his identity. He used nicknames all the time. He switched identities. He traveled to Iran. He traveled to Central America. He traveled to Africa. He met Osama bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, using a fake passport and he was very smart about the way he managed to maneuver everyone.”  And outmaneuvered the CIA and Mossad. “Over and over, they failed in trying to get him,” said Issacharoff. “But when they managed to collaborate and go together into the first-ever joint assassination attempt operation of the CIA and the Mossad, this is where the success came from including finding out about the way he looks, including about reaching his whereabouts and of course executing the assassination.”  Make your predictions at Gold Derby now.

U.S. Magistrate Judge David Hennessy said Jack Teixeira had ""breached his obligation"" to protect U.S. national security information.  Jack Teixeira has his second pre-trial release hearing in a federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts.  During the first hearing a month ago, his attorneys argued that other people accused under the Espionage Act have received bail and assured the judge that Teixeira wouldn't try to leave the country.  However, prosecutors used Teixeira’s online messages to suggest he was a threat to others.  In one post, he said he would ""kill a lot of people"" to ""cull the weak.""  This comes on the heels of a Justice Department filing that said Teixeira had been warned about mishandling classified information months before his April arrest.  According to internal memos filed in court, prosecutors said that the 21-year-old had received instructions in September to stop observing and taking notes on classified intelligence information. Despite this warning, he was cautioned once more in October. In February, Teixeira was apprehended once again for accessing information that the memo stated was ""not related to his primary duty and was related to the intelligence field,"" the Associated Press reported.

The government's main strategy, is using Teixeira's former words against him successful in the first step of a trial the nation is closely watching.

"assassination","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Pietermaritzburg"", ""KwaZuluNatal"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-20T04:16:07","By Chris Ndaliso  The appointment of the Moerane Commission, which presented some “inconsistencies” in its findings, enabled the KZN government to be seen to be doing something about political killings.  This is the view of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) when broached for comment on political murders and attempted murders.  ALSO READ | Assassination attempt on speaker’s life leaves bodyguard dead  ISS researcher and consultant David Bruce was asked by Weekend Witness to comment on recent attempts to allegedly kill IFP councillor Thinasonke Ntombela.  Last month, Ntombela was shot below the nose and the bullet lodged in his jawbone. His companion was shot in the face and arm but they both survived the assassination attempt.  Weeks afterwards a gunman walked into the office building of the IFP and pointed a gun at Ntombela’s secretary. He abandoned his actions when a car drove into the premises.  Bruce said, “There are some inconsistencies in the Moerane Commission findings.  For instance some of the recommendations are based on the idea that the key problem is one of political intolerance. This was relevant in the 1990s when violence in the province was partly linked to ideological differences between political groups. But, as the commission acknowledges, the key factor underpinning political killings is that political positions bolster financial and social status.  He said political positions were seen as a vehicle for advancing specific patronage networks and killings are targeted at people who are seen to threaten, or do not agree to advancing these networks.    He said there was a need for a peace process led by religious organisations or other civil society groups that is focused on the “toxic” political culture and the overall culture of violence in the province.  Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime  Rumbi Matamba, an analyst at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GI-TOC) believes that the commission’s recommendations have not been implemented since its report was published in 2018.  While the task force has investigated numerous killings, court processes are extremely slow and very few convictions have been secured to date. The trends explored in this report illustrate the urgent need to collect reliable, granular data on targeted killings, and the need to act proactively to intercept assassination plots, and to investigate and prosecute assassination cases with greater urgency.  Matamba said political killings nationally have increased from 24 in 2020 to 40 in 2022. She said KZN accounted for 21 of the 40 assassinations in SA in 2022.  ALSO READ | Brutal assassination stuns Pietermaritzburg  National police ministry spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, said since 2018, the inter-ministerial committee (IMC) task team on political killings set up by the presidency has investigated 226 dockets, in which 251 arrests have been made in politically-related cases. She said 46 accused have been found guilty, of whom 30 were convicted for murder.  “These would be the latest stats, updated after the IMC meeting which is yet to be determined,” said Temba.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4uY28uemEvd2l0bmVzcy9uZXdzL2t6bi1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW5vdC1kb2luZy1tdWNoLWFib3V0LXBvbGl0aWNhbC1raWxsaW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","2023-05-19T09:35:50","After months of flat denials, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence has admitted that Kyiv is carrying out a campaign of sabotage and assassination inside Russia. But why change the official line now?  Even if this is a good cop/bad cop routine, it still risks embarrassing the president, raising questions as to how far he is fully in control of HUR  Major General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR), has become one of the media stars of this war, not least thanks to an artfully curated public persona that a senior US intelligence official characterised as ‘George Smiley meets Jason Bourne.’ This week he took advantage of interviews on two separate YouTube channels to acknowledge a Ukrainian role in a spate of recent attacks in Russia. He also announced that the Ukrainian parliamentarian Yevhen Shevchenko held secret negotiations with Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko, on behalf of the intelligence agencies.  The attacks in Russia have ranged from the derailment of freight trains to bomb attacks on outspoken supporters of the war such as blogger Vladlen Tatarsky (killed in April) and author and militant Zakhar Prilepin (seriously injured earlier this month). It has long been presumed that HUR is the primary agency behind them, but until this month the agency had generally refused to confirm nor deny the truth behind the various allegations.  Then, though, Budanov told western journalists that ‘we’ve been killing Russians and we will keep killing Russians anywhere on the face of this world until the complete victory of Ukraine.’ This statement, alarming many in western diplomatic and intelligence communities in its starkness – Budanov refused to qualify which Russians he considered a legitimate target – nonetheless failed to make that much of a splash. This might explain why he chose to double down, celebrating that ‘we have already gotten many [Russian targets], including public and media personalities’ and claiming that the attacks were largely carried out ‘by citizens of the Russian Federation’ happy to work with HUR for ‘patriotic reasons.’  Most popular Gareth Roberts The sad decline of BBC Radio 4  Ukraine is stepping up its campaign of sabotage and assassination inside Russia, but Budanov is also no doubt continuing a campaign of psychological warfare. Although individual Russians have launched simple attacks such as firebombings of draft offices (and there have been claims of wider networks of anarchists and oppositionists) the larger-scale and more complex operations bear the hallmarks of professionals. Some Russians have been duped or blackmailed into sabotage, but Budanov’s claims of a wider anti-Kremlin terrorist movement is likely intended to rattle the security agencies and perhaps trigger a counter-productive crackdown. This is, after all, the man who also said that a coup was underway in Russia to topple Putin and who has a map in his office of a dismembered Russian Federation.  Budanov’s words also contradicted President Volodymyr Zelensky’s own repeated assertions that, as he said in Berlin just a couple of days before Budanov’s interviews, ‘we are not attacking Russian territory.’ To a degree this may well have always been disingenuous: leaked US intelligence documents (which have neither been confirmed nor denied) have Zelensky pondering seizing Russian border villages and even blowing up a pipeline taking Russian oil to Hungary.  Nonetheless, even if this is a good cop/bad cop routine, it still risks embarrassing the president, raising questions as to how far he is fully in control of HUR. According to the same trove of leaked documents, the CIA even had to intercede to get Budanov to stand down planned attacks on Russia on 24 February, the anniversary of the invasion. As an EU official put it, ‘Zelensky should have been able to squelch these ideas without the Americans having to negotiate with Budanov directly.’  The best things in life are free (for a month.

Last year, there was talk of him replacing General Valery Zaluzhny, the head of the armed forces. A former special forces commando turned spymaster, now the avenging angel of the Ukrainian nation, it’s possible that Budanov is looking to a rather different campaign in the future, as well as his present one against Russia.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZWN0YXRvci5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3doeS1oYXMtdWtyYWluZS1hZG1pdHRlZC10aGF0LWl0LWFzc2Fzc2luYXRlcy1wZW9wbGUtaW4tcnVzc2lhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-07-26","Not Discerned","{""Medellin"", ""Antioquia"", ""Colombia""}","2023-05-19T18:20:00","A notorious former commander of Colombia’s largest paramilitary group has revealed new details of how rightwing death squads worked side by side with the country’s business, military and political elite to sow terror in the countryside and wipe out leftwing insurgencies.  Salvatore Mancuso told Colombia’s peace tribunal this week that state institutions were not only complicit in the expansion of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) but actively coordinated with them, giving orders to wipe out anyone suspected of aligning with communist rebels.  “This phenomenon of paramilitarism came from the state,” Mancuso told the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) on a video link from the US where he was extradited on drugs charges in 2008.  Mancuso was released from prison in 2020 and is seeking a reduced sentence from Colombia’s transitional justice system in exchange for divulging the human rights atrocities committed by the AUC – a key player in a brutal, six-decade-long conflict which has left 450,000 dead and millions displaced.  The AUC formed in the Córdoba region in the north of the country to protect landowners from guerrillas but rapidly expanded into one of the world’s biggest drug cartels. Most of its 20,000 combatants laid down their weapons in 2004 as part of a controversial peace process.  Salvatore Mancuso, former commander of the right-wing paramilitary group AUC, seen on screen during during ceremony where he apologised for his crimes. Photograph: Schneyder Mendoza/AFP/Getty Images  Mancuso, who was the AUC’s second in command, has admitted to orchestrating thousands of crimes and some of the darkest chapters in Colombian conflict – including massacres of unarmed civilians, torture and sexual violence.  In sessions lasting up to eight hours the former warlord this week gave grisly accounts of how the militia acted as an arm of the Colombian state to silence the political opposition and take on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) guerrillas.  Mancuso said officials gave the AUC lists of individuals and communities with suspected ties to the communist rebels so they could intimidate, torture and assassinate them without consideration for the rules of war.  “Mancuso’s narrative was that the military was not strong enough to combat the guerrillas themselves and needed an extrajudicial force in order to carry out the scorched-earth tactics that they themselves could not,” says Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for Colombia at International Crisis Group.  There was “enormous pressure” from the state to wipe targets out, Mancuso said. Those targets include Gustavo Petro, then a leftwing congressman and now the country’s president.  Members of United Self-Defense Forces (AUC) brandish automatic assault weapons during a training session in a rural area of Puerto Asis, Putumayo province, in 2000. Photograph: Reuters  Mancuso corroborated previous accusations that the army gave the order for another notorious killing, the 1998 assassination of Jaime Garzón, a beloved TV comedian and political activist.  “Anyone who was accused was eliminated. This is a pattern we learned hand in hand with the institutions of the state,” he said.  The AUC deeply infiltrated Colombian politics and in 2004 Mancuso was even invited to speak to congress to a standing ovation.  One of Mancuso’s most shocking new allegations was that the then president, Álvaro Uribe, removed the security unit for Eudaldo Díaz , a local mayor in the town of El Roble, so the AUC could torture and kill him in 2003.  Mancuso also alleged that Francisco Santos, then vice-president, requested that he form a new unit around Bogotá to prevent leftwing rebels from advancing on the capital.  Uribe and Santos have both denied Mancuso’s allegations.  Mancuso alleged that hundreds of businesses – including banana companies and multinationals such as Coca-Cola and Drummond – helped fund the AUC in the 1990s as it grew from a community of vigilantes into a national terror machine, while military generals trained and supplied the AUC commanders with helicopters and uniforms. Coca-Cola and Drummond have previously denied the allegations.  A former combatant of the AUC shows his tattoos during the first National Meeting of AUC ex-combatants in Puerto Boyacá, on 6 May. Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images  “Mancuso’s testimony confirms that paramilitarism was not only an anti-subversive strategy but an economic one to make business leaders rich, to elect corrupt politicians in the highest ranks of the state and to spy on and intimidate politicians, lawyers and journalists,” says Julián Martínez, author of Chuzadas, a book documenting how the Colombian state spied on judges, journalists and the political opposition.  The army often planned their offensives together with paramilitaries so they could quash guerrilla fronts in pincer manoeuvres, Mancuso said.  “The territories in guerrilla areas were emptied,” he said.  When the number of civilian casualties began to rack up Mancuso says the attorney general’s office alerted the AUC ahead of investigations so they could burn the bodies.  Experts say Mancuso’s accounts advance the JEP’s mission to untangle the truth of Colombia’s conflict and offer reparation to victims.  The warlord will now have 30 days to provide evidence to support his claims, which could spark new investigations into some of Colombia’s most powerful political figures.  Mancuso’s testimony is vital to understand not just the past but the present as rightwing drug-trafficking organisations such as the Gulf Clan, which was founded by former AUC members who refused to disarm and continues to terrorise the countryside, picking off community leaders who oppose them.  “These same acts continue to be committed today, not in the name of the United Self-Defense Forces, but of the Gulf Clan and they too have extensive links with the state,” Martínez says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb2xvbWJpYS1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktc2FsdmF0b3JlLW1hbmN1c28tYXVjLWRlYXRoLXNxdWFkc9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIzL21heS8xOS9jb2xvbWJpYS1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktc2FsdmF0b3JlLW1hbmN1c28tYXVjLWRlYXRoLXNxdWFkcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We learned in school and still see on the occasional documentary and in pop culture that all of America glued itself to its TV sets when man — not just man, but American men — finally landed on the moon. The event united the nation, they say, behind the common cause of engineering might, scientific prominence, and undying patriotism.  But that was 1969, just after the Stonewall Rebellion, a gay rights riot against police brutality in New York. Just before 250,000 protesters rallied against the Vietnam War in Washington. Just after the convictions of James Earl Ray for the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and Sirhan Sirhan for the assassination of Bobby Kennedy. Just before the Hell’s Angels killed four people at the Rolling Stones’ concert at Altamont Speedway.  The moon landing happened smack dab in the middle of American upheaval over civil rights, free speech, and the Vietnam War. That upheaval continued right up to the moment Neil Armstrong’s boot touched the lunar surface and lasted long after Apollo 11 returned to Earth.  If the lunar landing united this country, it did so fleetingly.  Same with so many other “unifying” moments. The patriotism during World War II eventually gave way to the tumult of the civil rights era, and there were race riots in Detroit and elsewhere during the war. The national mourning over the death of John F. Kennedy quickly gave way to the ongoing bedlam of the 60s. The national celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet Union gave way relatively quickly to Waco and the Rodney King riots. The unprecedented national unity following 9/11 fell away to protests over the Iraq War.  Since then, we’ve had the Great Recession, which led to the rise of the tea party on the right and the Occupy Wall Street movement on the left, now antifa on one side and right-wing militias on the other.  Some part of me and a lot of other people longs for some big, unifying moment or some leader who will step out of the void and bring this nation together, but a quick review of the historical record reveals perennial division despite national successes and calamities and regardless of who occupies the White House or which party controls Congress.  I suppose when you have 300 million people of multiple cultures spread out over as big a geographic landscape as America, you’re bound to have differences of opinion.  When the stakes get higher — when lives and livelihoods and entire ways of life hinge on the outcome of policy — then those differences become starker and the fight over them louder.  That’s what’s happening right now.  Today’s issues — climate change, gun violence, inflation, immigration, election security, culture wars, even artificial intelligence — have severe consequences. People are losing their lives. They’re losing their jobs. They’re using up life savings. They’re concerned their voices don’t matter when they go to the polls. They’re losing their homes.  People are understandably loud, looking for salvation.  The problem is, with many of those issues, one person’s salvation is another’s damnation.  The way to solve climate change, for example, is to get off fossil fuels, but every coal plant closure means somebody loses their job. One way to curb gun violence is to limit access to guns, but that means somebody’s going to feel their Second Amendment rights have been violated. The way to slow inflation is to raise interest rates, but that means it costs more to borrow.  So half the country will feel relief coming from the White House, the Capitol, or statehouses, while the other half will feel cursed.  The cursed will yell and those feeling relief will yell back, and the divisions will continue.  History tells us the end to those divisions can’t come from some grand unifying moment or from a unifying leader.  It must come from us.  We must realize that everybody — or at least most people — yell what they yell because they, like everybody else, want what’s best for themselves, their family, their country.  If we can realize that, if we can realize everybody’s motivated by essentially the same thing as us, maybe we can stop hating them for it and instead commiserate a little, understand a little, and find a way to move on.

During his playing career, Bryant expressed profound thoughts on black empowerment. In 2017, he shared a series of Instagram posts, excerpts of which were published by the Dallas Morning News.  He said that he has been racially profiled before but saw the issue of racism larger than that. He concluded that everyone from every community had the opportunity to lead by example, writing,  ""I've been [racially] profiled on numerous occasions, but not once has it influenced an ill feeling inside me about anyone outside of that issue. REAL SLAVERY is different from what's going on in our world now. We all (every ethnicity) have the opportunity to lead by EXAMPLE.""  He also took to task people who talk about history of racism but do not focus on individual or community accountabilty. He said,  ""Instead of making videos about the history of racism that get applause or people with influence merely doing things to post for social media, we should focus on individual accountability to be better as a whole.""  It was in this context that he invoked Malcolm X among others. Dez Bryant said that civil rights leaders like him paved the path for them so that they do not have to carry the historical burden again but lead by example, instead.  ""We focus hard on fighting the realities that exist instead of creating our own reality. The ones who came for us (Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X) paved a new path for us to follow.

"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T15:53:46","On Friday 19 May, Slovak businessman Marian Kocner was acquitted by the Special Criminal Court of ordering the assassination of journalist Jan Kuciak. The investigative journalist of the online outlet Aktuality.sk was killed with his fiancée Martina Kusnirova on 21 February 2018 in their home in Velka Maca, Slovakia. They were both 27 years old.  The court said that “it was not proven” beyond reasonable doubt that Kocner had ordered the assassination of Jan Kuciak. Although before his killing the journalist had been threatened by Kocner due his articles about the businessman’s activities, “a high degree of suspicion is not enough,” the court said, adding that “in case of doubt, the doubt must be interpreted in favor of the defendant.”  Marian Kocner was also acquitted of ordering the murders of three Slovak prosecutors for which he was judged in the same trial.  The businessman’s associate Alena Zsuzsova was, on the contrary, found guilty of ordering the execution of the reporter five years ago. Convicted also for plotting to assassinate two Slovak prosecutors, Zsuzsova was sentenced to 25 years of prison. Her guilt “was proved beyond reasonable doubt” by both direct and indirect evidence, according to the court. The court awarded damages worth 160 thousand euros to be paid by Zsuzsova to the family of Jan Kuciak.  During the retrial, new evidence proving Kocner and Zsuzsova’s guilt was presented, especially a more in-depth analysis of their encrypted messaging between the two. Nevertheless, Kocner was acquitted by a majority of two votes over one by the three-judge panel. The decision to convict Zsuzsova was taken unanimously.  When they heard the verdict, the parents of the journalist and his fiancée left the courtroom. They announced filing appeals. These will be examined by the Supreme Court.  Today’s judicial decision came after a retrial ordered by the Supreme Court when it quashed the 2021 acquittal of Kocner and Zsuzsova. The retrial was merged with a trial over attempts to assassinate three prosecutors.  The businessman and his associate have both been in prison since their arrest in 2018. Kocner, who had links to the former government party Smer, has since been sentenced to 19 years in prison for an attempt to extort 70 million euros from Slovakia’s biggest commercial media, TV Markiza. Zsuzsova is currently serving a 21-year prison term for organizing the assassination of a Slovak mayor.  All the other persons charged with the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova - two hitmen and a middleman who cooperated with the justice - have already been definitely sentenced for the crime to long prison terms.  On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the assassination, a new platform for protection of journalists was launched by the Investigative Centre of Jan Kuciak with the financial and technical support of RSF.  Slovakia is ranked 17th out of 180 countries in the 2023 World Press Freedom Index established by RSF.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcnNmLm9yZy9lbi9raWxsaW5nLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtamFuLWt1Y2lhay1yc2YtdGFrZXMtbm90ZS1jb252aWN0aW9uLW1hc3Rlcm1pbmQtYW5kLWRlcGxvcmVzLWRlYmFjbGUtanVkaWNpYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Al-Quds Brigades fighters during the central festival of Avenging the Free (Social media)  The Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance factions stressed on Friday that it had the upper hand and delivered the last blow during Operation Avenging the Free, which the Resistance launched in response to the recent Israeli aggression against Gaza.  The Resistance has never allowed the Israeli occupation to unilaterally achieve its goals, the Operations Room underlined during a speech at the central festival of Avenging the Free, which the Palestinian Jihad (PIJ) Movement held in the Gaza Strip, Jenin, Lebanon, and Syria, in commemoration of the martyrs of the recent aggression on Gaza.  It confirmed that it thwarted the policy of Israeli occupation Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in achieving his objectives through assassinations.  The Joint Operations Room affirmed that this battle has proven, and will prove in the coming days, that the Israeli assassinations and crimes have only boosted the Resistance and the Palestinian people's determination to crush the arrogance of the occupier.  It underlined that the Resistance and Al-Quds Brigades have proven their ability to withstand and fulfill all their promises, pointing out that the response was clear in Al-Quds and ""Tel Aviv"" and in all illegal Israeli settlements.  It noted that what the Israeli occupation conceals is much greater than what appears on television and media.  The Resistance factions warned the Israeli occupation ""against any assassination or foolishness,"" adding, ""We stick to our promise and vow to respond with full force in the enemy's depth in a unified manner without any hesitation. The enemy got to experience what we are capable of.""  The Operations Room urged all the free people in the world to stand up to their responsibilities toward the central cause of the nation - Palestine. It also called to direct all energies and harness all capabilities to repel the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Elsewhere, the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions dedicated this political and military field achievement to the heroic Palestinian people, prisoners, and the Axis of Resistance, which was a backbone in all stages of the confrontation with the Israeli occupation.  Last week, an Egyptian-mediated ceasefire ended a five-day Israeli aggression against Gaza, that left 33 Palestinian martyrs, including six PIJ commanders, and more than 100 injuries.

Arnolfo Teves Jr. insisted on Friday that his life is in danger, as “proven” by a Bureau of Immigration order to “instantaneously intercept” him if he returns to the Philippines.  “This seems to be the true reason why they want me to come home. There is an order that when I arrive, I will be intercepted. What is more curious [is] that the order came out even before they filed a case against me,” Teves said in video posted on his social media page. He went on: “This means that even without a case against me, there’s already an order to intercept me. This is obviously political persecution and an abuse of my human rights.”  ADVERTISEMENT  Teves showed screenshots of a message supposedly from Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco, but he did not explain why he considered the order extraordinary or threatening.  As part of usual entry formalities in any jurisdiction, Customs, immigration and quarantine (CIQ) officers are authorized to “intercept,” question and sometimes detain an arriving individual, particularly if the person is wanted by the law.  Teves did not explain where he was or if he planned to return to the country after government lawyers filed multiple charges for the Mar. 4 killing of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and nine of his supporters.  The lawmaker maintained that even with several counts of murder, attempted murder and frustrated murder against him, “I am still innocent until proven guilty.”  “I should not be intercepted, I should not be arrested, and I should not be jailed,” Teves said, adding: “Now, you know why I do not want to come home.”  Teves is not required to appear at the prosecutors’ preliminary investigation of the charges, but he would be required to appear before a court at an arraignment, if prosecutors find probable cause for the charges. Teves’ 60-day suspension will also expire on May 22, and the House ethics and privileges panel will be meeting once more to discuss his case if Teves refuses to come home and report for work.  The DOJ officials said Teves’ repeated insistence about threats to his life may be part of a bid to find asylum in another country.  Timor-Leste has already rejected Teves’ petition for asylum after it expressed awareness that the representative was wanted for a ramp of serious crimes.Face the accusations  For Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, the best solution for Teves was to face the accusations against him in court. “He should just come home,” Remulla said on Friday. “He’s throwing a lot at us, but are we the ones who killed 10 people? Just come home and face the charges. He’s the one who’s wanted.”  ADVERTISEMENT  In another development, one of the 11 suspects arrested for the multiple murder complained to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) that the National Bureau of Investigation had abducted his family.  Former soldier Jhudiel Rivero, alias Osmundo Rivero, said in the letter, dated May 9, that the local government of Balog, Zamboanga del Sur, brought his wife and two children to Manila for unknown reasons.  But Remulla said that the family’s transfer was part of Rivero’s deal with the DOJ in exchange for his testimony.  “That was for the Witness Protection Program, so he saw his family. Rivero himself requested that. He saw his family. We’re not gonna do that if he didn’t request it,” Remulla said, welcoming inquiries from the CHR.  “These are the things [meant] to throw us off focus. We will remain focused on these cases. Because they are the accused for these crimes,” Remulla added.  g/  Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

"assassination","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T17:11:20","Veteran Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu-Akleh was covering an Israeli raid on Jenin Refugee Camp in her official capacity as a reporter for Al Jazeera on May 11, 2022, when an unnamed Israeli sniper fired a bullet into the thin space between the back of her helmet and her flak jacket, killing her. At the time, Abu-Akleh was fleeing Israeli gunfire directed towards her and other observing journalists, including Al Jazeera producer Ali Al-Samudi, who was wounded moments before Abu-Akleh’s death.    One year later, Israeli military forces have issued an apology for killing Shireen Abu Akleh. This follows countless reports from journalist eyewitnesses, analyses by multiple international outlets, condemnation from world governments, and a joint investigation which determined Israeli forces deliberately targeted Abu Akleh. Israel’s admission thus reflects a definitive loss of the narrative battle over the course of a full year rather a morally-directed decision. Al Jazeera Front Lines senior producer Kavitha Chekuru joins The Chris Hedges Report to discuss Abu Akleh’s assassination and the status of her case one year later.  Kavitha Chekuru is a senior producer for Al Jazeera’s Front Lines, which released the documentary The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh last December.  Studio Production: Cameron Granadino, Adam Coley, David Hebden, Darian Jones  Post-Production: Adam Coley  Audio Post-Production: Tommy Harron  Transcript  Chris Hedges: Shireen Abu Akleh, the Al Jazeera reporter with more than two decades of experience covering armed conflicts, knew the protocol. She and other reporters remained in the open, clearly visible to Israeli snipers about 650 ft away. Her flak jacket was emblazoned with the word, “Press.” There were two initial rounds of shooting that were fired at the journalists. In the first, producer Ali Al-Samudi was shot.  As the journalist turned to run away from the gunfire, Shireen was shot below her helmet during the second round, according to the human rights organization Al-Haq. There were a few seconds when the Israeli sniper clearly saw a profile in his scope, of Abu Akleh, one of the most recognizable faces in the Middle East. The accuracy of the M16, – Especially the M16A4, equipped with the advanced combat optical gun sight, a prismatic telescopic sight – Is very high.  In the fighting in Fallujah, for example, so many dead insurgents were found with head wounds that observers at first thought they had been executed. The bullet that killed Abu Akleh was deftly placed between the very slim opening separating her helmet and the collar of her flak jacket. I have been in combat, including in clashes between Israeli and Palestinian forces. Snipers are dreaded on a battlefield because each kill is calculated. The execution of Abu Akleh was not an accident: she was singled out for elimination.  Whether this killing was ordered by commanding officers, or whether it was the whim of an Israeli sniper, I cannot answer. Israelis shoot so many Palestinians with impunity. My guess is, the sniper knew he or she could kill Abu Akleh, and never face any consequences. The shooting, Al Jazeera said in a statement, was “A blatant murder violating international laws and norms.”  “Abu Akleh” the network added, was “assassinated in cold blood.” Abu Akleh, who was 51 and a Palestinian American, was a familiar and trusted presence on television screens throughout the region, revered for her courage and integrity, and beloved for her careful and sensitive reporting on the intricacies of daily life under occupation. Her reporting from the occupied territories routinely punctured Israeli narratives, and exposed Israeli abuses and crimes, making her the bête noire of the Israeli government. It is very hard to believe she was not a deliberate target.  Joining me to discuss the murder of Abu Akleh, and the refusal by the Biden administration to hold Israel accountable for the killing, is Kavitha Chekuru, a senior producer for the Al Jazeera show Fault Lines that produced the investigative report titled The Killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.  Kavitha, this is a wonderful report. It’s on YouTube, everyone should watch it. You did a tremendous job piecing together the narrative of what happened. I want you to begin at the beginning, and one of the reasons that we were able to determine what happened, is because we have video footage of it — From phones, and everything else, and cameras — That we don’t have for most Palestinians.  And then as you go forward, I wondered if you could lay out the Israeli response, and how it’s typical of Israel, in terms of first attempting to blame the victim, and how that shifted? But talk about the initial report coming in that she was shot, what you knew, and then what happened, and then we’ll get into your investigation.  Kavitha Chekuru: Sure. That day, May 11, the crew was in Jenin, which is a city in the Northern West Bank. In the weeks preceding that, there had been a series of increasing Israeli military raids. Shireen and her colleagues, as well as other journalists, had been covering them, and that day was no exception.  Shireen and everyone there, are experienced journalists. They know how to cover conflict and they know how to cover this conflict, in particular. When they got news of the raid, Ali Al-Samudi – A producer and journalist based in Jenin, who worked with Shireen for two decades – He called her and told her what was going on: that the raid had begun. So she and the Al Jazeera crew left their hotel. They met up with Ali, as well as other journalists that were there already, and they waited. They had their helmets on, their press jackets, and they waited to make sure it was safe.  They were away from the fighting itself. When they initially looked at the scene, they were a few blocks away from where they could see an Israeli convoy. In other footage that’s come up from civilians on the ground and from the Israeli military themselves – They put out body camera footage later on, and I’ll talk about that. It’s part of their response as well – But I mentioned the footage, because it shows you where they were, which will become important as well in the Israeli military response.  What they saw was a convoy of five Israeli military vehicles, about 650ft or 200m away. They waited, there were no shots, it seemed like it was calm. As the survivors of the incident told us, when they deemed it to be safe, they started walking very slowly. They all had on their press jackets, again, saying, “Press.”  I will say that when we went to Jenin –To the spot where this happened – If you look from the spot where the convoy was, down the road to where the journalists were, you wouldn’t even need a telescopic rifle to see. This was a very short distance. It was visible to us with our naked eye, people at that distance. When you’re looking through a telescope, it’s going to be even closer, even more obvious, than what they’re looking at.  They start to walk, and all of a sudden, shots start firing. They turned, Ali was hit. The Al Jazeera cameraman immediately started to record. He was a bit of a distance away from the others. That footage in particular became very crucial, because one, it gave us the number of shots fired. But it also really gave us… I mean, it’s horrible footage; it’s Shireen on the ground, and you see the way the shots continued even after that, particularly as her colleagues and civilians tried to help her.  Chris Hedges: Well, I just want to interrupt. Because in the film, every time somebody approached her – And she’s prone face down on the ground – They’re fired at.  Kavitha Chekuru: Exactly. Exactly. It becomes a bit hard to think this was just being caught in crossfire, when any time someone tries to help her, they’re targeted again. Eventually, they were able to get her body away, they went to the hospital, and she was pronounced dead. One of the things I should point out is that – If your viewers and listeners aren’t aware – Shireen Abu Akleh was a household name in the Middle East; she was very well known. She had been covering Palestine for Al Jazeera since 1997. This was a shock for us to hear this person had been killed.  There was a very quick response from the military. They said, well, there was fighting going on. It could have been Palestinian fighters that killed her. They quickly released a video. Actually, there were two videos. One was a video they had taken from fighters themselves that they had released – At a location in Jenin where they had been shooting from – Saying that this could be where the fight or the killers were. Then they released video themselves: body camera footage showed their own location and the configuration of the convoy. This was within just a few hours of the shooting itself.  Again, the footage from all parties involved becomes so important when you’re trying to dissect everything that’s happening. That footage they had taken from Palestinian fighters saying, this is the location of the fighters, B’Tselem – Which is an Israeli human rights group – Very quickly sent one of their researchers to that exact site and showed that it was not possible for those fighters in that location, or any of the Palestinian fighters that day who had been more inside Jenin. There was no clean shot, essentially. It was very windy. It would’ve had to be a magic bullet for it to have been Palestinian fighters, is what I’m saying.  You see this a lot when the Israeli military is accused of killing civilians, of killing Palestinians. This is a pretty tried and true strategy: cast out, let the doubt spread, and then it filters into the press even. But it was impossible to do that in this case, particularly because of the video footage that was available from the Al Jazeera camera person, as well as another civilian who had been filming on his cell phone right before the shooting started.  Chris Hedges: The Israeli narrative mutates, that’s also not uncommon. Talk a bit about its mutation. How, as facts come out, the Israelis respond.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The first response was to say that it might’ve been Palestinians, and then it’s a little bit of a step back. It’s like, well, maybe it was, but maybe not. We don’t know. And then it’s like, well we need to see, because it could have been us, but we don’t know yet. There’s the waiting game, essentially. As that waiting game goes on, in the meantime, various investigations come out from respective news outlets: from the EBP to CNN, the New York Times, The Washington Post, as well as human rights groups like B’Tselem. The United Nations did their own investigation. All of them said it was likely that it came from Israel, but it was the Israeli military that shot her.  Finally, it was in September that the Israeli military put out their final conclusion, because they said that they were conducting an investigation. And their investigation said that, yes, they may have shot her, but that it’s because she got caught in crossfire. The problem is that it’s disputed by witness testimony, and that again, video footage is available. But there haven’t been any consequences. Yeah. They said-  Chris Hedges: Let’s talk about the US response. Shireen was a US citizen, and it’s very telling of the collusion between Israel and Washington, the Biden administration. Talk about the US response, US promises, and investigation. Go into what happened.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. Very quickly, the US was asked about what they were going to do. Like you pointed out, she was an American citizen. At first they said, well we want all the facts. We deplore this, this is awful. The things that they normally say. In June, Secretary of State Blinken said that he wanted a thorough and independent – And that’s the keyword here, independent – Investigation into her killing, so that they can know the facts. The independence is really the key here.  There’s a US office in Israel and Palestine called the US Security Coordinator. Essentially it’s run between the State Department, and the DOD. They were responsible for looking into the killing, initially. They were already starting to go along with the Israeli conclusion by that point, not the Palestinian conclusion, the Israeli conclusion. That’s lying. She was killed by the Israeli military, but it was a crossfire. They were leaning on the crossfire to say it was an accident. In the aftermath, they’ve really stuck to that. One of the things that they’ve also said is that, well, they want to make sure that this never happens again.  So then the question becomes, how do you make sure that this doesn’t happen again? There has to be accountability. But the problem is that you need to have real investigations with real consequences. Otherwise, what you end up with is impunity. That’s what’s happening here, because the US is going along with the Israeli lie. It opens the door to this continuing on. Because if there are no consequences in the killing of a US citizen, a renowned journalist, then what does that mean just for Palestinian civilians?  Chris Hedges: Let’s talk about the bullet, because the Palestinians have the bullet that was extracted from Shireen’s body. The Israelis say they cannot have a conclusive investigation unless they are provided with the bullet. For obvious reasons, the Palestinian Authority is very reticent to give the bullet to the Israelis. And then the Americans step in. Can you speak about what happened?  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The US security coordinator did say that they did a forensic analysis of the bullet, but that it was inconclusive.  Chris Hedges: Well, the US promised an independent investigation if they were provided with the bullet. The bullet was provided to the US and then what happened?  Kavitha Chekuru: The US was provided with the bullet. They did analyze it, and they said that it was inconclusive. But there’s been no independent investigation. However, in November, the news broke that the FBI was going to investigate. Now, there’s not a lot of facts surrounding that though, I will point out. It came out more than 6 months after she was killed. By that point the US had made clear what their stance was on this killing and the idea of investigation, which was there wasn’t going to be an independent investigation run by the US. That was off the table. When it comes to the DOJ and the FBI, their investigations are supposed to be independent of the administration.  There’s not a lot of facts about when this investigation is happening, or if it has already happened, for instance. What we do know though is that Israel isn’t going to cooperate. The Israeli government made that clear. This was the previous government, which is not as right-wing as the current one. I think it’s pretty safe to say that the current one is not going to be cooperating either.  Chris Hedges: Talk about her funeral.  Kavitha Chekuru: Her funeral? I will say, I wasn’t there. I was watching it as a spectator from the States. There had been a state funeral first in Ramallah on May 12, the day before. And then on May 13, they brought her body to Jerusalem to be laid to rest in a Christian cemetery in the old city. And thousands of Palestines had come out to mourn her. This footage was being broadcast live, the whole procession on Al Jazeera English, and Al Jazeera. As soon as they brought the coffin out of the morgue and they started to leave the gates of the hospital to begin the rest of the procession, they were attacked by Israeli security forces in Jerusalem.  It’s shocking. Shocking footage of the way that the security forces attacked these mourners who were carrying the coffin. What her brother told us when we spoke to him was it felt like they were trying to make the mourners drop the coffin.  Chris Hedges: Well, then the coffin almost falls to the ground.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. The mourners made sure to keep it up while they were being beaten. In the footage, you can see them ripping away the Palestinian flag. If people have not watched that footage, I would encourage them to watch it.  Chris Hedges: What do you think the message that Israel intended to impart with the killing, and with the response to the killing? What were they saying, in particular, to the Palestinians?  Kavitha Chekuru: It’s interesting when you think about when journalists are killed in a situation when it’s not a traditional, or typical war. We’re not talking about Ukraine. This may seem a little bit crazy, but earlier in the year I was covering the killings of journalists in Mexico. I think there’s a commonality when you look at why journalists are targeted in these non-traditional conflicts. People don’t want certain things to be known. They don’t want journalists there to document the truth, and I think that’s the case here. We asked that question to the journalists that were there on the day of the shooting and who had been shot at as well. They said the same thing that they think the Israeli government doesn’t want what is happening in the occupied territories to come out, because the situation is getting worse. More Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank last year than any year since, I think, 2004, 2005.  Chris Hedges: When you carried out this investigation, what surprised you the most?  Kavitha Chekuru: The US, they have a tendency – It’s not like this is new – But the way that they are ignoring the very clear facts of what happened. This idea that they have continued to say she was caught in crossfire is a blatant lie. There’s footage that shows that’s not true. It’s that audacity to continue to lie when we’re talking about the killing of a US citizen. That might have been something that stuck with me.  Chris Hedges: Netanyahu’s new government is even more extreme than the old government. And neo-fascist probably isn’t too far from, certainly what many elements of that government is comprised of. It’s a coalition government with the most extreme figures in the Israeli political establishment, many heirs of the terrorist Rabbi Meir Kahane. Where do you see this going? What’s going to happen now?  Kavitha Chekuru: It’s a good question. To be blunt, nowhere good. If we’re talking about what it means for Palestinians, in particular, we’ve seen there’s actually been a lot of protests by Israeli citizens themselves against this new government already.  Chris Hedges: Yeah. But mostly around judicial reform, if I have that correct, not about the occupation.  Kavitha Chekuru: No. But if we’re talking specifically for Palestinians, there’s nothing good. The government has even made it very, very clear from day one that this is going to be the most extreme Israeli government in recent memory, and that they regard Palestinian land as Israeli land. Even looking at the way settlers have been acting in the past couple of weeks, in particular, you can see that emboldenment. So it’s even more important that journalists are able to do their job in occupied territories.  Chris Hedges: Where are we going? I think Al Jazeera wants to bring this before the International Criminal Court, if I have that correct? They don’t want to let it drop.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. I should say, I don’t want to speak as a representative for Al Jazeera in that way, because it’s a legal case, and I don’t think I’m really qualified to do that.  Chris Hedges: But they are seeking redress in international forums. Maybe you can at least explain that.  Kavitha Chekuru: Yeah. They did bring a petition to the ICC at the beginning of December. There has been a wider petition from Palestine human rights groups and lawyers in regards to the Israeli occupation, and for the ICC to investigate. I would say this is one part of that. Getting accountability in any situation where it’s a Palestinian killed by the Israeli military, very rarely is there justice. I hope that’s not the case here, but if you look at the past, it tells you that it’s very difficult to achieve.  Chris Hedges: Great.

Hossein Salami, the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), made the remarks when addressing a commemoration ceremony in the central province of Isfahan, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.  Elaborating on Tehran's revenge for the U.S. assassination of Soleimani in January 2020, Salami said Iran threw the first ""slap"" by launching missiles at U.S. Ain al-Asad base in the Iraqi province of Anbar just a few days after Soleimani's death.  ""The second slap is nothing but the U.S. gradual pullout from the region,"" the commander said, noting the ""third slap"" has not been delivered yet.  On Jan. 3, 2020, the U.S. military assassinated Soleimani in a drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport. The assassination was condemned by Iran as ""state terrorism.""  In January this year, a senior Iranian judicial official said 94 U.S. nationals have been charged with involving in Soleimani's assassination, stressing that no one will be immune from prosecution in this case. ■","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5uZXdzLmNuLzIwMjMwNTIwL2JmYTFiZDMyNTllNTRjY2JiMWY4OTI1OTc4ODY0MDg3L2MuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The production will begin June 18 and run through July 16, with opening night set for June 25. Golden Globe winner Debbie Allen is directing. It will also mark basketball star LeBron James' first foray into theatrical producing.  Fisher, who performed the role in the play's Off-Broadway premiere at New York Theatre Workshop in 2013, will co-star alongside The Bear star and Obie Award winner Edwin Lee Gibson as Hollywood icon Stepin Fetchit (a stage name for Lincoln Perry). Gibson originally helped develop the role with Power, but did not perform in the work's Off-Broadway run.  Inspired by true events, the work tracks the unlikely friendship between the heavyweight champion and Fetchit. The latter, a somewhat controversial figure, is considered the first successful Black film actor, but he primarily found that success playing roles deeply steeped in racist stereotypes—his onscreen persona was famously billed as ""The Laziest Man in the World.""  Fisher and Gibson will be joined by Wilkie Ferguson II as Brother Rashid, Alexis Floyd as Sonji Clay, and Bruce Nozick as William Fox.  “It’s extraordinary to see these characters come to life through Will Power’s creative and dynamic writing,” says Allen in a statement. “The play really paints a picture of the climate of Hollywood in the 1930s when Step was the highest paid Black actor of the time, and then in 1965 when heavyweight champion Ali prepared for his second bout with Sonny Liston and had to face the ramifications and tensions around declaring his embrace of the Nation of Islam in the wake of the Malcom X assassination. I’m really looking forward to the rehearsal process and exploring these complexities with the actors and creative team.”  The California production will feature set design by Sibyl Wickersheimer, costume design by Sara Ryung Clement, lighting design by Tom Ontiveros, sound design by Lindsay Jones, and projection design by Pablo Molina. Casting is by Kim Coleman, and Ed De Shae is stage manager.  The production will be the first stage project for The SpringHill Company, founded by LeBron James and Maverick Carter to develop and produce works about sports and entertainment. Their screen work has included The Shop, Space Jam: A New Legacy, Hustle, and What's My Name: Muhammad Ali, among other titles.

"assassination","2002-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:32:22","New Delhi: The killing of terrorist outfit Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) head Paramjit Singh Panjwar in Lahore on 6 May has brought back the spotlight on a list of 20 wanted criminals and terrorists that India handed to Pakistan for their extradition over two decades ago in 2002.  Apart from Panjwar, the list include wanted criminals and terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, as well as those accused of hijacking the IC-814 in 1999 and those involved in the 1993 Mumbai blasts who had fled to Pakistan.  Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, 26/11 mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba co-founder Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, Hizbul Mujahideen founder Syed Salahuddin, fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim and his key associate Chhota Shakeel are among the other wanted men.  ThePrint looks into where some of the remaining mentioned in the list are — starting with Masood Azhar and those associated with the IC-814 Indian Airlines hijacking.  JeM founder Masood Azhar was among three top terrorists released by India as part of the hostage release deal following the Indian Airlines IC 814 plane hijack by his brother and supporters.  Upon his release, the Bahawalpur-based maulana-cum-mercenary founded JeM which attacked Parliament on December 13, 2001. Azhar is also wanted for an attack on the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Assembly on October 1, 2001, in which 38 people were killed.  In 2008, he was connected to the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Further, he is believed to be the mastermind of the Pathankot attack in 2016 and the Pulwama attack in 2019.  According to news reports, the Pakistan government has asked the Taliban to trace and arrest the JeM chief in Afghanistan. He is still far away from being extradited to India.  Meanwhile, Masood Azhar’s elder brother Ibrahim Athar, Zahoor Mistri, Shahid Akhtar Sayed, and Azhar Yusuf — the IC-814 hijackers — were also part of the list sent in 2002. Zahoor Mistri was killed in a shooting in Karachi in March 2022. Masood Azhar attended the funeral of Mistri, according to news reports.  Ibrahim Athar, meanwhile, is also wanted for his role in the Parliament attack in 2001. According to Ministry of Home Affairs documents, as of 2020, a red corner notice was issued against the Pakistani national to bring him to India. The MHA notified Athar as a terrorist under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2020.  Azhar Yusuf was believed to be heading the JeM’s Balakot camp that was targeted by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in February 2019. Reports suggest that Shahid Akhtar Sayed has shifted from Karachi to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in search of a safe harbour.  A former engineer-turned-fanatic preacher and co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hafiz Mohammed Saeed is known to be the mastermind behind the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. Originally, he was known to operate from Muridke town, near Lahore in Pakistan.  In 2020, under pressure from the US and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a Pakistan anti-terrorism court convicted Saeed on terrorism-related charges and sentenced him to five and a half years in prison.  One year on, Pakistan accused India of carrying out a bomb blast near Saeed’s house in Lahore. Consequently, the three accused were sentenced to life imprisonment.  However, Saeed is still far away from an Indian prison.  Absconding since 1993, Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin is reportedly operating from Pakistan. In 2020, India designated him as a terrorist. In April, two properties owned by his sons were attached in a terror-related investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Hizbul Mujahideen had taken responsibility for several attacks on security forces in J&K.  Also Read: LTTE, JeM, ULFA – List of 42 terror outfits banned by MHA before Popular Front of India    D-Company & associates  Underworld Dawood Ibrahim — the man behind the planning and financing of 13 explosions in Mumbai in 1993 that claimed almost 300 lives — is wanted in connection with cases of arms supply, counterfeiting, drugs trade, funding alleged criminals, murder and smuggling. He reportedly lives in and operates from Karachi, Pakistan.  A key associate of Dawood, Chhota Shakeel is wanted for murders, extortions, kidnappings, and blackmailing of businessmen and film stars in India.  Accused of executing the Mumbai blasts, ‘Tiger’ Ibrahim Memon is also wanted in several cases of murder, extortion, kidnap, terrorism and smuggling arms and explosives in India.  Apart from being wanted in cases of terrorism and smuggling, Ayub Memon is accused of helping his brother Tiger Memon carry out the Mumbai blasts.  Further, Mumbai blast convict Yakub Memon — the brother of Tiger and Ayub — was hanged in a Nagpur jail in 2015.  Two more Dawood associates Ishaaq Atta Hussain and Sagir Sabir Ali Shaikh also feature on the list for their role in a conspiracy to kill former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani. Reports suggest that they are operating from Karachi.  Khalistan exponents & others  The list also mentioned the founders of Khalistani outfits, including Wadhawa Singh Babbar, Lakhbir Singh Rode, and Gajinder Singh.  Wadhawa heads the Babbar Khalsa International, which was designated as a terrorist outfit by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in 2020.  During the decades-long insurgency in Punjab in the 1970s and 1980s, the outfit took part in several killings and assassinations. He is also wanted for the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in 1995.  According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, Wadhawa is still operating from Pakistan.  Rode, a relative of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, heads the pro-Khalistan International Sikh Youth Federation. He is wanted in cases of arms smuggling, conspiracy to attack government leaders in Delhi, and inciting religious hatred in Punjab.  Rode is also said to have links with radical preacher Amritpal Singh, who was arrested in April after a month-long chase. He is allegedly based in Lahore.  Head of the pro-Khalistan outfit Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh was sentenced in Pakistan for hijacking an Indian Airlines plane to Lahore in 1981. Later, he was released from jail in 1994.  According to a report in The Tribune, in 2022, he posted a photo on his Facebook page that shows him standing in front of Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hasan Abdal in Pakistan’s Punjab.  Khalistan Zindabad Force chief Ranjit Singh ‘Neeta’ is also on the list. He faces at least 11 terrorism cases in India. Further, ‘Neeta’ is among the accused in the 1996 bombing of the Jhelum Express, as well as attacks on buses in 1997, the blasts on Sealdah and Pooja express trains in 2000, and the explosion at Jalandhar bus station in April 2006.  Like Rode, Neeta is said to be based in Lahore.  The last in the list is Delhi-born Abdul Karim alias Tunda who is blamed for more than 30 bomb blasts in New Delhi and parts of northern India in 1996-97. He was on the run for over a decade, including in Pakistan, before he was arrested near the India-Nepal border  in 2013.  In February 2023, a court acquitted him in the 1997 Rohtak twin blasts. He, however, remains in jail for his role in a bomb blast in Sonipat in 1996.  (Edited by Tony Rai)  Also Read: Pakistan is imploding.

"assassination","2023-04-06","Not Discerned","{""Tennessee"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:09:26","Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state’s capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, opponents have criticized the Republican-dominated legislature’s move as creating a “separate and unequal” court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  Supporters justified the law as an effort to curb the city’s crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed how states move. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of “white backlash” working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and Legislative Disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln’s assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: “Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.”  The Civil Rights Era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond’s First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell’s situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell’s actions and refused to seat him until the committee’s report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn’t take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter Movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another “white backlash” in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county’s population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state’s roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators—Justin Pearson and Justin Jones—for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, processes for filling vacant seats temporarily reinstated both Pearson and Jones , but they still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature’s rules—but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

Gelendzhik Palace has its own church, casino, fully-equipped gym, ice hockey rink and ‘entertainment room’ – complete with stripper poles.  The sprawling 190,000-square-foot complex is sealed off from the rest of Russia by 17,000 acres of woodland guarded by the FSB security services as well as special no-fly and no-boat zones.  But just when you thought the designers had ticked every box, they appear to have neglected one very big one – hide the plans showing the secret tunnels underneath.  The schematics were posted online a decade ago and remained accessible until 2016, having been originally published by contractors Metro Style to showcase their work.  They reveal an underground complex consisting of two separate blast-proof tunnels connected by an elevator which descends roughly 50 metres below the surface.  Vladimir Putin chairs a cabinet meeting via videoconference at Kremlin in Moscow (Picture: AP)  The plans reveal two tunnels roughly 50m underground  They show three tunnel entrances  According to the plans, each is encased in thick concrete and supplied with plenty of fresh water, ventilation and cables  Experts believe the plans are 'intended for someone to survive or escape'  According to the plans, each is encased in thick concrete and supplied with plenty of fresh water, ventilation and cables to support VIPs for up to weeks at a time.  Structural engineer Thaddeus Gabryszewski said they have ‘all kinds of safety and security’, suggesting they are ‘intended for someone to survive or escape’.  The precautions may be more than paranoia on Putin’s part – earlier this month Russia claimed he had been targeted in an attempted assassination following an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin.  Michael C Kimmage, a former US State Department official and Cold War expert, told Insider: ‘Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia.  ‘So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by elections, he is going to seek to maximize his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  The plans, which were uncovered by jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, show the tunnels measure approximately 40 and 60 meters long, respectively, and six metres wide - creating more than 6,000 sq ft of potential living space  The complex is surrounded by acres of guarded woodland (Picture: FBK)  A hatch visible in drone footage (Picture: FBK)  They dubbed one the ‘tasting room’ amid reports it contains full living quarters where Putin and his cronies could take in the views while remaining safe.  It stated: ‘It is a huge window that offers the best possible sea view.  ‘Here you can enjoy a glass of wine... this is not some kind of balcony where you are constantly in danger, but a very safe underground place where nothing threatens you.’  The second passageway is thought to be the preferred mode of escape, leading to a hatch on the coastline visible in drone footage captured by the group.  Mr Kimmage told Insider the location of the bunker – some 1,000 miles away from Moscow – suggests Putin is not merely intending on constructing a plush getaway, but a bolthole.  He said: ‘The two times there has been a big transition in Russian history — 1917 and 1991 — the status of the capital city and the leader's position there has been a big issue.  ‘Putin is solving for that contingency by establishing a network of residences that are as far from the centre as possible. So a tunnel system within the Black Sea complex makes a lot of sense.  ‘Even without an active threat, he's going to be worrying about this eventuality.’  Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

""We continue to urge all parties to exercise restraint and to refrain from provocative actions or rhetoric that inflames tensions. This certainly includes racist statements and actions, as well as violence,"" the statement said. ""We unequivocally condemn racist language of any form. Hateful chants such as 'Death to Arabs' are outrageous and unacceptable.""  Tens of thousands of people participated in the Flag March, a contentious event in which right-wing Jewish youth parade with Israeli flags through the Old City, including the Muslim Quarter.  Before the march reached Jerusalem's Old City, clashes erupted between Jewish marchers and Palestinian residents. In one incident, verbal insults hurled by Jewish participants turned into pushing and physical assault against the Palestinians. One resident was knocked to the ground and briefly beaten; law enforcement intervened and dispersed the Palestinians involved.  Participants in the march also attacked journalists in the Old City, wounding three, including Haaretz correspondent Deiaa Haj Yahia. All were lightly wounded, received medical treatment at the scene and continued to work. Police removed the assailants from the area, and later arrested two suspects in the attack, one of them a minor, who was in possession of a knife.  In addition, photographers and correspondents reported several attacks by police on journalists. In one case, Haaretz photographer Emil Salman was attacked by a police officer while carrying out his work.  Salman said that while protesters were being cleared from Jerusalem's Tunnels Road, he was removed from the area and shoved by one of the officers. He was released shortly after. Police claimed that Salman refused to show his identification, but Salman stated that he was not given the option of doing so while being pushed by the officers.  In another instance, an officer pushed CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman, whose arm was injured as a result. At the Damascus Gate in the Old City, an officer grabbed the neck of photojournalist Kobi Wolf.  Some of the march's participants shouted racist and nationalist slogans during the parade, part of which passed through the Muslim Quarter. Hundreds were filmed shouting ""Death to Arabs"" and ""A Jew is a soul, an Arab is the son of a whore"" near the Damascus Gate. Earlier, groups of young Jewish men were filmed dancing and singing ""May your village burn down.""  Despite high tensions and a recent ceasefire with Islamic Jihad and Gaza, the march ended on Thursday night without significant incidents. Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' political bureau, suggested that Israel's alertness ""proves the fear of the settlers,"" saying that the extensive security measures taken by Israel for the march ""only highlight the perceived weakness of the Zionist entity.""  Meanwhile, Energy Minister Yisrael Katz delivered a speech at the parade in which he threatened Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, saying that any attempt to disrupt or harm the march would result in his assassination by Israel, ""just like the fate of his associates in the Islamic Jihad.""  Hundreds of Palestinian demonstrators gathered near the Gaza-Israel border amid calls of Palestinian factions to protest the Jerusalem Flag March. Israeli security forces fired tear gas when the demonstrators approached the border.  Jerusalem Day is celebrated in Israel as the Hebrew anniversary of the country's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War and the reunification of Jerusalem, after the eastern side of the holy city and the West Bank, which had been held by Jordan since 1948, were conquered by Israel.  In 2021, tensions in the city came to a head during Jerusalem Day, which coincided with the final days of Ramadan. That morning, clashes on the Temple Mount compound left more than 300 Palestinians wounded, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent, prompting an Israeli decision to bar Jews from entering the holy site, one of several flashpoints in the city. This culminated in the Flag March, during which Hamas fired rockets at Jerusalem, kicking off a major operation in Gaza and violence in mixed Jewish-Arab cities throughout Israel.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTA1LTE4L3R5LWFydGljbGUvLnByZW1pdW0vamVydXNhbGVtLWZsYWctbWFyY2gtZHJhd3MtdGVucy1vZi10aG91c2FuZHMtbWFyY2hlcnMtYXNzYXVsdC1wYWxlc3RpbmlhbnMtam91cm5hbGlzdHMvMDAwMDAxODgtMmZkNC1kOTE0LWFmOGMtYWZmNWI0NzMwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","0301-04-24","Not Discerned","{""Cappadocia"", ""Abruzzes"", ""Italy""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:17:15","By Hovsep Daghdigian  Among the saints revered in the Armenian and other Christian churches is Surb (Saint) Hakob, also referred to as Saint Jacob of Nisibis, and Saint James of Mtsbin. This “Saint James” should not to be confused with other Saint James’s. Nisibis, also known as Mtsbin, is a city in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, about 75 km SE of Dikranagerd. Christians of Nisibis, which included many Armenians, traced their Christian origins to Saint Thaddeus who, with Saint Bartholomew, preached and were martyred in Armenia prior to Armenia becoming the first nation to accept Christianity early in the 4th c.  In the 4th c Rome and Persia were contending for power in Armenia and the region. The Persian king sent an Armenian traitor, Anak, to assassinate Armenia’s king Khosrov and his family. Members of the Armenian court, enraged by their King’s assassination, killed Anak and all his family members that they could find. Anak’s son Gregory, however, escaped to Cappadocia where he was educated within its Christian community. Similarly, the murdered Armenian King Khosrov’s son, Drtad, was sent to Rome where he received an education as befitted a future king. Rome later returned Drtad to the Armenian throne. Passing through Cappadocia, Drtad and Gregory met and returned together to Armenia. Gregory converted Drtad, and the Armenian nation, to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming “Gregory the Illuminator”, founder of the Armenian church.  Hakob probably was related to Gregory, either as a cousin or nephew. Some sources indicate he too may have spent some time in Cappadocia. As a youth Hakob abandoned city life, devoting himself to religion, and living an austere existence in the mountains near Nisibis. He became known for his compassion, honesty, sincerity and strong sense of justice. When the bishop of the large Christian community of Nisibis died, the church fathers tried to convince Hakob to take the position, despite his lack of refinement. Numerous attempts to convince him finally succeeded.  Bishop Hakob of Nisibis participated in numerous Christian councils attended as well by representatives of the Armenian church, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD which established the Nicene Creed, to which the Syriac and Armenian church adhered, and which is a fundamental profession of faith in the Armenian church. Byzantine emperor Constantine also attended the council and developed immense respect for Bishop Hakob.  Hakob is reported to have performed many miracles. In one instance a couple of men asked him for a donation to help bury their friend who, faking death, was lying on the ground. Hakob said a prayer, after which the men, checking their friend on the ground, discovered that he was indeed dead. They beseeched Hakob to bring their friend back to life, which he did.  While traveling through a village, Hakob encountered a group of young women washing in a stream. They immodestly refused to cover themselves properly in the presence of a stranger. In response to a prayer by Surb Hakob, the stream dried up and the women’s hair turned white. The villagers urged Hakob to allow the stream to flow again, which he did, but the immodest women’s white hair remained.  Hakob urged a Persian judge to reconsider an unfair judgement which he had issued. The judge refused. When Surb Hakob, with a prayer, turned a stone into dust the judge reversed his decision.  Following the death of Byzantine Emperor Constantine in 337, the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II saw an opportunity to recapture territory Persia had previously lost to Rome. He attacked Roman held territories in upper Mesopotamia, Armenia, and in 338 attacked Nisibis. Hakob mounted Nisibis’ defensive walls and, praying, caused a swarm of insects to attack the large invading army which included war machines and elephants. The insects so irritated the soldiers and elephants that they caused the army to retreat. The Persian general, eyeing the tower upon which Surb Hakob stood, claimed he saw Emperor Constantine, who had previously died, leading the defense. The Persian assault failed.  Troubled by the weakening faith of his people, Surb Hakob desired to find Noah’s “redeeming Ark”. He determined that if he could retrieve and display a piece of the Ark from Mt. Ararat[i], this would bolster his people’s faith.  One variant of Sp. Hakob’s jourrney up Mt. Ararat is described by Pavstos Buzand[ii], a 5th c Armenian historian. Other accounts differ slightly:  As Surb Hakob ascended the parched slope of Mt. Ararat, he with his colleagues grew tired and in need of water. They fell to the ground and prayed. A spring then gushed forth near Hakob’s head. According to Pavstos Buzand, “the spring, called Hakob’s spring, remains to this day”. Proceeding further up Mt. Ararat, near the summit, Hakob grew tired and fell asleep. An angel descended, left a piece of wood from the Ark near his head, and indicated that Hakob must search no further. As he descended the people around Ararat rejoiced at the presence of such a holy man who brought a gift of wood from the Ark. Surb Hakob then proceeded to visit the “great servant of the Armenian king”, Prince Manachir, near Lake Van whom he had heard was a merciless and unjust man. But Hakob hoped to soften Manachir’s heart and install in him fear of God. Instead, Prince Mananchir scorned Surb Hakob, throwing 800 innocent prisoners into the sea. Hakob, with his colleagues grieving for the innocent victims, journeyed to the base of a nearby mountain. Again, he prayed and a spring came forth from the ground. Climbing to the summit of the mountain, he cursed the realm of the prince causing the death of Prince Manachir, his wife, and his seven sons. According to another source, though, one of Manachir’s sons repented and thus survived.  Surb Hakob Monastery, on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat, was built in 341 AD at the place where Hakob received the wood from the Ark. There may have been a church, St. James, in the nearby village of Akori[iii]. The monastery was said to be of a cruciform plan with a central dome. In 1829 Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot, with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, were the first people known to summit Mt. Ararat. On the way to the summit, they visited Surb Hakob monastery which had engraved inscriptions dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. In the summer of 1840, an earthquake or volcanic explosion destroyed Surb Hakob monastery and the village of Akori. Many of the residents subsequently settled in Kamaris, a town in Kotayk province in the present Republic of Armenian. Currently the small Kurdish village of Yenidogan (“New Village”) is situated on or near the site of Akori. The monastery no longer exists, though there remain remnants of an Armenian cemetery with Armenian tombstones.  A number of Armenian churches and chapels named “Surp Hakob,” or equivalently “St. James of Nisibus” or “Saint James of Mtsbin”, exist. The history of some of these churches remains obscure.  About a mile outside the village of Kolotak, Martakert Province, in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabagh) is Hakobavank, founded in the 5-7th c, which underwent modifications until the 12th c. In the 14th c. the monastery became an important center of the region of Mets Arank, acquiring the name of Metsaranits Monastery. Between the 9th and 18th c the buildings were modified and maintained, with relics of Sp. Hakob kept until the 19th c. The monastery contains two churches, rooms for clergy, and in the Middle Ages was a pilgrimage site for Armenians in Eastern Armenia.  In 2022 a renovation project was initiated to restore a workable place of worship for the villagers, and refugees settling in Kolotak coming from areas of Artsakh now occupied by Azerbaijan. The monastery is also an archaeological and architectural site, with an inscription dating to 853 and medieval water pipes made of clay and wooden branches on the ground. A description of the completed Hakobavank restoration project can be seen on the reArmenia web page at https://rearmenia.com/en/collaborations/lets-restore-the-hakobavank-monastery?tab=updates .  Surb Hakob died either in 338 or 350 and is buried in the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis. A fragment of wood from the Ark resides in the museum at Echmiadzin. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, Surb Hakob of Nisibis’ holiday is celebrated on the Saturday between December 12-18.  ————————————————-  [i] Early accounts cite the Ark as having landed on Mt. Qardu, southern Turkey, in a region called “Kordukh” in Armenian.

You’ve probably heard of Botak Chin, Malaysia’s No.1 gangster back in the 70s and 80s. Malaysians nationwide were hooked on the news stories of his brazen crimes. We’ve not seen a more sensationalised gang leader till this day, with many still interested in his tales of notoriety.  This infamous gun loving criminal actually came from very humble beginnings. Here are a few details about Botak Chin’s life that you may not know of.  1.He’s not Botak (Bald)  Botak Chin, also known by his real name, Wong Swee Chin, is actually NOT bald. It’s believed that “Botak” stands for “Bantu Orang Tak Ada Kerja” which translates to “Helping people who are without jobs”.  Other reports say that Botak is a combination of three Hokkien words which are “Bo Tak Chin” which means “No (Bo), Work (Tak) Chin (Cina)” or “Cina Tiada Kerja” in Malay or “jobless Chinese”.  We’ll leave this theory for the Hokkien speakers to discuss in the comments!  2. He had 10 siblings  On March 3rd, 1951, Chin was born into a big family. He had 10 siblings and a father who worked for the Malayan Railways.  He attended Methodist Boys’ Secondary School in Sentul after receiving his education at a Chinese Vernacular Primary School. However, his education was cut short at the age of 15 when he quit school to work as a fishmonger.  It is believed that this was the period in which his mother passed away, leading him to spend even more time away from home.  Through his delinquent friends who he often did petty crime with, Chin joined a Malaysian Chinese Triad group called 360 (Sam Pak Lok) where he was impressed by the group’s collection of firearms.  3. He loved guns  Botak Chin was most famous for his guns. His power hunger for guns eventually built up a personal collection of 19 firearms, 5 grenades and 1000 bullets. Botak Chin loved showing off his weapons every chance he got. He would swagger about the Sentul market, openly showing off his guns to everyone.  While Chin did not bring harm to any children or civilians during his crime sprees, he did kill a number of security guards and police officers.  An abandoned tin mine in Sentul was the gang’s hideout, where they would practise their gun shooting on stray dogs roaming around.  4. Imprisoned for 5 years before he was freed  Botak Chin was known to go on a spree of armed robberies, even 8 in a month. After one spree near Kuala Lumpur City in 1969, Botak Chin was arrested for the first time and sentenced to seven years in jail. He was released after five for good behavior.  However, jail time did not deter him from crime. In fact, immediately after his release in 1975, he and his gang managed to purchase a new set of firearms and ammunition from a gun runner in Thailand.  5. He needed a special squad of cops to pursue him  A squad, called the Magnificent 12, was led by Deputy Superintendent (DSP) S. Kulasingam to specifically hunt down Botak Chin.  In their pursuit, the Magnificent 12 managed to gun down seven of the gang members, though they didn’t get Botak Chin himself. Enraged, Chin plotted his revenge and orchestrated an assassination attempt on Kulasingam, who thankfully escaped with minor injuries.  6. Survived 6 gunshots before he was hanged  Kulasingam finally got the final showdown he sought for when the squad ambushed the gang in Eng Leong sawmill on Jalan Ipoh.  A fierce firefight ensued which saw several more gang members killed and, in the chaos, Chin was wounded with 6 gunshots (but survived) and was then arrested.  He faced multiple criminal charges with his illegal possession of firearms, killing a number of security guards and policemen, earning him the death sentence.  While he was held in Pudu Jail, he attempted to escape but failed 3 TIMES and eventually was hanged in 1981.  7. Called himself Robin Hood of Malaysia  Despite being a pain to the police force, members of the public did sympathise with the gang leader. Some even compared him to the legendary Robin Hood.  Stories have been told of Chin giving away the proceeds of his crimes to the needy, with one tale relating how he gave an elderly ice-cream seller hundreds of ringgit out of his own pocket.  He is also said to have some level of moral standards, abstaining from targeting poor folks as well as never putting children in harm’s way.  Others did point out that these supposed acts of kindness could have just been his way of keeping possible witnesses against him quiet.  So there you have it, a brief snippet into Malaysia’s No.1 gangster in the 70s-80s. Of course it’s clear that Chin was an ambitious daredevil criminal but we just can’t help but be curious about his life.  Do know of any other infamous gang leaders we should cover? Let us know in the comments.

"assassination","1983-08-21","Not Discerned","{""Ninoy"", ""Pangasinan"", ""Philippines""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:21:38","It’s bad enough that the 'golden age' myths are being perpetuated by vloggers and trolls, but way worse when done by other economists  On Monday, May 15, 2023, the Philippine Center for Economic Development (PCED) – a government agency in support of the UP School of Economics – kicked off a series of lectures to commemorate its 50th anniversary this year.  The speakers are all past directors-general of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), and the talks are scheduled every month of 2023, from May to November.  The inaugural talk on May 15 was made by Dr. Gerardo Sicat, 87, the top economist of the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. In 1970, Sicat served as chair of the National Economic Council, and then became the first director-general of NEDA in 1973. These institutions were designed to undertake national planning toward socioeconomic development.  Sicat’s inaugural lecture on May 15 was quite fitting. He left his mark in the economics profession of the country by establishing a number of institutions, including PCED itself, as well as the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), the government’s think tank.  He gave a lecture reminiscing about his time in government during the Marcos dictatorship. It was natural to expect him to wax nostalgic. But some claims he made – along with former prime minister Cesar Virata, 92, who was in attendance and in fact one of Sicat’s discussants – unfortunately whitewashed certain aspects of the economy during that time.  The Sicat ‘bump’  For instance, Sicat presented a graph showing the upward trend of national output (measured by GDP or gross domestic product) over time.  He then pointed out that if you run a line across this trend, there was supposedly a “bump above the long-term trend of growth” during his time in office. He added, GDP “for a while it was up there, and then suddenly it drops, and then…for a long time it drops below the long-term trend…”  In short, the economy supposedly grew more rapidly around the time he was in office, and then underperformed starting the Corazon Aquino administration.  This was improper use of statistics and graphs.  Figure 1.  First, running a line across those data points is ill-advised because of a distinct “structural break” in the series around 1984 and 1985, when the Philippine economy suffered its worst postwar recession or downturn in the dying years of Martial Law. (You can read all about that in my book titled, False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.)  The presence of such break in the series would naturally make it appear that GDP was above-average in the 1970s, and below-average in the 1990s onward. Simply, you don’t just connect two separate trends using one trendline. If you implement the proper statistical corrections (which a colleague of mine at UPSE explored recently), such a big bump during Sicat’s time would all but disappear.  ‘Ninoy shock’  Sicat also showed another graph showing the growth of GDP over time, but this time labeled the steep decline starting 1983 as the “Ninoy shock,” referring of course to the August 21, 1983, assassination of the former senator.  He then showed alternative scenarios of how GDP would’ve grown had the “Ninoy shock” not happened. He said, “In the year 2000, if the growth path were lower, we would’ve achieved a real GDP…that was equivalent to the real GDP that the country had obtained in the year 2008. So that’s eight years lost in our growth. If it happened that there was a higher growth path, it would’ve been 10 years.”  Figure 2.  Right after presenting this, Sicat became defensive: “Now I’m not posing any judgmental issue here…” He added that he deliberately chose not to focus on it for his talk, because he would “get into trouble” and “so many issues” in the graph may be raised. “I won’t even answer questions if you ask me, what about this and that,” he said.  Here are some of those issues Sicat tried to avoid.  First, there was no explanation how projections he called “low growth path” and “high growth path” were obtained. Also, the lines and points in the graph are unaligned and seem arbitrary.  Second, when speaking about development, economists typically look at GDP per person, not GDP itself. And data show that after dipping in 1982 (even before Ninoy was killed), GDP per person in the country fell and didn’t recover until 2003. That’s 21 years called now the “lost decades of development” – far longer than the eight or 10 years that Sicat showed and attributed to the “Ninoy shock.”  Third, and most importantly, it’s unfair to label the dip in GDP as “Ninoy shock” when in fact the economy was worsening way before Ninoy came back to the country. The seeds of the crisis were planted as early as the mid-1970s. Using such a label conceals the fact that it was the Marcos government that was ultimately responsible for the economic crisis.  Sicat later added that the Ninoy shock “broke the nation’s back,” because after that, “international conference on the Philippine sovereign debt fell apart,” our creditors stopped lending, and we became “alone in the world.”  This is another gross mischaracterization of what had happened. Creditors stopped lending when, in late 1983, after Ninoy’s assassination, the Marcos government declared a debt moratorium. Essentially, the Marcos government said to the world we could no longer pay our debts. That stemmed from the profligate spending and irresponsible debt accumulation of the regime.  Sicat did mention in passing there was “looming” debt, but brushed it aside by citing the experiences of debt-ridden countries like Mexico whose debt crises “passed.”  This is the wrong comparison to make. As Professor Emeritus Emmanuel de Dios wrote back in 2015, “It is instructive that neither Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, nor any major Asian country catastrophically experienced negative growth in the early 1980s. The Philippines was the exception…. This suggests that there was nothing unavoidable about the crisis the Philippines suffered, and that it was the result instead of failed policies.”  Using his framing, Sicat downplayed the repercussions of the Marcosian debt crisis which depleted our international reserves, led to the debt moratorium, and fixed with necessary stabilization measures that ignited a full-blown economic crisis.  Sicat also put too much emphasis on the economic shocks in the 1970s and 1980s, like the oil price shocks due to OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] and the interest rate shock due to the steep rise of interest rates in the US in the early 1980s (Figure 3). He also lumped together the interest rate shock and the “Ninoy shock,” and pointed out that because of these GDP growth even became negative.  This is plainly wrong. GDP dropped by more than 7% not in 1983, but in 1984, then again in 1985. Also, in explaining the recession, there was no mention of the profligate spending and borrowing of the dictatorship, which, more than anything else, eventually brought the nation to its knees.  Figure 3.  Sicat went on by showing another graph of inflation, and here the “biggest shock was the combination of the interest rate shock plus the Ninoy shock.”  Again, this is wrong. Inflation shot up to more than 50% in 1984 largely because of the severe depreciation of the peso due to the conditionalities set by the International Monetary Fund in stabilizing the damaged Marcosian economy.  In the first place, if the technocrats had not allowed the economy to be so mismanaged and debt-ridden, we need not have declared a debt moratorium and we wouldn’t have to be “stabilized” by the IMF.  Figure 4.  For his part, former prime minister Cesar Virata claimed in the Q&A that Philippine debt ballooned because the banks wanted to give us big loans rather than small loans.  He said, “The problem during that time was that the Western banks…would not like to lend small things, they always want to lend big things with the guarantee of the government.” Also, he said the Western banks conspired to bring down the Marcos regime.  Oh, what spin!  Other Martial Law myths  Sicat made other claims about various aspects of Martial Law that also need to be given proper context or outright corrected.  First, he said near the beginning of his lecture that Martial Law was declared because Marcos “discovered, in his own analysis, that the country was in danger and decided Martial Law was the solution.”  But espousing this view only perpetrates Marcos’ dubious justifications for Martial Law. It also masks the truth that Marcos did it primarily to overextend his stay in power.  Second, Sicat proudly listed down a long list of infrastructure projects built during the regime. He even claimed that on a per-year basis, adjusting for the regime’s 21 years, Marcos would probably still be “the best” when it comes to infrastructure.  But he omitted mentioning that many of those infrastructure projects were extravagant, needless, and largely used as vehicles for corruption.  He did mention in passing the notorious white elephant, the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant: “Unfortunately, this…was not put to use by the successor government for political reasons.” No mention of the myriad problems that went into its construction. No mention of the multimillion-dollar commissions earned by Herminio Disini, the crony broker, and ex-president Marcos himself.  Sicat also mentioned the “protected industries” that were “highly indebted to state financial enterprises,” and which he “criticized in [his] academic work.” But he didn’t say that many of the protections and advantages were coming from the dictator himself, and those firms obtained money from the Marcos government at the behest of the former president himself (hence, the term “behest loans”).  In the latter part of his talk, Sicat also bemoaned the OFW phenomenon, saying that we don’t want a situation where our national income (taking into account OFWs’ earnings) is always ahead of GDP. Instead, we want to attract foreign capital and promote domestic economic activity and job creation.  But again he neglected to say that the labor exportation policy was a deliberate policy of the Marcos regime, and in fact people were encouraged to work abroad so that the remittances they sent back to their families could be used to replenish our depleting stocks of dollars – depleting precisely because of the ballooning debt of the regime, among other things.  Whitewashing galore  Sicat did not always see eye-to-eye with Marcos, most notably on the continued protection of domestic industries from international competition. Sicat’s push for liberalization was thwarted by strong lobby by industrialists, many of whom were Marcos cronies. Maybe that’s one reason why he exited the regime in 1980, well ahead of the economic crisis.  But more than 50 years since Martial Law was declared, it’s unfortunate that Marcos’ technocrats are still trying to justify or defend the dictatorship. They are still making it appear that the economy back then was stellar and that many things got worse when Marcos was ousted by the People Power Revolution.  It’s bad enough that the “golden age” myths are being perpetuated by vloggers and trolls, but way worse when done by other economists. – Rappler.com  JC Punongbayan, PhD is an assistant professor at the UP School of Economics and the author of False Nostalgia: The Marcos “Golden Age” Myths and How to Debunk Them.

But suspects should not be tortured, the president asserts.  ""Imran Khan did not oppose new army chief's appointment.""  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan should openly condemn the May 9 events, President Arif Alvi said Thursday, in which public properties and military installations were attacked.  In an interview on Geo News' programme ""Capital Talk"", the president — a close aide of the PTI chief — called for taking action against the miscreants involved in the events.  The PTI leadership — including the party chairman — have condemned the attacks in which the General Headquarters, Rawalpindi, was also targeted and called for a Supreme Court-led probe into the events.  The violent protests were triggered after Khan's arrest in the Al-Qadir Trust case which led to the deaths of at least 10 people and injured several others, prompting the authorities to arrest thousands of PTI workers.  After the supporters attacked army installations, the army said that May 9, 2023 — the day when chaos gripped the nation following Khan's arrest — would go down in history as a ""dark chapter"".  The military and the government alike have vowed to try the vandals who attacked army installations under the Pakistan Army Act, Official Secrets Act, and other laws.  Human rights organisations and some in the government have opposed trying civilians under the army act, but agreed that the vandals should be tried and ""due process"" be followed.  The president, in the interview, also added that during the trials, the suspects' human rights should be respected and they shouldn't be tortured.  ""The people involved should be punished in line with the law,"" he said.  'No issues on COAS appointment'  The president added that the PTI chairman did not oppose Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir.  ""Imran Khan asked me to tell General Bajwa that he should accept anyone whom the institution approves as the next chief,"" President Alvi said.  Khan has criticised the military's incumbent leadership and blamed a senior armed forces official for his alleged involvement in the November 3, 2022, assassination attempt.  But at the same time, the PTI chief has also said that he will not interfere with the institution's matters when he comes back to power.  ""I do not intervene in the institution's matters. I've repeatedly said this,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdlby50di9sYXRlc3QvNDg4MDk5LWltcmFuLWtoYW4tc2hvdWxkLW9wZW5seS1jb25kZW1uLW1heS05LWV2ZW50cy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYXJpZi1hbHZp0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2VvLnR2L2FtcC80ODgwOTktaW1yYW4ta2hhbi1zaG91bGQtb3Blbmx5LWNvbmRlbW4tbWF5LTktZXZlbnRzLXByZXNpZGVudC1hcmlmLWFsdmk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-18","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 20:21:22","By AFP - May 18,2023 - Last updated at May 18,2023  People take part in a rally to show solidarity with Pakistan's army in Peshawar on Wednesday, after military installations were allegedly damaged by supporters of former Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan following his arrest last week (AFP file photo)  ISLAMABAD — Former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party accused intelligence agencies on Tuesday of being responsible for shootings and arson during violent protests that followed his arrest last week.  The former cricket superstar has waged a campaign of defiance against Pakistan's powerful military, which controls the country's intelligence services, since being ousted from power last year.  Khan, 70, is Pakistan's most popular politician and his arrest on corruption charges last week, following months of political crisis, prompted his supporters to pour onto the streets of several cities.  Violent clashes erupted with police, government buildings were set on fire and military installations damaged, with at least nine people killed in the unrest.  Open criticism of the military, which has staged three coups and heavily influences domestic politics and foreign policy, is rare in Pakistan's political mainstream.  ""We have ample amount of evidence to present to any inquiry that the arson and in some places, shootings were done by (intelligence) agencies men who wanted to cause mayhem and blame it on PTI so the current crackdown would be justified,"" the party said in a statement.  ""PTI believes that identification of elements involved in this unusual incident of violence and chaos through a credible investigation is inevitable,"" the statement said.  It did not offer any evidence for the claim.  More than 7,000 people have been detained or arrested since the unrest broke out.  At least 19 senior PTI officials have been arrested, some in overnight raids on their homes, after being accused of instigating the violence.  The PTI statement came a day after top commanders vowed to try those involved in damaging military installations in military courts.  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whose government has vowed to rearrest Khan, said he would open more anti-terrorism courts to try people accused of anti-state behaviour during the protests.  The independent Human Rights Commission Pakistan said it was “deeply concerned by reports of random arrests and cases filed arbitrarily against PTI workers across Pakistan”.  “A distinction must always be made between those resorting to violence and non-violent political workers,” it said in a statement this week.  Khan’s arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court’s chief justice and he was later released and granted protective bail.  He has been tied up in dozens of legal cases since being ousted in April 2022, a frequent hazard for opposition leaders in Pakistan.  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of huge rallies challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, many analysts and politicians said it was with the backing of the generals.  Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass over foreign policy and other issues.  In opposition, Khan has made explosive claims about the military’s involvement in politics, including that it plotted with the United States to oust him from power and that senior officials planned a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  He has offered no evidence to support his claims but named a senior intelligence services general and Sharif as being responsible for the attack.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuam9yZGFudGltZXMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvZXgtcGFraXN0YW4tcG0ta2hhbnMtcGFydHktYmxhbWVzLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1hZ2VuY2llcy12aW9sZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-12-26","Not Discerned","{""Lasanod"", ""Nugal"", ""Somalia""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:24:06","The Somaliland army and militias associated with the Dhulbahante people have been fighting for control of Las Anod, capital of Somaliland’s Sool region, since February. The conflict began after the Dhulbahante said they wish to join Somalia rather than be governed any longer by Somaliland, which declared its independence in 1991. As leaders on both sides double down on warlike rhetoric and recruit new fighters, the violence could spread throughout Sool, putting Somaliland’s hard-earned stability at risk. The belligerents should commit to an immediate ceasefire to allow delivery of humanitarian aid. Once they reach a truce, they should prepare for talks about Sool’s future administrative status. To ensure that both sides have credible representatives at the table, the Dhulbahante should appoint an inclusive leadership team for these negotiations, and Somaliland should hold its overdue presidential election to restore local legitimacy to its governing elite. In 1991, Somaliland proclaimed independence from Somalia after years of rebellion led by the Isaaq clan, which continues to dominate the country’s politics. It based its claim to statehood largely on the argument that its history as a British protectorate set it apart from the rest of Somalia, which was under Italian colonial rule until the two territories merged into one in 1960. The colonial-era borders, which placed Sool on Somaliland’s side of the line, remain central to Somalilander identity. But the majority of Sool’s population is Dhulbahante, a people who belong to a non-Isaaq clan family, the Darod. They strongly resisted British colonialism and generally fared better than the Isaaq under Somali dictator Siad Barre, who ruled from 1969 to 1991, leading most of them to favour the idea of being governed by Somalia. They largely reject inclusion in Somaliland’s state-building project, which they view as serving the Isaaq clan’s interests. Uneasy with the Isaaq clan’s ascendancy in Somaliland, the Dhulbahante have long searched for an alternative administrative arrangement, such as joining Somalia’s federal member state of Puntland, where their family ties through the Darod/Harti clan are deeper, or creating their own separate member state within Somalia. Not all Dhulbahante have the same vision for the future, but many want to break with Somaliland.  Authorities in Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa have long struggled to stamp their authority in Sool.  As a result, authorities in Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa have long struggled to stamp their authority in Sool. Somaliland forces took control of Las Anod only in 2007, after troops from neighbouring Puntland – who had moved in four years earlier to claim the area – withdrew following a local dispute. Since then, Hargeisa has taken steps to placate the Dhulbahante, including offering posts in regional and national government to community elites and promising to devote 2 per cent of Somaliland’s budget to developing Sool and the neighbouring Sanaag region. But it has also missed opportunities to improve relations, feeding Dhulbahante perceptions of exclusion. President Muse Bihi refused, for example, to honour a power-sharing agreement that his predecessor Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud “Silanyo” made with prominent Dhulbahante politician Ali Khalif Galaydh in 2017. Dhulbahante leaders also allege that the government’s efforts to develop their region have been lacklustre, bearing little fruit. Against this backdrop, a Somaliland opposition member from the Dhulbahante was assassinated on 26 December 2022 in Las Anod, setting in motion the events that led to the fighting. Unexplained killings of Las Anod’s civic leaders are all too frequent: residents estimate that gunmen have shot some 120 prominent members of the community dead over the past thirteen years. Protesters gathered in town after the December assassination, complaining that the Somaliland authorities’ efforts to stop the killings have been inadequate. Police moved in to disperse the demonstrators, using excessive force. The protests then rapidly grew into an uprising, prompting Hargeisa to pull its security forces from large sections of the town on 5 January. This partial retreat was the catalyst for the Dhulbahante to cement resistance to Hargeisa’s rule. They nominated a 33-strong committee to represent the community, while Dhulbahante garaads (or elders), many of whom had left when Somaliland troops marched into Las Anod in 2007, poured back into town (to its credit, the Somaliland government did little to prevent their return). In early February, the Dhulbahante organised a conference to discuss their future, including representatives from the smaller Hawiye/Fiqishine clan. Then, on 5 February, they declared that the Dhulbahante and the areas where they live fall under Somalia’s writ. They called on Somaliland to withdraw its troops from Dhulbahante territory. As the conference drew to a close, Somaliland security forces and Dhulbahante militias came to blows, with each side subsequently blaming the other for starting the skirmishes. Since then, the tug of war over Las Anod has killed over one hundred and displaced at least 150,000. Fighting has raged on the outskirts of the city, which is now under Dhulbahante control, with observers also reporting indiscriminate shelling of houses and other buildings. Though confrontations appear to have slowed in recent weeks, the two sides are reportedly enlisting new fighters and procuring fresh supplies of weapons. More recently, the Dhulbahante committee banned commercial traffic from Somaliland, blocking the main road to Hargeisa and complicating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Sool  Hargeisa shows its disregard for the Dhulbahante’s deep-seated grievances by blaming the conflict on a range of outside actors.  Hargeisa shows its disregard for the Dhulbahante’s deep-seated grievances by blaming the conflict on a range of outside actors, such as Mogadishu and Ethiopia’s Somali region, which lies south of Somaliland. It also accuses Puntland of sending soldiers to the area, a claim that both Puntland and the Dhulbahante deny – although Puntland soldiers on ostensible leaves of absence have reportedly established a non-uniformed presence in Las Anod. Hargeisa has also sought to frame the conflict as driven by the Islamist insurgency Al-Shabaab. Thus far, the allegations of external support seem for the most part to be overblown. The Dhulbahante are indeed receiving money, equipment and fighters, but primarily from allied Darod/Harti clans in Somalia. More substantial backing may be in the offing, however: Puntland President Said Deni recently committed to rapidly “liberating” Las Anod, a rhetorical escalation that could be portentous. Silencing the guns has proven difficult. Hargeisa declared a unilateral ceasefire in the conflict’s early days, but neither side respected it. Elders from Somaliland and Ethiopian government representatives have tried to broker a truce, without success. At the time of writing, clan elders from Somalia were pushing for ceasefire negotiations, but although President Bihi allowed them to visit Hargeisa and meet elders from Somaliland after they travelled to Garowe and Las Anod, they will likely have difficulty forging a truce as elites in Hargeisa may push back against meaningful involvement from Somali actors. The Dhulbahante say they will stop fighting only if Somaliland removes its soldiers from all Dhulbahante-inhabited areas. But while Somaliland had offered to reposition its forces 30km outside Las Anod, it says it will not withdraw from all the territory where the Dhulbahante live. More recently, Somaliland conditioned consideration of a truce on Puntland pulling all forces Hargeisa associates with it from Las Anod. Complicating matters further is the fact that the Dhulbahante are increasingly referring to Somalia’s government as their legitimate representative. Mogadishu has thus far eschewed direct involvement in the crisis, likely because it wants to avoid getting sucked into an intractable conflict at a time when it has scaled up its military operations against Al-Shabaab. There are worrying signs that the fighting might escalate. Local sources tell Crisis Group that both sides are recruiting additional fighters. In recent weeks, both Somaliland security officials and Dhulbahante elders have said they are determined to go on the offensive. In addition to the alarming prospect of further urban warfare in Las Anod, clashes may spread to other Dhulbahante areas in Sool. If the conflict drags on, morphing from a Somaliland-Dhulbahante dispute into a confrontation between the Darod and Isaaq clan families (or even the wider Dir clan family of which the Isaaq form a part), unrest could ripple into other parts of Somaliland or into Ethiopia. Still another concern is Al-Shabaab. Evidence is scant that the insurgency has been involved in Las Anod to date, but prolonged disorder might offer the group an opportunity to insinuate its fighters into the conflict or otherwise exploit the crisis to extend its influence in the region.  Somaliland’s pursuit of international recognition revolves around its efforts to build democratic institutions and secure long-term stability.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaXNpc2dyb3VwLm9yZy9hZnJpY2EvaG9ybi1hZnJpY2Evc29tYWxpbGFuZC90aW1lLXNvbWFsaWxhbmQtYW5kLWRodWxiYWhhbnRlLXRhbGvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The resolution also seeks to restore the home where he lived. Malcolm X, pictured speaking to reporters in 1963. AP, File  The Boston City Council unanimously supported a resolution Wednesday that would mark May 19, the birthday of civil rights leader Malcolm X, as a municipal holiday.  The resolution would also designate a site on Malcolm X Boulevard in Roxbury for the creation of a statue honoring him as part of the city’s Black Heritage Trail.  It also seeks to renovate the building where he lived for years. The building is located at 72 Dale St. in Roxbury, across from what is now known as Malcolm X Park. The Malcolm X-Ella Little Collins House is “completely dilapidated,” Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson said.  Advertisement:  Fernandes Anderson, who sponsored the resolution, spoke during Wednesday’s meeting about her personal admiration for Malcolm X and his significant role in Boston’s cultural history.  “He was a man of great depth, who embodied values of selflessness, of love and patience and passion for humanity,” she said. “His values have had a profound impact on my life, and I look up to him as a symbol of hope for people who have faced discrimination and oppression.”  Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little in Nebraska, moved to Boston in the early 1940s as a teenager. He lived with his older sister Ella Collins, and the building at 72 Dale St. now bears both their names.  Malcolm X frequented the area now known as Jazz Square near Massachusetts and Columbus avenues and was known to attend shows at the Hi Hat Lounge. He was arrested in 1946 on burglary charges and was imprisoned until 1952.  The former home of civil rights leader Malcolm X, at 72 Dale St. in Roxbury.

"assassination","2019-05-05","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 06:40:50","New York rapper billy woods teamed up with producer Kenny Segal for their second full-length collaboration “Maps.” Released on May 5, “Maps” is a surreal concept album about traveling and tour life with an excellent array of features, including Aesop Rock, Danny Brown and Quelle Chris. Pushing an already-stunning discography into new terrain while maintaining his piercing rhymes and idiosyncratic metaphorical style, “Maps” unequivocally establishes woods as one of the greatest lyricists of our generation.  woods has garnered a cult following in recent years, thanks to an extended run of incredible records. This includes his 2022 album “Aethiopes,” a complex portrait of the constructed fictions and lived realities of the African diaspora, densely packed with historical references and detailed imagery rapped over atmospheric samples, such as Ethiopian jazz in the opening track “Asylum.” woods spent his childhood in Africa due to his father’s participation in the Zimbabwe War of Liberation, so certain elements of its depictions are drawn from his own experience.  woods previously collaborated with Segal on their 2019 album “Hiding Places,” a tense, haunting exploration of his fears and irritations. But woods’ imagery and Segal’s sampling convey a very different mood on their new record, swapping out cramped, shadowy crawlspaces for endless, sunlit expanses.  As a result of his success, woods has found himself on tour for the first time in his decades-long career. In spite of this, he still wishes to retain the anonymity he had when he was completely unknown — woods has never revealed his government name and always requires his face to be blurred in photographs. Somewhat incredibly, most of his concert attendees have respected this wish.  Rather than immersing listeners in the distant places he’s reached while traveling the world, woods focuses on the liminal spaces in between. Planes, airports and concert venues are the album’s primary settings.  woods’ rhymes frequently blend meditations on his own experiences, whether it be his divorce or the deaths of his loved ones, with references to various historical and cultural events. His personal and social worlds become one and the same. A perfect example can be found in the transition from chorus to verse in the song “Red Dust” on “Hiding Places”: “It’s not the act, it’s the touch / It’s how she arch her back when she- / Knock the plane out the sky / Spark the genocide.” In suddenly shifting the narrative to the 1994 assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana, woods draws a parallel between sexual and violent drives.  It’s clear that woods doesn’t make music intended for a pleasant listening experience. Though considerably softer and sunnier than all of woods’ previous albums, “Maps” is still filled with that familiar bitterness and sense of dread.  In the song “Facetime,” woods raps wistfully about a failing long distance relationship over a sparkling beat: “Watching unbroken wild ponies run wild at sundown / Only the lonely big tree like a sundial.”  Segal’s production perfectly complements the tone of woods’ lyrics. His samples are wonderfully textured, shifting from smooth jazz to distorted, foreboding beats in the record’s middle stretch, more fitting for the billy woods that fans are used to.  Of course, this is where Danny Brown comes in, delivering some trademark over-the-top aggressive bars on the track “Year Zero,” including a delightful MF DOOM reference: “Danny Brown back like skinny white girls / Workin’ out, ’bout to get the money like curls.”  woods is a masterful storyteller with a remarkable talent for painting the little details of life. The misfortunes conveyed through letters and voicemails, the bass from a party in the halls trembling the walls of his Brooklyn apartment, the happiness he waits for by the window “like Malcolm X” — woods remarks on it all with the grim, humorous sarcasm of a man who has spent a lifetime just barely getting by. But he finds relief in the joys of weed and food: “The nose is Pine-Sol and turpentine / But the taste remind me of Jamaican oranges that look like limes,” he raps on “Houdini.” “Maps” is filled with these beautiful sensory details.  “One sip of New York City tapwater, I’m back dialed in,” woods says gently at the beginning of “NYC Tapwater,” the album’s mellow penultimate track marking the conclusion of his travels. As he describes the city over a gorgeous, tender instrumental, it’s like we’re right there with him. It’s a dreamy ode to his home, but he closes the song by unveiling the city’s harsh reality, warning a boy about the omnipresence and ruthlessness of the New York Police Department.  On the closing track “As the Crow Flies,” woods reflects on fatherhood and mortality in a simple yet striking verse. “Tear-streaked apologies, balled fists, it’s a trip / That this is something we did,” he says to the child’s mother. “I watch him grow, wondering how long I got to live.”  Though utterly despondent as ever, woods seems to be facing the future head-on. “Already knew the options was lose/lose / Baby, that’s nothing new,” woods raps on “The Layover.” “That just make it easier to choose, it’s up to you.” What uncharted territories will he take his music to next?

"assassination","2020-10-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 08:00:34","Fourteen individuals connected to the teenage Islamist who beheaded a French history teacher in 2020 will be prosecuted for terror-related charges after authorities confirmed their intention this week to pursue associates of the 18-year jihadist Abdullakh Anzorov for complicity in murder.  A Chechen-born Islamist and refugee, Anzorov, killed history teacher Samuel Paty over a dispute about showing cartoons of Muhammed to students in the Parisian suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in October 2020 in an incident that highlighted the growing gulf between the French Republic and Islamist extremism.  Paty evoked the anger of Muslim students and their parents after allegedly showing the controversial cartoons by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. A viral hate campaign by Islamist preachers spread Paty’s personal details shortly before the murder.  Prosecutors confirmed that a total of 14 associates of Anzorov will face trial for assisting in the murder, including six teenagers who allegedly conducted surveillance before the assassination occurred. Anzorov arrived on the school premises on 16 October 2020, and bribed students to ascertain the location of Paty before stabbing the teacher to death and posting a picture of his decapitated corpse on social media.  Also among the suspects are an Islamic preacher, alleged to have directly been in contact with Anzorov over Twitter, and two friends who accompanied him to purchase the knife.  Anzorov was shot by police shortly after the murder. President Macron declared the attack a direct assault on the values of the French state and vowed to redouble the country’s anti-terror efforts.  The incident set in motion a dramatic diplomatic spat between France and the Islamic world with President Erdoğan of Turkey seemingly justifying the murder by comparing the treatment of Muslims in Europe to Jews in the Third Reich and calling for a boycott on French goods.  Outrage ensued after footage emerged of a funeral held for Anzorov in Chechnya with mourners praising the Islamist for his act of jihad. In 2021, French police launched an investigation after a memorial to the slain teacher was vandalised by suspected Islamists.  In response to the murder, the French National Assembly drafted emergency legislation to fight Islamism. New laws clamping down on foreign funding of mosques and the harassment of public officials were passed in February 2021. France has struggled against Islamist extremism over the past decade with high-profile attacks destabilising the state and fueling a rise of right-wing populism.  Depictions of Muhammed are a contentious issue in Europe and a notorious flashpoint for secular societies and the Islamic world. The Danish Parliament is currently reviewing how schools teach about the 2005-2006 cartoon controversy. This question of curriculum triggered a wave of anti-Danish hate globally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZXVyb3BlYW5jb25zZXJ2YXRpdmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL25ld3MvZnJhbmNlLTE0LWZhY2UtdHJpYWwtZm9yLWNvbXBsaWNpdHktaW4tdGVhY2hlci1iZWhlYWRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

GERRY ‘The Monk’ Hutch has left Ireland and is understood to be back in Spain, the Sunday Worldcan exclusively reveal.  Gardaí were unaware that the 60-year-old crime boss was planning to leave the country until after he secretly jetted out of Dublin Airport on Monday.  ‘The Monk’ had not come to any adverse garda attention since being cleared of murder in the Regency Hotel case last month.  Since Hutch’s acquittal over the Regency murder of David Byrne more than four weeks ago, it is believed gardaí did not have any intelligence to suggest there was an imminent threat to Hutch’s life and he has not received a Garda Information Message (GIM) warning him of any threat.  However, sources concede the Kinahan cartel would “grasp any opportunity with both hands” to murder the patriarch of the Hutch family.  After being cleared of the murder charge, ‘The Monk’ spent most of his time staying at his family home in Clontarf.  Earlier this month it emerged that the State is to oppose an application from Hutch to have his legal costs covered after he was found not guilty of murder at the Special Criminal Court sitting in Dublin.  He was cleared of the high-profile murder of Kinahan gang member David Byrne at Dublin hotel seven years ago.  Mr Byrne (33) died after being shot six times at a crowded boxing weigh-in event at the hotel on February 5, 2016, in one of the first deadly attacks of the Hutch-Kinahan gangland feud.  The attack was described by the court as a “meticulously planned high-velocity assassination” by a six-man hit team which left one man dead and two others injured.  It “sparked mayhem on the streets of Dublin” and resulted in a “series of callous murders”, the court heard.  Many of the victims were members of the Hutch family or close associates of the gangster.  Gerry ‘The Monk’ Hutch. Photo: Sam Boal/PA — © PA  ‘The Monk’ remains under investigation for being the alleged leader of the Hutch organised crime group, under anti-gangland laws.  Upon acquitting Hutch, the three-judge court stated in blunt terms that there was a “reasonable possibility” the Regency attack was planned by Patsy Hutch and that ‘The Monk’ stepped in, as head of the family, to try to sort out the aftermath, “particularly as his own life was at risk”.  The Special Criminal Court also found, beyond reasonable doubt, that “members of the Hutch family were responsible for the attack at the Regency and the murder of David Byrne”.  The Kinahan cartel attempted to murder Gerry Hutch in Spain on New Year’s Eve 2015, but he escaped.  He was arrested in a police raid on a restaurant in Fuengirola on the Costa del Sol.  He was extradited at the end of 2021 and brought to Wheatfield Prison to the 3G landing where he remained until he was cleared of murder.  While Hutch was acquitted of the Regency murder, two of Hutch’s close associates were jailed last week for their role in the attack.  Taxi driver Paul Murphy (61) was sentenced to nine years and builder Jason Bonney (52) to eight and a half years for facilitating the killing of Byrne.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vY3JpbWUvaXJpc2gtY3JpbWUvZ2VycnktdGhlLW1vbmstaHV0Y2gtc2VjcmV0bHktbGVhdmVzLWlyZWxhbmQtYWZ0ZXItYmVpbmctY2xlYXJlZC1vZi1yZWdlbmN5LW11cmRlci9hMzkxOTY0MDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1947-08-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 08:52:48","Seeing the events unfolding across the border these past few weeks with the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf Party Premier and former Prime Minister, Imran Khan, Tarek's observations once more ring true.  Jinnah was a latter-day caliph and despite his famous 1947 Lahore speech which every secular, rational Pakistani has memorised about safeguarding the rights of minorities — he left behind authoritarian precedents, inherited by the Pakistan military — that are still practised and implemented in Pakistan today.  The Muslim League's rallying cry of religious frenzy which ultimately sold the idea of Pakistan to the Indian Muslim masses of 'Islam is in Danger' 'Islam khatre mein hai' became the bonding agent between the military and civilian dictators and the mad mullahs which today comprise the US-sponsored deep state of Pakistan.  With the birth of Pakistan, created to keep the Hindu-majority of the Indian civilisation from ever wielding power, the Indian Muslim population got divided by the political machinations of the Muslim League and the ever-helpful British into 150 million in Pakistan, 140 million in Bangladesh and 160 million in India (today roughly 174 million).  The civil strife which has plagued the Islamic world since the death of the Prophet in 632 AD further took the lives of one million fellow Muslims when the Two-Nation Theory was exposed as bogus in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971.  Yet not happy with an Islamic State, the Pakistan Army which found itself with a country to run, chose the erstwhile former kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as its reason to launch a war for ‘bleeding India with a thousand cuts' Ghazwa-e-Hind (Islamic Jihad) for the next 75 plus years.  So, it is surreally satisfying to see karma visit the country today with the videos of Pakistani civilians wielding AK-47s and firing them on the Pakistan Army personnel.  The same Ak-47s that destroyed two generations of Kashmiri youth, now buried six-feet under and a third one radicalised enough to not consider India as our home, as our roots, our civilisational identity.  We, the children of the conflict saw the pre-conflict period of the 80s with relative peace and lost our childhood and youth to the three-decade ISI sponsored proxy war by Pakistan, witnessing the forced exodus and ethnic cleansing of not only Kashmiri Pandits (indigenous Hindus) but also secular Muslims.  We saw Kashmiri communal leaders rhetorically spew Jihad speeches from the mosque pulpits and recruit entire generations into the carnage while raking in moolah from the anti-India network of disinformation groups and NGOs — to build their palatial bungalows, sustain their jet-setting lifestyles and send their sons and daughters to elite universities across the globe.  It was later through Pakistani journalist Arif Jamal's Shadow War: The Untold Story of Jihad in Kashmir, published in 2009, that we came to know what had hit our generation in 1989 and how the Jihad had been long in the making in not just General Zia's war room plans of 1965, but further in 1947 itself (Raiders in Kashmir by Major General Akbar Khan (Retired) of the Pakistan Army).  Arif Jamal’s Shadow War delves into the Jihad in Kashmir, exploring the various dimensions of the armed insurgency and the role of terror groups, particularly those influenced by jihadist ideologies.  It even shed light on the tactics and strategies employed by jihadist groups operating in Kashmir and their connections to wider global jihadist movements.  In the book, Jamal drew upon his research and first-hand experiences (interviews with Kashmiri terrorists in training camps, men we grew up with) to present an account of the Kashmir conflict that went beyond the mainstream narratives, aiming to uncover the lesser-known aspects of the armed insurgency or as it would be known as The Lost Rebellion: Kashmir in the Nineties' (Manoj Joshi, 1999).  The azadi war cry which until a few years ago reverberated on the campuses of Left-bastion universities across India, is today now heard on the streets of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Quetta, in the provinces of Sindh and everywhere in Pakistan.  Instead of 'we want azadi from Endia' (a derogatory, deliberate misspelling of India signifying its end), the people were screaming for azadi (freedom) from the Pakistan Army and its alliance with the ‘mad mullahs’, another term made popular by author Salman Rushdie, a victim of jihadi interpretations of Islam for decades.  I cannot visit the graves of my male peers, male batchmates, and my late husband due to the sharia interpretations of Islam in Kashmir but it was a kind of closure to see the mayhem in Pakistan; a country which spilled so much blood on the streets of Kashmir for thirty long years and challenged the territorial integrity of India to which its Army and paramilitary and security personnel had to respond.  The State did act like a bull-in-a-china-shop often with its knee-jerk reactions, but by the time the State got its counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism act together, Kashmir had lost entire generations with half-widows and orphan children scattered across its beautiful landscape.  Today the Kashmiris themselves — the older generation who are alive and remember the 1947 'kabaili' raid by Pakistani Rangers and tribesmen and the younger generations who have lost their loved ones — realise their folly of the 1970s, 80s and 90s to take on the Indian State and Indian Army with AK-47s. That too funded by an Islamic State which itself failed to maintain its initial objective of a ‘state of Islam’ in the Prophet's message.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc3dhcmFqeWFtYWcuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL3Bha2lzdGFuLXZzLXBha2lzdGFuLXNlbWJsYW5jZS1vZi1jbG9zdXJlLWZvci1rYXNobWlyaXPSAWRodHRwczovL3N3YXJhanlhbWFnLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvcG9saXRpY3MlMkZwYWtpc3Rhbi12cy1wYWtpc3Rhbi1zZW1ibGFuY2Utb2YtY2xvc3VyZS1mb3Ita2FzaG1pcmlz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:14:48","Dianne Feinstein is back and voting in the Senate, but the drama surrounding her return has barely begun.  Without diminishing the sad circumstances of a legendary lawmaker in decline, the plot points can nonetheless read like a politico's mashup of ""House of Cards"" and ""Veep,"" with a score written by fans of ""The West Wing"" -- or ""Succession.""  At 89 years old and fresh off a bout recovering from shingles that resulted in serious complications, including brain inflammation, Feinstein, D-Calif., returned to the Capitol last week appearing weak and disoriented.  When asked about the reception from colleagues after her return, Feinstein seemed to claim to reporters that she hadn't been away at all, even though she missed more than 90 floor votes and left the Judiciary Committee unable to advance some contested nominees since February.  By her side since she's been back has been a new figure with a familiar family connection: Nancy Corinne Prowda, the eldest daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi's support for her longtime friend quieted calls for Feinstein to resign in recent weeks, and now her daughter is helping Feinstein do her job with minimal disruption or embarrassment.  Pelosi's support, while no doubt stemming from genuine affection for her fellow San Francisco political icon, is also wrapped up in the emerging race to succeed Feinstein in the Senate in next year's elections. If her seat were to become vacant before then, it would be filled by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has vowed to appoint a Black woman to the job, while Pelosi has endorsed a white man, Rep. Adam Schiff.  That's a lot to hoist on the shoulders of a frail almost-nonagenarian whose mental challenges, particularly regarding her memory, have long been an open secret in Washington. (Feinstein, for her part, has previously pushed back on any such characterization.) There remain indications that she might have to miss further work, with her office committing to a ""lighter schedule"" for the senator and confirming on Thursday, in light of reporting in The New York Times, that her recent health issues were far more serious than acknowledged publicly.  Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer escorts Sen. Dianne Feinstein as she arrives at the U.S. Capitol following a long absence due to health issues May 10, 2023, in Washington. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images  A senator missing votes due to illness is neither unusual nor, necessarily, cause for political alarm, particularly when that senator represents a state as deeply blue as California. But any one absence essentially erases Democrats' voting edge in the current 51-49 Senate and leaves the critical Judiciary Committee -- charged with sending potential judges to the Senate floor -- entirely deadlocked.  What's more, Democrats are staring down a Senate map in 2024 that, Feinstein's safe seat aside, looks brutal for their prospects of retaining control. And, of course, their party is being led by an 80-year-old president whose own reelection prospects are clouded by questions around his age and acuity, as shown in a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll.  Activists inside the Democratic Party have for years been deriding the Senate as dysfunctional, clamoring for rules changes to overcome what they call Republican obstructionism. Now, many of those same voices are in the awkward position of pushing a towering figure in state and national politics to step down with a year and a half left in her term.  Feinstein's latest illness kept her from the Senate starting in February, though calls for her resignation didn't reach a critical mass until last month when California Rep. Ro Khanna became the first sitting Democratic member of Congress to call for his home-state senator to leave office, saying it was clear that she could ""no longer fulfill her duties.""  ""We need to put the country ahead of personal loyalty,"" Khanna said at the time.  Pelosi has defended her with a subtle reminder that infirm senators are nothing new -- and have mostly been men who have been allowed to close out their careers on their own terms.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is flanked by aides as she returns to the Senate Judiciary Committee following a more than two-month absence as she was being treated for a case of shingles, at the Capitol in Washington, May 11, 2023. J. Scott Applewhite/AP  ""I've never seen them go after a man who was sick in the Senate in that way,"" Pelosi has said.  Left unsaid by her was the fact that she is backing Schiff in the rare open race to succeed Feinstein after Feinstein retires in January 2025. Khanna is backing Rep. Barbara Lee, who -- perhaps not coincidentally -- is a Black woman and is therefore at least a potential pick to fill a vacancy were Feinstein to resign before 2025.  Anyone selected by Newsom would have to run for the full six-year term on his or her own, but they would get an incumbency advantage in the March 5 all-party primary. Newsom pledged to choose a Black woman if another vacancy arose on his watch, after having chosen Sen. Alex Padilla -- a longtime friend who is Latino -- to succeed now-Vice President Kamala Harris, whose exit left the Senate with exactly zero Black women.  Newsom himself says he considers Feinstein one of his oldest personal friends and he has urged her to stay in office as long as she sees fit. But he has acknowledged the fraught nature of potentially choosing yet another replacement senator.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein takes her seat at a business hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill May 11, 2023 in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images  ""There's a lot of politics and a lot of folks polluting the political process,"" Newsom told Elex Michaelson, a Los Angeles reporter, earlier this month. ""For those who say, 'Enough of Newsom making these picks, I haven't…' I get it -- I'm with you. I understand. It's just the nature of what it is.""  That comment was read by some as a hint that Newsom might choose a caretaker senator who would vow not to compete for a full term next year. It could all shape the political future of Newsom, who -- at age 55 -- is seen a potential presidential contender if Biden steps aside, or in 2028.  The positioning comes in a complex political environment, with questions of ambition, political representation and urgencies of legislative progress colliding. Feinstein might appreciate the layers of intrigue, even though they might not match the wild and tragic circumstances that left her as mayor of San Francisco in 1978: the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.  In the meantime, for now at least, Feinstein is doing the most basic part of her job: casting as many votes as she can. Yet that's happening with the knowledge among friends and supporters that an unmatched legacy could be tarnished by how a career comes to an end -- and the unsavory conversations that surround it.  Editor's note: This story has been updated to show that a quote attributed to Dianne Feinstein was instead from Gavin Newsom.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvZGlhbm5lLWZlaW5zdGVpbnMtc2VuYXRlLXJldHVybi1oaWdobGlnaHRzLXNhZC1kZWNsaW5lLWFtaWQvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTk0MzcwNznSAXFodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy9kaWFubmUtZmVpbnN0ZWlucy1zZW5hdGUtcmV0dXJuLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtc2FkLWRlY2xpbmUtYW1pZC9zdG9yeT9pZD05OTQzNzA3OQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1973-05-25","Not Discerned","{""DunLaoghaire"", ""Dublin"", ""Ireland""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:43:10","Murder of AG shatters peace and innocence (May 1973 revisited)  On a normal Friday night in Kingstown, shots rang out in the quiet neighbourhood of the Fort Charlotte area, a peaceful residential area. It was not like today when the sound of gunfire is  one to which many communities have become accustomed. No, not SVG 50 years ago. So, what was going on?  Vincentians didn’t know it at the time, but the peace and stability of the country were to be rudely disturbed over the next two weeks and then an unprecedented series of events including legal battles right up to the British Privy Council were to unfurl and make their mark on our history.  While rumours circulated during that fateful night, it was not until Saturday morning that the official word came out. The Attorney General, a Dominican barrister Cecil Eric Rawle, who had taken up residence here, served as Chief Magistrate and was quite a well-known figure among all social classes, had been shot at his home and was hospitalized critically injured.  In a separate incident, a supermarket owner was also shot and wounded in what appeared to be a robbery attempt.  The Police announced that they were searching for three suspects, Junior “Spirit” Cottle, Marcus “Bomani” James and Loraine “Blackie” Laidlow. Both Cottle and James were members of a fledgling Black Power organization, grandly named the Black Liberation Action Committee (BLAC), formed just one year before and based in the lower Kingstown area. That connection was to have huge ramifications as to how this story would develop.  AG Rawle died two days later and was buried in a mournful ceremony shortly afterwards. In the meantime, the rumour mill kept churning out stories. Not surprisingly “Black Power” became the target of attacks, but local politics was such that stories spread that Rawle was a victim of an assassination plot relating to election petitions filed after the historic tied election of April 1972, suggesting that the accused were paid assassins. Nothing but a dastardly lie.  The death of Mr. Rawle brought about a dramatic change in the behaviour of the police both to local Black Power activists and in general to the youth of SVG in both Kingstown and rural communities. Previously there had been occasional skirmishes based on the police attempts to crack down on ganga smoking. There was little love lost between the police and the rising conscious youth.  The Black Power influence was sweeping the Caribbean and SVG stood up to be counted. There were four small, organized groups in the Kingstown area and at least one based in the rural area, in Diamond Village. There had been occasional protests and demonstrations about police brutality, but the most prominent altercation had occurred in February, 1972 when there were protests against the visit of Margaret of Windsor, sister of the Queen of Britain, and its colonies. It was as though the local middle-class elite had gone crazy that young Vincentians were daring to challenge colonialism. The wrath of the Police Force was unleashed in an unprecedented manner to beat and arrest the demonstrators including a female secondary school student.  All of this paled in comparison with the response to the killing of the AG. A virtual reign of terror was unleashed, with young men being arbitrarily beaten and illegally detained as police desperately sought information about the murder. A month-long manhunt was launched for the suspects, during which Marcus James was shot and killed and finally, on Sunday, May 27, the police surrounded Cottle at his humble residence in the Lower Kingstown area, “the Ghetto” as it was popularly known then.  The behaviour of the police that day was a forerunner of things to come, for having surrounded the area, they indiscriminately tear gassed the entire area, affecting old and young alike in their attempt to flush out Cottle. Little did we realize at the time that a mere two years later, we would witness the same tear gas treatment against teachers, students and the general public.  It was a traumatic experience for me as one of the leaders of BLAC. In the week leading up to the shooting of the AG, as a young teacher at Bishops College, Kingstown, I had been involved in altercations with the management after it consistently failed to address complaints about the racist practices of a British priest who was then the Principal. It led to my suspension and on just the day before the Rawle shooting, the students had staged a protest march around Kingstown calling for my reinstatement.  The new situation put all of that in the pot. I was summarily fired and worse, the leadership of the country went on radio to charge that the murder was part of an assassination plot and that a list was found of the names of several citizens earmarked as victims.  Dangerous lies! The Rawle affair was nothing of the sort. It was an exercise in reckless adventurism. But the politics of the time determined otherwise. Faced with the situation, we as “young revolutionaries”, as we called ourselves, made a martyr out of Cottle, a “revolutionary hero “as we said then. I must take full responsibility for my role in it as we attempted to combat the injustice.

Read on:Firstly, working on this documentary also meant reliving Gauri and all that she signified. Second, I wondered if I had the bandwidth to deal with the myriad emotions that would arise through this process of reliving her life. My proposal to make this documentary was approved just before the pandemic, and when the pandemic struck, co-ordination and shooting and the safety of crew thereafter became yet another challenge.The journey of making this film was very emotional, and difficult. At the same time, I discovered so much more about Gauri. Back then, I was the closest person in the family to her, and I recall cribbing about how she was too busy to spend time with the family. However, the more people I met, whose lives had been touched and impacted by her over the years, the more I realised that she was much larger than the ordinariness of day-to-day life. I met people in the forests and tribal areas, in Bababudangiri and Chikkamagaluru, where the first seeds of her activism were born. People of all religious backgrounds came together to co-exist in these places, and Gauri was in the thick of it all. They told me so many stories about my sister and the work she did that we were all left in tears. Gauri went beyond journalism and activism – tackling issues at the grassroot level, taking it a step further and ensuring they were heard by the government. I never understood her purpose when she was alive.Gauri was completely misunderstood. After she was killed, there were so many hate trolls coming our way and to know how misunderstood she was hurt us even more. In the film, we delve into how she was trying to intervene to come into democratic form, to fight not with guns and arms, but peacefully. The film includes a lot of actual footage of her meetings that showcase the truth of her mission, all thanks to her cameraman Deepu, who worked with her for over 20 years.The one scene I didn’t want to show in the documentary was her actual death. Till today, I am unable to face that scene even though I was the first to visit the site of the shooting. I was called in at court as the first witness during the murder trail. The most difficult and devastating part was having to come face to face with her killers. There was a video conference from jails across Karnataka where they were imprisoned, and I didn’t look at them. Even today, I don’t know if I can face them… knowing that they pulled the trigger, and knowing that they had planned to do this so for so long. I can’t come to terms with that. She is still around, giving me a lot of work to do. It is an unbearable loss, and I miss talking to her as we were more friends than sisters. The film has been a catharsis, and a healing. After I went through her journey through this documentary, I understood her better. It’s been therapeutic.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9saWZlLXN0eWxlL3Nwb3RsaWdodC9pLW5ldmVyLXVuZGVyc3Rvb2QtZ2F1cmlzLXB1cnBvc2Utd2hlbi1zaGUtd2FzLWFsaXZlLWthdml0aGEtbGFua2VzaC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDAzMzEzNzUuY21z0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vbS50aW1lc29maW5kaWEuY29tL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvc3BvdGxpZ2h0L2ktbmV2ZXItdW5kZXJzdG9vZC1nYXVyaXMtcHVycG9zZS13aGVuLXNoZS13YXMtYWxpdmUta2F2aXRoYS1sYW5rZXNoL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDAzMzEzNzUuY21z?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Hearing the plea on Thursday (May 18), the Supreme Court bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Ahsanuddin Amanullah asked the petitioner to serve copies of the petition and the Bombay high court’s order to the CBI, LiveLaw reported.  Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for Mukta, told the bench on Thursday that two absconding accused have not been found or arrested yet, and the CBI has said it is still conducting further investigations on whether there was a larger conspiracy.  Dabholkar, an anti-superstition crusader, was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants on August 20, 2013. In April this year, nine years after Dabholkar was murdered, the Bombay high court had said that it will no longer be monitoring the probe and “no further monitoring is required”.  “There cannot be perpetual monitoring. Some monitoring is fine but law is clear that when a charge sheet is filed, the rights of the accused are to be considered,” the high court had said.  His family, however, has disputed this – saying the masterminds behind the murder are yet to be arrested. The CBI is also reportedly yet to trace the motorcycle or weapons used for the killing. The accused are allegedly linked to the extremist Hindu right organisation Sanatan Sanstha. The same organisation and people have been linked to the killings of CPI leader Govind Pansare, Kannada writer M.M. Kalburgi and journalist Gauri Lankesh.  In the Supreme Court on Thursday, the bench said the high court cannot monitor each investigation. To this, Grover replied that the CBI should complete its investigation, and until then the court should monitor it.  “Your point is that CBI should conclude investigation so that trial can begin?” the court then asked, according to LiveLaw, and Grover responded in the affirmative.  The matter will be heard again in the second week of July.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9sYXcvbmFyZW5kcmEtZGFiaG9sa2Fycy1kYXVnaHRlci1hcHByb2FjaGVzLXNjLWFnYWluc3QtaGNzLXJlZnVzYWwtdG8ta2VlcC1tb25pdG9yaW5nLWNiaS1wcm9iZdIBgAFodHRwczovL20udGhld2lyZS5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL2xhdy9uYXJlbmRyYS1kYWJob2xrYXJzLWRhdWdodGVyLWFwcHJvYWNoZXMtc2MtYWdhaW5zdC1oY3MtcmVmdXNhbC10by1rZWVwLW1vbml0b3JpbmctY2JpLXByb2JlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1978-11-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:41:00","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office said Thursday that she is suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a complication from the shingles virus that can paralyze part of the face, and that she contracted encephalitis while recovering from the virus earlier this year.  Feinstein, 89, had not previously disclosed those medical details, though she said in a statement last week that she had suffered complications from the virus. The longtime California senator returned from a more than two-month absence on May 10 after weeks of questions about her declining health and whether she would be back in the Senate at all.  Adam Russell, a spokesman for Feinstein, said that the encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, “resolved itself shortly after she was released from the hospital in March.” Feinstein continues to have complications from the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, Russell said.  Russell confirmed the two complications after the New York Times first reported them, raising questions about whether she had been hiding the extent of her illnesses. Upon her return last week, Feinstein was using a wheelchair and noticeably thinner, and has appeared confused at times when speaking to reporters or being wheeled through the halls.  “The senator previously disclosed that she had several complications related to her shingles diagnosis,” Russell said in the statement. “As discussed in the New York Times article, those complications included Ramsay Hunt syndrome and encephalitis.”  Feinstein’s face has appeared partially paralyzed since she returned to the Senate, stirring some speculation about whether she had had a stroke. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is a complication that occurs when the shingles virus reaches a facial nerve near the ears. It can also cause hearing loss.  Encephalitis can also be caused by shingles. The swelling of the brain can have a number of different symptoms, including personality changes, seizures, stiffness, confusion and problems with sight or hearing, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Aides to Feinstein said last week that she is still recovering from her illness and would operate on a reduced schedule. Since she has returned, she has missed some votes where she was not needed. On Wednesday, for example, she missed the first three Senate votes of the day but appeared for the last two, in which the margin was much closer.  Feinstein has faced questions for several years about her clearly declining health and her mental acuity. In February Feinstein said she would not run for re-election in 2024.  But some Democrats have pushed for her to leave sooner. A member of the California congressional delegation, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, called on her to resign as she stayed away from Washington for more than ten weeks, and several other House progressives have echoed his call. And Senate Democrats were increasingly anxious during Feinstein’s absence as they were unable to confirm some of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominees with a narrow 51-49 majority.  As Democrats worried, Feinstein made an unusual request to be temporarily replaced on the Judiciary panel while she remained out of the Senate. But Republicans last month blocked a vote, saying there was little precedent for a temporary committee replacement and that they didn’t want to help Democrats confirm the most partisan judges. Others said they thought Democrats were unfairly trying to push her out of office.  Two weeks later, Democrats said that Feinstein would return to Washington.  A senator for more than three decades, Feinstein has had a groundbreaking political career and shattered gender barriers. She was the first woman to serve as president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in the 1970s and the first female mayor of San Francisco. She ascended to that post after the November 1978 assassinations of then-Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk by a former supervisor, Dan White. Feinstein found Milk’s body.  In the Senate, she was the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat.  Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

YouTuber j0nathan is back with some more information on the next game in the Assassin’s Creed series. This time, he claims that Assassin’s Creed Mirage will feature gameplay similar to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins. He also shared several other details regarding the gameplay, in addition to an expected release date.    Based on what the YouTuber stated, Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s expected release date is October 12, 2023. He said that the game was originally conceived as DLC for Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, but later repurposed into a standalone title as it gained more depths during development. He added that the gameplay is closer to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins, with lots of gadgets and items to use during missions, a smaller skill tree with only around 15 skills to unlock, and several weapons to unlock.  According to j0nathan, Assassin’s Creed Mirage features 4 main assassination targets, similar to the first Assassin’s Creed game, where players will need to investigate the aforementioned targets to know who they are and gain information before assassinating them. The protagonist, Basim, is said to start off as a simple thief who comes across an artifact of the First Civilization. The game’s story is said to explore how the Order went from “The Hidden Ones” to the assassins.  Although the world map is comprised of only Baghdad, the city itself is much bigger than Paris in Assassin’s Creed Unity, as it also has villages and desert areas on the outskirts. Missions will involve stealth, such as tailing NPCs and listening in on their conversations. The YouTuber added that Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s parkour isn’t as fluid as it was in Assassin’s Creed Unity. The game also marks a return for factions, with which you’ll have the opportunity to recruit thieves, mercenaries etc., much like in the Assassin’s Creed games featuring Ezio.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdHdpc3RlZHZveGVsLmNvbS9hc3Nhc3NpbnMtY3JlZWQtbWlyYWdlLWxlYWstZ2FtZXBsYXktc2ltaWxhci10by1vcmlnaW5zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is the reason why on parts of the pardon were submitted in proceedings related to the murder, the lawyer said in a court sitting on the case filed by the Caruana Galizia family against Theuma and others allegedly involved in the plan to kill the journalist.  ADVERTISEMENT  The suit for damages was originally filed against Yorgen Fenech, who stands accused of being a mastermind in the assassination, together with Alfred and George Degiorgio, two of the hitmen who were given a 40-year jail term each after pleading guilty to the murder last October, and Vincent Muscat, the third hitman, who was earlier given a 15-year jail term after striking a plea deal with prosecutors in exchange for testimony about the murder and that of lawyer Carmel Chircop in 2015.  Theuma’s lawyer informed the court that Theuma was exercising his right to silence in spite of having been granted a pardon to testify about his role in the murder plot.  Fenech had filed separate proceedings seeking Theuma’s prosecution for alleged perjury, a challenge that was rejected but is subject to appeal.  The court ordered the court registrar to produce a copy of Theuma’s testimonies in various proceedings. In Thursday’s session, the assistant registrar of the criminal courts, Stefania Calafato Testa, presented those testimonies, sealed under court order.  Theuma’s lawyer argued that such right to silence was only being invoked because of the challenge proceedings that were still pending at appeal stage. He would willingly declare on oath that he was granted a pardon for the specific reason of testifying about the journalist’s murder.

"assassination","2023-11-28","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Thu 18 May 2023 13:14:56","A conference held in London this week was subjected to an extraordinary onslaught on social and mainstream media from people who weaponized antisemitism against it.  The conference was on National Conservatism, a concept developed by the Israeli-American philosopher and political theorist Yoram Hazony. Through his key insight that attachment to the nation is a core component of conservatism, he has launched an attempt to reclaim for the West authentically conservative principles that have become muddled and uncertain.  As a result of this confusion, conservatism is failing to protect the Western nation-state against the progressive ideologies that threaten to destroy its culture.  The conference, at which I was one of the speakers, explored where conservatism went wrong and what it should be promoting.  The gathering provided a rare safe space for subjects that many have become too frightened to discuss, such as the transgender cult, the damaging impact of mass immigration and the need to restore the traditional family.  Subscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate  by email and never miss  our top stories  Those who express such views usually find themselves the targets of intimidation, smears and character assassination. So, unsurprisingly, the reaction of the left to the conference’s attempt to reinvigorate conservatism was to smear its organizers and speakers as fascists, antisemites and nutjobs.  The reason for such vitriol was that, to the left, promoting the traditional family, immigration controls and biological sex—mainstream views for millions of decent, civilized people—is akin to fascism.  Worse, however, were the false claims of antisemitism made to smear conference participants.  One of the speakers, the journalist and author Douglas Murray, talked in his keynote address about the need to have pride in one’s nation. Making the point that nationalism was given a bad name by Nazi Germany, he said, “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.”  This provoked an instant meltdown on Twitter. Murray was accused of minimizing Nazism and the Holocaust and being himself some kind of fascist and Jew-hater.  This was as stupid as it was grotesque. Murray was speaking in his trademark sardonic style. “Mucked up” wasn’t meant to be understood literally. It was a typically English figure of speech called litotes, which is defined as the use of a negative statement in order to emphasize a positive meaning.  “Mucked up” in this context was an ironic understatement to convey the enormity of Germany’s crimes.  Yet one typical tweet called Murray “disgusting openly racist” and expressed “utter contempt” for “suggesting the Holocaust of six million and sparking a destructive war was ‘mucked up.’” As Hazony tweeted in reply, “Yes, Douglas used irony in conveying his utter revulsion at German depravity. … Your reaction is tone deaf and phenomenally unjust.”  In The Guardian, the paper’s deputy political editor Peter Walker accused two other speakers—Conservative MP Miriam Cates and Kevin Roberts, president of the Washington, D.C. think-tank the Heritage Foundation—of using antisemitic dog-whistles.  This accusation was baseless, idiotic and vile.  Walker pointed to Roberts’s repeated use of the word “globalist” to criticize left-wing groups that want to end democracy and impose their views. Even though Walker acknowledged that “globalists” can be used neutrally, he said it had been “condemned by Jewish groups as an antisemitic trope” because it was “associated with the far-right and antisemitic conspiracy theories.”  But “globalism” is used interchangeably with “universalism” simply to describe the “brotherhood of man” thinking prevalent on the left, which prioritizes transnational laws, institutions and values. What’s more, the left itself has often used “globalization” as a term of disapproval to describe international capitalism and multinational companies.  In her speech, Cates said that liberal individualism has proven completely powerless to resist the “cultural Marxism” that is systematically “destroying our children’s souls.”  Walker claimed the phrase “cultural Marxism” has its origins in a conspiracy theory that Marxist scholars of the Frankfurt School in interwar Germany, many of whom were Jewish, devised a program of progressive politics intended to undermine Western democracies.  But “cultural Marxism” is not a conspiracy theory at all. It’s an accurate description of an actual agenda promoted not just by the radicals of the Frankfurt School but by other Marxist thinkers who urged the capture of the culture to overturn the West by infiltrating Marxist dogma from within.  Moreover, the claim that “cultural Marxism” is an antisemitic dog-whistle is innately ludicrous. Marx himself was a profound antisemite. In his 1844 essay “On the Jewish Question,” he wrote, “What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money. … In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.”  It’s not everyone who criticizes “cultural Marxism” who is an antisemite but those who promote Marxism. Those who smear Cates are, in essence, calling her an antisemite for accusing the left of promoting antisemitism. So, this is not only a disgusting smear but profoundly stupid and meaningless.  What’s more, as with globalization, while some of the people being criticized for “cultural Marxism” are Jews, the majority are not.  For example, in 2020, after Britain’s National Trust linked Winston Churchill to slavery and colonialism and the National Maritime Museum threatened to tarnish the reputation of Horatio Nelson, a group of parliamentarians complained that the “institutional custodians of history and heritage” were subscribing to “cultural Marxist dogma.”  Obviously, people can’t be antisemitic if they are directing the accusation of “cultural Marxism” at people who aren’t Jews.  Even more imbecilically, we are being told that “globalization” and “cultural Marxism” are antisemitic dog-whistles just because they’ve been used by neo-Nazis and white supremacists. This is to claim that language used widely by others in a neutral and factual way instantly becomes toxic when it issues from the mouths of bad people.  This absurd argument is also used to suppress criticism of the financier George Soros. It’s entirely legitimate to criticize Soros for his massive funding of anti-Western and anti-Israel causes. Yet anyone who does so is called an antisemite because Soros is a Jew and because some genuine Jew-haters subject him to antisemitic attack.  This means Soros is insulated from criticism because his Jewishness is used as shield for his behavior. In exactly the same way, those who smear Cates and Roberts are using antisemitism as a shield for the predations of the left.  What’s worse is that a number of Jewish Diaspora leaders often endorse such false and despicable accusations, as some did again this week against the NatCon speakers. Still worse is that the people who are thus smeared are as often as not some of the greatest defenders of the Jewish people.  I have personally known Douglas Murray for years. It would be hard to find a more passionately pro-Jew and pro-Israel individual.  Hazony tweeted about Cates and Roberts, “Kevin and Miriam are among the best friends we Jews have in public life. So why slander them in this way?”  Britain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman is also a staunch friend of Israel and the Jewish people. Yet in 2019, after she criticized “cultural Marxism” for an increasing use of censorship, it was the Board of Deputies of British Jews that attacked her and said she shouldn’t use the phrase again.  The Guardian, of course, is a paper that not only regularly pumps out falsehoods and blood libels against the State of Israel but recently published an appalling antisemitic cartoon linking the then-chairman of the BBC, who happens to be a Jew, to greed, gold and the image of a vampire squid.  Left-wingers—who are presiding over epidemic Jew-hatred in their own ranks—are using the claim of antisemitism to disguise the all-too accurate charge that they are destroying core Western values. It’s appalling that Diaspora Jewish leaders are helping them do so.  Melanie Phillips, a British journalist, broadcaster and author, writes a weekly column for JNS.

Baligod asked Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to have the witnesses transferred from the NBI custodial center in Manila to the Philippine National Police facility in Quezon City to “insulate them from the people corrupted or bribed by this former DOJ official.”  Baligod claimed that “no less than four detainees” revealed the bribery attempt at a preliminary investigation hearing at the DOJ last month.  When they rejected the bribe, the witnesses claimed jail guards gave them a hard time and later placed them in the same cell as Martin Miranda, a longtime bodyguard of suspended Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. and one of the respondents in the case.  Remulla said investigations tagged Teves as the “main mastermind” in the March 4 killings of Degamo and his supporters.  Recantations expected  Miranda, on the other hand, was allegedly the “enforcer” who picked 11 former Army soldiers as hit men, helped plan and provide logistical support for the assassination. The witnesses claimed Miranda was now “bullying” them.  Last month, former Justice Undersecretary Reynante Orceo claimed to be representing Miranda, although all 11 respondents denied, at that time, engaging his services and had lawyers from the Public Attorneys Office.  On Monday, Remulla bared that “six to seven” suspects in the Degamo case were now being represented by private lawyers and might recant the statements in their extrajudicial confessions.  “There are no recantations yet, but we expect that to happen. It’s a tactic used by people who want to destroy their previous statements, citing several excuses, but we expect these statements to hold,” Remulla said.  ADVERTISEMENT  Baligod agreed with Remulla and expressed confidence that the suspects would be indicted and that the case would proceed to trial.  “No effect at all. In fact, even if the 11 detained persons at the NBI recant, these would not affect the prosecution,” Baligod said, adding he had two more witnesses to present in court.  ‘Godfather doctrine’  As lawyer of the victims’ families, Baligod will serve as the private prosecutor in support of the state prosecutors who will be assigned to the case.  Baligod argued that they have a good case against Teves, citing the so-called “Godfather doctrine”—after the 1969 crime novel by American author Mario Puzo and later adapted to become a hit film.  He contended that a godfather or crime group leader may be prosecuted based on at least three circumstantial evidence alone, a principle adopted in US jurisprudence.  On May 17, the NBI filed multiple murder, multiple frustrated murder and multiple attempted murder before the National Prosecution Service against Teves, whose location remained unknown at press time.  Teves is not required to appear in the ongoing preliminary investigation, but he has to personally appear during arraignment because flight is prima facie evidence of guilt. If he does not appear in court, he can be tried in absentia.  g/  Your subscription could not be saved. Please try again. Your subscription has been successful.

"assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 23:36:40","An armed gang near Haiti’s capital ambushed two armored police vehicles and killed an officer in the latest attack against the country’s beleaguered force.  The Haiti National Police, which confirmed the attack, said gangs used Molotov cocktails to set the two armored vehicles on fire while they were in Source Matelas, a community just north of Port-au-Prince where at least 100 Haitians were killed last month in a gang attack.  “Following this attack, one of our brave police officers was unfortunately murdered,” a police statement said. “This criminal act, which is beyond reprehensible, will not go unpunished.”  The ambush occurred sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning, police said. It is the latest act of violence against police officers, who are increasingly targeted by armed gangs. At least 24 police officers have been killed so far this year, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network.  Meanwhile, more than 1,400 Haitians have been killed in the first four months in gang-related conflicts, the United Nations has said.  Police did not identify the dead officer, nor did they provide details on whether the officers involved were on active duty when the incident occurred. A police official, dispelling rumors that the officers were returning from Cap-Haïtien, told the Miami Herald that there is a security presence along National Road No. 1 where the attack occurred. He added that an investigation remains ongoing.  While Haitian police officers have stepped up anti-gang operations in recent days, a number of police officers had been temporarily transferred to Cap-Haïtien to beef up security for members of the government who were commemorating the 220th anniversary of the founding of Haiti’s flag on Thursday in the northern city.  Several Haitian media outlets have identified the fallen officer as Roberto Charleston, a member of a specialized police unit. Sources familiar with the incident told the Miami Herald that the attacked occurred at around 2 a.m. Thursday and the officer became trapped. Also, they said, the two armored vehicles that went up in flames were among the fleet of recently acquired Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles the Haitian government purchased from a Canadian company.  Story continues  In its statement, the police leadership said it has already taken action “to tackle and apprehend the thugs.”  The police killing was the second brazen attack in less than 24 hours.  On Wednesday morning, a high-profile investigative judge, Jean Wilner Morin, dodged an assassination attempt as he headed to work.  Two men riding on motorcycles riddled the judge’s black Toyota with bullets, a source close to Morin confirmed to the Miami Herald. The incident happened along Route Frères, and was condemned by the Professional Association of Judges in a statement. Calling the attack “odious,” the association called on Haitian authorites to take responsibility in guaranteeing the safety of citizens.  Morin is in charge of several corruption cases and has been holding hearings before bringing formal charges.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlci1raWxsZWQtaGFpdGktZ2FuZy0yMzM2NDA3NTYuaHRtbNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL3BvbGljZS1vZmZpY2VyLWtpbGxlZC1oYWl0aS1nYW5nLTIzMzY0MDc1Ni5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 00:21:03","I wrote recently about Austin Killips, the male cyclist, winning a female cycling race. I wanted to defend women’s right to single-sex sport, but also to defend young female athletes from unfair demands that they alone should “do something!” to stop male athletes competing in women’s competitions. One woman who agreed with me was Inga Thompson, and she has since gone further — demanding that those young women begin to object at the start of such events and on the podium. She is calling for men and women to unite to defend women’s sports from the trans-identified men, who seem determined to destroy opportunities for women to compete fairly.  Inga Thompson is a three times Olympic cyclist, a three-times world medal winner, and she has finished on the Tour De France Podium twice. Clearly, she knows a thing or two about what it means to compete as a woman in sports. Her experience of success is so precious to women’s teams now that she has retired from competitive cycling. This year she was given a board role on the newly-established Cynisca Cycling team, formed in conjunction with USA Cycling ahead of the 2023 season.  Young female cyclists are watching and will see it as a cautionary tale  Cynisca proudly states that it is “committed to advancing women in the sport of cycling both on and off the bike”. Inga is dedicated to advancing the interests of young female cyclists, and she was delighted to be joining what she saw as an innovative team. Her experience was not as smooth as she expected, though, and Inga decided to resign from the board in April. She endured a rough ride this week as the team at Cynisca behaved in a shocking way towards her for expressing her political views.  When Inga sent an email politely resigning her post on the board of Cynisca for a new role with Future of Cycling, she would never have expected to receive not a courteous acceptance but a cold and deliberate character assassination of the highest order. The email, widely distributed in the media as the team’s official statement on the matter, blithely waves a hand at Inga’s exceptional value as a board member before proceeding to make some bold claims about her.  Chris Gutowsky, the founder and general manager, distributed the following statement:  Ms. Thompson was invited to the board because of her impressive palmarés and a wealth of knowledge on international race strategy, tactics and training. If shared in the absence of politics, her knowledge and experience would benefit many and advance cycling for everyone. However, she has decided to dedicate her time to excluding people that are otherwise currently eligible to compete in UCI events. She has also attempted to use our team as a platform for her political activity.  It is quite extraordinary of Gutowsky to state that Inga would be valuable if she could keep her mouth shut about her beliefs. Her views, at least in UK law, have been established as worthy of respect in a democratic society. Gutowsky continued:  Ms. Thompson’s social media presence include dehumanisation of transgender people, spreading misinformation, demagoguery, and personal attacks on anyone who opposes her views.  Inga Thompson is astounded to be smeared in this way by her former boss. Her own letter of resignation shows a desire to protect Cynisca’s reputation, with deliberate sensitivity and care for the success of the team. Gutowsky, by return, seems not only peeved but determined to drag her reputation through the mud. His attitude was embraced with seeming glee by former competitive cyclist Anne-Marije Rook, as she poured it into a hit piece for Cycling Weekly. Inga was offered no right to reply but was instead blocked by Rook on social media. It is distressing to see Inga treated this way, knowing that young female cyclists are watching and will see it as a cautionary tale against speaking up for women’s right to female only sport. Inga is right, however — those women must take courage from the example she is setting for them, or they are going to have to fight for their podium places so much harder down the line.  She fears for the athletes she has left behind and how they may be treated  Gutowsky wrote, “Despite the negativity fostered by Ms. Thompson, we are succeeding and will push forward faster without her.” Inga Thompson has been left reeling by his lack of good grace in commenting on her departure. She fears for the athletes she has left behind and how they may be treated.  Marion Clignet, another experienced rider and member of Union Cycliste Feminine, was initially a sport director at Cynisca, but her contract was not renewed in February. Clignet also opposes trans-identified men competing in women’s sports, though Cynisca is keen to emphasise that this is not why she was let go. However, Clignet told Cycling Weekly that she was “treated differently, bullied, ghosted” and that “Inga was ostracised almost from the very beginning”.  Clignet also alleges that she experienced “rude”and “aggressive” behaviour from members of staff — something the Cynisca team has sought to deny. It looks, even from the outside, as though Cynisca is cleansing the team of the political view that men should not compete in women’s sport. In leading the Board in this direction, Gutowsky is not fostering an environment where women will win, but one where men will beat them, and women will be expected to be quiet about it.  Nothing could send a surer signal to young female cyclists than the treatment of Inga Thompson. If you object to men in your cycle races, then you will have your reputation dragged through the dirt of the cycling media.  Is Inga Thompson scared by what has happened to her? Not at all. She told me, “I will do anything to protect women’s sports and to honour the women who came before me who fought to have women’s rights and for women’s rights in sport. If being bullied so badly and defamed so badly gets women’s sport the attention it needs, then being bullied is worth it.”  Thompson is one of that rare breed of women who is willing to stand up for other women even at great personal cost. She is withstanding the abuse she receives for her views and keeping her eyes on the future for young female cyclists. She is braver than Chris Gutowsky in representing their needs and rights. I hope that whilst those vulnerable young female athletes see the backlash she has faced, they also see that if they don’t stand with her, they will lose the right to fair competition. As I have previously stated, it is crucial that male sportsmen begin to speak out on behalf of these women; they have more financial power to exact change and certainly more financial resilience. If, for example, Chris Froome on a salary of over £5 million spoke up, he wouldn’t feel the breeze of cancel culture rustle his bank account in the slightest. By contrast, it is only the established positions of retired elite sportswomen that allow them to take up arms for those young women being cowed by the boards of their teams. The heroine of this story is Inga Thompson, the woman who simply will not shut up and sit down whilst men shove women from their rightful podium place. The cost of saying “NO” to men is steep — the pride felt by women brave enough to say it is priceless.  (Cynisca, Rook and Cycling Weekly were approached for comment but did not offer any.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JpdGljLmNvLnVrL2luZ2EtdGhvbXBzb24tYW5kLXRoZS1jb3N0LW9mLXNheWluZy1uby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Russia's attack targeted the capital of Kyiv, as well as the coastal city of Odesa, among other cities. Ukrainian officials say their forces shot down 29 of the 30 missiles Russia launched, with the lone survivor striking an industrial target in Odesa and killing one person.  Ukraine's air defenses have become substantially more robust in recent weeks with the addition of U.S.-made Patriot missiles. The defense system has drastically reduced the rate at which Russian missiles strike their targets.  Russia has maintained an unrelenting assault on Ukraine's cities throughout May.

"assassination","1948-10-30","Not Discerned","{""Jejuri"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","Fri 19 May 2023 02:30:15","In April 2023, there arose a set of governmental moves to delete large chunks (in the name of “rationalisation”) from NCERT history textbooks. Kumkum Roy, a former professor of history at JNU, in her recent article in The India Forum, gives a detailed account of the deletions – especially in the section ‘Our Pasts I’ in Class VI textbooks. She notes that any and all references to diversity and socio-cultural difference in India’s deep and complex past are sought to be ironed out. This includes one of Asoka’s edicts which asks citizens to practice tolerance towards persons of other faiths, and try to co-exist peacefully. Crucially, a large part of the subcontinent’s past that involves Muslim rule has been part of such deletion proposals. The renowned historian Romila Thapar wrote in The Wire:  History is based on a continuity of events. It makes little sense to delete large sections of it, as such deletions inevitably confuse both teachers and students. Thus, to jump from the early to the late second millennium AD, and to preferably avoid teaching “Muslim history” can only result in immense confusion. Discussion of the impact of events gets stymied if there are breaks that create huge blanks in the narrative, or else deletions that annul the centrality of discussing an event in order to understand it or observing connections between various actions. Can one really discuss the assassination of a major political leader – in this case Gandhi – without mentioning who exactly the assassin was, what were his possible motives and what resulted as the political aftermath of the event?  Given these comprehensive critiques of the logics of “rationalisation” through which a massive act of public forgetting is being engineered, I seek to look at the practice of public consumption of history itself – its emotional and psychological impact. I wish to examine in this essay, a sense of history through which our everyday life is made possible, considering that the historical imagination is accessed all the time even though most people do not study history in university or go on to become professional historians. I want to go back in time and collect a few historical instances of a syncretic, contradictory sense of India – you may call it Bharat or Hindustan. This idea, M.A. Asif says, existed in rudimentary versions in medieval India, and was definitely not solely an invention of British historians and anthropologists. There is a geographical, cultural, intellectual and aesthetic consensus among court historians on what this entity – Hindustan – might look like. He writes of the historical work written by 17th c. CE historian of the court Adil Shah II, Firishta, in the book The Loss of Hindustan: The Invention of India:  For Firishta’s Hindustan, the intellectual geography has cities such as Ghazni, Kabul, Peshawar, Srinagar, Lahore, Uch, Thatta, Agra, Awadh, Patna, Jaunpur, Dhaka, Gulbarga, Golkonda, Bijapur, Chitor, Ujjain, Patna, Ahmedabad, and Surat, to name the most prominent cities from the tenth to the seventeenth centuries…. We cannot, in any analytical way, divide the histories of these cities along with the lines of ideologies – there is no Hindu period followed by a Muslim period.  This vast expanse of land, needless to say, is diverse and complex. Not only are there many kingdoms, and many kinds of rule – both Hindu and Muslim – the rise of Buddhism and Jainism influenced the social and religious landscape significantly. By the year 1615, when Sir Thomas Roe appeared in the court of Mughal Emperor Jahangir, as a representative of the English king James I, India was an extremely thriving economy and could boast of a composite Indic-Islamic cultural fabric. The historian Audrey Truschke shows in her book The Language of History: Sanskrit Narratives of Indo-Muslim Rule that Jain monks and scholars of Sanskrit regularly found patronage in Mughal courts.  We also know from the comprehensive biography of Dara Shikoh by Supriya Gandhi [The Emperor Who Never Was: Dara Shukoh in Mughal India] – the eldest of Shah Jahan’s sons – who took an active interest in Sufism as well as Indic metaphysical traditions. Significantly, he translated the Upanishads into Persian. Thus, we get a picture of a very cosmopolitan India in medieval times, albeit replete with caste and other hierarchies. It is this contradictory account of a long and complicated history that the textbook deletions seem to want to hide from our children. In so doing, not only do we misinform our children, we also generate a stunted relationship with the concept of the past (or many pasts).  History  Our consumptive approach to the history of India (or the Indian sub-continent) is primarily to neaten and straighten out interlinked, contradictory accounts of our collective, overlapping pasts. My call here is to urge Indian citizens to accept history as subjective, narrative accounts of the past by different people whose perspectives emerged from how they were situated in an era, and within a political establishment. Further, we often impose our contemporary categories – nation-state, state-church divide, secularism – on the past, and end up judging the past as though it were supposed to be an extension of our past.  These attitudes to history and the historical imagination must be corrected in educational institutions (schools included) in order to take the right perspective on the idea of India, as it is embedded in this subcontinent’s – stretching from the Hindu Kush mountains to the Indian Ocean – deep pasts.  What are our relations to diverse realms of our deep past? Deep pasts have laid traces on our collective memory even as we learn the stories of kings and princes and gods and goddesses and wars and festivals from centuries ago. Ram and Sita and Draupadi and Arjun and Krishna form our collective inheritance with which we imagine an India of the deep past – pasts whose temporal measurements are not available to us. They are ingredients of myth, but myth mixes with history in the Indian historical imagination. Historical characters – great monarchs like Akbar and Ashoka – are remembered in almost mythical registers, and the god Ram is remembered through his historically marked birthplace, Ayodhya. Traces of myth generate sacred geographies across the subcontinent for all religions. Diana Eck calls this network “tirthas”, a mytho-geography. Historical characters like the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb or Mahmud of Ghazni are remembered primarily as villains of history for acts such as the desecration of temples like the wealthy, powerful temple of Somnath. Many historical characters can easily be cast in the mould of exemplary goodness or badness. Claiming continuity of our own identity with good or bad characters of history produces pride and/or shame for us in the current time.  Why do we feel the need to take sides with history? Why is it difficult to accept the past with a bit of ambivalence? It rightly concerns us today, but it should not shape our present identity by assuming some king or emperor of the past is ours for the taking. Nor should it give us pride or shame to be of the same ethnicity or religion as some emperor or king who did a right or wrong thing. This ambivalence is important to cultivate in order to render a working political relationship with history. Our relationship with history, in turn, shapes our relationship with political ideologies that determine the present. We will be able to take an attitude of distance and sobriety to many violences of our current times, if we are able to stop attaching historical burdens to present currents of harm and violence. I am primarily talking here about communal, caste and gender violence. Our society and nation are replete with horrific instances of such violence. We render these violences and their implications opaque when we falsely attach them to historical incidents of violence.  Love  Let me transition to telling the story of Bharat or Hindustan not through the dry facts of historical continuity and/or rupture, but through the melodic register of poetry. Love, earthly and divine, features predominantly in any shape of this idea of India. Love for an intimate one as a lover or an admirer is everywhere in literary renditions of Lord Krishna’s leela with Radha, his primary consort, in the Braj region. It begins as early as Jayadeva’s Gitagovinda written in Sanskrit in the 12th century. One finds the early impressions of a character called Radha in the songs of Andal in modern Karnataka as early as the eighth century. Radha and Krishna perform earthly and divine love in assuming an inseparable form in Vaishnava theology that is written by various saints and mystics across the 13th century to the 16th century – including Roop and Jeev Goswami, Madhavacharya, Vallabhacharya, Sri Ramanuj and later poets and mystics like Surdas, Ravidas, Mirabai. The Braj region located in modern Uttar Pradesh, on the banks of the now-heavily-polluted river Yamuna (also widely worshipped as Yamunaji or Yamunarani), grew into a sacred geography that stages Krishna’s adolescence and youth – invoking in the devotee public emotions of dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, madhurya – servitude, friendship, companionship, amour (my translation). This range of emotions are versions of a combined love for the gods, for the community, and for the landscape. Such accounts of individual, social and divine love are found across languages and regions of India. These accounts do not make the history of violence go away.  They instead destabilise history that we learn to parrot through a predictable schema of villains and heroes. These poems and songs across two millenia, collected from across regions, languages and faiths, further show that Indians knew how to love strangers, people and communities who they did not quite understand. It’s the kind of love that in modern, secular language we come to recognise as ‘tolerance’. It is this rich register of love that we are disconnected from today as modern citizens.  I will discuss two poems, both modern, showing a longing for inhabitation of an Indic longtime. I use the word longtime when I could very well have said historical time, but when that is not measured in categories of modern importance like nation, citizenship, war, sovereignty, and so on.  The first poem is a yearning for a lost city, written in the modern era connoting a pain for a Bharat or Hindustan that is lost forever, leaving behind only traces or residues in language and space. These histories cannot be written but in poetry and song.  Magadh by Srikant Verma  Which way lies the city of Magadh?  Listen, O rider of the horse.  From Magadh I come  And to Magadh  I must return.  Which way shall I turn?  To the North of South?  Or to the East of West?  Lo, there lies Magadh!  And now it is gone!  It was only yesterday  That I had left Magadh behind,  It was only yesterday  That the people of Magadh had said.  Do not leave Magadh  I had given them my word.  That before the Sun rises  I shall be back  And now there is no Magadh.  Aren’t you looking for Magadh as well?  Brothers.  This is not the Magadh.  That you have read about in books  This is the Magadh which you  Like me  Have lost forever.  Translated from Hindi by Mrinal Pande. Reproduced from The Bloomsbury Anthology of Great Indian Poems.  The poet here yearns for a place or a feeling called Magadh. Magadh emerges as a signpost for historical amnesia. History allows us a window to keep score and calculate revenge, but this poem underscores an abyss through which a collective, modern agony is accessed.  In the next poem, written in the 1970s (most likely in Bombay because that is where the bilingual poet Arun Kolatkar was based), we find a timeless yearning for god, who is not mentioned explicitly but implied. Politically fuelled history fails us where these poems apply themselves. These poems arise out of a modern abyss – we live in this time making the most rational choices that we can make in our circumstances, when we vote, buy cars, breathe polluted air, protest government policy, all the while feeling a collective pain of a land that is lost to our conscious memory. That belongs to our multifarious gods, that land has fed our ancestors, the lands stands to this day bearing all the environmental violence that we inflict upon. The metaphor of ‘stone’ (implying the deity built in stone) recurs in the poem – the stone, to me, also reflects the mute enduring capacity of the land itself. This collective pain is amplified by the public consumption, erasure and manipulation of history (in textbooks and beyond).  Chaitanya by Arun Kolatakar  sweet as grapes  are the stone of jejuri  said chaitanya.  he popped a stone  in his mouth  and spat out gods  Arun Kolatkar, reproduced from Jejuri, NYRB Classics, 2005.  These poems are highlights of a modern disconnect that the current controversy over textbook deletion exemplifies. We have lost, as a citizenry, a finger on the textures of our past. Magadh is lost not only in geopolitics but in our imagination. The rock or stone that recurs in Kolatkar’s poems are a sign of the everyday lived in a conversation with various forms and iterations of the divine. These are textures of time lost in our current vocabulary. Their traces survive sometimes in the pages of poetry and fiction. They survive at other times in loud protests over this or that historical event that we interpret as sources of our own ignominy or pride. I would choose the former over the latter. As we protest the large-scale deletions of our past from textbooks that tell Indian history to our children, it is important to remember not to own historical names and events in order to take sides in our current political battles.  A version of this article has been published in the Marathi magazine Sarvankash.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2lyZS5pbi9oaXN0b3J5L2luZGlhLWhpc3RvcnktY29tcGxleC1zYW5pdGlzYXRpb27SAUtodHRwczovL20udGhld2lyZS5pbi9hcnRpY2xlL2hpc3RvcnkvaW5kaWEtaGlzdG9yeS1jb21wbGV4LXNhbml0aXNhdGlvbi9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1981-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 22:37:06","A car driven by someone with apparent psychiatric problems rushed through a Vatican gate Thursday evening and sped past Swiss Guards into a palace courtyard before the driver was apprehended by police, the Holy See said.  Vatican gendarmes fired a shot at the speeding car’s front tires after it rushed the gate, but the vehicle managed to continue on its way, the Vatican press office said in a statement late Thursday.  Once the car reached the San Damaso Courtyard of the Apostolic Palace, the driver got out and was immediately arrested by Vatican gendarmes. The Vatican said the driver was about 40 years old and was in a ""serious state of psychophysical alteration."" He was being held in the Vatican barracks.  VATICAN FORMALLY RECOGNIZES 21 COPTIC ORTHODOX WORKERS WHO WERE BEHEADED BY ISLAMIC MILITANTS AS MARTYRS  It wasn't clear if Pope Francis was anywhere near the incident, which occurred after 8 p.m. at the Santa Anna gate, one of the main entrances to the Vatican City State in the heart of Rome.  Francis lives on the other side of Vatican City at the Santa Marta hotel, where at that hour he would normally be having dinner and retiring to his room. The Vatican statement said that as soon as the gendarmes sounded the alarm of an incursion, the main gate blocking access to the piazza in front of Francis' hotel was shut.  ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, MAY 13, 1981, POPE JOHN PAUL II SURVIVES ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT  The incident was a rare incursion into the city state, much of which is off limits to the general public, especially at night.  While visitors can access St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museums during business hours, and people with doctors’ prescriptions can go to the Vatican pharmacy, permission is required to get into other buildings in the enclave.  The Apostolic Palace, which houses the papal apartments, key reception rooms, the Vatican archives and offices, is guarded around the clock by Swiss Guards and gendarmes who man various checkpoints.

"assassination","2023-10-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 00:01:12","In the contemporary world, it is easy to take for granted the privilege of having a voice. The right to express ourselves, to voice our opinions and concerns, to join in the dialogue on matters that affect our lives. These are fundamental freedoms we enjoy but often do not fully appreciate until they are gone. The profound quote from Malala Yousafzai, ""We realize the importance of our voices only when we are silenced,"" emphasizes this poignant reality.  Malala's journey is a testament to the power of the voice. As a young girl in Pakistan, she used her voice to advocate for girls' education, standing up against the Taliban's oppressive regime. When her voice became too powerful and too influential, she was brutally silenced and shot in an assassination attempt. However, her forced silence only amplified her message globally, evoking a wave of support and bringing attention to the cause she so fiercely advocated.  But how does this relate to us? Most of us are not living under oppressive regimes, and our voices are not under threat of physical violence. But do we truly understand the importance of our voice? Do we use it wisely and boldly, or do we sometimes let fear, apathy, or indifference silence us?  Each of us has unique experiences, perspectives, and insights. When we express these authentically, we contribute to the richness and diversity of thought in the world. Our voice can inspire change, motivate others, and even be a beacon of hope. We all have that inherent power, but the noise and distractions of modern life often obscure it. When we consciously silence ourselves, we lose out on opportunities to connect, grow, and affect change. Our voice becomes potent only when we choose to express it.  Moreover, we should remember that having a voice is not just about speaking; it is also about being heard. It means making a conscious effort to listen to others, to understand their perspectives, and to validate their experiences. In this interconnected world, we can empower each other by recognizing and affirming the value of each voice.  In contrast, being silenced doesn't always mean the absence of speech. It can also mean being unheard, ignored, or invalidated. It is when we find ourselves in these situations of silence that we truly understand the vital importance of having a voice. As Malala's experience has shown us, even in the harshest forms of silencing, the spirit of the message can break through louder and stronger.  However, the goal should be not to wait until we are silenced to appreciate the importance of our voice. Instead, let us realize the power and responsibility that comes with having a voice. Let's commit to using it wisely, confidently, and empathetically, contributing to a world where every voice is heard and valued.  Malala's quote is a poignant reminder and an inspiration for us all. A reminder that our voices are important and that they can be catalysts for change. And an inspiration that even when silenced, the power of a voice can echo across the world. Let us learn from her courage, and never underestimate the potency of our own voice.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3Bvd2VyLW9mLXZvaWNlLWltcG9ydGFuY2UtcmV2ZWFsZWQtaW4tc2lsZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2018-03-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Fri 19 May 2023 04:16:00","Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  Sunday May 21 is election day in Timor-Leste, when voters decide on 65 members of parliament to represent them. Each election is a reminder of the successful regional and international cooperation that led to Timor-Leste’s independence. It’s also a reminder of the importance of Timor-Leste as an exemplar of democracy, peace and human rights as foundational values.  It is in Australia’s interest that this be nurtured.  As a small state facing many challenges, maintaining these values has regional and global resonance. Timor-Leste is an important voice both in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is a successful state that, despite difficulties, has been able to be peace-loving and sustain relations with Indonesia.  By contrast, democratic regression, or the worst-case scenario of a failed state, would be an enormous setback for the entire region.  What role should Australia play in keeping this democracy strong?  The history of the Australia-Timor-Leste bilateral relationship is complicated. It includes the vital Timorese assistance during the second world war and Australia’s tacit approval of Indonesia’s 1975 annexation. It also includes Australia leading the United Nations International Force East Timor (INTERFET), which in turn led to Timor-Leste’s transition to independence following a referendum in 1999.  The two nations have been complexly intertwined through Timor-Leste’s journey to independence and democratic development.  There have been instances of unease between the two countries. The most notable was the allegation of Australian spying during negotiations on the Greater Sunrise oil fields. This remains an ongoing issue with the potential to derail ties again.  Read more: After a border dispute and spying scandal, can Australia and Timor-Leste be good neighbours?  But there have also been positive steps, such as Operation Astute, an Australian-led military and police deployment. This operation helped stabilise the country during the 2006-2008 political turmoil that culminated in the attempted assassination of President Jose Ramos-Horta and his medical evacuation.  Story continues  In 2018, Australia and Timor-Leste concluded a treaty establishing their maritime boundaries following a United Nations conciliation process.  The complexity of the relationship means Australia needs to be respectful in relations, but it should not stop Australia from being a partner to support Timor-Leste’s democratic processes and institutions.  Australia and Timor-Leste came to a resolution on a maritime dispute in March 2018. Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  A recent report outlines how Australia can support Timor-Leste’s governance in ways that ensure effective, capable and legitimate institutions that are responsive to people.  Australia has a track record of such programs. The eight-year, $72 million Governance for Development Program supported Timor-Leste agencies to develop good policy and improve systems as well as helping civil society engage with government decision-making. The program worked in areas including public financial management, economic policy, enabling business, public service administration, law reform and financial services.  The Partnership for Inclusive Prosperity (PROVISU) will continue to support good governance and economic policy by providing support to Timor-Leste’s central government agencies and economic ministries. Through programs like this, Australia can offer meaningful support to Timor-Leste.  Good governance that responds to citizens’ needs is a perennial problem. Timor-Leste’s nascent bureaucracy makes this a priority issue. Australia should continue to develop partnerships that strengthen institutions so they are able to deal with problems.  An example of this is PARTISIPA, a ten-year $80 million program to improve access to quality basic infrastructure and services. It works in partnership with national and subnational governments to improve the delivery of decentralised services and village-level infrastructure, such as rural water. It continues Australia’s long-term support for the national village development program and its community-driven processes.  Another area where Australia can contribute is in media.  Timor-Leste has a vibrant media landscape that is among the freest in the region. Australian can support Timor-Leste to ensure its media are strong and robust as well as free, with public interest is at its core. It can also work with local media to strengthen their ability to educate the general public on governance issues, to hold power to account and to promote the rule of law.  Australia can help Timor-Leste maintain a vibrant and free media landscape. Antonio Dasiparu/AAP  An example of this is a recent memorandum of understanding between the ABC and Timor-Leste’s public broadcaster RTTL, which includes media development programs. The agreement recognises the vital role both organisations play in informing audiences and contributing to democracy. The ABC will work with RTTL to establish a new English-language news service, helping staff enhance their journalism and content-making skills.  Another priority Australia can engage with is the justice system.  Consultations with Timorese civil society organisations, conducted by The Asia Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Development, Diplomacy & Defence Dialogue (AP4D) report, revealed a particular concern about rebuilding trust in the judicial system. It’s an area with which Australia has not been greatly involved compared to Portugal.  Australia should also engage with Timorese political parties, recognising the important structural role they play in governance. This can complement continued engagement with formal government institutions and the national parliament. Australia should continue to invest in the protection and promotion of human rights.  Read more: ASEAN leaders give 'in-principle' support for Timor-Leste's membership. What does this actually mean?  Finally, Australia should be a partner for youth civic and political engagement, given the reality of a future political transition from independence leaders to younger generations.  Timor-Leste today lives with a legacy of conflict, which has far-reaching implications. There is significant pressure on government to meet the needs and expectations of the Timorese people. Australia can be a partner to support these goals.  By helping to build a stronger, resilient and prosperous Timor-Leste, Australia is investing in a more secure and stable immediate neighbourhood, which will reap mutual benefits.

"assassination","1857-11-11","Not Discerned","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 19:07:12","Cameron Rowland, Depreciation, 2018. Restrictive covenant; 1 acre on Edisto Island, South Carolina  40 acres and a mule as reparations for slavery originates in General William Tecumseh Sherman’s Special Field Orders No. 15, issued on January 16, 1865. Sherman’s Field Order 15 was issued out of concern for a potential uprising of the thousands of ex-slaves who were following his army by the time it arrived in Savannah.[1]  The field order stipulated that “The islands from Charleston south, the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea, and the country bordering the Saint Johns River, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement of the negroes now made free by the acts of war and the proclamation of the President of the United States. Each family shall have a plot of not more than forty acres of tillable ground.”[2]  This was followed by the formation of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands in March 1865. In the months immediately following the issue of the field orders, approximately 40,000 former slaves settled in the area designated by Sherman on the basis of possessory title.[3] 10,000 of these former slaves were settled on Edisto Island, South Carolina.[4]  In 1866, following Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson effectively rescinded Field Order 15 by ordering these lands be returned to their previous Confederate owners.  Former slaves were given the option to work for their former masters as sharecroppers or be evicted. If evicted, former slaves could be arrested for homelessness under vagrancy clauses of the Black Codes. Those who refused to leave and refused to sign sharecrop contracts were threatened with arrest.  Although restoration of the land to the previous Confederate owners was slowed in some cases by court challenges filed by ex-slaves, nearly all the land settled was returned by the 1870s. As Eric Foner writes, “Johnson had in effect abrogated the Confiscation Act and unilaterally amended the law creating the [Freedmen’s] Bureau. The idea of a Freedmen’s Bureau actively promoting black landownership had come to an abrupt end.”[5] The Freedmen’s Bureau agents became primary proponents of labor contracts inducting former slaves into the sharecropping system.[6]  Among the lands that were repossessed in 1866 by former Confederate owners was the Maxcy Place plantation. “A group of freed people were at Maxcy Place in January 1866 …The people contracted to work for the proprietor, but no contract or list of names has been found.”[7]  The one-acre piece of land at 8060 Maxie Road, Edisto Island, South Carolina, was part of the Maxcy Place plantation. This land was purchased at market value on August 6, 2018, by 8060 Maxie Road, Inc., a nonprofit company formed for the sole purpose of buying this land and recording a restrictive covenant on its use. This covenant has as its explicit purpose the restriction of all development and use of the property by the owner.  The property is now appraised at $0. By rendering it legally unusable, this restrictive covenant eliminates the market value of the land. These restrictions run with the land, regardless of the owner. As such, they will last indefinitely.  As reparation, this covenant asks how land might exist outside of the legal-economic regime of property that was instituted by slavery and colonization. Rather than redistributing the property, the restriction imposed on 8060 Maxie Road’s status as valuable and transactable real estate asserts antagonism to the regime of property as a means of reparation.  ———  [1] Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution, 1863–1877, updated ed.

Fighting between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza ended after five days, as a ceasefire took effect and appeared to hold late May 13.    Over the course of the fighting, 33 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, including civilians and combatants. Two civilians were killed in Israel – a woman in the central Israeli city of Rehovot and a Gaza resident who was working in a town on the Israeli side of the border.    Islamic Jihad shot more than 1,000 rockets at Israel during the conflict; many that were aimed at populated areas were intercepted by Israel’s missile defense systems, and some fell short in Gaza. Israel conducted hundreds of airstrikes in Gaza, killing six Islamic Jihad leaders.    This round of fighting began on Tuesday, May 9, as Israel assassinated senior leaders of Islamic Jihad, which is designated by the United States and European Union as a terror group. Those assassinations followed a day of heavy conflict between the two sides one week earlier, after a senior member of Islamic Jihad died of a hunger strike in an Israeli prison.    Tuesday’s airstrikes also came after far-right figures in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s governing coalition pushed for a harsher response to the Gaza rockets.    Egypt mediated Saturday’s ceasefire, and a statement from Netanyahu’s office “thanked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and expressed the appreciation of the State of Israel for Egypt’s intensive efforts to secure a ceasefire.”    The statement added that Israel would refrain from further airstrikes, as long as rocket attacks from Gaza ceased.    Unlike previous rounds of conflict between Israel and militants in Gaza, Hamas, the group that controls the coastal strip and likewise is designated as a terror group by the United States and EU, appeared to remain on the sidelines. Israel and Hamas have fought several times in recent decades, with their deadliest conflict taking place in the 2014 Gaza War.  — JTA    ","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vamh2b25saW5lLmNvbS9jZWFzZWZpcmUtZW5kcy1pc3JhZWxnYXphLWNvbmZsaWN0LWFmdGVyLWRheXMtb2YtZmlnaHRpbmctcDMxOTc0LTk3Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WHNT) — U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) is firing back at U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper (D-CO) after Hickenlooper claimed former President Donald Trump politicized the decision to move the U.S. Space Command Headquarters to Redstone Arsenal.  The junior senator from Colorado made these claims in response to an NBC report Monday that said President Joe Biden may prevent Space Command Headquarters move to Alabama over the state’s abortion policies.  Hickenlooper sent out a series of tweets Wednesday, referring to the NBC report, saying “This focuses on the extreme abortion laws in Alabama and Sen. Tuberville’s decision to bar military promotions – a hold that directly affects military readiness.”  He also questioned the validity of the review process.  “The process that led to the initial decision to move space command to Alabama was ‘minimally credible’ and left out key considerations,” Hickenlooper said via Twitter.  Senator Tuberville responded to Hickenlooper’s tweets saying in part “… the facts are clear – and the facts are on Alabama’s side.”  In a statement made Wednesday regarding Senator Tuberville’s decision to block military promotions, Tuberville said “If I thought this had anything to do with it, obviously, we wouldn’t be going down this road. But I believe in life.”  Today just happens to be the 60th anniversary since President John F. Kennedy visited Redstone Arsenal, months before his assassination.  During a recorded video commemorating the anniversary, Senator Tuberville implored President Biden to visit the Rocket City.  “And so today I want to challenge President Joe Biden,” Tuberville said. “Come to Huntsville. See with your own eyes why this is the best place for Space Command. Put politics aside and do what’s right for this country.”  Despite reports that President Biden wants to prevent Space Command Headquarters from coming to Redstone Arsenal, ultimately the decision remains in the hands of the Secretary of the Air Force.  So far, Secretary Frank Kendall has given no timetable for a decision.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3dobnQuY29tL25ld3MvaHVudHN2aWxsZS90dWJlcnZpbGxlLWludm9sdmVkLWluLXR3aXR0ZXItZXhjaGFuZ2Utd2l0aC1jb2xvcmFkby1zZW5hdG9yLW92ZXItc3BhY2UtY29tbWFuZC1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtbG9jYXRpb24v0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd2hudC5jb20vbmV3cy9odW50c3ZpbGxlL3R1YmVydmlsbGUtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4tdHdpdHRlci1leGNoYW5nZS13aXRoLWNvbG9yYWRvLXNlbmF0b3Itb3Zlci1zcGFjZS1jb21tYW5kLWhlYWRxdWFydGVycy1sb2NhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Born on May 19, 1925, his life was marked by an unyielding commitment to racial equality and social justice.  Early Life  Malcolm Little, who would later adopt the name Malcolm X, was born in Omaha, Nebraska. His childhood was fraught with hardships and violence. His father, a Baptist preacher and supporter of Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, was allegedly killed by white supremacists. His mother was institutionalised for mental health issues, and Malcolm and his siblings were placed in foster care.  During his early life, Malcolm faced significant racial discrimination, which influenced his views on race and social inequality. In his teen years, he relocated to Boston and later Harlem in New York City, where he became involved in criminal activities.  Prison and Conversion  In 1946, Malcolm was sentenced to ten years in prison for larceny and breaking and entering. It was in prison where he began a transformative journey. He was introduced to the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI), a Black nationalist and religious movement, through his brother Reginald. He began to study the teachings of NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, which led to his conversion to Islam. It was also during this time that he adopted 'X' as his last name, a symbol for the African identity that he felt had been stolen from him and other African Americans due to slavery.  Rise to Prominence  Upon his release from prison in 1952, Malcolm X became a devoted follower and spokesperson for the NOI. His charisma, intelligence, and powerful oratory skills quickly propelled him into the national spotlight. He fiercely criticized the mainstream civil rights movement and its advocates, like Martin Luther King Jr., for their nonviolent approach, arguing instead for racial separatism and self-defense in the face of racial violence.  Malcolm X's philosophy evolved throughout his life. After a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964, he became disillusioned with the NOI and its teachings. He embraced Sunni Islam and began to advocate for racial harmony, rather than separatism.  Assassination and Legacy  On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated while giving a speech in Harlem. His killers were identified as members of the NOI. His assassination marked a tragic end to a life dedicated to challenging the status quo and fighting for the rights of African Americans.  Malcolm X's legacy continues to resonate today. He is often celebrated for his unapologetic critique of systemic racism, his powerful articulation of Black identity, and his advocacy for Black self-determination. His life and work continue to inspire and influence movements for racial and social justice across the globe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8veW91cnN0b3J5LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L21hbGNvbG0teC1iaXJ0aC1saWZlLWxlZ2FjeS0xOTI1LW1heS0xOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The court had granted permission for Anas to testify wearing a mask in open court, with the condition that he reveals his face to the accused person in the judges' chambers beforehand.    The decision was announced in a statement by Tiger Eye P.I, the investigative firm led by Anas, which expressed concerns about the potential risks to his safety and security.

His fellow workers responded by declaring a strike. The dockworker, Juan Oscar Contreras, was a night-shift casual worker.  He slipped from on top of a truck that was at the edge of the dock; a temporary bridge had been placed between the truck and the ship that was being unloaded. Other workers immediately lifted him out of the water but could not revive him. The port has no emergency squads, equipment or ambulances.  Port of Rosario Argentina, container yard. [Photo: Claudio Elias]  Workers denounced port authorities over unsafe conditions that exist throughout the facility, and initiated strike action. One worker pointed out that, while there are life vests in the facility, none of them are distributed among the longshore workers. According to one eyewitness, management tried to dress Contreras’s body with a life vest.  Cesar Aybar, head of the local trade union, the Sindicato Unidos Portuarios Argentinos (SUPA), declared: “Sadly, between 4 and 5 in the morning, one of our fellow workers died. We have been denouncing for a long time the way that things are done; the port is not in the conditions it needs to be in, in terms of hygiene and safety.” Aybar said that this was the third dockworker fatality at Puerto Rosario.  The national federation of longshore unions, FEPA, indicated that it was considering a national strike over the worker’s death, which it described as an “assassination,” a result of the port’s negligence. “Our organization totally backs the work stoppage organized by the United Dockworkers of Rosario (SUPA Rosario) and demands an exhaustive investigation on this worker’s death,” it stated.  Both SUPA and FEPA are corporatist organizations with a long history of corruption and betrayal of workers’ struggles. Both organizations are accomplices in what amounts to decades of deterioration in Argentina’s logistical network, of which the ports are an important part. The Rosario Terminal is a major exporter of cereals, sunflower seeds, soybeans, vegetable oils and processed agricultural commodities.  Argentine ports, once government property, were privatized in the 1990s, under the pro-business administration of Peronist president Raúl Ménem. The major ports, such as Rosario, were taken over by multinational agribusiness conglomerates, including US-based Cargill and Bunge, Dreyfus (France), COFCO (China), Glencore (Switzerland), and Vicentín and AGD (based in Argentina). Vicentín is one of the owners of the Port of Rosario Terminal, where Contreras fell and died.  These owners exercise oligarchic control over the ports and their workers. Government agencies keep no independent records of the exports of cereals, oils and other agricultural products; they rely on what the companies volunteer to report.  Argentina’s ports were privatized together with other parts of the country’s logistics supply chain, including railroads and airlines.  The work stoppage takes place in an atmosphere of open rebellion among Argentine workers. In January, Rosario dockworkers ended strike action over the sacking of 25 dockworkers and attacks on wages, along with company-imposed speed-ups.  Other sections of the working class currently carrying out protest strikes and strikes over wages and working conditions include subway workers and educators. Many of these uprisings take on a spontaneous character and are in opposition to the trade union bureaucracies.  On Tuesday, Port of Rosario management refused to meet with a government arbitrator and locked out the port workers. Two hundred trucks have been prevented from entering the terminal, as the company (Valentín) attempts to pit dockworkers against the truck drivers. Port of Rosario Terminal head Leonardo Feltrinelli cynically claimed that Contreras’s death had been merely “a fatality” and gave guarantees that safety procedures had “been verified” by the company.  According to a spokesperson for the SUPA union, “the company refused to give in to the arbitrator’s suggestions and declared that the work would take place as it saw fit.” Describing operations at the port as “very poor” in terms of infrastructure, hygiene and safety, the SUPA bureaucrat called on the provincial governor to intervene.  Neither SUPA nor any of the port unions have called for an extension of the work stoppage at the Port of Rosario Terminal to all the other terminals and ports, isolating the Port of Rosario workers. It now appears that dockworkers will be back on the job toward the end of this week, even though nothing seems to have been resolved.  Argentina is in the midst of an inflationary debt crisis and is very dependent on its export revenues; yearly price increases exceed 100 percent. Its finances have been taken over by the International Monetary Fund which is demanding ever-increasing austerity policies on behalf of national and international vulture funds. These include a drop in imports and attacks on workers’ living standards.  Over 40 percent of the population now subsists below the poverty line. A recent report from the Catholic University in Buenos Aires indicates that, since the pandemic began in 2020 there has been a dramatic increase in youth hunger (among those under 17 years of age) as well as increases in extreme hunger. This, in a nation that continues to be one of the world’s leading providers of agricultural foodstuffs. Increases in government food aid and other programs for the poor are quickly eclipsed by price increases.  Agricultural monopolies play a huge role as the Argentine economy struggles to resolve its financial implosion.  In an attempt to deal with the inflationary crisis, the current administration created a soy-bean-based peso-dollar exchange. Exporters that deposit their dollars in Argentine banks are guaranteed an exchange rate that exceeds the official peso price of dollars. Yet exporters are very much part of the flight of dollars out of the country, routinely depositing their dollar profits in tax-havens across the world.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvaml4Yi1tMTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Hiroshima"", ""Hiroshima"", ""Japan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 07:13:48","Security is tight at every G7 summit, but this year's host Japan has more to prove than most, after an attack last month on the prime minister and the 2022 assassination of ex-premier Shinzo Abe.    Some 24,000 security personnel are reportedly being deployed to Hiroshima during the summit, most dispatched from other parts of the country.    Well ahead of the May 19-21 talks, patrolling police have been weaving between tour groups in the western city's famed Peace Park.    Security personnel were also motoring up and down the river that runs alongside sites like the Atomic Bomb Dome, with helicopters regularly buzzing overhead.    The measures have extended far beyond the city, including to the capital Tokyo, where messages on the train system warn of heightened security for the summit.    Major cities in Japan do not generally have rubbish bins in public places, but security personnel have been sealing off other places considered to pose a potential threat.    Coin lockers, which are common in many stations, have been put out of operation at major stations as far afield as Tokyo.    Vending machines on subway platforms have also been unplugged and sealed with tape, along with apologetic signs warning they will be unavailable during the summit for security reasons.    In Hiroshima, signs across the city and in hotels remind locals and tourists alike that the summit will cause disruption, including the closure of streets and access to the island of Miyajima, which leaders are expected to visit.    - 'Inconvenience understandable' -    Dozens of schools and other institutions have simply opted to close during the summit, according to local media.    But Yoshinari Kakei, who was out walking his dog in the Peace Park early Wednesday evening said he was ""grateful"" for the heavy security.    ""Inconvenience and limitations are understandable. We will just live with that during this period,"" the 52-year-old told AFP.    The measures are likely to be closely scrutinised less than a year after a gunman assassinated former prime minister Abe as he campaigned in the city of Nara.    Then in April, a man hurled an explosive device towards Prime Minister Fumio Kishida shortly before he was due to deliver a campaign speech in the city of Wakayama.    He escaped unharmed, but the fact that an assailant was able to throw the device at such close range so soon after the Abe murder prompted renewed criticism of security arrangements in Japan.    The head of Japan's National Police Agency, and the local police chief, resigned in the wake of Abe's assassination after an investigation confirmed ""shortcomings"" in the security for the former leader.    The investigation slammed a system under which local police were given responsibility for the security of visiting senior officials and argued that with better measures, it was ""highly probable"" the attack could have been prevented.    Kishida has instructed police to step up security around the G7 ""so that guests can visit Japan with peace of mind"".    Leaders from G7 members Japan, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union will be joined by invitees including Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHA6Ly93d3cubXR2LmNvbS5sYi9lbi9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMTM2MzY0Ni9qYXBhbi1yYW1wcy11cC1nNy1zZWN1cml0eS1hZnRlci1wbS1hdHRhY2tz0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXR2LmNvbS5sYi9BTVAvRGV0YWlscy8xMzYzNjQ2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pennsylvanian William Post III, known as Bud, said he managed to scrape together $40 (£32) after pawning a ring and spent it on lottery tickets back in 1988.  Loading…  His landlady, who was also his on-off partner, Ann Karpik bought an additional 20 entries and one of those 60 tickets turned out to be the jackpot winner.  Advert 10  Post scooped a whopping $16.2million (£13m) and took the option to have it paid out annually, in instalments of $498,000 (£401,253).  With such a healthy sum of money landing in his account each year, you’d think Post would be set for life, but as we've seen before from lottery winners, it didn't turn out like that.  According to reports at the time, Post managed to burn his way through $300,000 (£241,719) of his first payout ‘within weeks’ of receiving it.  And if you’re wondering how he managed to do that, well, despite not owning a pilot's licence, Post splashed out on a twin-engine plane for himself and bought businesses for his siblings.  Advert 10  William Post III, known as Bud, scooped £13m on the lottery. Credit: William Post III  In the words of his bankruptcy lawyer John Lacher: “He did everything you would expect of a guy who became a millionaire overnight.”  Unbelievably, just three months after being given his $498,000, he was $500,000 (£402,865) in debt and, when his second instalment landed in his bank account, rather than pay what he owned, he bought a $395,000 (£318,263) mansion - leaving his debts to mount.  His money problems weren’t his only worries - his brother Jeffery hired a hitman to try and kill Post and his sixth wife, in a botched attempt to claim an inheritance.  Advert 10  Things continued on a downward spiral for Post; in 1989, one year after his big win, Karpik launched legal proceedings against Post, claiming he had told her they would split the cash and in 1992 she won the case.  Post pawned a ring to buy 40 lottery tickets. Credit: Pexels/Erik Mclean  With his debts mounting, Post sold his mansion and auctioned off the rest of his annual lottery payouts.  What was left of his cash prize, around $2.6 million (£2.09m) , was soon frittered away, too.  Advert 10  But Post’s bad luck wasn’t over yet - in 1998 he was arrested for an assault conviction from six years previous. Post had been convicted after firing a gun at a debt collector who turned up at his home.  Post served his time and came out to a very different way of life - living off just $450 (£362) a month disability payment. He died penniless in 2006 aged just 66.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhZGJpYmxlLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dpbGxpYW0tcG9zdC1paWktYnVkLWxvdHRlcnktd2luLWJyb3RoZXItOTE1MTY1LTIwMjMwNTE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1968-11-22","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 10:59:00","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was once a hero of the environment in New York.  He helped push a fracking ban. As an environmental lawyer, he spent more than three decades fighting for a cleaner Hudson River. He protected New York City’s reservoir in the Catskills. He pressed for the closure of the Indian Point nuclear plant. He founded an environmental group devoted to water protection that has worked on six continents.  That Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is gone.  Advertisement  The long shot presidential candidate and onetime crusader for environmental protections has transformed into a font of anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracies. That includes promoting false claims about the assassination of his father, former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy.  “It’s hard not to be sad about it,” said Alex Beauchamp, Northeast region director for Food & Water Watch, who was a Kennedy ally during the years long fight to ban fracking in New York.  “You start to have a couple of crazy views, and then, all of a sudden, you’re a full-blown conspiracy theorist,” Beauchamp said. “I do think it changed; I don’t think he was the same 10 years ago.”  Last month, Kennedy officially launched his bid against President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary. Since then, his poll numbers have been surprisingly strong, reaching as high as 21 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight, a media and poll tracking site. That puts him in a similar position to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in his uphill battle against former President Donald Trump on the Republican side.  The Kennedy campaign did not respond to a request for comment. However, in an interview last month with a New York radio station, Kennedy blamed the media for portraying him as “crazy” and said people would be open to his ideas.  “When they see me, I don’t look like the mischaracterizations,” he said. “It may be that people just want something different.”  Kennedy’s environmental work in New York is the type of resume that climate-minded Democrats could embrace — had he not clouded it with his public persona of the last few years.  Kennedy, with his famous lineage and long career of battling and beating polluters, was a regular presence at the New York State Capitol. He’d stand atop its grand staircase looking down at hundreds of cheering activists hanging on to his every word as he railed against fracking, Hudson River pollution and greedy corporations poisoning natural resources.  But over the last decade, Kennedy’s visits to the New York State Capitol became less about environmental causes and more about attacking the safety and efficacy of vaccines. It’s there where he began to split his time as an anti-vaccine activist and as a climate champion. He would spout discredited claims about vaccines causing autism one day, and then the next, he would be back to the Hudson River protections.  By 2015, Kennedy was using his name to host press conferences where he pushed false claims about vaccines harming children who receive meningitis shots. He wasn’t holding forth on the grand Capitol staircase, however, and in June of that year, he crowded reporters into a small basement room off the Capitol with angry parents who claimed vaccines had caused autism in their children, a thoroughly debunked claim.  Kennedy and his supporters shouted at reporters for hiding the “truth” about vaccines. He flipped over a poster board and began writing, in small, barely legible script, formulas that he claimed proved his point that additives in vaccines were harming children.  Kennedy told reporters that vaccines were “making our children dumber and … giving them injuries.”  It was a difficult moment.  However, Kennedy would take that message and expand on it wildly, traveling to other state capitols to fight against similar meningitis vaccine legislation. Within a few years, he would step down from his long-held positions on some of New York’s top environmental groups, Riverkeeper and the Waterkeeper Alliance he founded. In a resignation letter, he said he devoted himself full time to anti-vaccine causes and conspiracies.  “A series of recent events have aligned my thoughts and feelings and given me the clarity to conclude it’s time to move on,” Kennedy wrote when he resigned from Riverkeeper, the group that he had built up since 1984 to become an environmental powerhouse of water protectors around the country.  Kennedy has traced his attacks on vaccines to his work fighting against mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. He has said that mothers who believed their children had been poisoned by trace mercury amounts in vaccines attended some of his public rallies calling for tighter regulations on coal plant emissions. He listened to their stories and it convinced him that he should also look at the health industry in the same way he viewed the fossil fuel industry.  In some circles, Kennedy has enjoyed renewed popularity during the Covid-19 era, where more people are open to vaccine hesitancy and conspiracies. He has helped raise millions of dollars for the Children’s Health Defense, which traffics vaccine misinformation as well as the “dangers” of internet cell towers and radiation.  He also has called for the release of his father’s killer, Sirhan Sirhan, who he claimed did not murder his father. In a recent radio interview, he said the CIA could have been involved in his uncle’s murder, a long-running and debunked conspiracy theory.  In the first weeks of his presidential campaign, Kennedy has not rejected climate science, but now claims that climate policy is part of an international conspiracy involving Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum. That type of rhetoric fits squarely with the “Great Reset” conspiracy, which holds that governments will exploit the protocols of the Covid-19 era to force “climate lockdowns,” including forcing people to eat bugs instead of meat.  “Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know, the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big, you know, mega-billionaires, the same way that Covid was exploited, to use it as an excuse to clamp down top-down totalitarian controls on society,” Kennedy recently told radio show host Kim Iversen, who has also trafficked in conspiracy theories around Covid-19 and vaccines.  Some in New York who fought alongside Kennedy for years feel betrayed.  Kennedy waged so many important environmental battles in New York for so many years that the activist community mostly looked the other way when he started to ramp up his anti-scientific screeds against public health, said former state Assemblyman Steven Englebright (D), who chaired the Environmental Conservation Committee. He said the Kennedy name and the long record of success discouraged people from ostracizing their erratic ally at a time when he alternated between climate and anti-vaccine causes.  “I don’t see that man anymore. From what I see, he’s eccentric at best and maybe disturbed,” Englebright said. “He has lost his way in a direction away from science, and the other word for science is facts.”  The new Kennedy is a purveyor of cherry-picked and junk science who claims public health officials act like Nazis, compares Anthony Fauci to Adolf Hitler and invokes Anne Frank when discussing vaccinations. His own family is horrified at what he is doing to harm the public at large and the political legacy he inherited.  “Bobby’s lies and fear-mongering yesterday were both sickening and repulsive,” Kerry Kennedy wrote on Twitter after her brother referenced Anne Frank. “I strongly condemn him for his hateful rhetoric.”  More recently, Kerry Kennedy has made it clear that the family does not support his presidential run.  “I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues, including the Covid pandemic, vaccinations and the role of social media platforms in policing false information,” Kerry Kennedy said in a statement after he launched his campaign.  Some of his former opponents, however, are thrilled at what they see.  Kennedy once told Marc Morano, a conservative activist who runs a prominent climate denial blog, that those who reject climate science should be held criminally liable and that polluters should be thrown in jail. Now, Morano says, all is forgiven because Kennedy is “undergoing a genuine transformation over his views on the climate agenda.”  He considers the new Kennedy an ally in his fight to sow doubt and distrust around climate science, vaccine research and Covid-19 public health measures.  “I have received some flak from my fellow climate skeptics for being so welcoming and forgiving to RFK Jr., given his hostile history to anyone opposing the climate ‘consensus,’ but I truly believe we are at a pivotal point in U.S. history where we need to realign coalitions to oppose Covid and climate coercion,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3cy5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvcmZrLWpyLWdyZWVuLWhlcm8tdHVybmVkLWFudGktdmFjY2luZS1hY3RpdmlzdC10YWtlcy1vbi1iaWRlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The head of Ukraine's military intelligence service has said in an interview that Kyiv has assassinated Russian propagandists.  Major General Kyrylo Budanov made the admission to the Ukrainian YouTube channel Rizni Lyudi. According to a translation by the independent Russian-language outlet Meduza, Budanov said that Ukraine had ""successfully targeted quite a few people"" associated with Kremlin propaganda since the start of the war nearly 15 months ago.  Budanov did not provide any names of individuals that Ukraine has allegedly targeted, but several well-known, pro-Kremlin figures have been killed or wounded inside Russia since the start of the war.  Among the more high-profile incidents was last August's car-bomb killing of Darya Dugina, the journalist daughter of Aleksandr Dugin, an ideologue known as ""Putin's philosopher.""  More recently, the prominent military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky was killed by an explosion at a Saint Petersburg café in April, and earlier this month pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin was injured in car-bomb attack.  Ukraine had previously denied involvement in the deaths of Dugin and Tatarsky, while Kyiv's security services neither confirmed nor denied having a role in the Prilepin incident.  Though he didn't give more details about Ukraine's involvement in any Russian propagandists' deaths, Budanov told Rizni Lyudi that ""[t]here have been well-publicized cases everyone knows about, thanks to the media coverage.""  On Tuesday, Budanov also spoke to the Ukrainian YouTube channel ISLND TV. During the interview, he hinted at targeting individuals in countries outside of Ukraine, according to a translation by the Kyiv Post.  ""Outright scum will eventually be punished in any country in the world. Only elimination can be a well-deserved punishment for such actions,"" Budanov said, per the Kyiv Post.  He continued, ""I do not consider anything else. It is my personal opinion, I stick to it, and I will implement it.""  Elsewhere in his talk with Rizni Lyudi, Budanov said that the ""Russian army's potential for advancing is completely depleted, but it still has a significant defensive potential.""  ""They've erected a multi-tier defense system,"" he said. ""Still, this isn't the same Russian army that could have been expected to conduct substantial offensive operations.""  Budanov also offered some praise for the Wagner Group of Russian mercenaries and its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, at least in comparison to the Russian Defense Ministry's formal military forces.  ""Wagner Group is maximally effective; the Defense Ministry's regular army is maximally ineffective,"" Budanov reportedly said. ""Out of sheer envy, the Russian command is trying to undermine and eliminate Wagner Group...The terrible thing is that 80 percent of what Prigozhin says is absolutely true.""  When asked about Budanov's comments, Jason Jay Smart—a political adviser on post-Soviet and international politics—described the role propagandists can play during times of war.  ""The Nuremberg Trials found Julius Streicher, a propagandist, guilty for having driven the German population to wage war,"" Smart told Newsweek. ""Russian propagandists today play a critical role in advancing the Kremlin's narrative across the nation. Removing these vocal supporters of genocide would be a positive for both Ukraine and, ultimately, Russia.""

In a discussion with Daveed Diggs for Interview magazine, Hawke admitted that he “didn’t even know” if audiences would care about his trilogy of “Before” films, which began in 1995 with “Before Sunrise.”  More from IndieWire  “It’s not like I don’t want compliments and prizes and money and fire engines. I want everything, but I know how to listen to the river, how to listen to my own voice,” Hawke said. “I remember when I was doing those movies with Richard Linklater, for example, the ‘Before’ trilogy or ‘Boyhood,’ I didn’t even know if they would come out. One part of my brain thought, ‘Oh, people are going to love this.’ And another part of me thought, ‘Nobody’s going to be interested in this.’ I didn’t care. I knew that I was interested in it, and I can hear that voice.”  Hawke added, “But every time in my life I try to sell out, when I’m like, ‘Oh, that’ll be a hit,’ every time I try to do that I fall on my ass. Totally wrong every time.”  The beloved Richard Linklater film “Before Sunrise” later spurred sequels “Before Sunset” and “Before Midnight,” with a fourth film teased as part of an “After” series in 2020. The revolutionary years-long filmmaking tactic for “Boyhood” is set to be replicated for Linklater’s “Merrily We Roll Along” adaptation starring Paul Mescal and Beanie Feldstein.  Hawke noted that, like Linklater, he follows other aspirational figures like Bob Dylan and Spike Lee when standing his ground.  “I always feel like Bob Dylan’s being true to himself and millions of people happen to care,” Hawke said. “Spike Lee seems to always be working for himself and some of the movies hit big and some of them don’t, but you can tell they all kind of mean the same. It’s coming from the same creative force.”  Story continues  Hawke previously shared that Linklater assured him audiences would “care” about “Before Sunrise” as the human connection at the center of the largely-improvised film co-starring Julie Delpy grounded the story.  “‘I don’t want you to worry too much about the script. I’m inviting you to be a filmmaker with me,'” Hawke recalled Linklater telling him. “‘My whole life I’ve gone to the movies and there’s espionage and shootouts and helicopters, all this action. Everything that I see is all this drama, [so much so] that you would think my life, our lives, have no drama. That’s not the way I feel. My life feels very exciting to me and I’ve never been involved in a chase or a gun shootout. My life is exciting to me. And what’s the most exciting thing that’s ever happened to me? Connecting with another human being…If we can put that on screen I think people will care.'”  Hawke summed up in 2020, “Really what he is saying is that we are enough. It’s a hard thing for us, as people, to comprehend that. We are interesting. We are valuable. You are special from the moment you are born. At its essence, the movie is saying people witnessing each other has a huge power. Some times I leave ‘Harry Potter’ or ‘Avatar’ and I feel blue because I don’t have superpowers or magic. But I think Rick’s movies make you realize your life is magic.”  Best of IndieWire  Sign up for Indiewire's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Netflix has unveiled the first look teaser for animated movie Nimona, an action adventure thriller from filmmakers Nick Bruno & Troy Quane (of Spies in Disguise). Originally a production of Blue Sky Studios, a former subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, best known for creating the Ice Age and Rio franchises, it was originally set to be directed by Patrick Osborne, with an initial release date of 2020. Following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the production received pushback from Disney's new leadership due to the film's LGBTQ themes, then was canceled due to Blue Sky's closure in April 2021. Annapurna Pictures later revived the project, with Bruno & Quane taking over directing duties, DNEG on the animation, and Netflix releasing it. Nimona, a teenager with the power to shapeshift, is targeted by a knight for assassination. The knight's mission to kill Nimona becomes complicated when he is accused of a crime, and learns that Nimona may be able to exonerate him. Starring the voices of Chloë Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang, Frances Conroy, Lorraine Toussaint, Beck Bennett, Indya Moore, Julio Torres, and RuPaul Charles. Great teaser introducing us to this world & these characters.  Here's the first teaser trailer (+ poster) for Bruno & Quane's Nimona, direct from Netflix's YouTube:  When Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed), a knight in a futuristic medieval world, is framed for a crime he didn't commit, the only one who can help him prove his innocence is Nimona (Chloë Grace Moretz), a mischievous teen with a taste for mayhem — who also happens to be a shapeshifting creature Ballister has been trained to destroy. But with the entire kingdom out to get him, Nimona’s the best (or technically the only) sidekick Ballister can hope for. And as the lines between heroes, villains, and monsters start to blur, the two of them set out to wreak serious havoc — for Ballister to clear his name once and for all, and for Nimona to… just wreak serious havoc. Nimona is co-directed by animators / filmmakers Nick Bruno & Troy Quane, both directors of Spies in Disguise previously. The screenplay is by Robert L. Baird and Lloyd Taylor; story by Robert L. Baird, Lloyd Taylor, Pamela Ribon, Marc Haimes, Nick Bruno, Troy Quane, Keith Bunin. Based on the Graphic Novel by ND Stevenson. It's produced by Karen Ryan, Julie Zackary, Roy Lee. Netflix will debut Nimona streaming on Netflix starting June 30th, 2023 this summer.

If involved, they should be brought to justice as soon as possible. As the saying goes ‘blood leaves its trail’,” a statement issued by the executive committee of the Awami Action Committee (AAC) said on Thursday.  Police on Tuesday said it has arrested two persons who were allegedly involved in the killing of Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq after evading the law for 33 years.  The AAC said the killing was a very painful and tragic part of the history of Kashmir.  “A visionary leader who espoused dialogue, tolerance and people’s will as his ideology, Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq’s brutal assassination is unpardonable,” it said.  It said those involved in the Hawal massacre, which happened during the funeral of Mirwaiz Farooq, in which more than 70 people were killed, should also be brought to book.

"assassination","1963-06-14","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 23:43:47","JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – This year marks 60 years since the assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in his Jackson driveway. In June, there will be a week-long commemoration celebrating the lives and legacy of Medgar and Myrlie Evers.  Evers’ assassination was the first murder of a nationally significant leader in the civil rights movement in the country. His death sparked the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  “Medgar, as a as a soldier on the shores of Normandy, fighting against the Nazis, only to return home and fight racism all over again in the form of Jim Crow, the part African-Americans for restaurants, restrooms and voting, and Myrlie Evers in her life, heading the NAACP and really guiding it to a place where it needed to be. I mean, just their lives were just so courageous and and continue to inspire us,” said Jerry Mitchell, an investigative reporter in Mississippi.  At 90-years-old, Myrlie Evers-Williams continues to promote issues of racial equality and social justice.  “And Myrlie Evers just celebrated her 90th birthday, and I saw her speak out in California to a packed crowd on the floor. And she was telling the students, never give up, never give up. And as she’s shown in her life, it’s never too late to do the right thing. And that’s what we see in the story of Black workers, the efforts that it’s never too late to do the right thing,” stated Mitchell.  Freedom Rider Hezekiah Watkins met Medgar Evers as a teenager, but he wasn’t a fan at first because Evers was talking non-violence, which was something he and his friends didn’t want to hear.  “My thing and others was, I’m not going to let you hit me upside my head, and I don’t retaliate. That was our mindset back then, and this was before things really, really got out of hand in terms of the beatings and the murders that took place. I just was not a believer of non-violence,” said Watkins.  However, Watkins said Medgar Evers saved his life when he attended a meeting, and Evers asked the young men about their guns.  “His last question is, ‘Once you run out of ammunition, what are you gonna do?’ We kind of looked around at each other, and then he went on to say, ‘Have you ever seen a dog?’ I’ll never forget this, ‘Have you ever seen a dog chasing a car? That dog bark be so ferocious that he’s going to eat the car up. But once that car stop, that dog relax, and that dog ask himself, what do I do now? That’s what you would be asking yourself when you run out of those little few bullets that you have. What do I do now?’ It puts something on my mind. It really did, and I’m sad. He has a point. You know, once you don’t have any ammunition, what are you going to do?”  Watkins said that’s when he and his friends become non-violent.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvaW4tZGVwdGgtcmVwb3J0cy82MC15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1oaXMtc2xheWluZy1tZWRnYXItZXZlcnMtbGVnYWN5LWxpdmVzLW9uL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqdHYuY29tL25ld3MvaW4tZGVwdGgtcmVwb3J0cy82MC15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1oaXMtc2xheWluZy1tZWRnYXItZXZlcnMtbGVnYWN5LWxpdmVzLW9uL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2022-02-10","Not Discerned","{""PrinceAlbert"", ""Saskatchewan"", ""Canada""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:56:00","PRINCE ALBERT, Sask. — A Saskatchewan police chief says he is retiring after a report found officers who responded to a domestic violence call didn’t check on the well-being of a toddler in the hours before the child was killed.  Chief Jonathan Bergen of the Prince Albert Police Service issued a statement Thursday saying the move is in the best interest of the department and the city.  Bergen said he has always held himself accountable for his decisions and been open to scrutiny.  ""What I did not expect from my service and the community I trust and value, is the level of aggressive personal attack and contrived character assassination of me and my leadership team, and the cruel and misdirected emotional assault on my family, orchestrated by a select few  ""Largely the attacks have been cowardly and anonymous. For much of the last three years, it has been very public and relentless.""  The service has been criticized for several incidents in the last few years, with one of them being the killing of 13-month-old Tanner Brass.  The Public Complaints Commission report into the death of the boy, released earlier Thursday, says two officers neglected their duty in the case.  The boy's father, Kaij Brass, has been charged with second-degree murder and his trial is scheduled for next year.  “The circumstances on the morning of Feb. 10, 2022, amount to a tragic and potentially avoidable incident,” the report found. “(Tanner) was, at all relevant times, vulnerable and in danger while inside the residence with (his father).”  Kyla Frenchman, the toddler’s mother, has demanded the officers be fired, alleging she was racially profiled when she called for help. The report found she went willingly to a police station with the officers because women’s shelters were full and there was nowhere warm for her to go.  Her son was left with his father and killed.  The report says Frenchman had called 911 early on the cold winter morning after she walked to an RCMP facility that was closed. She told 911 that her child’s father was intoxicated and had assaulted her.  Story continues  When asked if she was concerned about the child's safety, the report says the mother became emotional and alleged “he hits him when he puts him to bed.”  The two officers arrived six minutes later and spoke with the mother outside the home. She told them the father was intoxicated and had pushed her down some steps.  Frenchman told police she just wanted to get her son and her clothes and wait for a ride to come from La Ronge, more than 200 kilometres north of the city, the report says.  The officers went to the front door and the father came to the window but refused to open the door. Officers later said that they believed he didn’t appear intoxicated and the mother didn’t want to pursue an assault investigation.  The officers determined they had no authority to enter the home or grounds to arrest the father, the report says. They were outside the house for 13 minutes and did not attempt to check on the child.  That was a failure of protocol, the report found. The officers had the authority to enter the home and would have been justified in helping the mother retrieve her belongings and the boy.  The officers also failed to follow the force’s intimate partner violence policy, which requires members “ensure the immediate safety of the complainant and any children who may be present,"" the report says.  Five hours after the mother called for help, the report says, a man called 911 indicating he had killed his baby.  “The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a series of compounded failures by (the officers) when they had a legal duty to investigate the 911 call by (the mother),” the report says.  The report also notes that the officers didn’t take any information regarding the father’s level of intoxication and whether it was safe for the man to be alone with the toddler.  The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, has alleged the officers racially profiled Frenchman and accused her of being drunk.  FSIN Chief Bobby Cameron called for the officers to be held criminally accountable ""for their failure to prevent the death of Baby Tanner.""  The commission’s report says officers were aware the mother was sober but there was no place for her to go. They said she could spend a few hours at the detention centre and she agreed.  Videos from the police car and the detention centre show the mother was not handcuffed and she rested once she was placed in the cell, the report says.  The commission says the force doesn’t have a policy for lodging sober, consenting people in cells, and that places officers in a difficult position when encountering people with nowhere to go and no safe alternatives.  “Officers must either bring sober, consenting persons to cells or leave the person to fend for themselves in the harsh winter,” the report says.  Michelle Ouellette, the commission chair, said the findings were submitted to the police chief to impose appropriate discipline.  Bergen said for the ""sake of integrity"" any discipline must be handled by a new police chief.  Last year, the Saskatchewan government appointed a former Edmonton police chief to conduct an independent review of the force following the child's death.  The review has been completed but Saskatchewan’s public safety minister has not said whether it will be publicly released.  This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 18, 2023.

"assassination","1981-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Woodruff"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:59:00","May 18—Longtime news broadcaster Judy Woodruff has interviewed the last nine U.S. presidents, but those haven't been her coolest interviews.  ""There aren't many cool people in Washington (D.C.),"" Woodruff said.  The 76-year-old answered questions Thursday afternoon from Shawn Vestal, a Spokesman-Review columnist, and from the Community School students about her five decades of experience covering politics and news at NBC, CNN and PBS.  Woodruff told the roughly 30 students in attendance at the West Central Spokane school that she looks fondly on her time covering former presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1970s and '80s because it was her introduction to covering national politics.  She said the two presidents were quite different: Carter, a Democrat, was a peanut farmer and Reagan, a Republican, was an actor in Hollywood.  Woodruff was covering Reagan the day he was shot in a 1981 assassination attempt. She said she heard the ""pop, pop, pop"" that everyone thought was the sound of fireworks but quickly realized were gunshots as U.S. Secret Service personnel were screaming for people to get down.  ""It was just the worst kind of thing you'd ever have to cover or want to cover as a reporter,"" she said.  However, Woodruff said she is nostalgic about that time when Republicans and Democrats differed politically but could be seen at dinner with each other.  ""Today, that just doesn't happen,"" Woodruff said. ""The two parties are very far apart.""  Woodruff, who stepped down as PBS NewsHour's anchor in December, is working on a series, called ""Judy Woodruff Presents: America at a Crossroads,"" for the network that examines why the country is so politically divided.  ""It's so funny to me at this stage in my career I'm still finding really, really interesting things to cover because this country keeps changing in many ways, for the better but in many ways that are really troubling,"" Woodruff said. ""Your generation has a lot to figure out.""  Story continues  Woodruff also addressed keys to being a good reporter and the state of media today.  She said reporters should listen and ""prepare like crazy"" for interviews with the expectation that some prepared questions will be thrown out. She said interviewing a president on camera is ""very nerve-wracking,"" but she enjoys the pressure that comes with it. She interviewed President Joe Biden in February.  ""I thrive on pressure,"" Woodruff said.  She said it's becoming more difficult to discern what is true and false in media, and that readers and listeners need to use common sense and look at the source of information to determine its validity.  Woodruff recalled what her first producer said to her as a young reporter: ""No one cares what you think.""  ""It was drilled into me that I was to keep my views out,"" she said.  Woodruff said it's important to the nation's democracy that reporters provide the news ""straight"" and let their audience make up their mind on the topic.  ""I feel very strongly if we don't continue to have straight reporting in this country, it weakens our democracy,"" she said.  Judy Woodruff, a long-time TV journalist and former anchor of PBS Newshour, speaks with students about her distinguished career in TV journalism, Thursday, May 18, 2023, at The Community School. (COLIN MULVANY/THE SPOKESMAN-REVI)  The students in attendance Thursday are working on a project called, ""Lights, Camera, Take Action,"" a KQED Learn ""Call for Change"" challenge that allows students across the country to make videos or audio recordings on topics they're passionate about, said David Egly, social studies project facilitator at the Community School.  Some students told Woodruff about their projects, which included gun control, sex trafficking and sex education in schools, and asked Woodruff for advice on their assignments.  Woodruff told the students to gain a deep understanding for their topics and present them in an understandable and compelling way so people care about them.  Woodruff spoke to students and posed for a group picture with them after her talk.  She told The Spokesman-Review she wants students to know journalism matters, especially now because of the sea of misinformation. Woodruff said if students are curious and willing to work unpredictable hours, they should pursue the career.  ""I think right now that journalism is in a kind of crisis because so much of local journalism has shrunk,"" she said. ""Some places disappeared.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdGhyaXZlLXByZXNzdXJlLXJlbm93bmVkLWpvdXJuYWxpc3QtanVkeS0wMzU5MDAyOTEuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC90aHJpdmUtcHJlc3N1cmUtcmVub3duZWQtam91cm5hbGlzdC1qdWR5LTAzNTkwMDI5MS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1978-06-05","Not Discerned","{""Vienna"", ""Vienna"", ""Austria""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:29:54","Helmut Berger, the Austrian actor and regular Luchino Visconti collaborator who become one of the most recognizable faces of European arthouse cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 78. The news was announced by the actor’s agent, who wrote that he died “peacefully but nevertheless unexpectedly” on his management company’s website.  Born in Austria in 1944, Berger moved to Rome and began pursuing an acting career after expressing disinterest in following his parents into the hospitality industry. He initially found work as an extra before meeting Visconti in 1964. The “Rocco and His Brothers” director gave Berger a small part in his 1967 film “The Witches,” an omnibus film also directed by the likes of Vittorio De Sica and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Berger and Visconti began a professional and romantic relationship that would go on to shape the European cinema landscape of the subsequent decade.  More from IndieWire  Berger’s most significant roles came in two of Visconti’s next projects: “The Damned” and “Ludwig.” In 1969’s “The Damned,” Berger played an unhinged fictional heir to a steel empire in Nazi Germany who was willing to bend his morals and do business with Hitler in order to fulfill his lusts for money and power (among other things). Three years later, “Ludwig” saw him portraying the infamous “swan king,” Ludwig II of Bavaria, in a film that explored the late monarch’s obsession with extravagance and the opulent lifestyle that eventually saw him declared insane. Both films saw him portraying powerful men with ambiguous sexualities, which helped establish Berger as one of his era’s most notable sex symbols.  He re-teamed with Visconti on the 1974 film “Conversation Piece,” which starred Burt Lancaster as an aging professor who develops a close relationship with a younger man (Berger). Many interpreted the project as an allegory for the close relationship that Visconti and Berger developed over their decade of working together. It was Visconti’s penultimate film before his 1976 death and the final project that the two men would work together on.  Story continues  Berger continued to act until his retirement in 2019, memorably playing the titular role in Massimo Dallamano’s Oscar Wilde adaptation “Dorian Gray” and Frederick Keinszig in Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather Part III.”  Best of IndieWire  Sign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.

PHOTO COURTESY OF CLICKORLANDO.COM  OSCEOLA COUNTY, Fla. — A chapter of a Fla. nonproﬁt organization that helps citizens defend their faith and freedom says that the Osceola County School District acknowledged that a series of books it makes available for children are suitable only for young adults, but refused to pull the books from the shelves.  Citizens Defending Freedom Members in Osceola County are challenging the appropriateness of “Assassination Classroom,” a graphic novel series in which students are tasked with killing their alien teacher, and asking for the series to be removed from the Liberty High School Library.  The group ﬁled for challenges to the books via the School Library Media Advisory Committee.  One of the questions on the form, which was completed by the Media Advisory Committee and returned in response to the challenge, asks, “Is there a preoccupation with sex, violence, cruelty, brutality, and aberrant behavior that would make this material inappropriate for children?”  The School Library Media Advisory Committee answered “Yes” to that question.  Still, the School Library Media Advisory Committee said the books will remain on the shelf, deciding that they were suitable for “young adults.”  In an email to school ofﬁcials, Citizens Defending Freedom executive director on Osceola County Chris Fontenot sent an email to school leadership asking them why books that are suitable for “young adults” would be made available to high-schoolers, most of whom are still children. Fontenot also said that Citizens Defending Freedom plans to appeal the ruling.  Citizens Defending Freedom is no stranger to “Assassination Classroom.”  The group is already challenging the books at the state, asking that they be removed from school libraries.  According to an analysis by Citizens Defending Freedom members, the books contain “explicit violence, mild profanity and sexual activities.”  For example, one illustration in one of the books depicts a group of students aiming guns at their teacher, who appears to be an alien. Other depictions show students pointing weapons with captions such as “GET READY,” and “F-I-I-I-R-E.”  After failing to kill the teacher, and after launching a ﬁrestorm of bullets, one student says, “ALL THOSE BULLETS … AND WE MISSED!?” while two other students say “WE’RE ASSASSINS AND OUR TARGET IS” … “OUR TEACHER.”  BookLooks Review rates the series as “Minor Restricted.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZmx0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9vc2Nlb2xhLWNvdW50eS1zY2hvb2xzLWRlZW0tYm9va3MtaW5hcHByb3ByaWF0ZS1mb3ItY2hpbGRyZW4tZGVjaWRlcy10by1sZWF2ZS10aGVtLWluLXNjaG9vbHMtYW55d2F50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sison said this is part of the continued efforts of the military and police to regain the trust and confidence of the people and restore peace and order in the province, which was shaken following the March 4 assassination of Governor Roel Degamo and nine others.  “We will not abandon Negros Oriental, especially now that we have a very challenging task ahead. We will continue with our operations, checkpoints, and the security of victims as well as the families of the assailants until such time that the situation here in the province normalizes,” Sison said.  Sison heads the Joint Task Force Negros, comprising the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police, which was created soon after the Pamplona massacre.  Following their surrender, some suspects in the Pamplona massacre had appealed to the military and the police for the safety of their families as they vowed to cooperate in the investigation.  Some families have already been secured by law enforcement agencies.  Sison reiterated that they would protect both the families of victims and suspects caught in the middle of the conflict.  Sison’s statement also comes as the Senate Committee on Public Order and Dangerous Drugs has wrapped up its inquiry into the brazen attack against the late governor at his Pamplona residence where he was distributing government aid to beneficiaries.  The Senate hearings also looked into many other killings in Negros Oriental in previous years that are still unsolved to this day.  Meanwhile, the Army general presided over the turnover of command of the 11th IB from outgoing commanding officer, Lt. Col. Roderick Salayo, to his successor, Lt. Col. Michael Aquino.  Sison commended Salayo for the battalion's accomplishments during his two-year stint, noting among other things the surrender of Communist insurgents who have already been reintegrated into mainstream society and are enjoying the benefits of the government's Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program.  On the other hand, he challenged Aquino to continue the gains of his predecessor in running after the remaining New People’s Army rebels, especially in the dismantled Southeast Front operating in southern Negros.

"assassination","2023-01-04","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:47:55","In its latest act of aggression against the besieged Gaza Strip, Israel dealt a severe blow to the resistance movement Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). High-ranking commanders, including the majority of the members of the group’s military council in Gaza, were assassinated in rapid succession during the battle.  These targeted killings sought to weaken the PIJ’s leadership structure and disrupt the organization’s command and control. However, despite these setbacks, the PIJ pulled some new tricks out of its hat, managing to expand the range of its missile strikes, which reached as far as Tel Aviv.  To gain a deeper understanding of these strategic PIJ developments and its advancements in retaliatory strikes, it is important to examine two significant past military operations: “Black Belt” (2019) and “Breaking Dawn” or “Unity of Fronts” (2022).  Learning from the past  Those two battles were triggered by the killing of prominent leaders in the PIJ’s military wing, the Quds Brigades, which appears to have further emboldened Israeli occupation forces in their policy of targeted assassinations. From Israel’s perspective, the perceived political gains outweighed the costs incurred during these two rounds of conflict.  In November 2019, following the assassination of Quds Brigades commander Baha Abu al-Ata, the fighters responded recklessly without proper planning. Rocket launchers were emotionally fired immediately after the assassination, making the missile unit vulnerable to Israeli detection.  As a result, the Quds Brigades suffered significant losses, with around 27 missile force staff members, including three field commanders, being killed. This battle also had a secondary, more dangerous consequence: It established an Israeli policy of singling out a specific resistance group, leaving the PIJ to face their fate alone without the participation of other key resistance elements like Hamas.  During the 2022 “Unity of Fronts” battle, a similar fate befell the Quds Brigades following the arrest of PIJ leader Bassam al-Saadi. Although they fired over 400 rockets at Israeli settlements in retaliation and employed improved tactics compared to the previous battle, Palestinian public opinion fell victim to Israeli propaganda.  The Israelis’ narrative portrayed the PIJ as endangering the lives of two million people in the Gaza Strip – and neglecting the plight of 4,500 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails – for the purpose of securing the freedom of just one person. Furthermore, when some errant rockets fell in Gaza due to technical errors, doubts were raised about the PIJ’s ability to successfully wage war independently.  Trying new tactics  But on 9 May, a significant shift occurred in the conflict. Despite the initial heavy blow from Israel’s first strike, which resulted in the loss of three prominent PIJ leaders – Khalil al-Bahtini, Tariq Ezz al-Din, and Jihad Ghanem – the movement’s response was purposefully delayed for approximately 35 hours.  This unusual stalling tactic confused Israeli calculations. During the brief lull, discussions were held between the PIJ, Hamas, and other resistance factions to ensure coordination and readiness for the upcoming fight. On 10 May, “Operation Revenge of the Free” was launched, as announced by this Joint Operations Room.  The PIJ’s initial missile response unfolded in three stages. The first stage employed a “dumping and neutralization” tactic, focusing on Israeli settlements bordering the Gaza Strip within a 15-kilometer range. These targets included Sderot, Nahal Oz, Nativ Ha’atsarah, and Kerem Shalom.  The resistance’s aim was to first deplete the batteries of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system. Following this, missile barrages were launched at about 30 cities, reaching depths of 20 to 75 kilometers into Israeli territory. Targets included Ashkelon, Ashdod, Beersheba, and extended all the way to Tel Aviv, Rishon Lezion, and Palmachim. By the end of the first day, the Quds Brigades had fired approximately 400 rockets.  Discussions in the joint command center  Amidst these developments, discussions were ongoing in the Joint Operations Room, while reports in the Arab and international media hinted at an imminent ceasefire. Egyptian news channels reported that Cairo’s intelligence efforts had led to a truce agreement between Israel and the Joint Ops Room.  This aligned with the Israeli security establishment’s assessment that the scale of retaliation would not surpass what was witnessed in the 2019 and 2022 rounds. The Israeli assessment viewed the PIJ as incapable of waging a prolonged battle, even with the involvement of smaller military factions such as the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades of the Popular Resistance Committees, The Martyr Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the National Resistance Brigades of the Omar al-Qasim Forces, and the Mujahideen Brigades.  Informed sources reveal to The Cradle that Egyptian intelligence did indeed reach an agreement of sorts with the leadership of Hamas, as a representative of the Joint Ops Room, on the first day of the conflict. However, a deal did not take place because it excluded any significant achievements for the Palestinian resistance.  During this time, Egyptian mediators attempted to establish contact with PIJ Secretary General Ziyad al-Nakhala, but he did not respond to the call. Subsequently, a phone conversation took place between Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, and Nakhala. Then, at approximately 7:00 p.m. on 12 May, the Quds Brigades responded to the Egyptian proposal by launching a series of missile strikes targeting Israeli cities.  ‘Deterring’ the Resistance  Despite the ongoing and surprising resilience displayed by PIJ, a statement on 14 May by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that the balance of deterrence had been altered in Israel’s favor:  “Since Guardian of the Walls [Sword of Jerusalem or Sayf al-Quds], Hamas has not fired a single rocket into our territory. They are deterred. Operation Guardian of the Walls dealt Hamas the hardest blow in its history and caused a change in the deterrence equation and it has been working for two years now.”  “Our intention in Operation Shield and Arrow was to change the balance of deterrence against Islamic Jihad. The difference comes not only because of the targeted assassinations that we have been doing for the 16 years that I have been prime minister, but that we did so so calmly and effectively. We took down half of Islamic Jihad’s leadership in a surprise blow, and the other half during the operation.”  Assassinations: A failed policy  Despite the heavy losses suffered in the initial strike, the subsequent days of fighting proved equally devastating. Israel continued its targeted assassinations, eliminating key figures such as the commander of the missile force in the Quds Brigades, Ali Hassan Ghali, and his deputy, Ahmed Abu Daqqa, followed by the assassination of Operations Staff Commander Iyad al-Hassani on the fourth day.  Remarkably, after each targeted killing, the Quds Brigades intensified its missile strikes and introduced new tactics into the battle. This had the effect of shrouding the Israeli ground forces, which had misread the PIJ’s capabilities, in the fog of war.  The Quds Brigades employed tactics such as utilizing suicide drones, anti-tank missiles, and launching intensive mortar attacks. Its intention was clear: to demonstrate through firepower and brute force that the policy of targeted assassinations had not diminished its effectiveness in the field.  Not taking the bait  A source in PIJ tells The Cradle that the Quds Brigades leadership had carefully analyzed the lessons learned from the previous two battles. According to the source, Israel’s objective was to provoke another “emotional reaction” from the Brigades, through heavy firepower. To counter the Israeli tactic, the Brigades have focused on strengthening the discipline of field fighters. “The instructions were clear: do not shoot and wait for orders.”  This discipline led to an expansion of the area of missile launch sites, which reduced the effectiveness of Israel’s technological monitoring of the firing points, and weakened the possibility of identifying and targeting them.  The source explains: “When we decide to launch 50 missiles, we do so from 10 launch points, although we are able to launch them all from one or two points. By doing so, we preserve the safety of fighters and launchers.”  According to Israeli statistics, PIJ alone fired about 1,500 missiles, “which completely paralyzed the cities of the south, and caused the evacuation of 12,000 settlers,” killing an Israeli and a foreign worker, and injuring 77 others, in addition to hundreds of minor injuries and panic attacks.  These numbers, according to Palestinian researcher Ismail Muhammad, show that the PIJ was able, during only a 10-month interim between operations “Unity of the Fronts” and “Revenge of the Free,” to rebuild its missile stockpile and to address all previous technical problems. As Muhammad tells The Cradle:  “Despite the losses at the command level, no significant field losses were recorded. Four field fighters from the artillery unit and the armor unit were martyred, while the losses in the missile unit remained zero.” “The continued firing of missiles at the same pace until the last moment indicates that that the assassination of the commanders did not affect the effectiveness of the field, and that the Brigades were able to assign new commanders, whom Israel described after the bombing of the city of Jerusalem on the last day as crazier than their predecessors.”  Down but not out  Shortly before the ceasefire took effect, PIJ launched over 120 rockets targeting Ashkelon, Tel Aviv, Palmachim, Rishon Lezion, and Rehovot. This was an attempt by the PIJ to remind Israelis that its military capabilities remained intact and plentiful and that it retained the upper hand, even though the ceasefire deal did not accurately reflect PIJ’s gains on the ground.  During the ceasefire negotiations, the PIJ was successful in persuading mediators to include the phrase “stop targeting individuals” in the agreement, signaling a halt to assassinations. However, it is widely acknowledged that Israel is unlikely to honor this commitment.  The military assessment of Operation Revenge of the Free is that it allowed the Quds Brigades to increase the cost for Israel by singling out PIJ cadres. Despite the loss of six commanders, a source confirms to The Cradle that the Brigades appointed new commanders during the battle who effectively resumed operations without missing a beat.  Predictably, Israel has already deviated from the spirit of a ceasefire by supporting the controversial Flag March of Jewish extremists through East Jerusalem, assisted and emboldened by the presence of 3,200 Israeli security forces. This visceral challenge to Palestinians represents a crucial test not only for PIJ but also for all resistance factions that have pledged to disrupt Israel’s provocative actions in Jerusalem.  The Flag March aims to project a false “image of victory” for Netanyahu and restore Israel’s deterrence – something he failed to achieve during the five-day confrontation with the second most powerful organization in the Gaza Strip in terms of strength and military capabilities, and arguably, the most militant and uncompromising in its armed struggle for national liberation.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGUtdmlldy8yNDk3Ny9waWpzLXRhY3RpY2FsLXRyaXVtcGgtbWlzc2lsZXMtbXVsdGlwbHktZGVzcGl0ZS1sb3NzZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1987-10-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 21:44:00","Listen 4 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  Nearly 30 years ago, while serving in the Senate, Joe Biden told an interviewer that “if Haiti just quietly sunk into the Caribbean, or rose up 300 feet, it wouldn’t matter a whole lot in terms of our interests.” Now, as president, Mr. Biden has crafted a policy — or lack of one — that reflects that indifference. He has done so even as Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, is seized by its worst security, political and humanitarian crisis in decades, one the United Nations recently likened to war.  Haiti’s ineffectual government has begged for international intervention. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres has issued repeated urgent appeals for a specialized armed force to stem the violence, restore some semblance of rule of law and establish conditions for holding elections, which are impossible amid the current anarchy. The international community’s response has been a shrug.  Haiti is a failed state whose collapse, accelerated by its president’s still-unsolved assassination almost two years ago, has generated tens of thousands of migrants desperate to reach the United States. In the absence of a functioning government, and in the face of a crumbling national police force whose members are gunned down in the streets, gangs have run riot over the capital city of Port-au-Prince and elsewhere.  Advertisement  The incidences of killings, rapes and kidnappings have soared. Street violence is ubiquitous, and children are frequently among the victims. Sophisticated, high-caliber arms and ammunition, much of it smuggled from the United States, have fed the spiraling mayhem. The illegal drug trade has exploded. Recently, the vacuum in government authority has given rise to vigilante violence against suspected gang members, some of whom have been gunned down and burned to death in the street.  Follow this author Editorial Board 's opinions Follow  In a country that has long struggled to feed itself, the pandemonium’s humanitarian fallout is cataclysmic. In a recent report, the U.N. characterized life in Haiti as a “daily, terrifying struggle for survival.” Within the population of roughly 12 million, nearly 5 million people have difficulty feeding themselves, and almost a third of Haitians live on less than $2.15 a day.  The Biden administration, seeking to impede Haitians who make their way to Mexico from crossing the U.S. border illegally, has established a so-called humanitarian parole program. Under its provisions, U.S. residents who meet certain criteria can apply to sponsor a Haitian immigrant to enter the country legally for a limited period. But the program has been plagued by misinformation and technical glitches. Many Haitians who have managed to use it are health professionals, whose exodus has contributed to the country’s deterioration in public health.  Advertisement  Haiti’s long and checkered history of international interventions has justifiably led skeptics inside the nation and elsewhere to be wary of a new effort by outsiders to bring order. U.S. Marines built infrastructure in Haiti during a roughly two-decade intervention early in the 20th century but also were guilty of appalling racism. In this century, U.N. peacekeepers tamped down political violence but also reportedly sexually exploited and assaulted Haitian women and girls. Other U.N. troops introduced cholera into the Haitian water system through poor sanitation at one of their bases; the result was an outbreak that killed some 10,000 people and sickened hundreds of thousands.  Notwithstanding those shameful experiences, there is no plausible escape from Haiti’s meltdown in the absence of international intervention. A broad coalition of civil groups and political parties in Haiti has called for a new national unity government that would prepare the way for elections. But internal divisions among those groups, and the plain reality that there is no domestic force that can grapple with the street gangs, have produced political paralysis.  The likelihood of such political dysfunction was all too apparent in the aftermath of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in July 2021. But the extent of Haiti’s misery since then has exceeded even the grimmest predictions.  Advertisement  Both the Biden administration and the Canadian government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have refused calls to organize an armed intervention. France has similarly demurred, despite its own role in impoverishing Haiti, first through exploiting Haitian natural resources as a colonial master in the 18th century, then by imposing forced reparations that lasted over half a century. Nor has the Organization of American States shown the interest or capacity to arrange such an intervention.  The byproduct of the world’s callous apathy is painful to behold — a country, unable to fend for itself, in an accelerating descent into agony.

"assassination","1965-02-21","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:02:42","Reddit Email 16 Shares  By Joseph R. Stuart, Brigham Young University | –  May 2023 marks 98 years since the birth of civil rights leader Malcolm X, formerly Malcolm Little.  Malcolm X was a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, or NOI, and helped to lead the organization until he left in 1964 – the year before his assassination.  The NOI, whose role in civil rights movements is a focus of my research, included leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, who along with Malcolm X are known for their fiery rhetoric and teachings on race.  The NOI, which teaches a Black supremacist message and advocates for racial separatism, has also been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  While the organization once boasted half a million members, the group is now relatively small. Currently it has an estimated membership of roughly 35,000 – but prominent NOI members, such as boxer and onetime Malcolm X friend Muhammad Ali, attracted wide public interest in the movement. Today, its influence continues to extend well beyond its membership.  Although Malcolm X – and other prominent members like Ali – left the NOI, thousands of students each year learn about the group from Malcolm X’s “Autobiography,” originally published in 1965.  Malcolm X’s influence on popular culture also remains significant. He inspired a Hollywood biopic and is referenced in the work of artists such as Beyoncé, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, who was briefly associated with NOI.  Netflix: “Blood Brothers | Malcolm X & Muhammad Ali Official Trailer | Netflix  Thanks largely to Malcolm X, the NOI is now a household name, but its teachings remain controversial, particularly among Muslims.  A radical alternative to Christianity?  W.D. Fard, a peddler by day and preacher by night, established the NOI in 1931 in Detroit, Michigan.  He taught that God was a Black man who taught the first human beings Islam. Accordingly, Fard framed Islam as “the natural faith” for people whose ancestors came from Africa, before colonization and slavery had forced Christianity onto them. He argued that Black people should abandon Christianity in favor of Islam as their ancestral religion.  Fard also taught that Christianity was “the white man’s” religion and a corrupted form of Islam used to promote white supremacy. The message appealed to Black migrants from the South, who were sometimes looked down upon by Northern Black Protestants. Fard disappeared from the historical record in the mid-1930s.  Malcolm X and the NOI  Malcolm X joined the NOI while incarcerated in 1952. He became an international spokesman for the group, using his fierce wit and sense of humor to debate Black and white leaders on matters of race, religion and politics.  Malcolm X was suspended from the NOI in 1963 for his comments about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The following year, he renounced the NOI, converted to Sunni Islam, completed the hajj and formed a Black civil rights organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unit, or OAAU. This group sought to unite all Black people across the globe and conditionally accepted help from white people committed to Black freedom. The NOI, on the other hand, focused on the U.S. and refused all help from white Americans.  Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, during an OAAU event in New York. The identity of his killers remains a mystery.  A new era  When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, transformed the NOI into the “World Community of al-Islam in the West.” He downplayed previous teachings about Black supremacy and aligned the movement closer to Sunni Islam. In 1977, however, a protégé of Elijah Muhammad’s and Malcolm X’s named Louis Farrakhan “restored” Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam. Farrakhan assumed leadership of the group and emphasized Elijah’s teachings on race.  W.D. Fard, the NOI’s founder, and his successor Elijah Muhammad did not seem to know much about Sunni or Shiite Islam’s teachings. Fard did not cite the Quran to his followers, and Elijah Muhammad did not read the book until after assuming the NOI’s leadership.  As the group grew after World War II, Muhammad and other leaders became more familiar with mainstream Islamic tenets. They changed the name of their meeting places from “temples” to “mosques” and incorporated the Quran and Arabic phrases into their teachings and community organizing.  While the movement has changed its practices to align more closely with global expressions of Islam, many Muslims do not consider the NOI part of the Ummah, the global community of Muslims.  Not universally considered Muslim  The NOI’s unique theology is one of the reasons the group is not accepted into the Ummah.  Other forms of Islam maintain that God is eternal, nonhuman and singularly divine. The NOI, however, teaches that W.D. Fard was “God in person” who called Elijah Muhammad as his prophet.  Despite this significant deviation from mainstream forms of Islam, the NOI follows four of the five pillars of Islam: five daily prayers (salat), giving alms to the poor (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) and a month of fasting during Ramadan.  NOI Muslims did not practice Ramadan until 1988, when Farrakhan instructed members to fast “with the entire Islamic world.”  Changing attitudes?  That change led to opportunities for intra-Muslim cooperation but also underscored the limited acceptance of the NOI that continues among many other Muslim groups.  For example, in 2000, NOI members prayed with Houston Muslims during Ramadan, allowing the NOI to connect with other American Muslims.  However, these cross-Muslim events have not continued in Houston. Nor are they common elsewhere. The lack of sustained pan-Muslim events might suggest that, even when religious practice aligns, there remain obstacles to the building of relationships between mainstream and NOI Muslims.  While both the NOI and Malcolm X remain controversial, for many admirers X’s work has taken on new significance for today’s racial justice movements.  Joseph R.

Johnson said Kanu had, on May 12, 2021, traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, as a British citizen and was legally admitted. And that on June 19, 2021, agents of Nigerian government abducted him and tortured him for eight days before his illegal rendition to Nigeria.  Johnson’s letter, which was dated May 10, 2023, and marked, ‘Re: Appeal for Your Urgent Intervention in Urging the Government of Nigeria to Release Nnmadi Kanu from his Extraordinary Rendition, was made available to The Guardian, yesterday, by special counsel to IPOB leader, Aloy Ejimakor.  Stressing that time is of the essence, the US lawmaker said: “There is now growing fear/concern that the Muhammadu Buhari administration intends to assassinate or cause Kanu’s disappearance before May 29, when it plans to hand him over to the incoming administration.  “For months now, it is public knowledge that Kanu’s health condition has deteriorated. He suffers from a serious heart condition and other ailments for which he is not getting enough medical attention.  “Appeal to the Nigeria Government to release the IPOB leader dated back to June 27, 2021.”  Describing Kanu as the leading advocate of Igbo struggle for self-determination, Johnson further stated that his persecution by the Nigerian government has intensified since 2015, when he (Kanu) visited Nigeria from London, the United Kingdom.  He further stated: “First, few days after his arrival, on October 14, 2015, he was arrested in Lagos by agents of the Nigerian government.  “He was held in solitary confinement by the Department of State Security (DSS). Ultimately, he was granted bail by the Nigerian courts.  “After his release, he resided primarily in his ancestral home in Abia State, Nigeria, with his parents, siblings and other extended family members.”  “On October 10, 2017 to October 14, 2017, the Nigerian military attacked and invaded his home. In the process, dozens of people were killed, many were injured and maimed, while many others were captured alive and have disappeared.  “Fortunately, Kanu escaped the invasion and returned to his London residence to reunite with his nuclear family.  “On May 12, 2021, he traveled to Nairobi, Kenya, as a British citizen and was legally admitted into the country.  “On June 19, 2021, he was abducted by agents of the Nigerian government.

A veteran Wall Street executive told CNBC that he has been helping bankroll Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine group and has become an informal advisor to the organization.  Mark Gorton, founder and chairman of high-frequency trading firm Tower Research Capital, said he has given $1 million to the anti-vaccine nonprofit organization called Children's Health Defense since 2021.  Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic and a son of late senator and U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, founded Children's Health Defense. The younger Kennedy was also chairman of the group's board before he launched his run for president as a Democrat in April.  While President Joe Biden is the clear favorite to win the 2024 Democratic nomination, Kennedy has drawn a surprising amount of support, with a recent Fox News survey showing that 19% of the Democratic primary voters surveyed would back him in the primary.  Polls also show that Kennedy's rise in influence coincides with an increase in skepticism about vaccines, despite scientific evidence that the shots are safe. Kennedy has attracted support from some longtime political players, including former Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who is running the campaign. Michael Flynn, former President Donald Trump's national security advisor, was reportedly pictured with Kennedy in 2021, according to ABC News.  During an almost 90-minute interview at Cafe Fiorello in New York, Gorton said he is cheering on Kennedy's campaign for president and has repeatedly met with him since he donated to Children's Health Defense.  ""I like him a lot. He's a super smart guy. Again, he's not really a politician. He's a corruption fighter,"" Gorton said, adding that he has Kennedy's cell phone number.  Asked about Gorton's donation, a spokeswoman for the Children's Health Defense said in an email, ""CHD's donor information is confidential and only communicated to the IRS in compliance with their rules/regulations.""  A Kennedy campaign spokesperson did not return requests for comment before publication.  The Associated Press reported that Children's Health Defense played a key role in pushing back on Covid vaccines and helped elevate Kennedy's profile. The nonprofit's most recent publicly available tax documents show that it raised just over $6 million in 2020, the year the Covid pandemic started, more than double what it raised a year earlier.  The organization sent CNBC its tax documents from 2021, which show the group raised just over $15 million that year. It went into 2022 with over $11 million in assets. The documents don't name the group's donors.  Beyond his donation, Gorton said he's been talking to the nonprofit's staff through Zoom calls, and advising the group on its messaging strategy. ""I basically have been working with them to try and develop a strategy to go after the core of the beast which is the pharmaceutical industry,"" he said.  Federal Election Commission records show that Gorton donated $500,000 last year to a super PAC that was then called the People Pharma's Movement and run by other Kennedy allies. That PAC rebranded as American Values 2024 and has spent over $200,000 in print ads backing Kennedy's candidacy, according to FEC records.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJmay1qci1hbnRpLXZhY2NpbmUtZ3JvdXAuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L3dhbGwtc3RyZWV0LWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1yZmstanItYW50aS12YWNjaW5lLWdyb3VwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-04-11","Not Discerned","{""Tijuana"", ""BajaCalifornia"", ""Mexico""}","Fri 19 May 2023 01:22:22","SAN DIEGO (Border Report) — Through the first four months of the year, 603 homicides were recorded in Tijuana, including 161 in April alone, according to Baja California’s State Attorney General’s Office.  Of the people killed this year, 68 have been women.  Carlos Jaramillo Silva, president of Tijuana’s Business Council, says the high murder rate continues to generate a bad image for the city.  “This draws a lot of attention, it’s a crisis even though there’s a lot of work going on to lower the homicide rate,” he told the El Sol Newspaper in Tijuana.  Jaramillo is calling for a new strategy when it comes to fighting crime on the streets.  “We need to know what every police agency is doing, we can’t have all of them essentially doing the same thing,” he said.

First of all, permit me to say I was impressed by your uncompromising honesty. It was truly impressive. Not everyone would be willing to admit to himself – much less to a 4-year-old girl whom his country murdered in cold blood when it assassinated her father – that “my conscience is clear, little girl.”  To be clear, everyone knows you aren’t the only Israeli Jew whose conscience isn’t bothered in the slightest by my deliberate, planned assassination. But you went out of your way to tell me this in writing, so that I wouldn’t, heaven forbid, comfort myself with the thought that my death might trouble your sleep.

But I’m already old enough to understand what a conscience is. And you have to be an exceptional person to do something dirty but have your conscience remain clean.  So allow me to tell you, Avri – now that I’m dead, you’ll allow me to call you Avri? – that you, the Jews, are all exceptional. No stain clings to you. Not to you and not to the Israel Defense Forces, which manages to be the most moral army in the world no matter what you do. You aren’t just a light unto the nations; you’re truly bleach unto the nations.  In your letter, you told me that I came to you while you were trying to fall asleep, in the confusion of a dream. In other words, you saw me as a human being – like you, like your daughter. You actually wrote, “I saw her for a moment on the news, holding some kind of school certificate, a proud look on her face, like children the world over, like my daughters.” You wrote that my face was engraved on your heart, and I asked you “laish,” which means “why” in Arabic.  Ostensibly, everything that ought to rouse your conscience was taking place in your heart. But your conscience? It slept the sleep of the just. It isn’t working anymore. It’s broken. Can an entire nation be broken just like an individual can?  From your letter, it’s completely clear that you know this was a deliberate act – that your country didn’t kill me and my mother by accident, but intentionally. It’s clear to you that your country understood my life was the price that had to be paid to assassinate my father, the wanted man, and it decided it was worth it. You clearly know that I’m a child, that I didn’t do anything, that my only crime was being born “to the wrong family, the wrong father.” (Why? Who are you to decide that I was born to the wrong family?).  But then it all collapses into a warped rationalization that frees not just you as an individual, but all of you, from responsibility for your actions. Once upon a time, you still searched for a ticking bomb to justify pinpoint assassinations. Today a ticking watch is enough to justify a non-pinpoint assassination. The explanation that satisfies you, the story you tell yourselves, is all that’s needed for you to justify murdering a 4-year-old girl.  “I view your death as I do the unnecessary death of an Arab child who was killed with his criminal father in a car,” you wrote. It’s “heartrending, but it’s not directly connected to me.” How simple. You put together a few sentences and free yourselves of responsibility. “Your ‘laish’ should be directed at him, after he finishes looking for the virgins that aren’t there,” you write at the end.  Look at yourself. If only my death had at least freed me of you. But to this day, you’re pestering me so I’ll free you of the guilt you don’t feel. “What do you want from my life?” is a question I can no longer ask. So instead I’ll ask, what do you want from my death?","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMtMDUtMTkvdHktYXJ0aWNsZS1vcGluaW9uLy5wcmVtaXVtL2EtbGV0dGVyLWZyb20tYS1mb3VyLXllYXItb2xkLWdhemFuLWdpcmwvMDAwMDAxODgtMzAzOS1kODA1LWE3YzktZjlmOWNkMzQwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mughniyeh, who was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Western, Israeli and Arab civilians and security personnel, began to operate toward the end of the 1982 Lebanon War and was assassinated, according to reports, in a joint Israeli-American effort in Damascus in February 2008.  The series is a docudrama: a dramatization of events of the past, generally sticking to the facts and interspersed with short documentary footage, including interviews with some of those involved.  Open gallery view Imad Mughniyeh (standing on the right) in 'Ghosts of Beirut.' Credit: Sifeddine Elamine/SHOWTIME / yes  Issacharoff (full disclosure: he’s a close friend and in the past a co-author) says that the writers allowed themselves creative freedom only in regard to a small portion of the plot. The reconstruction drew mostly on investigations and on interviews with intelligence personnel in Israel and the United States, along with a number of participants from the Arab side.  The original plan was to create a documentary film, but it turned out that many of the central figures involved are unwilling or unable to be interviewed openly. “We met with a large number of operations and intelligence personnel, including handlers of agents. Some of them are people for whom deviousness is a way of life. They mislead you quite a bit in interviews, mainly to blur methods of operation,” Issacharoff relates. The writers drew on the aid of experts on Mughniyeh and on Hezbollah, among them Dr. Shimon Shapira, a retired brigadier general.  Mughniyeh, as depicted in “Ghosts of Beirut,” is a person of unusual skills, daring, intellect and force of leadership, but who also displayed extraordinary cruelty. He personally tortured William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirut in the mid-1980s, extracted from him secrets that exposed agents being run by the Americans in Lebanon, and afterward sent a video documenting the torture to Buckley’s friends.  Following 16 months of brutality inflicted on him, Buckley died in captivity, and his body was handed over to the United States. That was the event, along with his part in the hijacking of a TWA plane to Beirut in 1985, that made Mughniyeh a target for the administration. The hunt took two and a half decades, during which Mughniyeh was placed on the FBI’s list of most-wanted terrorists.  The first two episodes of the series trace Mughniyeh’s rise, when he was in his early twenties, during Israel’s invasion of Lebanon. The first major terrorist incident that Mughniyeh helped plan was the suicide attack on the building housing the Israeli administration in Tyre – the so-called “first Tyre disaster” – in November 1982. For years Israel claimed that the explosion in the building was due to a gas leak, despite convincing evidence that it was, in fact, the first suicide bombing in the region.  It was Mughniyeh who recruited the terrorist who perpetrated the attack, his distant relative Ahmad Kassir, the driver of the booby-trapped car. Kassir’s brother is today a high-ranking figure in Hezbollah. Last year, Shin Bet director Ronen Bar announced a renewed internal investigation of the event, in light of the demand by the bereaved families and former Shin Bet employees to declare the disaster an act of terrorism.  The last two episodes leap ahead in time to 2007, when new progress was made in the pursuit of Mughniyeh. The murderous operative appeared once more on the Americans’ radar following an incident that took place in northern Iraq. Iran, angry at the arrest of four members of its Revolutionary Guards by the U.S. Army, tasked Mughniyeh with carrying out a revenge operation in which American soldiers were kidnapped and murdered. Subsequently, the CIA linked up with the Mossad and Military Intelligence, which used a technological and operational breakthrough to tighten the surveillance of Mughniyeh.  The major problem was that Mughniyeh was very cautious and avoided all personal exposure. For years, the intelligence services hunting him weren’t even sure if they had an authentic photograph of him. According to the series – and here Issacharoff doesn’t reveal what is reliable information and what is solely the fruit of imagination – patterns of activity were identified before Mughniyeh’s trips from Lebanon to Syria, where he would meet periodically in Damascus with Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force.  The third participant in the meetings was a Syrian general, Muhammad Suleiman, who was killed in an Israeli assassination operation in northern Syria about six months after Mughniyeh, as divulged in U.S. National Security Agency documents. As for Soleimani, the Americans assassinated him in January 2020 in Iraq; according to some reports, the U.S. was assisted in the operation by intelligence supplied by Israel.  Open gallery view Avi Issacharoff (left) and Lior Raz at a convention in January. Credit: Tomer Appelbaum  Cherchez la femme  In the days before Mughniyeh arrived in Damascus, there was a noticeable stirring in the activity of the logistical and operational envelope that preceded his arrival in the city, and that was intended to protect him from assassination attempts. Concurrently, similar movements were discerned around Soleimani, who maintained a somewhat more prominent public profile. But what gave away Mughniyeh’s location on the eve of the assassination was a family crisis.  Mughniyeh had a lover, a Syrian woman, and his wife, who lived in Lebanon, found out about her. According to the series, intelligence agents intercepted a conversation in which Mughniyeh tells one of his sons that he has brought his wife to Damascus for a reconciliation.  Israel recruited the United States for the operation, but encountered two objections: American apprehension that booby-trapping his car would cause casualties in an adjacent school, and a refusal to attack Soleimani on the same occasion. (The Americans’ demurrer is especially interesting now, against the backdrop of the killing of nine Palestinian civilians in the latest assassination operation in the Gaza Strip last week, and the Israeli claim that the U.S. is less cautious than we are in regard to the killing of civilians.)  Open gallery view Qassem Soleimani, assassinated in 2020. Credit: Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader  According to the same reports, the prime minister at the time, Ehud Olmert, flew to Washington to persuade the White House that the Mossad was capable of making a commitment that no innocent individuals would be hurt in the explosion.  The fourth and final episode reconstructs in detail the assassination itself, including the forgoing of the opportunity to assassinate Soleimani and Suleiman, both of whom, as noted, were later killed. In 2015, in an assassination operation on the Syrian border in the Golan Heights, Israel also killed Jihad Mughniyeh, Imad’s son, who together with the Iranians tried to form a Hezbollah squad in the southern Golan.  Last week, Israel assassinated six of the top-ranking figures in Islamic Jihad. Despite the decision-makers’ intense self-congratulation, they were ultimately local operatives whose elimination is not expected to bring about any considerable change in the strategic picture in Gaza. In the past there were, by contrast, Israeli assassinations, primarily in Hamas (Ahmed Yassin, Abdel Aziz Rantissi, the failed attempt to assassinate Khaled Meshal), which were aimed at a higher level. Those actions were considered controversial, and it was claimed that targeted assassinations mainly spur revenge efforts by the adversary.  The case of Mughniyeh is different, and can apparently be listed together with two other strategic assassinations: that of Soleimani and the assassination, which is attributed to the Mossad, of Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shikaki in Malta in 1995. In those three cases, the target was so central to his organization that his elimination severely disrupted its activity in the years that followed. The countries that decided on the assassinations viewed them as worthwhile actions, as they caused damage to the terrorist organizations’ capabilities for a lengthy period.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9saWZlL3RlbGV2aXNpb24vMjAyMy0wNS0xOC90eS1hcnRpY2xlLy5wcmVtaXVtL2ZhY3Qtbm90LWZpY3Rpb24tZmF1ZGEtY3JlYXRvcnMtdGFja2xlLXJpc2Utb2YtaGV6Ym9sbGFocy1hcmNoLXRlcnJvcmlzdC1tdWdobml5ZWgvMDAwMDAxODgtMmZmOC1kOTE0LWFmOGMtYWZmZDgwNGIwMDAw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He assassinated Mahatma Gandhi at a multi-faith prayer meeting on January 30, 1948, when Gandhi Ji visited the then Birla House in New Delhi for a prayer meeting.  Godse fired three bullets at the chest of Gandhi ji from a close range, ensuring his death. He chose not to escape and was arrested, tried and sentenced to death. It was his third attempt to assassinate Gandhi ji. Earlier in 1944, he had made two attempts to kill him, but were unsuccessful. He was not alone in the assassination conspiracy; he had plotted the assassination with Narayan Apte and six others.  After the 1948 assassination, Godse claimed Gandhi favoured the political demands of British India's Muslims during the partition of India of 1947.  Godse was born into a Konkani Brahmin family from Baramati, Pune. He got his name Nathuram after his parents forced him to wear a nose ring as they feared that their family was under a curse where their male child died at infancy. He had three brothers and a sister, with all of three boys dying in their infancy.  His parents sent him to study at an English-language school in Pune after he completed his fifth standard education at a local school in Baramati.

It is said that during his school days he had tremendous respect for Mahatma Gandhi and he even participated in civil disobedience movement in 1930.

The SFJ is a banned terror group under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The video was recorded on April 5 and released on Thursday. Through a separate Press statement issued on Thursday from New York, the outfit has opposed G20 summits in Jammu & Kashmir.  Besides being sheltered in the US, the SFJ is also backed by Pakistan’s ISI and the latest exhortations could be a bid to revive so-called Khalistan movement here in India following the dismantling of the secessionist network with the arrest of a host of alleged Khalistani leaders like Amritpal Singh and his cohorts, counter-terrorism experts said.  The outfit also gave a call to the Kashmiris to block the Srinagar airport to sensitise the delegates through holding of G20 meeting in Srinagar.  The SFJ is a rootless entity in terms of popular support and its leaders are spearheading the so-called Khalistan movement for earning their livelihood from their masters in the Pakistan Army and the notorious spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), analysts said.  The Centre is hosting the G20 tourism working group meeting under India’s presidency between May 22 and 24.  The SFJ is headed by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun who is facing several cases on terrorism charges but is living freely in the US without any action from the law enforcement agencies there despite the American Government claiming to fight terrorism worldwide.  The US preaches Pakistan and other countries to rein in terror groups but is itself harbouring such groups. American server service provider Cloudflare Inc is known to host the websites of several UN-banned terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad on the one hand and the ISI on the other, the analysts said.  The SFJ has also launched a dedicated email site for the Kashmiris to send emails urging the G20 ambassadors to “Boycott Kashmir Summit” and “Save Kashmiri Pundits”.  The Save Kashmiri Pundits” could be a ploy to target them through the Pakistani terror cohorts during the G20 summit and run a propaganda overdrive against the Government, the analysts said.  In its bid to scare the member countries of the grouping, the SFJ has also written a letter to G20 countries with the dubious claim that the agencies here can orchestrate violent incidents in Jammu and Kashmir.  In its letter to the G20 countries, the SJF dubbed the abrogation of Article 370 as “annexation by the Modi Government.

The Armenian media allegedly mentions that Pashinyan, returning from the meeting in Brussels, faced an assassination attempt against himself and his son.  This information mentioned about Pashinyan is also similar to the scenario of Karen Demirchiyan, who had been assassined in 1999 in the Armenian parliament. Some sources even mention that Pashinyan wants to make himself a hero. Supposedly, because there are conspiracies against him, Pashinyan is trying to insure himself in order to deny his promise in the future.  Turkish political analyst, professor Husameddin Inac, in a comment for Azernews on the issue, evaluated this chaos in the Armenian society as follows: “Pashinyan is currently in a very difficult situation. In fact, since he was defeated in the 44-day war, he is somehow thinking of signing peace. But, unfortunately, he cannot accept this either in his country, or due to pressures of members in his government and even society.”  The expert, who approaches the issue from the prospect of both Russia and the domestic audience, noted that currently Russia is not an interested party in Armenia's rapprochement with Azerbaijan. Because, according to Inac, the settlement of Azerbaijani-Armenian relations means the end of the mission of Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh. This does not leave the need for Russia to be a joint mediator. According to Husameddin Inac, another issue is related to the so-called artsakh in Karabakh.  “If we look at it from a historical point of view, there was no state called ""artsakh"". Everyone knows that Karabakh is historically the territory of Azerbaijan and no so-called state can be a matter of discussion.  Armenia accuses Azerbaijan by inventing various excuses. Allegedly, they claim that if Azerbaijan starts the great retun to Karabakh, it will carry out ethnic cleansing against the Armenians there. This is a completely fictitious claim. However, Mr. Ilham Aliyev said that the population could only under the condition of accepting Azerbaijani citizenship. They will have the same rights as other citizens and will live in peace and tranquility. Unfortunately, since this condition did not satisfy them, they falsely spread a series of fake news in the media about the oppression of Armenians by Azerbaijanis. And now they also want to blame Pashinyan for what he has only done right in Brussels.""  At the same time, Husameddin Inac touched upon the protests that took place in Karabakh after Pashinyan's meeting in Brussels.  ""If we look carefully at the processes, we will see that after Pashinyan's meeting in Brussels, the protests by separatists in Karabakh started to become more active. This is not only the influence of the separatists, but also of the foreign forces that reign over Yerevan. I think that direct and sincere dialogue between Azerbaijan and Armenia will not be possible as long as this influence is on Yerevan. First of all, Yerevan should take control of the separatists in Karabakh and dissuade them from empty claims as possible,"" the political analyst said.  ---  Follow Rena Murshud on Twitter: @RenaTagiyeva  Follow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF6ZXJuZXdzLmF6L2FuYWx5c2lzLzIxMDAwMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","1993-04-10","Not Discerned","{""Johannesburg"", ""Gauteng"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Thu 18 May 2023 08:13:22","I was about to set off to the airport on the morning of 10 April 1993 to cover the great American boxer Muhammad Ali’s arrival in Johannesburg when the news came through: Chris Hani had been murdered.  Of all the African National Congress (ANC) leaders I’d met during a decade of underground membership during the 1980s, the one who impressed me the most was Hani.  From 1987 to 1992 Hani was chief of staff of the movement’s military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and leader of the South African Communist Party from 1991 to 1993. Intelligent, brave, warm and witty, he exuded the kind of energetic charm that made him a hugely compelling revolutionary. I spent time with him in 1987 and 1989 and felt then, and later, that he would have made a far better successor to Mandela than the anointed dauphin, Thabo Mbeki.  The news of his assassination outside his home in Dawn Park, Boksburg, came as a shock. I found it difficult to focus on the appearance of Ali, who’d been a kind of hero of mine for more than 20 years.  In his recently released book, The Plot to Save South Africa, journalist and author Justice Malala does a masterful job of telling the tale of Hani’s murder and the precarious spell that followed before his funeral. He describes the nine days that followed, days that contained the potential to scupper fragile negotiations to end apartheid and prompt prolonged chaos or worse.  The subtitle of this book – “The week Mandela averted civil war and forged a new nation” – is appropriately chosen.  The book is a gripping read for anyone interested in late 20th century history, and in the end of apartheid more specifically. Malala has done a fine job in making this not just an impressively researched record, but also a compelling, fast-moving tale.  Narrative balance  Malala, who was a young reporter at The Star at the time of the killing, is a talented story-teller, adept at weaving the required facts into a page-turning narrative. Each anecdotal vignette comes with the kind of vivid descriptive detail that is only possible with exhaustive research. He interviewed scores of the key players from all sides in this drama. He also had access to a wealth of archival material, allowing him to delve into the minds of the protagonists and to recount their movements, what they were wearing and the words they shared with each other.  He draws on his experience, discipline and flair as a writer to maintain the momentum all the way through to the funeral at the end.  The key player in this enthralling story is Nelson Mandela who had been released after 27 years in prison in February 1990. He adored Hani, treating the 50-year-old as his son. He was overwhelmed with sadness. But he retained the clarity of purpose to hold back ANC supporters from wrecking the negotiations to end apartheid that had started soon after Mandela’s release, and had resumed shortly before Hani’s murder, after a spell of suspension.  The assassins wanted the talks derailed. They hoped Hani’s death would ignite a civil war that would unleash the apartheid security forces against the ANC and the Mass Democratic Movement, an alliance of anti-apartheid groups, as never before.  There was indeed an outpouring of rage, grief and violence following the murder. In the areas around Johannesburg and Pretoria alone 80 people were killed and hundreds injured in violence directly related to Hani’s assassination, with many more casualties in the rest of the country.  Most of the injuries and fatalities were due to the actions of the apartheid security forces and right-wing vigilantes.  But the outcome of the assassination was the opposite to the killers’ intentions. The incendiary climate following the murder focused minds on both sides. Mandela, his lead negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa, and other ANC leaders successfully used the moment to press for an election date and a Transitional Executive Council to run the country until the first democratic election. This was hugely significant. It meant that the then ruling National Party, the party of apartheid, could no longer call the shots before the election.  Without the urgency injected into the negotiations process by the assassination, it is possible that it would have dragged on, and many more would have died.  The outcome was the opposite to the killers’ intentions. Immediately afterwards, power leaked away from the state president, FW de Klerk, the National Party and the security establishment, and flowed to Mandela, the ANC and the Mass Democratic Movement.  In his accounts of these killings Malala retains narrative balance, giving space to all of the players. For example, he devotes several pages to the murder by ANC activists of the liberal anti-apartheid teacher and activist Ally Weakley, who was tragically mistaken for a right-wing vigilante.  A far-right plot  The book starts with Mandela receiving news of the murder and quickly segues to the movements of the two men who would be convicted, the Polish immigrant Janusz Walus, who pulled the trigger, and his mentor, the Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis, and also those who assisted them, including Derby-Lewis’s wife, Gaye, and the journalist Arthur Kemp, who supplied Hani’s address (and subsequently emerged as a leading player in the international extreme-right).  Later, Malala raises the possibility that others within the apartheid security forces were aiding them. For example, the regular police investigating the murder were instructed by the Security Police not to probe into Walus’ links to his employer, the arms trader Peter Jackson. Jackson owned the car the killer used on the day, and Malala notes that the killer’s diary disappeared from the police docket, later reemerging with several pages missing.  He also points to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission finding that Walus operated as a source for the National Intelligence Service (the apartheid state’s version of the CIA). The commission probed human rights abuses by the apartheid state and those who fought against it.  To maintain the hour-by-hour tension, Malala avoids reaching ahead, instead portraying the players in this drama as they were then. Perhaps inevitably, some of those who star in his account fared less well in the decades that followed – in particular the ANC spokesperson Carl Niehaus, who confessed to fraud and was eventually expelled from the ANC.  More generally, many of the devoted ANC leaders who played a central part in the build-up to Hani’s funeral went on to become multi-millionaires, more interested in self-enrichment than the common weal.  Appropriately, Malala resists the temptation to speculate about what would have happened if Hani had lived. Instead he closes with Mandela and De Klerk winning the Nobel Peace Prize and the launch of the Transitional Executive Council which ushered in the largely peaceful elections on April 27 1994.  This book serves as a reminder of how close South Africa came to civil war in the countdown to democracy. Nearly three decades on, it is also a timely reminder of the selflessness and dedication of many of the main players of the time, qualities that seem in short supply today.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vdGhlLXBsb3QtdG8tc2F2ZS1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtbWFzdGVyZnVsLWFjY291bnQtb2YtYW4tYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi10aGF0LW5lYXJseS1kZXJhaWxlZC1lZmZvcnRzLXRvLWVuZC1hcGFydGhlaWQtMjA1NTg00gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9hbXAvdGhlLXBsb3QtdG8tc2F2ZS1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2EtbWFzdGVyZnVsLWFjY291bnQtb2YtYW4tYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi10aGF0LW5lYXJseS1kZXJhaWxlZC1lZmZvcnRzLXRvLWVuZC1hcGFydGhlaWQtMjA1NTg0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","0064-10-15","Not Discerned","{""Moscow"", ""Moscow"", ""Russia""}","Thu 18 May 2023 16:41:31","Roman Emperor Domitian is remembered for only one joke. “It’s a terrible thing to be an emperor,” Domitian said, “because everything thinks your paranoia about being assassinated is groundless—until you’re actually murdered!” Soon after Domitian was assassinated. Extreme vigilance is the essential mood of tyranny, which must inhabit that condition not just first because it is indeed in danger of overthrow and surrounded by enemies but also because it requires its people to be fearful and isolated, therefore conditioned for extreme solutions. President Vladimir Putin is living proof of this conundrum.  The recent drone attack on the Kremlin may have been the work of Ukrainian or internal Russian factions, possibly within his own wider security organs, or a ‘false flag’ operation by the regime itself, but it was inevitable that the dictatorship would claim it was an assassination attempt on Putin. This is absurd since everyone knows that the president does not live in the Kremlin but outside Moscow in his gilded mansion, Novo-Ogaryovo. Yet Domitian would sympathize because Putin has every reason to fear assassination.  It is a cliché of the cliché-ridden Western press on Putin—and his predecessors Stalin, Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible—that they are paranoid to the extent of madness. It is a cliché that ignores and misunderstands the nature of dictatorship particularly in Russia. All absolute systems in world history depend on coercion to crush opposition and maintain power, thereby creating internal enemies who can only use violence to overthrow the ruler. All such systems deploy war and xenophobia to inspire and control their own people which creates another legion of enemies. The Western press always emphasizes the omnipotence of the autocrat in a system without limits without seeing that a system without limits means the leader exists in a permanent state of carnivorous chaos without any real or lasting security. Systems without clear rules of succession grant enormous power to the ruler but also mean they have no means of retirement. In Russia—whether under Tsars Ivan IV and Peter I , Stalin or Putin—rulers could appoint their successors but could never do so without creating a potential present menace.  In October 2011, during the Arab Spring revolutions, Putin spent hours watching the gruesome smartphone footage of longterm Russian ally, Colonel Gadaffi, who was sodomized with a bayonet before being shot. Putin resolved to save his ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria. And himself. He no doubt reflected on the nature of Russian tsardom. He was aware of it from the start: when Yeltsin offered him the presidency in 1999, Putin hesitated, asking “how will I protect my family?” The answer? To establish a dictatorship and keep it for life.  More from TIME  Read More: Putin’s Path to War in Ukraine  Every wise tsar knows that his constant poise must be ferocious vigilance. Peter the Great set the standard of the all-talented emperor and supreme commander to which Putin—along with every other Russian ruler—aspires but he faced constant plots against his life which he handled himself by personally torturing and executing thousands of mutinous musketeers; he even tortured his own rebellions son Alexei to death. Peter invented modern Russia—even its name Roosiya was coined by him—as a new empire; he took the title imperator. The state has never developed from that vision. But this imperial self-image also sets a perilous standard for Peter’s admiring successors: the tsar – whether president or general-secretary—is also a military commander.  If a Russian ruler cannot dominate the “Russian world,” he will disappoint history. Peter was overwhelmingly successful in his wars—but even he was nearly captured and defeated by the Ottomans. Yet the dream of every Russian ruler is conquest. In 1904, Nicholas II’s Interior Minister V.K. Plehve, supposedly advised, “What this country needs is a short victorious war.” Every ruler (even in our democracies) aspires to one of those. Nicholas II instead faced a disastrous defeat vs Japan; but Putin built his imperial presidency and garnished his swaggersome overconfidence with a run of three ‘short victorious wars’ in Chechnya, Georgia and Syria. But they were minor skirmishes; Ukraine is proving very different…  Out of the last twelve Romanov emperors, six died violently. Ivan the Terrible and Stalin died in their beds by wreaking such havoc around them that no one dared destroy them. Putin is a killer but not yet a mass killer on their scale.  Circa 1700, Peter the Great (1672 - 1725), Tsar of Russia, beheading one of the rebel Streltsy (semi-professional musketeers) in front of his nobles. Hulton Archive-Getty Images  In June 1762, the new young Emperor Peter III—puny grandson of Great Peter—threw away costly Russian gains against Prussia. His own Guards and his wife Catherine the Great overthrew him; the Guards strangled him. The press release announced he had died of haemorrhoids. When Catherine later invited the French philosopher d’Alembert to Russia, he joked “I must decline because I suffer from haemorrhoids which are a fatal disease in Russia.” After midnight, on 11th March 1801, Russian Emperor, Paul, son of Catherine and Peter III, was awakened by footsteps on the stairs of his Mikhailovsky Castle; he hid behind a tapestry as the conspirators—slightly drunk after a pre-homicidal champagne—burst into his bedroom.  The conspirators were let in by trusted servant; they were led by his chief minister & top generals; and backed by his own son, who waited downstairs. What happened next was history’s most savage liquidation of a Russian autocrat.  Paul, inconsistent and menacing, was destroyed by war , capricious foreign policy—including sending an army to attack British India. The conspirators saw his feet peeping out of the wallhanging and dragged him out; conspirators hit him with a golden snuffbox, knocking out an eye, then threw themselves onto him, shattering his head on the floor, strangling him with his sash, then drunkenly stomping his head to pulp.  Just over a century later Nicholas II was not killed by his generals but he was overthrown by them. Yes the crisis was accelerated by hungry crowds in the capital Petrograd but contrary to popular history, he was forced to abdicate by his generals when he was isolated in his railway carriage on his way to put down the revolution.  Putin knows all this history. “How will history remember me?” he kept asking historians in recent years. His isolation during Covid made him one of history’s most dangerous creatures: the omnipotent history-buff. Stalin read history obsessively and collected a huge library—half of which is in Putin’s Kremlin office. Before the war, Putin liked to ask visitors to chose a book then together they would examine Stalin’s pungent marginalia. He is not an intellectual like Stalin but he reads historical biographies—including a famous Russian biography of Paul and my own biography of Catherine the Great and Potemkin. History matters to him; he has always been obsessed by eighteenth century Russian leaders, Peter, Catherine and Prince Potemkin. They were the trio who dominated Ukraine; all subsequent Russian-Soviet leaders including Lenin and Stalin regarded the possession of Ukraine as essential to their vision of Russian statehood.  It was Peter who founded St Petersburg and won the Baltic. It was Catherine in partnership with her brilliant lover, co-ruler and secret husband, Prince Potemkin, who conquered Crimea in 1783 and south Ukraine 1787-91, founding the cities Sebastopol, Odessa, Kherson that form today’s battlefield. When I wrote that first book in 2ooo, Putin, waiting for it to be translated, asked for a one-pager on Potemkin’s conquests and cities. In his speeches and essays before invading Ukraine, he cited Catherine and Potemkin. When his troops took Kherson, they captured Potemkin’s tomb and when they retreated late last year, they stole the Prince’s body. I predict that Putin will create a splendid tomb for Potemkin in Moscow to prove the Russian claim to Ukraine.  But the history also shows what happens when tsars fail. In 1964, Khrushchev was fortunate that he was only overthrown and retired after he risked nuclear war and delivered an unprecedented national humiliation in the Cuba Missile Crisis—though his successor Brezhnev did propose his assassination.  Victory makes a Russian ruler invulnerable, almost sacred. Defeat places a Russian ruler in danger from his closest courtiers, ministers and generals. While one thinks of tsars overthrown by crowds, most are actually destroyed by their closest colleagues deep within their own palaces. The modern prototype would be another secret-policeman-aspiring- to-rule, Lavrenti Beria, overthrown in June 1953 by his trusted, somewhat inferior comrades, Khrushchev and Malenkov (whose house at Novo-Ogorovo is now Putin’s home—what a small world) at a surprise meeting. He was shot.  When Russian leaders fall, nemesis usually comes from those closest. “When you walk down the corridors,” mused Stalin, “you never go when it’s going to come.” Putin is not paranoid; he has ever reason to be vigilant.  Domitian would sympathize.

"assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:16:25","© Provided by Firstpost Pakistan is teetering on the edge of a cyclical phenomenon, but this time stakes are too high  High-voltage spectacle leading to the arrest of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan by the Rangers on 9 May 2023 at the Court House in Islamabad resulted in turmoil across the country. The intensity of violence unleashed by the workers of Imran’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was well beyond expectations. The rampage resulted in the loss of over a dozen lives and colossal damage to the property, including that of military establishments. Despite the ruthless crackdown by security forces, the environment continues to be volatile.  The explosive situation took another dramatic turn two days later when on 11 May, the Supreme Court of Pakistan (SC) ordered Imran Khan’s immediate release, calling his arrest to be illegal. While Imran’s followers rejoiced, the government accused the judiciary of acting politically and favouring the former prime minister. The SC decision came as a jolt even for the army. The next very day, Islamabad High Court granted bail to Imran Khan along with two weeks’ reprieve from arrest in the Al-Qadir trust case. It also provided him immunity from arrest in any case filed after 9 May. Immediately on his release, Imran Khan went ballistic, squarely blaming the Army Chief General Asim Munir for destroying the nation and creating chaos.  The gravity of the prevailing situation reverberates the outrage that followed former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in 2007. Ongoing unrest probably is the worst since 1971, which ended up in the dismemberment of Pakistan. The current political calamity could not have come at the worst time when Pakistan is in the grip of a serious economic crisis, almost on the verge of bankruptcy.  In its 75 years of existence, for half the time Pakistan has been ruled by army generals. Even during the times, the civilian government was in place, the army continued to exercise effective control by proxy. For that matter, Imran Khan also wears the tag of the selected prime minister as the army played a key role in his coming to power in 2018, orchestrating the dismissal of the Nawaz Sharif government on corruption charges.  Going by the history of civil-military relations in Pakistan, no civilian government has been able to complete its full term. So was the case with Imran Khan who fell out of favour with the then Army Chief General Qamar Bajwa, his benefactor, over the appointment of DG ISI (Director General Inter Service Intelligence). While Imran Khan wanted Lt Gen Faiz Hameed to continue as the head of ISI and subsequently take over as the Chief, General Bajwa overruled the prime minister and appointed Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum as the DG.  The army ultimately got rid of Imran Khan last April, by engineering his toppling through a ‘no confidence motion’ paving the way for Shehbaz Sharif to become the prime minister. After his ouster, Imran Khan vociferously took up an anti-army stance, gaining considerable public popularity in the process. He went on to level allegations against Major General Faisal Nasser, head of counter-intelligence in ISI for an attempt on his life. Imran Khan has been demanding early elections in a bid to cash in the favourable public sentiments. However, his coming to power is not in the army’s interest. General Asim Munir, in fact, has a personal grudge against Imran Khan for removing him from the post of DG ISI prematurely when he reportedly initiated an investigation of corruption charges against Bushra Bibi-Imran’s wife.  Unprecedented public anger is directed against the Pakistan Army (Chief) fueled by hardships faced by the common person in the wake of harsh economic conditions, given that military continues to maintain a lavish lifestyle. There are also reports about dissidence within the army, evident from a major military reshuffle wherein Lt Gen Salman Ghani commander of the Lahore-based Corps stands replaced by Lt Gen Fayyaz Shah. Reports of purges against the pro-Imran elements in the army have also surfaced.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLWluL25ld3Mvb3RoZXIvcGFraXN0YW4taXMtdGVldGVyaW5nLW9uLXRoZS1lZGdlLW9mLWEtY3ljbGljYWwtcGhlbm9tZW5vbi1idXQtdGhpcy10aW1lLXN0YWtlcy1hcmUtdG9vLWhpZ2gvYXItQUExYmw5VFk_bGk9QUFnZ2VzMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Mrs Salame spent time putting flowers around a pole which has become a focal point for commemorations each year.  She had to be supported by friends who had come to pay their own respects to Aya.  On occasions passers-by would stop to say dua (prayers) and others came to lay their own flowers at the spot.  Aya’s mum, Samar Salame visited Blackburn on the anniversary of the death  Speaking today Mrs Salame said found it hard to return to the town since the death of her daughter.  Holding back tears she had to be comforted by Aya’s friends as she spoke.  She said: “It is not fair. For those people to be breathing and alive and my daughter she under the soil in her grave.  “Still her brothers and sisters are suffering. Our life is damaged. They smashed us. They killed us.  “I hope their prisons will be their graves.”  New pictures of Aya have been released on the third anniversary of her death (NQ/Aya Hachem Family)  Permanent memorial to remember Aya  It has also been revealed there are plans to make a permanent memorial at the site where Aya was killed.  This will be in the form of a plaque on the pole, which would be painted the colour green.  The family are said to be looking at producing their own plaque which would be a permanent reminder of that fateful day and also celebrate the life of Aya.  The pole is owned by broadband company 6G Internet and the firm said they would work with the family in ‘whatever way they could’.  Simon Jones from 6G Internet said: “This is an extremely sombre time for the family, the local community and the whole town.  “If the family wish to commemorate the life of Aya Hachem at the site with a permanent memorial we will do whatever we can to assist them.”  The company also said it would pay for any costs incurred for the memorial.  Who was Aya Hachem?  Aya was an aspiring lawyer who was studying at the University of Salford, and her family had moved to Blackburn 10 years before her death, fleeing from violence in Lebanon.  Five years after arriving in the country, a 14-year-old Aya Hachem and her parents went to a charity event to help traumatised refugees settle into life in the county.  In the decade she lived in the town, Aya thrust herself into British life, learning English and excelling at school. She became one of the Children’s Society’s youngest ever trustees at 16.  Aya started at the University of Salford when she was 18 and was in her second year when she was murdered.  What happened on the day  Aya Hachem was walking home from Lidl, passing Quick Shine Tyres in Blackburn on May 17, 2020, when a hit which had been organised to kill the business owner, Pachah Khan, tragically saw her shot and killed.  The assassination attempt was organised by one of the owners of RI Tyres, Quick Shine’s neighbouring business, because they were angry about the fact Quick Shine had started to sell tyres.  Feroz Suleman masterminded a plan to have Mr Khan killed, bringing in trusted friends and allies to help carry out the shooting.  Feroz Suleman, Zamir Raja, Anthony Ennis, Louis Otway, Ayaz Hussain, Kashim Manzoor, Uthman Satia and Abubakr Satia have all been found guilty of murder and attempted murder.  Judy Chapman was found guilty of manslaughter.  Suhayl Suleman, brother of Feroz stood trial for the murder of Aya and attempted murder of Pachah Khan but was acquitted.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhbmNhc2hpcmV0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvbmV3cy9jcmltZS8yMzUyNzcyMi5heWEtaGFjaGVtLWZhbWlseS1tYXJrLXRocmVlLXllYXJzLXNpbmNlLWJsYWNrYnVybi1zdHVkZW50cy1kZWF0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Farooq had been killed 33 years back.  The family has asked the J&K government to take the case of the father-son duo’s killing to a logical conclusion.  “We praise the J&K police for cracking the assassination case of Moulvi Mohammad Farooq after 33 years… We once again urge upon the J&K Lt Governor as well Government of India for not only reopening of this case and taking this case to a logical conclusion, so as to bring the culprits of this whole conspiracy to justice,” Rajinder Premi, son of Sarwanand Koul Premi said.  The family said Sarwanand Premi, 65, and his younger son Verinder Koul, 27, were killed by the militants in April 1990 after they were kidnapped from their home at native village in South Kashmir’s Anantnag district. Within a week after the incident, the Premi family left Kashmir.  The family said an FIR was registered in police station Dooru Anantnag, but this case was closed as untraced after a brief period, as no effective and expeditious investigation was done, The Family said the Police had arrested eight suspects involved, but later the case was closed as untraced.  Rajinder Premi said the family had approached the authorities with the request of handing this case to CBI for an expeditious and effective investigation, but due to unknown reasons was not allowed by the then J&K government.  They said the case of the father-son killing was not reopened despite the recommendations of the state Human Rights Commission (SHRC) in 2012.  Last year, the Jammu and Kashmir government recognised the literary contribution of Sarwanand Premi, who was conferred the lifetime achievement award posthumously on Republic Day. Sarwanand Premi authored more than three dozen books, which include translations of the “Bhagavad Gita” into Urdu and ‘Ramayana’ into Kashmir.

"assassination","1865-04-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 09:00:20","His second Inaugural Address remains a towering achievement. Lincoln’s attempt to comprehend divine purpose in the tragedy of “American Slavery” and the war that ended it remains a work of bracing spiritual honesty, all the more surprising for the fact that its author had once had to print a handbill assuring the public that he was not an “open scoffer” at religion.  Tackling this paradox is the challenge before Joshua Zeitz, a biographer of Lincoln’s two secretaries, John Hay and John Nicolay, who now turns his lens on the president himself.  Lincoln’s religion has been treated before, in the hagiographies that followed his assassination, when “Americans needed to memorialize Lincoln as a Christian martyr,” as Zeitz puts it, and in the writings of his former law partner, William Herndon, who set out to define him as an “un-believer.” Zeitz weaves between the dogmas, revealing a complex thinker who deftly merged religious language with political goals and underwent a “spiritual renewal” during the Civil War, especially after the death of his son Willie in 1862.  Zeitz adds meaningful context to the story, examining the ways in which soldiers experienced religion in the field; both sides held revival meetings. Above and below the Mason-Dixon line, religious leaders leaned into the conflict and found reasons to believe they enjoyed a special relationship with the Almighty. The Confederacy claimed God’s support in its Constitution and motto (“Deo vindice”). Southern leaders denounced Northerners as “infidels,” a word that was sometimes applied to Lincoln, and claimed that the Bible justified slavery.  Lincoln, of course, disagreed with that selective reading, and as he moved decisively against slavery in the final years of the war, he often claimed a spiritual justification. His speeches drew heavily on Scripture, including, in 1858, the “house divided” (Matthew 12:25); then, at Gettysburg, “four score and seven years ago” (paraphrasing Psalm 90); the second Inaugural Address, with its readings from Matthew 18:7 (“woe unto the world because of offenses …”); and Psalm 19 (“the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether”). Frederick Douglass, who was present at the second inauguration, called it “more like a sermon than a state paper.” One scholar estimated that “266 of its 702 words were quoted verbatim from the word of God.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvYm9va3MvcmV2aWV3L2xpbmNvbG5zLWdvZC1qb3NodWEtemVpdHouaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-07-01","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:00:00","Two decades ago, Jacob Langfelder was a Midwestern kid who’d moved to New York with big theater dreams and a job waiting tables.  Today, his production company Broadway and Vine is bringing a bevy of stage and screen celebs to Wine Country — and all before the company’s second birthday.  Its summer outdoor concert series, announced in April, includes San Francisco native Darren Criss (FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story,” Fox’s “Glee” and “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Broadway) on July 28; Sutton Foster (TV Land’s “Younger,” “The Music Man” on Broadway with Hugh Jackman) on Aug. 2; and actor and model Brooke Shields on Aug. 29. It all kicks off with Tituss Burgess (Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Schmigadoon!” on Apple TV+) on June 27. Attendees enjoy not just a concert in a vineyard under the evening sky, but also a wine tasting and a vintner dinner.  The story of how Langfelder made his career leap draws equally on his time treading the boards and his gigs reciting menu specials.  “As most people do, I got into waiting tables as a survival job,” the Springfield, Ill., native told The Chronicle. But unlike many aspiring actors, “I fell in love with hospitality.”  In between touring with Jonathan Groff in “The Sound of Music” or performing in Stephen Sondheim musicals, he worked at Craft as Tom Colicchio (“Top Chef”) was becoming a celebrity chef and at other haute cuisine spots including Jean-Georges and Daniel.  “Maybe it was a bit of the performer in me,” Langfelder recalled. To him, serving meals at a hip restaurant was like acting in a hit show.  On vacations, he discovered another love — Napa Valley — finally seeing in person the wine regions he discussed with restaurant patrons.  Around 2013, his passions for hospitality and theater merged for the first time when he started managing 54 Below, which included booking artists.  “When I started putting artists onstage, I got that same — not butterflies, but that excitement of when I was onstage,” Langfelder said. “I fought so hard to be on the stage, and to finally have something that I could lend to other artists was really fulfilling.”  Then in 2016, he happened to be talking with friends in Bouchon Bakery Time Warner about where to take a show when Thomas Keller walked by and sat down. “I said, ‘I would really love to bring Broadway to Napa,’ ” Langfelder recounted. Keller was receptive to the idea and made some introductions with Wine Country movers and shakers.  Keller was “happy to have played a small part in something that is enriching the Napa Valley arts community,” he said in a statement to The Chronicle.  Langfelder officially moved to the region in 2018, getting to know the scene by producing events for Festival Napa Valley, the annual event blending arts performances, wine and food. It takes place this year July 8-23.  Langfelder’s Broadway and Vine, blending Wine Country’s comestibles, libations and vineyard views with a chance to see Broadway stars without all the razzle-dazzle, debuted with Tony Award nominee Tony Yazbeck in 2021, as much of the rest of the world was reopening from the pandemic, thanks to vaccines.  But Napa had its additional wounds. When Langfelder introduced Yazbeck at Tre Posti in St. Helena, he could see the scars of 2020’s Glass Fire across the valley. “We were all just starved to do something,” Langfelder said. He thought, “Can I just do, like, one show? And if it doesn’t work we’ll just throw in the towel?”  But it did work. Since then, Broadway and Vine has hosted Lea Michele (“Glee” and “Funny Girl” on Broadway), Fairfield native Taylor Iman Jones (“Head Over Heels”) and Abby Mueller (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”). The company adds to the Broadway offerings of Transcendence Theatre Company, which also produces in the region but specializes in large-cast revues.  Langfelder knows tourists might not associate Wine Country with Broadway, so he especially looks for crossover talent. He also acknowledged that some of his guests are coming for the concerts and that others attend for the food and wine bigwigs.  “You get the performer saying, ‘I have no idea who these wine people are, but I love all of it,’ ” Langfelder said, “and the same with the vice versa.”  To witness top-tier musical talent in the middle of nature’s splendor? “You essentially get to be Julie Andrews on the mountaintop,” Langfelder said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tc24uY29tL2VuLXVzL3RyYXZlbC90cmlwaWRlYXMvd2hlcmUtdG8tc2VlLWJyb2Fkd2F5LXN0YXJzLWxpa2UtZGFycmVuLWNyaXNzLWFuZC1zdXR0b24tZm9zdGVyLXdpbmUtY291bnRyeS9hci1BQTFiajdIej9vY2lkPWhwbG9jYWxuZXdz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:13:00","One Piece chapter 1084 raw scans were released on Wednesday, May 17, 2023, bringing with them a truly exciting on-hands look at the issue’s alleged events. While spoilers and raw scans, however legitimate they may seem, aren’t officially confirmed until the chapter officially releases via Shueisha, the raw scans do corroborate information from text-based leaks.  Likewise, One Piece chapter 1084 does allegedly and excitingly show Im-sama confronting Nefertari Cobra during his discussion with the Gorosei. Especially shocking about this move is that he establishes himself as the true ruler of the World Government by sitting on the Empty Throne. It’s likely at this moment that Cobra became a target of assassination for the World Government.  Assuming the raw scans are proven legitimate upon the issue’s official release, One Piece chapter 1084 seems set to be an incredibly exciting follow-up to the Reverie flashback. While the announcement of a one-week break for the next issue is unfortunate, fans will undoubtedly see it prove worth the wait upon its official release.  One Piece chapter 1084's raw scans show Charlos’ attempts at capturing Shirahoshi while Cobra meets Im-sama  Raw scans  ONE PIECE (ワンピース) Spoilers @OP_SPOILERS2023 #ONEPIECE1084    Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25 Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25 #ONEPIECE1084Luffy in the Cover Page of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine Issue No. 25🔥 https://t.co/ZTnfZM9N7c  One Piece chapter 1084’s raw scans begin with a focus on Sabo, who is still making his way through Pangaea Castle while fighting the fortress’ guards. Jewelry Bonney appears out of nowhere after he eliminates one group of enemies, and the two then begin making their way through the castle together.  One of Karasu’s crows appears next to them as they run and says something to Sabo that seemingly shocks him. The crow is then shown to have a ring of keys in its mouth, possibly suggesting that Kuma has been or will be freed imminently. Sabo then hears some enemies coming, prompting him to pick up Bonney and hide on one of the hall’s decorative arches.  Later on, the two are shown to be discussing something after having come down from the rafters. However, the focus doesn’t stay on them long, as One Piece chapter 1084 then focuses on the Empty Throne room, where Cobra Nefertari is meeting with the Gorosei. He seems to be discussing some aspect of the Void Century and the World Government’s formation with them, given the use of the numbers “800” and “20” in his dialogue.  Cobra seems to be discussing a former Queen of Alabasta, seemingly corroborating the information found in text-based spoilers earlier in the week. The Gorosei show no visible reactions to this topic, but Cobra seems to be getting sterner and sterner as the conversation continues.  It’s then revealed that Im-sama has been listening to this conversation the entire time from the Room of Flowers. Meanwhile, Cobra is bringing up the initial “D,” which gets a rise out of a majority of the Gorosei. One Piece chapter 1084 then shifts to elsewhere at the Reverie, where Saint Charlos is yet again trying to capture Shirahoshi.  Other Celestial Dragons are seemingly telling the overjoyed Charlos not to do this, but he doesn’t seem to listen. Shirahoshi’s brother, Fukaboshi, then angrily rushes onto the scene, clearly intent on reclaiming his sister. He rushes Charlos, prompting Kuma to fire a laser beam in his direction. Thankfully, both he and Shirahoshi are able to get out of the way in time.  Fukaboshi then continues to rush Charlos while Rebecca, Leo of the Tontatta Tribe, and Sai of the Happo Navy observe. Saint Donquixote Mjosgard, who has personal ties with the Neptune royal family, gets in between Fukaboshi and Charlos to stop the former from doing something he’ll regret.  Leo and Sai, meanwhile, both attack Charlos, prompting Morley to take advantage of the opportunity to rescue Kuma. However, he makes himself known to the others as he does this, causing a stir despite the fact that Shirahoshi is now safe. One Piece chapter 1084 then returns to the Empty Throne room, where Im-sama is now ascending the stairs to the Empty Throne.  The Gorosei silently watch as this happens, as does Cobra with a horrified expression on his face. The issue then ends with Im-sama sitting on the Empty Throne and seemingly speaking to Cobra directly. Unfortunately, the chapter does end with the announcement of a series’ break next week.

"assassination","2018-03-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 11:00:00","Diagrams showing a tunnel complex beneath Putin's Black Sea palace are evidence of just how long the Russian leader has been fixated on the possibility of existential conflict with the West. Contributor/Getty Images; FBK; Metro 2000 via Wayback Machine; Alyssa Powell/Insider  You would think that the architects who designed Vladimir Putin's palace thought of everything.  After all, the 190,000-square-foot, billion-dollar complex, perched on a rugged bluff overlooking the Black Sea, has every luxury that an autocrat could possibly desire. As revealed by Alexei Navalny's investigation, the palace has its own church, wine cellar, and casino. It has a hookah lounge complete with a stripper pole, an arboretum, and an ice rink for the hockey games Putin likes to play with cronies. But good luck ordering takeout — security is tight. Putin's imperial dacha is sealed off from the country he rules by 17,000 acres of woodland and a special no-fly zone.  The precautions are more than paranoia on Putin's part. Earlier this month, Russian authorities claimed that two drones had attempted to assassinate Putin in a failed strike that ended in an explosion above the Kremlin.  But, despite all these princely luxuries and castle-like defenses, the palace's builders appear to have neglected one crucial detail. They failed to hide plans showing two elaborate tunnels running beneath the palace complex — plans that any competent state-security apparatus would fight tooth-and-nail to keep secret.  In fact, they were posted publicly to the Russian internet. Metro Style, a now-defunct Russian contractor, posted the diagrams to their website to showcase their work in the early 2010's. They were viewable online as late as 2016.  Today, Insider is publishing annotated versions of the diagrams with English-language translations, which can be viewed below.  The underground complex beneath Putin's palace consists of two separate tunnels connected by an elevator that descends roughly 50 meters below the surface. The architectural plans show the tunnels encased in thick concrete are supplied with enough fresh water, ventilation and extensive cables to support VIP occupants for days or weeks at a time. An expert who reviewed the tunnel plans saw signs of Putin's obsession with survival at a time other strongmen were falling.  Story continues  ""Putin has a lot of anxiety about being the not-entirely-legitimate leader of Russia,"" said Michael C. Kimmage, a former State Department official who worked on Russia and Ukraine policy. ""So knowing that his legitimacy is not entirely secured by elections, he is going to seek to maximize his personal safety through a complex of well-defended personal residences.""  The exits from those tunnels are visible just below the palace complex, on the bare cliff rising up from the beach:  Two entrances to the underground tunnel complex are visible on the hillside beneath Putin's palace. aerial photo by FBK; Insider  The lower tunnel includes a moving walkway leading to the exit. ""This tunnel set-up has all kinds of safety and security,"" said Thaddeus Gabryszewski, a structural engineer familiar with defensive structures who reviewed the diagrams for Insider. ""There's a fire system. There's water, there's sewer. This is intended for someone to survive or escape.""  All leaders of nuclear states make plans for extreme contingencies. The US president has an emergency bunker beneath the White House, and Mount Weather in Virginia. But unlike US facilities, the Black Sea complex was privately funded and remains privately owned. It appears intended not to insure the continuity of a political system so much as the survival of one individual. Putin's investment in a tunnel complex beneath a brand-new vacation home, built during years when he was still publicly flirting with Russian integration into Europe, is evidence of just how long the Russian leader has been preparing for threats, and building the trapdoors he would need to shelter or escape. ""We have to see this as part of a long confrontation with the West that has marked the last 13 or 14 years of Putin's life,"" said Kimmage.  A cross-section of the hillside shows two tunnels connected by an elevator, at right. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotations by Insider  ""These images are not blueprints,"" Gabryszewski told Insider. ""They are closer to architectural drawings. They show you the intent, the flow, and the premise of these spaces.""  The two tunnels are approximately 40 and 60 meters long, respectively, and 6 meters wide, creating about 6,500 square feet of potential living space that bears signs of being blast-proof. Their ability to withstand the impact of a nuclear blast or a bunker-buster bomb would depend on two factors that aren't in the diagrams — how the tunnels' 15-inch thick concrete shells are reinforced and the material used to fill the area around them, Gabryszewski said.  They show several features that suggest Putin commissioned the structure with worst-case scenarios in mind. Especially striking are 16 cable racks, each about a foot wide, embedded into the wall of the lower tunnel. These racks are designed for the ""conduit"" cables that can carry electricity, lighting, copper wire and fiber optic cable needed for a command post.  A cross-section showing the interior of the lower tunnel, which includes a moving walkway leading to the beach. Metro Style via Wayback Machine; annotation and translations by Insider  The sheer volume of conduit running through the lower tunnel is important because it's far more than would likely be necessary to operate the tunnel's own internal systems. ""Those trays could be for communications, lighting, power — anything that goes through a cable or tube,"" Gabryszewski said. ""It's an awful lot of cable just for the tunnel itself. So it could be some kind of back-up system for the palace complex."" Rather than serving merely as an escape passage, one of the tunnels' purposes appears to be a kind of emergency spinal cord for the entire palace complex.  Neither the Moscow-based company that acquired Metro Style, nor Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's chief spokesperson, responded to requests for comment. Amid mass protests triggered by Navalny's 2021 video investigation, Putin denied owning the Black Sea palace.  Metro Style, a company founded in the 90's by three men who have gone on to found several construction companies since, was also hired by the Russian government to dig subway tunnels beneath Moscow. When the company posted the diagrams to their website, they did not specify that the Black Sea tunnels were built for Putin. Instead, they described ""a complex of underground structures for a boarding house in the city of Gelendzhik, Krasnodar Territory."" Gelendzhik is the town closest to the palace complex, a five-hour drive from the resort city of Sochi.  The existence of the fortified tunnels, nearly 1,000 miles away from Moscow, demonstrates that Putin isn't just focussed on indulging his taste for the high life near a resort town. He is also concerned with staying alive. Survivalism was a likely driver behind the tunnels' remote location, said Kimmage, the former State Department official who is now a professor at Catholic University. ""The two times there has been a big transition in Russian history — 1917 and 1991 — the status of the capital city and the leader's position there has been a big issue,"" Kimmage said. ""Putin is solving for that contingency by establishing a network of residences that are as far from the center as possible. So a tunnel system within the Black Sea complex makes a lot of sense. Even without an active threat, he's going to be worrying about this eventuality.""  A cutaway diagram showing the interior of the elevator shaft connecting the two tunnels indicates six separate ventilation shafts designed to deliver fresh or filtered air to the tunnel's occupants.  A cross section of the vertical elevator shaft.

Is Bhuma Akhila Priya, the former minister and TDP in-charge for Allagadda, jeopardizing her political career? The answer appears to be yes.  Chandrababu Naidu has grown increasingly impatient with Akhila Priya. Her involvement in politics, as seen during Lokesh's recent padayatra entry in Nandyala, has drawn severe criticism.  Eventually, Akhila Priya was arrested yesterday at 7:30 in the morning in connection with the attack on TDP senior leader AV Subba Reddy.  The attack on a leader of her own party, who is often regarded as the soulmate of her late father Bhuma Nagi Reddy's legacy, has caused a major uproar.  Reports suggest that Akhila Priya's husband, Bhargavram, had orchestrated a plot to assassinate AV Subbareddy, which was foiled by the Kadapa police. Subsequently, a case was registered against Akhila Priya's husband and his friend, Guntur Seenu.

"assassination","1351-11-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 08:49:48","If you want a bit of peace an tranquillity amongst the bustle of Torquay, Torre Abbey is that place. A House of God, a Georgian house, a Victorian estate and now a museum, art gallery and gardens.  It wasn’t always like that.    The medieval Abbey was a very rich and powerful place and so it attracted the attention of those with less spiritual motives. Here was an institution with extensive resources and potential patronage opportunities. It could dispense benefices, employ people and grant leases on lands and tithes.    Torre Abbey was big business, so who was in charge mattered. And disputes over control could lead to kidnap and murder.  In 1345 Abbot Simon de Plympton died and the canons had to appoint a new head. Richard de Cotelford was elected but the father-abbot refused to confirm the election. Instead he appointed John Gras. Although Richard’s family were landholders in South Brent, John Gras was better connected. This was a common reason for the overturning of elections by outside interests.  John Gras ruled for three and a half years, dying in early 1349, possibly a victim of the Black Death that ravaged the South West. His successor, John de Berkadone, was confirmed in May 1349.    However, Richard de Cotelford had always complained that he had been cheated out of his rightful position. He continued to press his claim and in November 1349 won his case, receiving confirmation from the exiled bishop of Porto.  Two years later in August 1351, Richard returned to England from Avignon, going first to Westminster to receive royal support. He then journeyed to Torre, expecting when he arrived to be welcomed by the appreciative abbots and local landowners. To support his legitimate claim, he was accompanied by Roger de Queryngdon, the bearer of the King’s protection. That was the idea, anyway.    However, the return of Richard hadn’t gone down well with those who had installed John de Berkadone a couple of years earlier and who had presumably done quite well out of the appointment.    On 6 November 1351 it was recorded that “a large confederacy of disturbers of the peace, men at arms, and others purpose to come to the abbey and the granges, manors, and other places annexed to the abbey and consume and waste the goods and things therein.‟  Two weeks later, on 20 November, a commission was appointed to investigate this group of men who “broke by night his close, church and treasury at Torre Moun, co. Devon, carried away his goods and assaulted his men and servants, whereby he lost their service for a great time.”  It named a number of those involved in this attack who, it was disclosed, came from Totnes, West Devon, Dartington, Ashburton, and Dartmouth, alongside “many others‟.    Around this time Richard and Roger de Queryngdon were kidnapped and murdered.  It looks like the objective was to remove Richard from his leadership of the Abbey.  The attackers came from the lower gentry and townsmen of South Devon and it seems most likely that the assassins were sent on their violent mission by Geoffrey Gras. Geoffrey was the kinsman of the deceased abbot John Gras whose election Richard had overturned. John de Berkadone was then reinstated as abbot.  Effectively, Geoffrey Gras had kidnapped and killed Richard de Cotelford, along with the King’s messenger, to ensure his continued influence at Torre Abbey.  An attack on any Christian abbey was, of course, a serious breach of the peace. The assassination of a senior member of the clergy, disrespect to the King’s protection, and the kidnapping and murder of his messenger were also great offences.  However, even though the gang were named in the commission, they appear not to have suffered any punishment and Geoffrey Gras was pardoned.  Gras and his family remained closely connected to the Abbey even after he had kidnapped and slain their elected leader. The white-cassocked canons seem to be willing to let the attack be forgotten. Or perhaps they just didn’t have any choice in the matter.  ‘Torquay: A Social History’ by local author Kevin Dixon is available for £10 from Artizan Gallery, Lucius Street, Torquay, or:    https://www.art-hub.co.uk/product-page/torquay-a-social-history-by-kevin-dixon","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd2VhcmVzb3V0aGRldm9uLmNvbS90b3JyZS1hYmJleS1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWtpZG5hcC1hbmQtbXVyZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Following the release of the Pentagon Papers, the pair assumed the task of plugging leaks to the press that could further damage the president’s reputation — a job that earned them the nickname “the plumbers.” Their efforts to keep Nixon in power culminated in June 1972, when they endeavored to burglarize and wiretap the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington.  In the show, Woody Harrelson plays the gruff and enigmatic Hunt alongside Justin Theroux as a comically mustached Liddy. Viewers of the show might suspect that its creators took liberties to portray the two men as more eccentric than they actually were. But the truth is, the real White House Plumbers were crazier, bolder, and more outlandish than any character dreamt up in a writers’ room.

Hunt also happened to be an immensely talented author.

"assassination","2023-10-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 20:00:00","Warning: Spoilers ahead for Avengers #1 (2023)!  Avengers assemble! Captain Marvel has just put together a new incarnation of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. The latest Avengers roster includes Captain Marvel, Captain America (Sam Wilson), Iron Man, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Panther, and Thor. But is there room in their lineup for another powerhouse?  Avengers #1 (written by Jed MacKay and penciled by C.F. Villa) ends with the surprise arrival of Kang. But the time traveling conqueror doesn’t want to attack the Avengers, he wants to warn them. What’s going on?  Kang, ally or enemy?  The Avengers are taking a moment to reset. After the events of Jason Aaron’s Avengers Assemble storyline, the group has decided to temporarily disband. This has allowed the team to reassess their place in the world so they could forge a new beginning. Carol Danvers is named team chairperson, and most of Avengers #1 involves her putting together the new roster.  As Captain Marvel explains, this new iteration of the Avengers will get back to the core of what made the team inspiring in the first place. “The Avengers aren’t cops. Or, at least, we shouldn’t be. That doesn’t work, that just gets us into civil wars,” Carol tells Iron Man. “The Avengers are firefighters. We’re the ones who fly into the blaze, whatever it is.”  The new Avengers then battle Terminus, a behemoth who enjoys destroying planets. During the battle, Scarlet Witch casts a powerful spell, which causes a huge surge of energy. Captain Marvel then finds herself displaced in Null-Time, the space between time. It’s unknown if this was a result of Wanda’s spell or other forces.  As Captain Marvel gathers her bearings, she’s surprised to find herself face to face with Kang. However, the Avengers’ enemy has seen better days. The deadly villain is severely wounded and missing most of his armor. “You’ve come to my deathbed Carol Danvers. We must speak. I have a warning for you,” Kang weakly says.  Why is Kang wounded?  Kang the Conqueror has a reputation for being one of Marvel’s most fearsome villains, so the sight of him humbled and broken might be a bit surprising. However, you wouldn’t be surprised if you read Timeless #1 (2023). The one-shot followed Kang as he searched the timeline for something called the Missing Moment. As you have probably gathered, the search didn’t go so well. The thing about searching for mythical items is that you usually find yourself clashing with others.  A group known as the Twilight Court sought the Missing Moment for their master, a villain named Myrddin. It wasn’t long before their paths crossed, and Kang was in for a world of hurt. Myrddin stabbed Kang through the chest, critically wounding the time tyrant. In a last-ditch effort for survival, Kang transported himself to Null-Time. “If I’m to thwart Myrddin, even from beyond the grave, then I will require heroes of my own,” Kang says.  So, Kang is looking for heroes, and now he’s face to face with Captain Marvel. She said that her new Avengers would rush into the blaze to save people, but does that include madmen like Kang?  Will Kang join the Avengers? What’s next for the villainous conqueror?  Will this lead to Kang joining the Avengers, or destroying them? Popverse doesn’t have a time machine, but we can look at comic solicitations for a hint on what the future might hold. Avengers #2 goes on sale June 21, and the solicitation states, “The Avengers find themselves with a rare gift – foreknowledge of the dangers coming their way in the form of the deadly TRIBULATION EVENTS. But can this information be trusted? And can even Earth’s Mightiest Heroes triumph in the face of cascading disaster?”  Avengers #3 goes on sale July 26, and the solicitation states, “The first Tribulation Event strikes the Earth! The Avengers fly into the action as the Ashen Combine – a collection of the Multiverse’s greatest monsters – descend from the Impossible City to follow their respective appetites. Cityslayers all, pursuing the assassination of metropolitan areas for sport!”  Neither solicitation says anything about Kang, but they don’t have to. The copy makes it clear that the Avengers will be going on Kang’s quest to stop Myrddin, which includes making their way through the Tribulation Events. As established in Timeless #1, Tribulation Events are fixed moments in history. You cannot find the Missing Moment without going through the Tribulation Events, and only heroes can access them. This is why Myrddin formed the Twilight Court, as he wasn’t a hero.  There is a lot we still don’t know about the nature of the Missing Moment, but it appears that it will be deadly in the wrong hands. Whether the Avengers trust Kang or not, it’s in their best interest to stop Myrddin from obtaining the Missing Moment. And then what? Will Kang betray the Avengers once his rival is out of the way? Is he just using them to get the Missing Moment for himself? Probably.  However, Kang might surprise us. Plenty of reformed villains have become central parts of the Avengers’ roster, including Hawkeye, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. Maybe Jed MacKay has a surprise up his sleeve, with plans for a Kang redemption arc.  However, the difference is those reformed villains wanted to change. For now, it seems Kang just wants the Missing Moment for himself, and he isn’t after Myrddin for any moral reasons. Plus, Kang is currently gearing up to be the MCU’s next big bad. Making Kang a hero in the comics while he’s a villain onscreen might hurt some of that corporate synergy Marvel loves so much.  It looks like Kang’s journey is at an interesting crossroads, and only time will tell which way it goes.  Avengers #1 (written by Jed MacKay and penciled by C.F. Villa) is available now.

Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s repeated requests to speak to his three children – aged 11, 14 and 17 – were denied given that they now live in the United States.  “Vladimir very much misses his kids, his family, and he’s devastated that he has not been able to talk to us in over a year,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said on Wednesday. “And the authorities know that. They’re just using it as a psychological torture against him.”  Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Convicted last month of treason and other offences for publicly condemning Russia’s leadership and the war in Ukraine, Vladimir Kara-Murza received the harshest sentence of its kind since the February 2022 invasion.  He was detained in April last year, hours after CNN broadcast an interview in which he said Russia was being run by a “regime of murderers”.  State prosecutors accused the 41-year-old of treason, among other offences, and of discrediting the Russian military by spreading “knowingly false information” about its conduct in what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.  Vladimir Kara-Murza, who holds Russian and British passports, was a close associate of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition figure assassinated near the Kremlin in 2015. He continued to speak out against President Vladimir Putin.  “Had I tried to convince him to give up his fight, I would have betrayed him,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said.  ‘PERSONAL ENEMY’  Evgenia Kara-Murza said her husband’s successful lobbying of foreign governments and institutions to impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for human rights violations had made him a “personal enemy” of the Kremlin.  “Dictatorships all over the world are very much afraid of clear, strong voices that refuse to be intimidated. And Vladimir’s voice is one such voice.”  Despite not being able to speak to him, his children have grown up being acutely aware of the perils of being an opposition figure in Russia.  They witnessed their father slip into comas after poisonings in 2015 and 2017 that left him with a serious nerve disorder called polyneuropathy. Russian authorities denied any involvement.  “Their father was first poisoned when our oldest was nine,” Evgenia Kara-Murza said. “She’s now 17. That’s half of her life she spent knowing that her father was being targeted again and again and again.”  (Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Alex Richardson)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3R2YmFtLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2phaWxlZC1ydXNzaWFuLW9wcG9zaXRpb24tZmlndXJlLWthcmEtbXVyemEtZmFjZXMtcHN5Y2hvbG9naWNhbC10b3J0dXJlLXdpZmUtc2F5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This lone photo bears the testimony of the nation’s pride and pain.  In the photograph, it is shown that how Sheikh Hasina, the luckless daughter of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, found their Dhanmondi-32 house in Dhaka locked upon her return to country on May 17, 1981 ending her six-year in exile. Her entry into their house was subject to permission from the military authority.  house was under the army authority until June 10, 1981. Military ruler Ziaur Rahman didn’t allow Sheikh Hasina or any member of Bangabandhu family to enter the house till his death.  Consequently, on the day of her return, Sheikh Hasina had to arrange prayer session on the road outside the house. It was a sheer cruelty and flagrant violation of human rights. She couldn’t seek justice for the brutal killing of her father and family members due to Indemnity Act passed in the parliament in a bid to protect the killers permanently. Moreover, the homeless daughter of Bangabandhu was barred from entering her only abode in Dhaka.  Now, numerous human rights activists and organisations are seen protesting different incidents accusing the government’s various bodies of violating human rights but during that time, they didn’t show minimum sympathy to Bangabandhu’s daughters. These ‘self declared human rights defenders’ had turned their eyes blind and remained mum in this regard.  A few days later, the house constructed on loan from the House Building Finance Corporation (HBFC) was auctioned as the installments of around Tk 12,000 were not paid. Sheikh Hasina had paid the money to get the house back.  The Dhanmondi-32 house was not merely a residence of a national leader. Since Bangabandhu and his family members had started living in the house on October 1, 1961, it turned into the centre of Bangalees’ nationalistic struggle. Bangabandhu took all policy decisions of Awami League from the drawing room of this house after discussing with his colleagues. He gave all instructions to the mass people gathered in front of the house through a hand mike from its balcony.  This house is a national asset and it cannot be compared to any structure. Feeling the historic importance of the house, Bangabandhus’s two daughters declared that this house would be turned into a museum.  Despite having no shelter in the city, they made the house as ‘Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Museum’, which reminds Bangalees of their most proud moments and painful chapter of national life, so that they can get inspiration to uphold the spirit of independence and take lessons to turn around from the most difficult situation in life.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5LXN1bi5jb20vcHJpbnR2ZXJzaW9uL2RldGFpbHMvNjg5OTE1L0EtaG91c2UtdGhhdC1zcGVha3Mtb2YtbmF0aW9uJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1wcmlkZS1hbmQtcGFpbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  MEMPHIS, Tenn. — As Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month continues, the Chinese community is working to chronicle and preserve its 150 year history in Memphis.  “Our Memphis history starts in 1873,” said Emmi Dunn, Secretary at the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  Dunn has been researching the history of the Chinese community, and says a laundry ad in a newspaper was the first indication of when Chinese immigrants first made their way to Memphis. Chinese immigrants likely made their way to the Mid-South after work completed on the transcontinental railroad according to Dunn.  “They were still building railroads in the South and Texas, so lots of Chinese came down here,” said Dunn.  Several immigrants began opening laundromats because it did not require a lot of money to do so. The first Chinese store opened in 1880, the first restaurant opened in 1894, several in and around Beale Street.  “They have a much more diverse customer base. During segregation time, that’s where black people can get some service,” said Jinliang Cai, President of the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South.  At one point, so many Chinese business were on Beale Street, a local newspaper referred to that part as “Chinatown.”  “It consisted of a few stores, grocery stores, cafes and laundries,” said Dunn, “It was not a Chinatown per se as you would think of in San Francisco or New York.”  The Chinese business influence reached its height in the 1920s and 30s. Business began to leave the area over time for different reasons, including after Dr. Martin Luther King’s assassination. Laundromats eventually began to disappear after washing machine’s became automated.  “Eventually really the downtown started to decline after that, and really it started to trickle to the suburbs,” said Cai.  Most businesses only stayed open for a couple of years on Beale Street. The Chop Suey Cafe stayed open for close to 50 years, but closed its doors in 1967. This is why the Chinese Historical Society of Memphis and the Mid-South are trying to preserve that history and stories just like it.

"assassination","1965-08-06","Not Discerned","{""Montgomery"", ""Alabama"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:05:31","Martin Luther King Jr. forgot Coretta’s birthday in 1965, but she said she didn’t mind.  “In the light of my own involvement and commitments,” she said, “it is not too difficult for me to understand and forgive little things like this which do occur, sometimes.”  Coretta Scott King was thirty-eight years old, the mother of four children, ages two, four, seven, and nine. In 1965, she spent more time than ever out of the house, working for the movement, beginning in March with a series of Freedom Concerts on the West Coast. In April, she traveled to Detroit for a dinner honoring and raising money for Rosa Parks, who had struggled to find work, first in Montgomery and later in Detroit, and who had suffered deteriorating health.  In May, Coretta King spoke at a gathering of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom in Chicago. And on June 8, she was the only woman to speak at an anti–Vietnam War rally attended by more than fifteen thousand people at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Earlier that year, at an SCLC retreat, Martin had asked Coretta to speak about Vietnam and whether the organization had a responsibility to take a stand against the war. “I talked about how it would continue to drain resources from education, housing, health, and other badly needed social programs,” she recalled. “I said, ‘Why do you think we got the Nobel Prize? It was not just for civil rights . . . Peace and justice are indivisible.’ ”  It was Coretta’s passion for activism that had first attracted Martin, back in 1952, when she had been enrolled at the New England Conservatory of Music and he had been pursuing his doctorate at Boston University. On their first date, they had discussed the merits of capitalism versus communism. He explained that he intended to devote himself to the fight for racial justice. Coretta, having attended the progressive and integrated Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, thought she would have the edge on this well-bred young man when it came to passion for social reform. She was pleasantly surprised to find that he seemed determined to fight racial discrimination, even if he was not yet sure how to do it.  King was attracted to Coretta in no small part because her experience as an activist exceeded his own. Thirteen years later, however, she expressed frustration with her limited role in the civil rights movement.  “My husband feels it important that one parent remain at home to give them [the children] security,” she told a reporter in Seattle. “But I would like to make a more complete witness by marching, and, if necessary, going to jail.”  Martin, on the other hand, almost never spent time home alone with the children when Coretta traveled. Instead, the Kings relied on friends and family to watch Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice. In a memoir written years later, Coretta recalled a conversation in which she told Martin she wanted to take a more active role in the movement:  During one exchange, he told me, “You see, I am called [by God], and you aren’t.”  I responded, “I have always felt that I have a call on my life, too. “I’ve been called by God, too, to do something [. . .]”  Still not convinced, Martin turned to me and said, “Well, somebody has to take care of the kids.”  “No problem,” I said. “I will do that.”  Looking a bit crushed, he asked, “You aren’t totally happy being my wife and the mother of my children, are you?”  “I love being your wife and the mother of your children,” I said. “But if that’s all I am to do, I’ll go crazy.”  During a 1965 television interview conducted at his home, King was asked if he had educated his wife on matters of activism. “Well, it may have been the other way around,” he said. “I think at many points she educated me. When I met her, she was very concerned about all the things we are trying to do now. . . I wish I could say to satisfy my masculine ego that I led her down this path, but I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved when we met as she is now.”  James Karales for Look magazine / Library of Congress King at home with family, 563 Johnson Avenue, Atlanta, fall 1962  The Feminine Mystique, written by Betty Friedan, had been published in 1963 and remained enormously popular in 1965, describing the widespread dissatisfaction among American women, and encouraging them to declare: “I want something more than my husband and my children and my home.” At one point in 1965, Coretta began working on an essay for the first issue of a magazine called New Lady, a publication that billed itself as “the Negro woman’s guide to a new way of life.” By the time she finished, the article ran to thirteen pages of text and photos. Coretta must have been proud of it because she mailed a copy to Rosa Parks. “Women have been the backbone of the whole civil rights movement,” Coretta wrote in the article. “Women have . . . made it possible for the movement to be a mass movement.” It was a simple fact, but nevertheless an overlooked one.  In Montgomery, Parks had sparked the bus boycott and Jo Ann Robinson and the Women’s Political Council had launched it. Aurelia Browder, Claudette Colvin, Susie McDonald, and Mary Louise Smith had served as plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court decision that desegregated the city’s buses. Ella Baker had long served as one of the movement’s best organizers. Diane Nash had helped initiate the Freedom Rides and cofounded SNCC. Septima Clark and Fannie Lou Hamer had led the push for voter registration in much of the Deep South. And then there were countless women such as Coretta Scott King and Juanita Abernathy who endured many of the same perils as their husbands while receiving little credit for their work, work that included not only marching and organizing but also taking care of children, filling in for their husbands, and advising their spouses on matters of strategy, leadership, and politics. In addition to the other challenges, Coretta Scott King ran her household on a modest budget, because her husband insisted that most of the income from his speeches and writings go to the SCLC.  In her article for New Lady, Coretta offered her clearest explanation of how she navigated a path that left many ambitious women of the 1960s feeling lost and angry. Over and over, she returned to the themes of compromise and perseverance. She began: “While my husband was being prepared for the job that he is doing, I feel that I was being prepared also to be the helpmate… I feel very strongly that it was meant to be this way.”  At Antioch College, as she recalled in the article, she had insisted on doing her student teaching in the Yellow Springs Public Schools, along with her white classmates. But the Yellow Springs schools were segregated, and Antioch officials wanted her to travel nine miles to an integrated school in Xenia, Ohio. She “felt like crying” when her teachers and classmates refused to support her. “Then I thought, ‘I am a Negro and I am going to be a Negro the rest of my life. I just can’t let this kind of thing get me down . . . I’ll have to accept this.’ . . . So I made the compromise,” she wrote.  She accepted even worse, according to Hosea Williams, who said that he witnessed King’s cruel treatment of Coretta on more than one occasion. “ ‘Shut up and go ahead in the back room!’ ” Williams said he heard Martin yell at Coretta. “She would get up quietly and go on back. Martin had told her many times.”  Williams was a frequent critic of Coretta, but if the men in the SCLC dismissed King’s wife, the women admired her. They saw a woman fighting to balance her dedication to her family and her causes. Xernona Clayton, an SCLC staff member from Atlanta who traveled at times with Coretta, said she was always impressed by Coretta’s calm determination. For Coretta to leave Atlanta and perform a concert, she not only had to rehearse, arrange her travel, and promote her appearances but also had to make sure the children would be cared for in her absence. Before leaving, she would type a list of meals for the week, including desserts. Even when she was on the road, without consulting notes or a calendar, Coretta knew when the children had doctors’ appointments, piano lessons, and haircuts, Clayton said, and Coretta checked in frequently to make sure nothing was forgotten.  “Coretta Scott King was a disciplinarian,” wrote her son Dexter, “took no guff from hers or any others. Froze you with a look.”  Carole Hoover, another SCLC staff member, said it was clear that Dr. King respected and relied on his wife’s opinion when it came to high-level questions of strategy. “She was very much engaged with those things that were important to him,” Hoover said. “He genuinely valued her thinking.” People in the office heard rumors about King’s infidelity, and specifically about his relationship with Dorothy Cotton. “That rumor floated several times,” Hoover said. “I don’t think Coretta ever bought into that.”  But others in the SCLC did buy into it. When King returned to Atlanta from one of his frequent trips, he usually went to Cotton’s home before going to his own house, said Stoney Cooks, an SCLC staff member. It was understood within the organization that the relationship had been going on for years. “Only the people who were very close to him even knew about it,” Cooks said, and Cotton “didn’t flaunt it.”  Nevertheless, the women of the SCLC saw Coretta and Dr. King as powerful partners, said Edwina Smith Moss. “They didn’t profess to be perfect, and Coretta was such an asset to Dr. King,” Moss recalled. “She was strong, and she came out of the South . . . If Dr. King ever wanted to quit, she wouldn’t have let him. She was not fearful. If she had been, it would’ve shown . . . She understood the FBI wanted to break them up . . . Coretta had steel. Coretta had a sense of the movement. You couldn’t have done that without a real sense of the movement. She was the power behind the throne . . . She was not the person to break. If she was going to have a battle, it was going to be with Dr. King, and it was not going to be in public . . .”  “It is a great temptation,” Coretta wrote, “to demand more of my husband’s attention. We women are like that. But I have had to realize that he belongs to the world and therefore cannot be the same kind of husband and father that he would like to be.” Doing her part for the cause of freedom, she said, included explaining to the children why their father went to jail and why he wasn’t home as much as other fathers and why, sometimes, he didn’t come home when the family expected him. “I have considered my own role very important from the beginning,” she wrote.  The assassination of President Kennedy frightened her, Coretta wrote. The assassination of Malcolm X frightened her more. She felt stuck, “weak and depressed,” after Malcolm’s death. She reminded herself, she wrote, that she and her husband and all humans were coworkers with God, building a world of peace and love. As she concluded in her article: “When you decide to give yourself to a great cause, you must arrive at the point where no sacrifice is too great. This is the first demand that is made of us in our great struggle for civil rights. I shall stand with Martin Luther King, Jr., my husband, as he faces them.”  Throughout the spring and summer, King hustled from speech to speech, interview to interview, city to city, protest to protest, until August 6, 1965, when he arrived in Washington, D.C., to meet with President Johnson and witness Johnson’s signature of the Voting Rights Act. Joining King were Roy Wilkins, James Farmer, and Rosa Parks, among others. Coretta King watched the ceremony on television. She was home taking care of Marty and Dexter, who had both had their tonsils removed. Martin had been so busy that Coretta had never found time to tell him about the scheduled surgeries. It was one of the few occasions, she wrote years later, when she felt sorry for herself.  “I felt very supportive of his being there,” she wrote, “but I also had this feeling of being alone, of being entirely by myself.”  Later that day, outside the White House, five hundred people protested U.S. policies in Vietnam. King made no public comment on the anti-war demonstration. His focus was on the historic new law, which, he said, would “go a long way toward removing all the obstacles to the right to vote.”  It was, he told reporters, as he prepared to fly home to Atlanta, “a shining moment.”  Adapted from Eig’s biography King: A Life published by Farrar Straus & Giroux  Contact us at letters@time.com.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjI4MDMwMi9tYXJ0aW4tbHV0aGVyLWtpbmctanItbWFycmlhZ2UtY29yZXR0YS1zY290dC1raW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""Film is a powerful mass media where history is being preserved in its every frame ...and that's why film archieve is necessary for the country for understanding the history, tradition and culture of a particular nation"", he said.    The Information and Broadcasting Secretary made this comment while attending as the chief guest at a function organised by BFA marking its 45th founding anniversary of Bangladesh Film Archive in city's Agargaon.  Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had a dream to set up a film archive in the country and he had taken necessary steps in this regard in January, 1975, the secretary told the function.  But the initiative was halted after the brutal assassination of Bangabandhu on August 15 in 1975, he added.  Describing the incumbent Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as a cinema loving personality, the information secretary said the present film archive has been set up due to the personal initiative of Sheikh Hasina.  About the importance of the film archive, the information secretary said ""Bangladesh Film Archive now has got a complete shape and there is more opportunity to make it better, adding ""Since the Liberation War is our great achievement ..Bangladesh Film Archive will have to collect and preserve all the audio-visual documents of the Liberation War to enrich its importance.""  Former Director General of Bangladesh Film Archive and former Information and Broadcasting Secretary Kamrun Nahar, Additional secretary (film) of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Dr M Jahangir Alam and noted cultural personality Syed Salauddin Jaki also spoke on the occasion.

"assassination","1865-04-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 18:00:53","Funnily enough, Allan Pinkerton spent little of his time as a detective, even though the term “private eye” is based on his logo. Most of what he did was espionage. With, you know, a little union-busting, as a treat. Still, he clinched the concept of a private detective outside the realm of the hired thug. Even though, yeah, Pinkerton agents are also hired thugs; just ask the person Wizards of the Coast sent Pinkertons after recently. But Allan Pinkerton did also thwart assassination plots against Lincoln before his inauguration, so that’s a net positive, at least?  In fact, the first fictional detective predates the public familiarity with Pinkerton. Charles Dickens created Mr. Nadgett in Martin Chuzzlewit, which I have not read on the grounds of hating Dickens and almost all of his works. Still, the golden era of pop culture fiction is the mid-twentieth century, definitely post-Pinkerton, and “private eye” is a phrase that gets used a lot. Whether it’s Sam Spade, James Rockford, or Kinsey Milhone, they’re all private eyes. And pop culture is full of them, of many varying types.  The first one to come to mind for most people is the hard-boiled. Your Sam Spade, your Philip Marlowe, your Mike Hammer. Tough men—they’re men—who drink a lot and are always on the verge of bankruptcy and generally have a secretary they sexually harass in some way. Probably there is a set of Venetian blinds in their office. They will almost certainly be shot at, if not actually shot, at least once in any given case. The bodies will just keep piling up.  At about the same time, we got a lot of Gentleman Detectives. (Also generally men.) Your Lord Peter Wimsey, your Hercule Poirot, your Nero Wolfe. Some of these were not officially set up as detectives and just kind of tripped into a lot of cases, but also there were some who had fancy apartments and were hired by expensive people. Nero Wolfe has a staff—enough so that he almost never leaves the brownstone. Though a lot of Gentleman Detectives were also globetrotters; how many countries did Hercule Poirot solve cases in?  Starting in about the ‘70s, you also got what is kind of the response to the two classic types. Jim Rockford, obviously—he’s hard-boiled, but in a more modern way. He’s got a bit of sensitivity. No secretary at all, because he can’t afford one, and he gets clients based on his ad in the phone book. It’s as though everyone realized there’s room for variety. You can have, say, a man in very short shorts who’s basically a rich man’s pool boy. You can have a man with crippling Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. You can have the man who’s slipping into the life of a fictional character.  Who, in fact, was created by a woman in-universe, because that’s an extension of where detectives could go. Nancy Drew isn’t the first of the female detective characters, but she’s a good start. But as late as 1982, Laura Holt invented a male boss because no one wanted to hire a woman. (Which the first Enola Holmes book plays with, I discovered this week.) Yes, there’s Miss Marple, who’s kind of in the Gentleman Detective range—the Little Old Lady equivalent, along with Jessica Fletcher and others. Phryne Fisher, who predates the hard-boiled men on the timeline, inasmuch as she’s in the ‘20s, but who is a modern addition to the genre.  And, of course, there’s more than just white dudes. You’ve got Easy Rawlins, John Shaft, and Precious Ramotswe. And all of those are just in the English-speaking world; if you expand out of that, you’ve got dozens, if not hundreds. The private detective has a lot of choices. From Adrian Monk to Veronica Mars and beyond. You’ve got Harry Dresden, private detective/wizard. You’ve got Jessica Jones, private detective/superhero. Dirk Gently, private detective/whatever he needs to be on a given day. Fiction’s full of them, and they just keep going. Ask Benoit Blanc.

Referring to steps in establishing democracy and voting rights, and reforming the electoral system, Hasina said those who were once vote riggers are now vocal about democracy and voting rights in the country.  The AL chief asked her party not to take such political rhetoric seriously, and advised them to stay beside the people, work for them to change their fortune and thus maintain people's trust and confidence in their party.

"assassination","2023-05-09","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:21:00","Those saying Israel's latest assault in Gaza was just a bleeding exercise in futility fail to understand the real purpose behind it.  Polls released by major Israeli channels after the ceasefire, which was signed on Saturday night, prove beyond doubt the operation achieved its main goal from the government’s perspective: the popularity of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition was on the rise.  Netanyahu was trailing in polls to his opposition rivals days before the bombing campaign, dubbed “Operation Shield and Arrow”, was launched on 9 May with a series of overnight assassinations.  Five days of Gaza bleeding - in which 33 Palestinians, including six children, were killed - and the ongoing bleeding of Netanyahu’s coalition was miraculously cured. Mission accomplished.  Netanyahu has restored his image as “Mr Security” - not the ailing prime minister accused of leading his country into a dictatorship with his government’s controversial judicial overhaul plan.  Stay informed with MEE's newsletters Sign up to get the latest alerts, insights and analysis, starting with Turkey Unpacked  “The only achievement of this military operation is the security of Netanyahu’s coalition,” Zehava Gal-On, former head of the leftist Meretz party, told Middle East Eye.  'In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them' - Daniel Rothschild, head of Israeli think tank  Strangely enough, this miraculous recovery has nothing to do with how Israelis feel about the outcome of the five-day assault.  A poll conducted by Channel 12 a day after the ceasefire showed that 42 percent of respondents believed the operation strengthened Israeli deterrence.  Around 44 percent believed it made no difference and five percent thought it made it worse.  This indifference is echoed by politicians on both sides of the spectrum.  Members of the coalition, both from Netayhu’s Likud party and his allies in the far-right Religious Zionism party, sound unhappy with how the operation ended. They wanted more.  The same goes for Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the opposition right-wing Yisrael Beytenu party, who blamed Netanyahu for creating a “Hezbollah in the south” by not attacking Hamas, the Palestinian group which rules over Gaza.  On the left, politicians repeated the same knee-jerk reaction of non-judgmental support for the attacks.  Labor MP Efrat Rayten, for example, was more worried about how it was going to be “difficult to explain” the images of children killed in Israel’s air strikes, rather than questioning the purpose behind the bloodshed.  No vision for Gaza  In Israel, the very same people who doubt the merit and logic of the operation once it ends are the ones who support it as it unfolds - and politically reward Netanyahu for launching it.  And there’s very little reasonable explanation behind this.  Perhaps it’s not fair to expect reason from people who follow a leadership that lacks any meaningful logical or moral considerations.  Gaza: How this 85-year-old Palestinian experienced two Nakbas Read More »  After all, what do you expect of a military and political establishment that refers to the killing of Palestinian children as “collateral damage”?  But many in Israel have learned that after almost 20 years of 15 futile “operations”, a blockade, mass killings, “targeted eliminations,” and the destruction of Gaza - along with thousands of rockets fired into Israel’s south and centre in response - this is not the answer.  However, no one offers an alternative, and more bloodshed seems to be the only option.  Those same people who support the operation know that the next one is just around the corner. They know that the Islamic Jihad “senior leaders” that Israel assassinated will be replaced quickly.  “In the absence of any strategy, all Israelis can expect is more rounds of violence with shorter breaks between them,” said Daniel Rothschild, head of the Institute for Policy and Strategy think tank and former military general.  “As long as Netanyahu applies his tactical approach of divide and rule between Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza - effectively weakening one and strengthening the other - and unless they come up with a holistic strategy that includes both the West Bank and Gaza, we are doomed to have more tactical rounds coming one after another,” Rothschild told MEE.  People react following an Israeli air strike in Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip, on 13 May 2023 (NurPhoto via Reuters)  His views are shared by Yair Golan, the Israeli military's former deputy chief of staff and now a politician with the left-wing Meretz party.  “What have we gained from this operation? Nothing,” Golan told MEE two days into the ceasefire.  Since Israel unilaterally “disengaged” from Gaza in 2005, pulling out troops and settlements that were in the strip since it was occupied in 1967, little has changed in the strip, he added.  The military presence was replaced by an air, land and sea blockade, which turned the densely populated enclave into the largest “open-air prison”, according to human rights groups.  The military also launched repeated operations in Gaza from 2006 onwards, killing more than 6,000 Palestinians in less than two decades.  Under Netanyahu’s leadership, this policy has meant that Israel is effectively working against its interests by weakening the PA and strengthening Hamas, Golan argued, keeping the region ""stuck in an endless confrontation"".  The deterrence equation  The declared aim of the latest assault was the Islamic Jihad, the second biggest armed group in Gaza behind Hamas.  This is the third time since 2019 that the group has been singled out in attacks by Israel in which Hamas was not targeted.  Despite widespread speculation, Hamas - which has a much bigger arsenal than the Islamic Jihad - did not publicly confirm if they joined other armed groups in launching retaliatory rockets at Israel.  During a visit two days after the assault to Ashkelon, one of the cities that came under heavy rocket fire, Netanyahu hailed the success of the operation.  He said it ""changed the deterrence equation"" with armed groups in Gaza - an assertion dismissed by Golan.  ""Once again, we just bought time, limited time. How long?"" he asked, arguing that the question on whether Hamas joined the fighting or not was irrelevant.  “Hamas was in no rush to reach a ceasefire. They offered the Islamic Jihad moral support and probably arms and weapons as well,"" he explained.  Cracks in the protests?  Another collateral damage of the five days of bloodshed in Gaza might be the months-long mass protest movement against Netanyahu's “regime change”.  Since January, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been rallying weekly against a judicial overhaul proposal presented by the government which critics say will weaken the country's judiciary.  In late March, Netanyahu postponed the plan amid widespread strikes and protests. He said he wanted to give room for talks with the opposition in the hopes of reaching a consensus regarding the plan.  No progress has been made in the discussions so far, and the issue is expected to come back to the fore of Israeli politics by the end of May once the state budget is passed.  Gaza: Israel's unity over new aggression won't last Read More »  The common struggle against what many views as a pending dictatorship seemed to unite Israelis otherwise divided by many schisms in the relentless demonstrations from January until now.  But that might change after the Gaza assault.  One of the leading groups in the demonstrations, Brothers in Arms, a grouping of reservists, was quick to publish a poster in support of the “brothers in arms” bombing Gaza - a statement that drew the ire of others in the protests movement.  Another dominant protest group, Black Flags, decided to cancel the weekly demonstration last Saturday as the fighting was still unfolding, an announcement ignored by some protesters who showed up to the rallies anyway.  These could be small cracks in the thin armour of Israeli opposition solidarity that can be easily fixed. Or they could be the beginning of a crisis: war with Palestinians could see many in the opposition camp rally around national ""defence"" and break the momentum of protests.  For Netanyahu's government, this could be the big collateral benefit of his bombing campaign.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pZGRsZWVhc3RleWUubmV0L25ld3MvaXNyYWVsLWdhemEtYXNzYXVsdC13aW5zLW5vdGhpbmctbmV0YW55YWh10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Winchester"", ""Nevada"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:53:04","Gotham Knights has the lowest budget of any superhero show on The CW.  By TeeJay Small |  Not all studios can tout the seemingly endless budget of Marvel or Star Wars projects, despite sharing intellectual property with some of the biggest names in modern media. For the CW network, series such as The Flash and Stargirl have long been criticized for their low CGI budget, failing to live up to the standards of their box office blockbuster counterparts such as Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League. According to a recent write-up in The Hollywood Reporter, The CW’s latest effort to bring Gotham City to life, Gotham Knights, has the lowest budget of any DC series ever produced by the network and still may face cancellation.  As the ongoing Writers Guild of America strike begins to loom over the industry, many networks are looking to cut costs. For the CW, this means gutting a number of their scripted series and pivoting to more unscripted content, with shows like The Winchesters and Kung Fu each getting the axe this past week. Despite touting such incredibly low budgeting numbers to produce, Gotham Knights seems to be next on the chopping block, as the series continues to bring in less viewing traffic than its sister series Superman and Lois.  Gotham Knights centers around a socio-political firestorm kicked off by the aftermath of Batman‘s untimely death. Without the Dark Knight himself to instill fear in the hearts of the city’s most dangerous felons, the city quickly devolves into chaos, leaving District Attorney Harvey Dent and a band of mismatched fugitives to attempt to keep the city from boiling over while investigating the true nature of Bruce Wayne’s assassination. The series is currently in the final weeks of airing its first season, with the last two episodes set to hit the small screen on Tuesday, May 23, and Tuesday, May 30, respectively.  Despite this news being reported to The Hollywood Reporter from a close source, many fans have already been made aware of the staggeringly low budget for Gotham Knights simply by watching the show. A tertiary glance at fan engagement on a number of online platforms such as Twitter and Instagram reveals dozens, potentially hundreds of critiques of the show’s costuming, props, and failure to secure more convincing shooting locations. While most television shows utilize movie magic to cover up their shortcomings, it seems that Gotham Knights lacks the budget to do even that.  Gotham Knights seems to serve as a cautionary tale for networks like The CW amid growing concerns that other entertainment unions, such as the Directors Guild and IATSE, may soon engage in a strike as well, proving the age-old adage that “you get what you pay for.” By seemingly trying to save money by skimping on production costs and overall quality, the network has actually lost money by failing to entice viewers to flock to the show.  If Gotham Knights does wind up getting canceled in the coming weeks, it surely speaks more to studio failure than it does to the general public’s gauged interest in Batman and Batman-adjacent projects. Though film outings such as Matt Reeves’ Batman and Todd Phillips’ Joker sport significantly higher budgets than the average CW television show, both films serve as contemporary examples that stories told in the setting of Gotham can and will attract huge viewing numbers if you’re willing to put in the time, effort, and money to make them worth exploring.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpYW50ZnJlYWtpbnJvYm90LmNvbS8_cD01MTgzNDnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1983-06-22","Not Discerned","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:29:46","After the Vatican opened an investigation last December and the Italian parliament is currently considering its own probe, the city of Rome too has announced a new inquest into the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, at the time the 15-year-old daughter of an employee of the Prefecture of the Papal Household whose family lived in a Vatican apartment.  Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYW5nZWx1c25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdmF0aWNhbi92YXRpY2FuLWNvb3BlcmF0ZXMtcm9tZS1vcmxhbmRpLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9hbmdlbHVzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy92YXRpY2FuL3ZhdGljYW4tY29vcGVyYXRlcy1yb21lLW9ybGFuZGktaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1968-04-04","Not Discerned","{""Memphis"", ""Tennessee"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:19:47","PVAMU’s 8th President to Spring 2023 Graduating Class: ‘Remember the dream of MLK and the courage of Rosa Parks to use your voice.’  PRAIRIE VIEW, Texas (May 17, 2023) – Ruth J. Simmons, Prairie View A&M University’s eighth president, still remembers when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. The news was a shock and a turning point for her. Facing challenges and difficulties as a college student herself at an HBCU decades ago, she shared about wanting to quit.  The death of MLK, however, woke her up.  “I felt unworthy to complain about picayune inconveniences when one so dedicated to making the world better for me was willing to give his life,” Dr. Simmons shared at the PVAMU’s 141st Spring Commencement Convocation on May 13. “So, I renewed my commitment to do what I could in my turn to make a better world.”  Simmons, immediate past president of PVAMU, returned to campus Saturday morning to give an impassioned speech to over 1,000 candidates for graduation. She acknowledged the “perils of the present moment” facing the graduating class who had already faced so much in the last few years alone.  “You leave this place at a moment when we’re all reckoning with unimaginable events that point to the confused state of the polity,” she told an enraptured audience. They are embarking into the world at a time when “hard-fought rights are being re-litigated.” She, nevertheless, encouraged them of their place and purpose in such a world: “I, for one, am confident that through your intelligence, your generosity, your open-mindedness, and your tolerance, you are prepared to play an important role in healing this nation.”  The 2023 class has overcome so much more than the typical college graduate of the past: a global pandemic, post-pandemic uncertainty, racial and social upheaval, economic instability, historic inflation, and an ongoing war in Ukraine, disrupting daily life worldwide.  At times emotional, tissues clutched in hand, Simmons, who stepped down earlier this spring, spoke about her undiminishing love for the University and her abiding faith in its students.  She highlighted their courage, endurance, and resilience: “Having come through this difficult period, your intelligence and your character have been tested. Your adaptability and fortitude have held up, and you stayed on the path to this achievement that we celebrate today.”  But above all, she urged them to remember. “Remember your freedom and the opportunities you enjoy have been purchased at a great cost. You owe to those who came before you and those who will follow you the obligation to pay attention, to speak up for access, and to do all you can to ensure that the freedoms we enjoy today are preserved and enhanced.”  Graduating, she said, is more than tossing your cap into the air on graduation day or hanging the framed diploma on the wall for all to see. “Don’t just do that. Remembering the burden of being educated, raise your voice. Raise it in defiance of those who’ve returned this country to 19th-century ideas and biases,” Simmons told the audience to thunderous applause.  Let the history of Prairie View further inspire you, she told them. “Let your conduct reflect the amazingly courageous history of this place.” Be true to yourself and hold strong to your values, not forgetting where you come from or who you are, Simmons advised. “Having studied here, you carry with you a stronger sense than most of what could be lost if we give in to the forces of darkness,” she said. “Those who benefit from the bravery of pioneers who removed barriers to freedom and opportunity do not get a free pass.”  Perhaps like the 1968 assassination of MLK, the 2020 murder of George Floyd may alight this next generation graduating into a precipice of a world on edge. Simmons charged graduates: “It is your turn to stand up, to insist on equal rights for all and defy those who would debase and violate the rights of others.”  Despite thundering storms delaying the ceremony and forcing it to be relocated to the University’s “Baby Dome,” 1,008 students walked the stage. And despite the challenges of the last four years, PVAMU awarded 837 bachelor’s, 153 master’s, and 18 doctorates. In addition, nearly one-third of undergraduate graduates identified themselves as first-generation college students.  This spring, PVAMU also produced its biggest class of doctoral candidates, thanks to various University measures, such as recruiting more highly qualified faculty for tenured and tenure-track and increasing tuition and fee support, James M. Palmer, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, said in a press release.  This semester’s notable graduates include Jordan Poston, known as “Mr. Senior” from Dallas, who is headed to a Fortune Global 500 company. Another Spring 2023 grad, Zian Richmond, is a criminal justice major who graduated a year early and is headed to law school. Houston native Morgan Redd join the MD Anderson Cancer Center as an oncology stem cell transplant nurse.  Simmons did not doubt the graduating students’ abilities and potential to reach the highest heights. However, she called on them to go beyond professional goals and career aspirations to become the next frontiers who change the world.  “Those who came before you at Prairie View, who fought for your rights, now speak to you across the ages,” Simmons said. “Can you hear them?” The crowd of thousands sat in silence, listening. “Listen to their voices and contemplate their good works. This nourishment gives you the courage beyond what you thought you possessed.”  Where would we be today, she posed, without the dream of MLK and the courage of Rosa Parks? “You’ve been truly privileged to have the education that others’ efforts afforded you,” Simmons said. “Now, go. And make it mean something. Use your voice.”  By Christine Won  PVAMU Commencement Statistics (Spring 2023)  Number of degrees (by college/school)  College of Agriculture and Human Sciences: 58  School of Architecture: 59  Marvin D. and June Samuel Brailsford College of Arts and Sciences: 237  College of Business: 150  Whitlowe R.

"assassination","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 15:17:45","The international community and Tunisians alike have condemned the sentencing as another authoritarian move by President Kais Saied, but experts predict that the sentencing will result in neither sanctions nor mass unrest  A senior leader of the Tunisian opposition, former Speaker of Parliament Rached Ghannouchi, was sentenced to a year in prison on Monday on charges of supporting terrorism and inciting violence.  Ghannouchi, who leads the Islamic democratic Ennahda party, was arrested last month. He denies the charges. The international community has condemned the arrest as another authoritarian act by Tunisia’s President Kais Saied.  A press statement from the US State Department last month said that the arrest of Ghannouchi and other political opponents represents “a troubling escalation by the Tunisian government against perceived opponents.”  Foreign Minister of Germany Annalena Baerbock told reporters that she was very concerned about Ghannouchi’s arrest and that the “democratic achievements in Tunisia since 2011 must not be lost.”  The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011 led Tunisia to become a democracy. In 2021, Saied issued an emergency declaration dismissing the government and suspending the parliament. He ruled by decree for about a year until a new constitution was approved in 2022 that concentrated power in the hands of the president. Saied’s government has become increasingly authoritarian since then.  Alice Gower, director of geopolitics and security at the Azure Strategy advisory firm, told The Media Line that Saied has consistently used arrests of high-ranking politicians to fend off potential threats. Ghannouchi’s sentencing “is yet another example of the repressive nature of the Saied government,” she said.  She noted that the international community’s relative silence on the issue has led to “what has been perceived as tacit indifference to what goes on in Tunis.”  Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed  Hamish Kinnear, a Middle East and North Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, said that Ghannouchi’s prison sentence will spark outrage among supporters of the Ennahda party but is unlikely to inspire significant unrest in the country.  “Ghannouchi is popular among the Ennahda party faithful, but his reputation among the population at large is more mixed,” he told The Media Line.  Kinnear said that Ennahda was part of several post-revolution governments that failed to deliver economic prosperity. The party was also accused of involvement in the assassination of two popular secular politicians in 2013. Although party representatives have consistently denied the accusations, “many leftist Tunisians hold Ennahda responsible,” Kinnear said.  Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness.  Similarly, Gower said both Ghannouchi and his party “have faced waning popularity for failure to embrace the younger generation and address the country’s economic plight.”  She said that Ghannouchi’s sentencing will increase the sense of instability in Tunisia, aggravating the country’s economic distress.  “Saied has already isolated international donors and investors due to his erratic policies. The country’s economic woes are now so dire that it needs financial support from elsewhere, despite Saied’s claims to be working to avoid indebtedness,” Gower said.  Although Western governments have expressed alarm at the arrest of Ghannouchi and other opposition figures, Kinnear said that it is unlikely that governments would turn to sanctions or a halt to economic aid, since such measures “would risk undermining Tunisia’s political stability.”  He explained that the Biden Administration is currently lobbying for Tunisia to secure an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan and sign up for a program of structural reforms that could resuscitate its struggling economy. The work currently being done to stabilize Tunisia makes it unlikely that the US would do anything that might push “the country closer to the economic abyss,” he said.  Gower said that the chaos currently going on in Tunisia is the result of the international community’s ongoing refusal to intervene. She called on the US, a major supplier of aid to Tunisia and central figure in the IMF, to “demand answers and change before authorizing further military aid and the rollout of an IMF loan program.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWVkaWFsaW5lLm9yZy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy90dW5pc2lhcy10b3Atb3Bwb3NpdGlvbi1maWd1cmUtc2VudGVuY2VkLXRvLWEteWVhci1pbi1wcmlzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Such a law, signed a few months after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, allowed large estates´ belongings to local landowners to be delivered to rural workers who have received other benefits denied until then, such as access to healthcare, education, and housing.  The Agrarian Reform and a series of measures taken by the new Cuban government marked the beginning of the country’s economic recovery, which plunged into rural precariousness due to the obsolete production systems.  The date also recalls the assassination of peasant leader Niceto Pérez on May 17, 1946, in the hands of landowners in Guantánamo´s mountain region, some 950 kilometers from Havana.  In that historical context and due to the organization’s results in the Cuban countryside, the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) was founded on a similar date in 1961.  President Miguel Díaz-Canel recognized the role of that agricultural force in satisfying the population’s needs and reducing dependence on foreign markets through the proper use of their lands.  jrr/iff/oda/lld","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsZW5nbGlzaC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2N1YmEtY2VsZWJyYXRlcy1mYXJtZXJzLWRheS1hbmQtZmlyc3QtYWdyYXJpYW4tcmVmb3JtLWxhdy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-01","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 02:45:12","“Justice is what the judge ate for breakfast.” — Jerome Frank, legal realist philosopher  SIX recent judicial orders — one order of the Supreme Court and five orders of the Islamabad High Court — in two days (May 11 and May 12), restraining the authorities from arresting Imran Khan, has converted the PDM-PPP government into hard core legal realists of the kind captured by the quote above. These judicial orders have also, post-facto, reaffirmed the alleged correctness of the sole legal and judicial strategy of the government’s legal team: whenever you lose a case partly due to your own incompetence, tell everyone that the judge has been influenced.  But is the PDM-PPP government correct in its judicial fairytale analysis that these allegedly ‘defective’ judicial orders are the result of an alleged bias in favour of Imran Khan? Or is Imran Khan correct in constructing his alternative judicial fairytale analysis that these decisions are strictly a product of the application of the Constitution and the law, without any extraneous influences and predispositions?  The paradox: After over 100 registered cases, an assassination attempt, assaults on his home, the large-scale prosecution of PTI leaders and workers, a proxy case seeking his political disqualification on the non-disclosure of his alleged daughter, Tyrian White, and even a case questioning his nikah, can anyone seriously doubt that Imran Khan is the subject of systemic political vendetta and state repression?  If we are honest enough to admit these facts then what is so legally extraordinary about the relief of no-arrest and protective bail, for a very limited period only, granted by the SC and IHC to Imran Khan? The government cannot seriously challenge the legality of these six judicial orders for two main reasons.  Firstly, the SC order dated May 11, 2023, was passed by a three-member bench which also included Justice Athar Minallah. Is the government now alleging that even Justice Minallah is ‘biased’, someone whom the government only recently celebrated as a great dissenting SC judge? Secondly, no serious lawyer or legal scholar can question the legality of such limited and temporary no-arrest relief by the SC and IHC.  Therefore, the main focus of their critique has been on the extraordinary speed and generosity of this legally correct relief — this speed and generosity, they allege, tends to show bias in favour of Imran Khan. Therefore, the apparent paradox of how such judicial relief can be both legally and constitutionally correct but might exhibit alleged bias needs to be explained.  Most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law.  Beyond fairytales: In periods of relative democratic rule in Pakistan, even in highly politicised cases, most judges cannot escape the constraints imposed by the Constitution and the law. But this is subject to the two caveats of contested interpretations and judicial discretion.  Both the Constitution and the law allow judges to adopt differing judicial interpretations of the Constitution and the law, and thus also allow judges enough judicial discretion to either deny or grant judicial relief to individuals in similar circumstances. This ‘undefined space’ created by differing interpretations and judicial discretion is filled with fear, desires and visions which judges experience and express in their judicial role.  As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes observed: “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy … even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men…”.  Judicial interpretations and discretion, although controlled by the Constitution and the law, are also influenced by the fear of losing judicial power or privileges, by judicial desires and visions coloured by their political and social views and class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Like all of us, judges are also human beings.  Fear, desires and visions: Two key judicial cases document both the acceptance and denial of the Pakistani judge’s apprehension of the coercive power of the state. Firstly, the contempt case against retired Gen Mirza Aslam Beg (1993), where it was alleged that he had sent a message to the SC not to restore the dissolved National Assembly of the Junejo government. Gen Beg recanted and the SC went into denial.  Secondly, the challenge to the Eighth Constitutional Amendment recorded in the Mahmood Achakzai case (1997). In this case, Justice Saleem Akhtar records the admission of Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada that he had, by implication, threatened CJP Anwar-ul-Haq with his removal as CJP if Gen Zia was not given the power to amend the Constitution.  After recording this damning admission, the SC slumbered in silence. These are actual cases of interference, but generally, there is apprehension among judges of the tremendous coercive power of the state, especially the deep state. No wonder, the cases of missing persons have witnessed judicial silence, with former CJP Iftikhar Chaudhry and former CJ Athar Minallah and the IHC being exceptions.  Moreover, judges, while interpreting the Constitution, which is replete with political ideology and values, appear to act like applied political theorists, as David Robertson explains in his book Judges as Political Theorists. Political and social views influence judicial desires and visions, which in turn structure legal interpretations. Isn’t the US supreme court publicly perceived as being composed of bitterly divided Republican and Democratic judges?  Also, judges are influenced by their class, gender and geographical backgrounds. Can anyone deny that the rich and middle classes have a better chance of getting much speedier relief than the poor? Further, one of the differences between the judicial interpretation of Article 63A of the Constitution, by Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail might stem from their geographical origins. A judge from Balochistan might show more sympathy in giving politicians the benefit of the doubt.  The key is not to wish for super human judges without predispositions but for greater judicial accountability and transparency to expose biases and a more representative judiciary which represents our (all too human) predispositions.

"assassination","1983-10-19","Not Discerned","{""WoundedKnee"", ""SouthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 22:08:00","by Nuri Muhammad  BELIZE CITY, Mon. May 15, 2023  In 1956, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), J. Edgar Hoover, convinced US President Eisenhower of the ominous danger faced by Americans from homegrown dissidents, and justified the use of an undercover operation known as Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), “to suppress and destroy all radical subversives in the US”.  Historical records show that J. Edgar Hoover executed a series of covert, and often illegal, projects conducted by FBI agents, aimed at “investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations”. According to these records, “eighty-five percent of the resources of this program were expended on infiltrating, disrupting, marginalizing, and/or subverting groups suspected of being subversive; such as communist, socialist, militant black groups, women’s groups, civil rights groups and the American Indian Movement”. Hoover ordered his agents to “expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize” these groups. So paranoid was Hoover about these supposed internal enemies that he even saw Dr. Martin Luther King, a pacifist, as an enemy of the state, and therefore ordered wire taps and constant surveillance to keep an eye on Dr. King.  COINTELPRO had specific methodologies to reach its objective, one of which was the tried and tested tactic of turning ‘brother against brother’. They played on internal ego conflicts, whispering in the ear of contending brothers and exaggerating small things into big things; then supplied the weapons to murder when the arguments got out of control  We also learned from the records how they infiltrated the Nation of Islam (NOI) and were involved in the assassination of Malcolm X, the armed attack on the American Indian Movement at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, and the infiltration of the Black Panther Party (BPP) which resulted in the death of Bobby Hutton, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark. (For further research, use Google).  While COINTELPRO officially ended in 1971, suspicions persist that the program’s tactics continued informally and may have also been used in the Caribbean. Unlike the US, where the use of the Freedom of Information Act has provided their citizens access to documents which revealed information about US covert activity, in the Caribbean, unfortunately, no such access exists, despite Freedom of Information provisions in our laws.  We know that between 1968 and 1975 there was a revolutionary fervor running throughout the Caribbean. These groups were nationalistic, black, socialist, and a mixture of the educated and the grass-roots working together for a common purpose. To name a few, there were the Joint National Action Committee (NJAC) in Trinidad, New Jewel Movement (NJM)in Granada, Working Peoples Alliance (WPA) in Guyana, and the United Black Association for Development (UBAD) in Belize, with others in Jamaica, Antigua, and Barbados. These groups were not only of security interest to their respective governments, but also drew the attention of British and American intelligence.  According to the record, they used sleepers who posed as dedicated followers but were secretly agents of the US/UK intelligence network. These sleepers were sophisticated and very subtle in their execution of their scheme. They are the “whisperer” described in the Qur’an, who withdraws after his whisper, thereby making you think it was your idea. These agents from this intelligence network are very subtle, sometimes appearing as good advisors.  We know again from antidotal observation rather than recorded facts, that agents must have been involved in exaggerating the differences between Maurice Bishop and Bernard Corde which ultimately resulted in a faction, led by Corde, assassinating his friend and comrade, Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, on October 19, 1983. This was the power of the tactic of COINTELPRO to stop or suppress revolutionary movements as they rose in the west. Understanding that this strategy continues to be used to destroy black movements, we can better understand how the rift between Bishop and Corde occurred, which led to Bishop’s assassination, and ultimately created the enabling environment for the invasion of the US forces, which brought the New Jewel Movement government to an abrupt end.  In the case of Belize, it will take some ambitious young Belizean American, using the Freedom of Information Act in the US, to access some of the documents of embassy officials and CIA agents to see how Belize was being viewed by COINTELPRO in the late sixties, early seventies.  It’s not clear how the operation was unfolded in Belize, but the results tell us that there must have been some scheme afoot to exacerbate ego conflicts and splinter unity of action. How else could you explain how intelligent men like Norman Fairweather, Bert Franklin, Evan X Hyde, Roy Cayetano, Bert Tucker, Dr. Joe Palacio, Nuri Muhammad and so many others could go through the seventies and eighties, nineties, and now 23 years into the new century, and not have formed some kind of front to advance the cause which they all for so long have espoused?  How else could you explain this monumental failure of these intellectual activists to not forge something larger than themselves? These so-called cultural/nationalistic/religious leaders did not deliver a collective response to the problem. The horrible condition of young black males (Creole/Garifuna) in 2010, is our collective burden.  Clearly, we can’t blame the implosion of all these groups in the Caribbean to the machinations of British/American intelligence activities, because the endemic ego conflicts played an equally important role in our eventual demise. But one cannot discount the role of agents within these organizations in turning brother against brother. It worked in the Congo, Kenya, and Algeria and in the US with the NOI and the BPP.  Some say that, clearly, Black Power as defined by the radicals of the 60s and 70s has been defeated in the eyes of the US Justice Department and has been relegated to the dust bins of undercover programs, some dating back to the 1920’s. They say Black Power is no longer a national security concern, and there is no need to focus on the specter of “Black Power” anymore; “Black Power” is no longer a foundation or platform for social action in America. In fact, in Belize, “Black Power” is just a T-shirt fashion statement.  The new focus today is on narco-trafficking, money laundering, gun-running and human trafficking, but the biggest of them is the specter of radical Islam; therefore, Belize is filled with intelligence operatives who are not necessarily in the employ of the US Justice Department, yet they remain an essential source of information to the NSC.  There are the conscious agents and there are the un-conscious agents; we know what a conscious agent is about, but it’s the un-conscious agents that slip between the radar because they themselves don’t realize that they are inadvertently, agents of the intelligence network.  I remember interviewing former CIA agent Phillip Agee, in 1990, on KPFK Radio in Los Angeles. He was at one time stationed in Guatemala City and had some knowledge of the agency’s activities in Belize. He said that the CIA used a number of ways to assess a “point of interest” before executing any action. One way of assessing the climate of a target group is their public statements. Studying newspaper articles, editorials, op-eds, and monitoring radio talk shows is the major way the CIA assesses the climate in places like Belize. He said the CIA (and its British counterpart) may have tons of information gathered through its massive surveillance apparatus, but will only engage that information when the US or UK national security interest is threatened.

"assassination","2023-10-07","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:41:34","Original hospitals deal concessionaire, former Vitals Global Healthcare director Ram Tumuluri, has claimed in an official disclosure to the US authorities that he was threatened repeatedly by former Office of the Prime Minister chief of staff Keith Schembri and others that he would meet the same end as journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia if he didn’t sign the hospitals’ concession over to Steward Healthcare.  In a whistleblower complaint to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and shared with partners in Malta, The Shift and The Times of Malta, Tumuluri claims the threats were made by former Office of the Prime Minister Chief of Staff Keith Schembri, then-health minister Konrad Mizzi and one of the concession’s original brokers, Shaukat Ali, among others.  Tumuluri also says that former prime minister Joseph Muscat played a role in what Tumuluri claims was a forced handover of the concession to Steward for €1. Muscat denies being a part of such coercive tactics, which is contradicted by Tumuluri’s filing and affidavit. Schembri has also vociferously denied Tumuluri’s claims.  Tumuluri has also accused Steward Health Care of engaging in unlawful activity with the government of Malta and insists he only signed the concession over because he was made to fear for his life by government officials and others working on their behalf.  The 505-page complaint includes an affidavit from Tumuluri and hundreds of pages of supporting documents, such as internal emails, contracts and project plans.  He said they lasted through the period of her assassination that October until Tumuluri says he eventually caved into demands in December 2017 and signed the concession over because he feared his life and that of his family would be in danger if he didn’t.  Schembri, according to Tumuluri’s disclosure, warned him that “[he] is the law in Malta” and that no agreement could protect Tumuluri’s interest.  He allegedly warned that “if the government could silence a vocal reporter like Ms Caruana Galizia, Mr Tumuluri should be very careful not to make enemies with the government”.  ‘You want us to be a friend, not a foe’  Tumuluri alleges in his SEC whistleblower disclosure that at one meeting at Castille, Schembri told him, “You know what happened with Daphne [Caruana Galizia] and you don’t want to end up in that position. You want us to be a friend, not a foe.”  Tumuluri discloses several meetings in which he alleges his life had been threatened and claims he was pulled aside afterwards from one such meeting, by Mizzi, who warned him, “Don’t force these guys to go to that level.”  At another such meeting, Tumuluri says Shaukat Ali and his son Ali, who he says were “acting as de facto agents and representatives of the government of Malta”, told Tumuluri that although he had signed up to do business with a European Member State, Malta was, in fact, a “mafia state” where “the cost of life is less than €10,000.”  Chillingly, during these meetings in the presence of both Schembri and Mizzi, Shaukat Ali told Tumuluri, according to his account, that if the government could “get rid of someone like Daphne” Tumuluri was of no significance and that it could also “get rid of” him quite easily.  Tumuluri claims that it was only under duress and “as a result of the repeated threats of violence and other harm, including the threats of murder conveyed to him in December 2017” that he ultimately gave in to the government’s demands that he sell Bluestone’s shares in Vitals Malta to Steward.  ‘We need to silence Daphne’ – Schembri  In his official SEC filing, seen by The Shift and investigative partners, Tumuluri says he feared that if he did not comply with the government’s demands, he would be murdered by “agents of the government of Malta”.  He claims that over the course of the preceding year he “had various frightening and otherwise uncomfortable experiences with the government of Malta”.  He details how on one such occasion in early 2017, he was present at the Office of the Prime Minister with Mizzi and Schembri.  Tumuluri says that Schembri turned to him and stated, “in sum and substance that ‘we need to silence Daphne [Caruana Galizia]’, and asked whether “we know anyone who could get rid of her.”  Tumuluri says he thought Schembri had been joking at the time and disregarded the comment.  He says he began changing his mind after he said he witnessed the detonation of a car bomb on the other side of the road while he was driving in Malta in February 2017.  Tumuluri was presumably referring to the car bomb in Msida that left Romeo Bone severely injured on 20 February 2017.  Tumuluri says he later heard Schembri “chastise the individual or individuals responsible for the car bomb that Mr Tumuluri had witnessed on the grounds that the operation had not been conducted properly”.  Cardona ‘cancelled Sicilian hit on Caruana Galizia’  Soon after that, in March or April 2017, Tumuluri claims he attended a meeting at the Office of the Prime Minister with Schembri, Mizzi, and Asad Ali, the latter being the son of one of the hospitals’ original dealmakers Shaukat Ali.  Tumuluri reports in his FCPA filing that Schembri told him at that meeting that former minister Chris Cardona, one of Caruana Galizia’s frequent targets, “had paid the Sicilian mafia €10,000 to assassinate Ms Caruana Galizia” but that Cardona the next day developed a case of “cold feet and had cancelled the directive”.  Schembri, Tumuluri says in his sworn statement, said that Cardona had never gotten the money back after cancelling the directive.”  Tumuluri claims he had the impression that Schembri made the statements “as an amusing anecdote and to mock Cardona for being weak,” but despite this, he still “felt deeply uncomfortable, concerned, and intimidated”.  An investor’s hand  In another disturbing incident Tumuluri reported to the SEC, he says was present for a meeting at the OPM in December 2017 where several individuals, including Schembri and Armin Ernst, had discussed a court injunction filed by Ashok Rattehalli, then a consultant and medical director for Vitals.  Rattehalli had been employed with Vitals since June 2016 and had received an option to purchase 5% of Vitals Malta shares as part of his compensation.  But since Tumuluri could not permit Rattehalli to exercise the option because a deal to hand the concession over to Steward had not yet been brokered, Rattehalli had sought and obtained an injunction to prevent the transfer of Vitals to Steward, as The Shift had revealed.  According to Tumuluri’s filing, “During this meeting, Schembri received a telephone call from Asad Ali reporting that Asad Ali had threatened Rattehalli by advising him that he would cut off Rattehalli’s hand and use his hand to apply a signature to a document to withdraw the injunction if he did not withdraw the injunction himself.”  Rattehalli, Tumuluri said, “immediately withdrew the injunction as directed”.  Muscat’s involvement  Although Muscat insists he played no role in the deal, Tumuluri insists that “Schembri’s demands that Mr Tumuluri sign the share-purchase agreement [with Steward] were made at the direction of Muscat”.  During the meeting, Tumuluri claims that “Muscat entered the room and demanded that the share-purchase agreement be signed that same day”.  Tumuluri claims that Muscat told him, “Do I need to butt your heads together to get this signed?”  Before leaving the room, Tumuluri says, Muscat advised Schembri that he expected the share-purchase agreement to be signed within half an hour.  Schembri then, according to Tumuluri’s account, asked him to step outside the room with him because he did not want to say certain things in the presence of lawyers.  “Schembri began discussing political relationships among ministers and advised that the government had to oust Mr Tumuluri from the concession and had to replace him with Ernst and Steward.”  Tumuluri says Schembri further advised that Muscat had asked Schembri to speak to him personally “to ensure that the share purchase agreement was signed the same day”.  Tumuluri further claims that Muscat had instructed Schembri to remove Tumuluri and Bluestone and to transfer the concession to a then-undisclosed third party, which later turned out to be Steward, with which the government had already struck a deal.  That meeting was in December 2017, and Schembri, Tumuluri says, told him the government wanted to announce the concession’s transfer to Steward by Christmas.  He says at that point, Schembri warned that if he “wanted to do business in Europe or elsewhere again, he should stay on his ‘nice’ side, as opposed to his ‘nasty’ side, he should remain a ‘friend’” and not a ‘foe’, and he should sign the share-purchase agreement immediately.”  Brown bags and a board position  Nor was Steward chairman and CEO Ralph de la Torre, who has not replied to the investigation’s questions, spared in Tumuluri’s US SEC filing, with Tumuluri claiming de la Torre told him that he had no problem with bribing government officials if need be.  “In touting Steward’s supposed competitive advantage in Malta, de la Torre told Mr Tumuluri that Steward was not as rigid as Partners Healthcare International [Tumuluri’s former partner for the deal],” according to the filing.  Along such lines, Tumuluri adds that “de la Torre boasted that he could issue ‘brown bags’ to government officials if necessary to close transactions, insinuating that he would bribe officials of the government of Malta.”  Tumuluri says he did not respond to the “brown bag” comment and did not agree to assist Steward with any violations in Malta of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He said he did, however, agree to further discussions with de la Torre, subject to a non-disclosure agreement, to explore the possibility of Steward serving as an equity investor in Vitals Global.  Tumuluri claims that through the latter part of 2016 and the entirety of 2017, Ernst conspired with Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre, along with government officials and others, to steal his confidential and proprietary information, such as business models, intellectual property, and other trade secrets; defame him; undermine his business relationships; disrupt financing to Vitals Malta; and to strip him of his interests in Vitals Malta and the hospital-services concession.  He also claims the collusion was aimed at blocking him and Vitals from extending his Malta business model to other countries in Europe and thwarting the implementation of his business model through an information-technology platform in the United States and abroad.  Tumuluri says he also had information from Shaukat Ali that, during the discussions between the government and Steward around September and December 2017, de la Torre also had travelled to Malta and had met with Prime Minister Muscat on multiple occasions.  He also says that, according to Schembri, Ernst had been in discussions with the new Health Minister, Chris Fearne, about taking the concession from Vitals Malta.  He claims Shaukat Ali told him that de la Torre offered Muscat a seat on the Steward Board once he left his government position. Tumuluri provided no follow-up to the discussion he says Ali had cited.  ‘Completely false and baseless’  When it comes to the threats Tumuluri says he was made, Keith Schembri perhaps features most prominently. When asked to react to the accusations being made in his respect, Schembri labelled the accusations as “completely false and baseless”.  Schembri, in a stark contradiction to Tumuluri’s claims, insists it was Steward Healthcare that approached “us” at the United Nations General Assembly in New York to express their interest in acquiring Vitals in Malta.  “It is unfortunate that Mr Tumuluri has chosen to make such outrageous claims, and I question his motives behind doing so.  “It appears that he has a vivid imagination and is attempting to associate this case with the tragic murder of Mrs Caruana Galizia, which is absolutely horrendous.”  “I vehemently protest against these baseless allegations and false claims made by Mr Tumuluri.”  On his part, Muscat says it is a “clear and uncontested” fact that he was “made aware of Steward’s interest in the concession after Steward and VGH reached an agreement in principle on the concession”.  He adds, in a complete contradiction of Tumuluri’s filing, “I categorically deny being at any stage involved in the negotiations between the two sides, either directly or indirectly, and I never asked for any position.”  “I also emphatically deny ever organising and/or attending any meeting whatsoever involving Steward and VGH. I challenge anyone to produce any sort of evidence to the contrary.”  “As stated numerous times, my only interest was in a seamless transition between the two entities as an agreement was reached.”  Like Schembri and Muscat, Shaukat Ali also denied the accusations Tumuluri is levelling, saying, “I can confirm that the allegations of wrongdoing, as stated in your communications, against me and my son are entirely false and vehemently denied.”  He also warned he was “liaising with our lawyers both in Malta and abroad who are monitoring the situation, including the publication of defamatory material. Should the need arise, we will not hesitate to take legal action.”  As for Konrad Mizzi, the former health minister insisted Tumuluri had not been coerced into handing over the hospitals’ concession.  “I reject any claim that Mr Tumuluri was being bullied into exiting, and deny even being aware that he received any threat if he did. If a statement was made stating that I was present, then it is false.”  “At the time of the transfer of shares, government had approved the transfer onto Steward after the Office of the Prime Minister was approached with a proposal for the acquisition of the concession. My understanding is that as private parties, the transferor and transferee were free to accept or decline to reach an agreement, and an agreement was in fact reached.”  When contacted about the filing, Steward Health Care International said it “emphatically rejects any and all allegations of impropriety made by Tumuluri, who is widely reported and recognised as an international fraudster, against the company and its directors.”  “We consider these accusations malicious, self-serving and entirely without merit. We reserve our rights to take legal action to defend our position and reputation.”  Click on the following links for the full replies supplied by Keith Schembri, Shaukat Ali, Konrad Mizzi and Joseph Muscat.

"assassination","1901-01-01","Not Discerned","{""McKinley"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:02:44","Late though it may be in the age of print, we still envision ransom or other threatening notes in the same way we have for generations, with their demands incongruously spelled out with individual letters, each one a different size and font, taken from the pages of newspapers and magazines. This classic cut-and-paste method of ransom note construction presumably emerged as means of evading minds like that of Trista Ginsberg, a document analyst specializing in handwriting at the Secret Service. She appears in the Great Big Story above, which comes to focus on one facility at the Service’s headquarters in particular: the International Ink Library.  “The Secret Service has the largest ink library in the world,” says the video’s narrator. Its more than 12,000 samples of different inks include “pens, bottled ink, and printer cartridges.” These come in handy when, say, “someone writes a threatening letter to the president.”  A document analyst like Irina Geiman samples the letter’s ink, and then, by comparing it to the inks in the library, “she can figure out what kind of ink was used, and, hopefully, it can help solve the case.” Geiman also explains a less dramatic type of case that comes across her desk rather more often: at-home inkjet counterfeiting of $20 bills.  Though that may not be the highest example of the counterfeiter’s art, the art itself motivated the creation of the Secret Service in 1865 as a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department. “Following the Civil War,” says the Secret Service’s FAQ, “it was estimated that one-third to one-half of the currency in circulation was counterfeit.” It was in 1901, after the McKinley assassination, that “the Secret Service was first tasked with its second mission: the protection of the president.” Hence the cultural currency of the image of the would-be president assassin evading governmental pursuit while laboriously assembling his missives one letter at a time — surely reason enough for the Secret Service to have put together a top-secret International Glue Library.  via Messy Nessy  Related content:  How Ink is Made: The Process Revealed in a Mouth-Watering Video  Books Made with Disappearing Ink Strategically Fade Away  Anatomy of a Fake: Forgery Experts Reveal 5 Ways To Spot a Fake Painting by Jackson Pollock (or Any Other Artist)  Read the CIA’s Simple Sabotage Field Manual: A Timeless Guide to Subverting Any Organization with “Purposeful Stupidity” (1944)  Based in Seoul, Colin Marshall writes and broadcasts on cities, language, and culture.

The hitman and another man were sentenced to life imprisonment.  Today, Trang Provincial Court sentenced 52 year old Charinrat “Chuan” Kruthirat to death after he and two others were found guilty of murdering 54 year old Somsak “Lawyer Wao” Ochuenjit in 2021. Chuan was the mastermind behind the lawyer’s assassination.  At 7.40am on May 4, 2021, a gunman fatally shot Somsak while he was working in a rubber plantation near his home. Somsak had not long before told his family that he was receiving death threats.  Somsak was assassinated after leading a campaign for the right to agricultural land for poor farmers in Wang Wiset district. Tensions were high between local farmers occupying oil plantations without valid leases, government agencies, and private companies backed by politicians.  Four days later, the Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Brad Adams, called on the Thai authorities to investigate the murder…  “Thai authorities should not just stand by while grassroots activists in southern provinces are being murdered for standing up for their communities.”  “The Thai government should urgently conduct a credible and impartial investigation and bring those responsible for Somsak’s death to justice.”  Human Rights Watch pointed out that five land activists have been killed in southern Thailand over the past decade.  Two years on, justice is set to be served for Somsak after the court sentenced Chuan to death for planning the murder and hiring a hitman.  The court also sentenced the former village chief of Moo 10, Chalermwat “Yai Pua” Nokroorak, to life imprisonment for his role in the planning of the murder although he did not participate on the day itself.  The hitman, Saranyoo “Nil” Kueboonsong, was at first sentenced to death for shooting dead Somsak. However, because the hitman ratted out Chuan – helping the police’s investigation hugely – and plead guilty, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.  All three men were taken into custody after the verdict was read yesterday and taken to Trang Provincial Prison.  Follow us on :              Somsak’s family travelled to Khao Phra Wiset Temple after the verdict was read to burn incense and to inform Somsak’s spirit to rest easy because justice had finally been served.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Jackson"", ""Mississippi"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 08:00:00","Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state's capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a ""separate and unequal"" court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city's crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of ""white backlash"" working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln's running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln's assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: ""Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.""  Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond's First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell's situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell's actions and refused to seat him until the committee's report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn't take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another ""white backlash"" in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county's population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson's complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state's roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature's rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

Trevor Jackson (Grown-ish, Superfly) will co-star. Myriad Pictures is shopping the project to buyers here in Cannes this week.  Mace is the harrowing story of two very different types of cops – a veteran officer Mace (LaBeouf), dangerous and corrupt, and Virgil Woods (Jackson), a young rookie who believes that he can change the system that fosters cops like Mace from within. It’s inspired by the recent racial injustice on the streets of America and Woods refuses to be bullied and pits his principles against the amoral Mac. Woods risks everything he believes to stop Mace from destroying the city when Mace unleashes a gang war to cover up his crimes. Everyone around Mace is in danger as Mace plays his game and tries to conceal his tracks, no matter the cost.  The Meyers Media Group production is projected to start later this year in New Jersey with additional casting underway. Lawrence Steven Meyers, John Evangelides, Randy Dannenberg and Robert Maclean will produce. Brendan McDonald and Kirk D’Amico will serve as exec producers. Tribune Pictures is onboard to co-produce and co-finance the film.  LaBeouf can next be seen in Francis Ford Coppola’s highly anticipated Megalopolis and he’s just joined the cast of David Mamet’s Assassination. He most recently wrapped production on Abel Ferarra’s Padre Pio which follows the life of the now saint during his time as a monk in Puglia, Italy.  Amiel is an award-winning director, writer and producer who garnered international acclaim for The Singing Detective and followed that with Queen of Hearts, which premiered in Cannes. His further credits include Tune in Tomorrow, with Keanu Reeves and Peter Falk, Copycat with Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter and Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones.  Myriad Pictures’ D’Amico said, “We are delighted that Shia LaBeouf will head up the cast for this film which explores the underbelly of a police precinct in contemporary New Jersey. We think that with Jon Amiel at the helm and Shia in the title role that the result will be extraordinary and exciting.”  Meyers added, “We are really excited to have assembled such a package. With the amazing screenplay, Jon at the helm, and Shia joining Trevor as the lead actors, it is an irresistible creative coup for us. Thankfully, the investment from Robert’s Tribune Pictures enabled us to greenlight the film in time for Myriad to bring it to the Cannes Market.”  Shia LaBeouf is represented by John Crosby Management and attorney Matt Saver.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2RlYWRsaW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3NoaWEtbGFiZW91Zi10by1zdGFyLWluLWFjdGlvbi10aHJpbGxlci1tYWNlLWZyb20tZGlyZWN0b3Itam9uLWFtaWVsLW15cmlhZC1waWN0dXJlcy1jYW5uZXMtbWFya2V0LTEyMzUzNjk3ODgv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvc2hpYS1sYWJlb3VmLXRvLXN0YXItaW4tYWN0aW9uLXRocmlsbGVyLW1hY2UtZnJvbS1kaXJlY3Rvci1qb24tYW1pZWwtbXlyaWFkLXBpY3R1cmVzLWNhbm5lcy1tYXJrZXQtMTIzNTM2OTc4OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1997-07-15","Not Discerned","{""Miami"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:32:17","The new FBI sci-fi series Class of ‘09 fails to make a strong impression, despite boasting some signature FX (on Hulu) aesthetics.  By Valerie Ettenhofer · Published on May 17th, 2023  Welcome to Up Next, a recurring column keeping an eye out for the best new shows on the horizon. This week, TV critic Valerie Ettenhofer checks in with a review of FX’s new drama Class of ’09.  Imagine if AI technology could solve crimes. Free from the bias and limited resources of police, unburdened by human anger or fear, a computer that’s a dozen steps ahead of its users might just be the key to a safer world. Except, if you’ve watched or read any number of sci-fi stories in this vein, from Minority Report to the works of Isaac Asimov, you’ll know that this concept is little more than a shiny pipe dream. The new FX/Hulu series Class of ’09 attempts to mine this familiar plot once more, but its sleek style and intriguing cast aren’t enough to make it feel fresh. Instead, the series loses itself in a hazy sort of mystique that, in the four episodes available for review, fails to coalesce in a meaningful way.  Tom Rob Smith’s (Assassination of Gianni Versace) Class of ’09 tells the story of a particularly important class of FBI recruits, jumping back and forth between their time at Quantico, the height of their careers, and a timeline several decades later when the former colleagues end up back in one another’s lives by strange and mysterious circumstances. Nothing is that strange and mysterious, though, and that might be Class of ’09’s biggest problem; the show keeps the languid, contemplative pace of something like Alex Garland’s Devs but seems to have much less on its mind or up its sleeve. The entire show feels surprisingly muted, even in its most action-packed moments. An odd sense of emotional distance keeps even the show’s most surprising beats from fully working.  The series stars Kate Mara (A Teacher, House of Cards), and while the actress is as watchable as ever, there’s a blankness to her character, Poet. Her classmates are equally dull but at least have more interesting backstories. Tayo (Brian Tyree Henry, Atlanta) is underestimated by his teachers and classmates in the FBI program and wants to prove them wrong. He has grand ambitions that tie directly to his own experiences as a Black man. Hour (Sepideh Moafi, Black Bird), Poet’s Quantico roommate, has her own motivations for changing the world, and they stem from the experiences of her immigrant parents.  All of these actors have been fantastic in tons of other projects, yet here, they often take an almost toneless approach to their lines that saps the life out of most scenes. The robots of Class of ‘09 are all of the algorithmic variety. Still, for a few brief moments in early episodes, I wondered if this inexplicably boring bunch was secretly a bunch of androids. Alas, it seems as if the series is purposely going for a cool, detached demeanor, and its narrative simply doesn’t have the juice to pull it off.  Class of ’09 does fit nicely into the sleek sci-fi TV show format in other ways, though. Will Bates’ score is excellent, and the show’s direction is as striking and artistic as one would expect from an FX-related production. The cast is so talented that they’re still sometimes enjoyable to watch, even when the story and scripts don’t capitalize on their full range of abilities. A plot involving a shady, cultish figure played by Mark Pellegrino (Supernatural, Lost) temporarily gets the show’s blood pumping, and each of his scenes is genuinely tense. Yet his scenes are relatively few and far between; instead, the series is focused mainly on presenting us with a series of solemn conversations among coworkers, many of which seem frustratingly vague thanks to the non-chronological timelines.  The series also goes deep on one aspect of its ideology while refusing to illustrate another. Its central technology is pitched as a world-saving crime radar of sorts, but its invention doesn’t quell questions about bias and hatred in the criminal justice system. The show seems poised to explore those moral questions related to racial profiling in-depth, but it still approaches its central topic from a stubbornly retributive justice-based standpoint. This is a “catch the bad guys” show, and its dream of a perfect world doesn’t seem to involve criminal rehabilitation or address the social and economic factors that lead to incarceration: it’s just a skilled bad guy-catching machine. There’s something disheartening about a utopian vision of the future of the criminal justice system that still doesn’t seem to see criminals as humans, and that’s a problem the show only partly addresses.  Class of ’09 is a surprisingly hard show to describe because tonally and emotionally, it leaves audiences grasping for purchase in what might just be a blank wall. The series isn’t offensively bad, and in some ways it’s artful. Still, its strange insistence on favoring the enigmatic over the engrossing or endearing (I came away not caring about a single character) overwhelms whatever it’s trying to pull off. Skip this one and instead watch any number of other projects featuring Henry, Mara, or Moafi – or just throw on Minority Report again.  Class of ’09 is currently airing on FX. Watch the limited series trailer here.

Lynyrd Skynyrd - Leonard Skinner A high school yearbook photos of Leonard Skinner in 1969. He died in 2010 aged 77.  The Yardbirds The influential British band's name was partially inspired by the nickname of American jazz saxophonist Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker. It's also the name given to rail yard hobos in Jack Kerouac's 1957 novel On the Road.  The Yardbirds - Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker Jazz musician Charlie 'Yardbird' Parker in 1955 – the year of his death aged just 34.

Molly Hatchet Just like their fellow Jacksonville rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd, Molly Hatchet were named after a real person. Molly Hatchet's moniker is more steeped in history, however, as they're named after an infamous 17th-century axe murderess dubbed 'hatchet molly'.

The pitfalls of self-expression through political assassination are on display in writer/director Musa Alderson-Clarke’s provocative and gritty short Killing Boris Johnson. Chas (Shadrach Agozino) is falling apart over the suicide of his mother. Suffering from seasonal depression, she counted on family gatherings during the holiday to get through. However, when Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared a lockdown in December 2020 and banned all get-togethers, Chas’ mom took her own life. He’s enraged because while his mother died and he was in isolation, Johnson secretly held his own private Christmas party, violating his own rules.  So now Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson. There is an event at a children’s school the prime minister is scheduled to appear at, and he plans to go there and shoot him. Unfortunately, Chas soon discovers that there are no gun shops in England, so he is at the mercy of whatever homemade goods are available on the black market. His sister, Maia (Jesse Akele), tries to reach out to him, but Chas won’t let her into his flat. That may be because she would see his rubber Boris Johnson mask, the one that Chas puts on at night and looks in the mirror while punching himself in the head.  The frustration of the decisions made for you gets an escapist valve through dreams of dead monarchs and legislators. Killing Boris Johnson engages in this impulse but also shows how futile it is to dare follow it. Alderson-Clarke’s script walks the same path Taxi Driver does, except the concept here walks a little further. The filmmaker first sets up the emotional reason that Johnson is targeted for slaughter. Then, by bringing it from the political to the personal, the short connects the viewer to Chas’s emotional state instead of keeping him behind glass in an insane aquarium.  “…Chas has decided to kill Boris Johnson.”  This also allows Alderson-Clarke to explore the emotional agony of loss from suicide through excellent expressionistic set pieces that comment on vengeance. One particularly vivid example is Chas attacking himself wearing his Boris Johnson mask. His fury is directed outwards but is only causing him harm. This is crystalized in the squirm-inducing climax, which is thankfully left ambiguous.  Agozino gives an outstanding performance, pulling off the challenging trick of giving us relatable alienation. He slowly boils the watcher in his craziness instead of letting loose with a full-throttle nutter. Akele provides a well-grounded counter-balance to ensure everyone isn’t heading down Derangement Lane.  The production quality is excellent and very polished. It manages a lot of grit without getting pulpy, making the intensity of the viewing experience all the more genuine. Alderson-Clarke’s got the directing skills to pay the bills while also sporting fresh storytelling talent. Killing Boris Johnson will drop jaws and land inside your mind like a bolt of clever lightning.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZmlsbXRocmVhdC5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9raWxsaW5nLWJvcmlzLWpvaG5zb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2021-10-12","Not Discerned","{""Gonaives"", ""Artibonite"", ""Haiti""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:11:53","By Kirk Petersen  The recent arrest of a former top official of the Diocese of Haiti is just the latest sign of catastrophic dysfunction in the largest diocese of the Episcopal Church.  Haiti has not been led by a bishop for nearly five years, because the outgoing bishop was credibly accused of manipulating an election to install his preferred successor.  In the absence of a bishop diocesan, the ecclesiastical authority of any diocese passes to the diocesan Standing Committee. The Rev. Mardoché Vil, who heads that committee in Haiti, is a fugitive, accused by Haitian police of trafficking weapons into a country where murderous gangs are better armed than the police.  The previous president of the Standing Committee, the Rev. Fritz Désiré, was arrested May 9 on similar charges.  Still being sought for arms trafficking is Vundla Sikhumbuzo, a Zimbabwean who worked as chief of operations for the diocese from 2011 until 2018. Vundla, who has been identified in multiple news reports as an international arms trafficker, was dismissed in 2018 after he allegedly attacked his wife with acid, leaving her disfigured. However, Vundla allegedly received several deposits of US$30,000 or more from the diocese as late as 2021.  These allegations began coming to light in August 2022, when the diocesan executive secretary and an accountant working for the diocese were arrested on arms-trafficking charges.  Virtually none of this has been reported in American news media. Most of the information comes from articles on Haitian news websites, some of them machine-translated from French.  Bishop Todd Ousley of the Office of Pastoral Development is the Church Center’s liaison with the Diocese of Haiti. In an email addressed to Vil on May 7, Ousley supported plans for a diocesan synod, or convention, to elect new members of the Standing Committee.  Ousley’s expression of support was denounced as “immoral and unacceptable” by the director general of the well-respected St. Vincent’s Center, an Episcopal institution that has provided educational opportunities and job training to children with disabilities since 1945.  “In encouraging President Vil to organize the Synod, [Ousley] did not underline anything about the current context in which Father Mardoché Vil is up to now being sought and pursued by the National Police of Haiti,” wrote the Rev. Irnel Duveaux in a letter to the St. Vincent’s board, which was forwarded to TLC by a priest in the diocese. Duveaux did not respond to a request for comment.  Ousley declined to be interviewed for this article. Public Affairs Officer Amanda Skofstad released a copy of the May 7 email, which appears at the bottom of this article. ”  “The point of the letter was to address the need for a synod to elect or re-elect members of the standing committee,” Skofstad said. “Since the current occupant of the office of president of the standing committee is Vil, the letter could only be addressed to him. Any use of the letter to promote political agendas within the Diocese of Haiti would be a misuse of the letter.”  She also released the following statement from Ousley:  “To the best of our knowledge, Père Jean Mardoché Vil is the duly elected standing committee president for the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti, and the validity of his service in that office is a matter to be determined by the diocese through its synod. As always, the clergy and people of the Diocese of Haiti are being held in prayer as they face various challenges within the church and Haitian society.”  However, two senior priests in the diocese have written to the national Department of Religious Affairs to say that a rival Provisional Standing Committee was elected by the clergy of the diocese in April. The six-person ad hoc committee was created to provide “honest and credible interlocutors without criminal records, capable of ensuring a responsible transition and doing everything possible to restore the image of this institution tarnished by the actions of a group of mercenaries.”  The letter, which also appears at the bottom of this article, names Duveaux, two other priests, and three lay people as members of the ad hoc committee. The letter provides an accounting, by name, of the votes cast for and against the committee by 59 priests in the diocese, and reports that 54 percent of the priests approved the committee.  Unsafe conditions have deteriorated in Haiti since the June 2021 assassination of President Jovenal Moïse. Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who was allegedly involved in the assassination, has since served as acting president.  “Violent gangs have effectively seized control of large swathes of the country,” according to a recent United Nations report, and rival gangs have engaged in armed combat, sexual violence, and kidnapping. Vigilantes have recently begun targeting the gangs. The BBC reports that 13 suspected gang members were beaten and burned to death in Port-au-Prince, the capital, in April.  The Diocese of Haiti reports nearly 98,000 baptized members, making it more than 30 percent larger by that measure than the Diocese of Texas, which ranks second. Because of societal violence and diocesan infighting, Haiti has had virtually no influence in recent years in the governance of the broader church.  The diocese has, however, had a remarkably broad role in Haitian society. The diocese owns more than 250 schools, as well as hospitals and higher-education facilities. L’Université Episcopale d’Haïti (UNEPH) educates about 2,500 students.

"assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Chantilly"", ""Virginia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 04:10:28","To support a supplemental bid to keep Jack Teixeira jailed pre-trial, prosecutors provided proof that on three instances, the young enlisted man had been caught improperly accessing classified information. Even after formal warnings on September 15 and October 27, 2022, on January 30 of this year, a female Master Sergeant observed Teixeira “viewing content that was not related to his primary duty.”  Days later, amid a discussion of “fed cars sneaking around,” Teixeira fantasized about making an “assassination van.”  Nevertheless, even after three chances to stop all this, Teixeira was still actively stealing classified information for over a month after that, and as an earlier filing laid out, he offered to take requests about “happenings that pertain to your country” after that.  TEIXEIRA: Like to thank everyone who came to the thread about the current event, going on and participated and listen to me, cover set event since it’s beginning, I was very happy and willing and enthusiastic to have covered this event for the past year and share with all of you something that not many people get to see something very few people in fact, get to see, but despite all of this, I’ve decided to stop with the updates TEIXEIRA: If you guys do you want happenings that pertain to your country or events or politics or whatever you can DM me and I can tell you what I have, but it’s going to always be a brief summary TEIXEIRA: I can’t promise, speed or prompt response, but I will respond to you eventually so offers on the table. If you want to take it until then I’ll still be sticking around here still be posting shit, so not going anywhere don’t worry about that.  I suspect the non-response to these three incidents may be one reason the Commanding Officers of this base have been temporarily suspended and the entire unit stripped of its intelligence mission.  But the more important supplement for Teixeira’s ultimate fate may be this exchange from November 15.  Teixeira: I remember reading that on a TS network … Teixeira: I work in airforce intel … User: Would have been nice User: If you alerted us that a drone was heading to crash in the middle of a suburb of our capital? Teixeira: We did Teixeira: Just not that simple User: Official government statement was nobody said shit User: And nobody saw it Teixeira: Yeah I expect that to be the official statement Teixeira: My gov would have done the same downplay strategy User: What is a ts network Teixeira: Top secret … Teixeira: Like SCI noforn, hcs … User: What is being said now about this loose ukrainian missile? Teixeira: I mean I’m hoping to get back to work in the next week rn I have covid Teixeira: When I do get back however I will let u know  This exchange may be a response to this incident from the same day, when a Ukrainian air defense missile attempting to shoot down an incoming Russian attack went astray and killed two Poles (though Przewodów is nowhere near Warsaw).  If that’s right, by extrapolation this interlocutor must be have been presenting as a Pole. After Teixeira stated that he worked in Air Force intel with access to a Top Secret network, his interlocutor elicited information, challenged Teixeira’s response, then probed how much access Teixeira really had. Teixeira responded by telling someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally that he had access to compartmented information and HUMINT. Then the supposed Pole asked for more information.  And Teixeira agreed to get it for him.  Perhaps this presumed Pole was just shooting the shit in a gamer chat room. Or perhaps this guy was something else, someone with the training to know how to coax someone into greater and greater compromise.  Perhaps there were others in the chat room who saw all this go down and exploited the situation accordingly.  This filing, as the earlier one also did, specifies that these chats do not reflect the full extent of Special Agent Luke Church’s knowledge of the situation.  The interactions described above do not reflect all my knowledge on this matter or all relevant, inculpatory, or violent messages that I observed. They are instead offered to provide the Court with representative sample of certain messages attributable to TEIXEIRA.  Church might well be withholding the full context of these exchanges, too, perhaps withholding what happened after Teixeira went back to work after recovering from COVID.  Thus far, DOJ’s filings speak just of the existing charges against Teixeira, 18 USC 793(b) and (d). But this willful sharing of HUMINT with foreigners soliciting it — whether they really are citizens of a NATO ally or something else — gets a closer to espionage, an 18 USC 794 violation of the sort that can carry life imprisonment.  Update: dc-turtle suggests the drone could have been in Croatia, not Poland (which I’ve added to the title). It would still amount to Teixeira sharing information with someone presenting as a citizen of a NATO ally.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVtcHR5d2hlZWwubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvamFjay10ZWl4ZWlyYXMtcG9saXNoLW1pc3NpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(Courtesy of bereaved family members of Park)  The Supreme Court of South Korea cleared a man who served 17 years in prison for allegedly spying for North Korea in 1975 of his charges in a retrial on Thursday.  Seoul's top court upheld an earlier ruling in 2022 that the evidence that originally put Park Ki-rae in jail for his breach of the National Security Act is not admissible, given that the investigative authorities during former President Park Chung-hee's military dictatorship had obtained the evidence and a confession by violating the defendant's human rights, through unlawful detention and torture.  During the military dictatorship, Seoul's anti-communist sentiment had continued to grow, particularly after the North's failed assassination attempt on the president in 1968, partly in order for the then-president to consolidate his control over South Koreans.  Defendant Park, a reunification activist, was one of the people arrested for attempting to rebuild a political party called the Unification Revolutionary Party, which the military junta had cracked down on after the revelation of party members' failed subversive activities against the then President Park in late 1960s.  Prosecutors then indicted him in 1974 for allegedly inviting others to join the party, illegally entering North Korea to communicate with North Koreans, conducting spying activities against Seoul and leaking military information.  Park was sentenced to death in April 1975. However, he ultimately served in total 17 years behind bars as his sentence was commuted several times until he was released on parole in 1991.  He continued his reunification activities after he was released from prison until he passed away in 2012.  This photo shows bereaved family members of the defendant Park Ki-rae, who was acquitted of spying charges in a Supreme Court verdict Thursday following a retrial. (Yonhap)  The defendant's bereaved family members sought a retrial of his case in 2018 in hopes of removing his criminal record, questioning the evidence's admissibility to the court. The retrial of the case began in 2020.  The prosecution, however, continued to seek life imprisonment for him, claiming that his statements to the court had been made with the help of his attorneys.  After the Supreme Court verdict, the defendant's son, Park Chang-seon, told reporters that it was ""exceptional and inappropriate for prosecutors to seek life imprisonment to a person who had endured torture and served 17 years of imprisonment unjustly,"" adding that Park was the first individual to be acquitted of spying accusations related to the Unification Revolutionary Party crackdown in a retrial.

OPCW inspectors are trained to use hazmat suits with a self-contained breathing apparatus.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  The Hague, the Netherlands  The international body that banned chemical weapons is due to celebrate its first major milestone sometime this year — the completed destruction of the world’s declared stockpiles of banned substances. But at the organization’s brand-new facility in the Netherlands, scientists from around the world will continue its work to prevent, spot and respond to chemical warfare.  On 12 May, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) officially inaugurated its new Centre for Chemistry and Technology near The Hague, where the international body will bring together its existing laboratories and add new monitoring and training programmes.  Attacks in UK and Syria highlight growing need for chemical-forensics expertise  Although nearly all countries — except Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan — have officially renounced the use of chemical weapons under an international treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), such chemicals continue to be used illegally. The OPCW has played a central part in the response to crises: its investigators found that nerve gas and chlorine were used in the Syrian civil war during the past decade, for example, and in 2018 an OPCW team investigated the attempted assassination of a Russian dissident in the United Kingdom that involved a nerve agent called Novichok.  Historic step forward  The centre “will allow the OPCW to enhance the [lab] verification regime through maintaining and developing our knowledge, skills and expertise related to chemical weapons”, says OPCW director-general Fernando Arias.  “It was an historic step forward for the OPCW today,” said Paul Walker, a vice-chair of the board at the Arms Control Association, a non-governmental organization in Washington DC, after attending the 12 May launch. Although the OPCW’s monitoring work had been going on for more than a decade, the Syrian civil war catapulted it onto the global stage. “That began the whole process of realizing that we needed [the OPCW to have] much more expansive and expensive labs,” says Walker, who attended the inauguration on behalf of an umbrella organization called the CWC Coalition.  The new Centre for Chemistry and Technology is an upgrade compared with previous OPCW lab facilities.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  “I think it will be a big deal for the OPCW,” says Alastair Hay, an environmental toxicologist at the University of Leeds, UK, who has been an OPCW adviser and conducts outreach training for the organization. “The previous lab facilities OPCW had were really quite limited,” he says. The lab will also enhance the organization’s ability to train researchers, he adds. The centre was built outside the OPCW’s normal budget, with €34 million (US$37 million) of voluntary contributions from 56 countries.  Stockpile disposal  Since 1997, the OPCW has had a mandate under the CWC to monitor countries’ compliance with the ban, which required signatories to stop producing chemical weapons, to declare their existing stockpiles and commit to destroying them. The organization has so far certified the destruction of more than 70,000 tonnes of chemical weapons, and it received the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in 2013. Of the eight countries that disclosed the possession of such weapons, seven have completed disposal. The eighth — the United States — expects to finish destroying its stockpile (mainly artillery containing mustard gas and nerve agents) in the next few months and is thought to be the last country to do so.  “We estimate that a large number of old and abandoned chemical weapons still remain undiscovered around the globe,” says OPCW spokesperson Elisabeth Waechter. For example, large numbers of rusting Japanese chemical weapons left over from the Second World War still await safe disposal in China. “While it is the responsibility of countries to destroy them safely, OPCW technical experts can provide advice — and verify the safe destruction.”  The CWC also compels state parties to report the production of chemicals that have a dual purpose — compounds that have legitimate uses but can also be used either as weapons or as ingredients to make them.  The OPCW analyses samples from chemical plants worldwide to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals.Credit: OPCW/Flickr (CC BY-ND 2.0)  At the new centre, a warehouse is stocked with crates containing analytical-chemistry equipment ready to be dispatched around the world. As well as investigating alleged chemical-weapons attacks, the OPCW sends inspectors on routine missions to chemical facilities in member countries, often at short notice, to search for evidence of the production of banned chemicals. “Inspectors go to different sites and essentially audit what those particular sites have declared,” says Hay.  Samples brought back to The Hague are also sent to at least two international labs, to ensure that the results are cross-checked before they are reported to member countries. “It’s really important to be able to have access to really good facilities, where the results are incontrovertible,” Hay notes.  Novichok nerve agents banned by chemical-weapons treaty  These facilities are part of a network of 25 ‘OPCW-designated’ labs. The remit of the Centre for Chemistry and Technology includes putting labs through a periodic certification process to enable participation in the network. The centre also trains chemists from labs that want to match its standards and join the list. In an effort to provide knowledge to as many nations as possible, the OPCW is working on certifying labs in African countries for the first time: its current trainees include scientists from Algeria, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.  Increasing the labs’ geographical diversity can “build global capacity for the benefit of all regions and the international community as a whole”, Waechter says.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZDQxNTg2LTAyMy0wMTYyMi050gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","0301-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Cappadocia"", ""Abruzzes"", ""Italy""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:14:48","BY HOVSEP DAGHDIGIAN  Among the saints revered in the Armenian and other Christian churches is Surb (Saint) Hakob, also referred to as Saint Jacob of Nisibis, and Saint James of Mtsbin. This “Saint James” should not to be confused with other Saint James’s. Nisibis, also known as Mtsbin, is a city in southern Turkey near the Syrian border, about 75 km SE of Dikranagerd. Christians of Nisibis, which included many Armenians, traced their Christian origins to Saint Thaddeus who, with Saint Bartholomew, preached and were martyred in Armenia prior to Armenia becoming the first nation to accept Christianity early in the 4th century.  In the 4th century Rome and Persia were contending for power in Armenia and the region. The Persian king sent an Armenian traitor, Anak, to assassinate Armenia’s king Khosrov and his family. Members of the Armenian court, enraged by their King’s assassination, killed Anak and all his family members that they could find. Anak’s son Gregory, however, escaped to Cappadocia where he was educated within its Christian community. Similarly, the murdered Armenian King Khosrov’s son, Drtad, was sent to Rome where he received an education as befitted a future king. Rome later returned Drtad to the Armenian throne. Passing through Cappadocia, Drtad and Gregory met and returned together to Armenia. Gregory converted Drtad, and the Armenian nation, to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming “Gregory the Illuminator”, founder of the Armenian church.  Armenian cemetery at Akori / Yenidogan at 5,700 feet on Mt. Ararat Armenian cemetery at Akori / Yenidogan at 5,700 feet on Mt. Ararat, Ararat summit in background  Hakob probably was related to Gregory, either as a cousin or nephew. Some sources indicate he too may have spent some time in Cappadocia. As a youth Hakob abandoned city life, devoting himself to religion, and living an austere existence in the mountains near Nisibis. He became known for his compassion, honesty, sincerity and strong sense of justice. When the bishop of the large Christian community of Nisibis died, the church fathers tried to convince Hakob to take the position, despite his lack of refinement. Numerous attempts to convince him finally succeeded.  Bishop Hakob of Nisibis participated in numerous Christian councils attended as well by representatives of the Armenian church, such as the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD which established the Nicene Creed, to which the Syriac and Armenian church adhered, and which is a fundamental profession of faith in the Armenian church. Byzantine emperor Constantine also attended the council and developed immense respect for Bishop Hakob.  Drawing of Surb Hakob Monastery, near Akori on Mt. Ararat, from reprint of “Journey to Ararat,” Friedrich Parrot, Harper & Brothers, NY, translated by W. D. Cooley, also available online  Hakob is reported to have performed many miracles. In one instance a couple of men asked him for a donation to help bury their friend who, faking death, was lying on the ground. Hakob said a prayer, after which the men, checking their friend on the ground, discovered that he was indeed dead. They beseeched Hakob to bring their friend back to life, which he did.  While traveling through a village, Hakob encountered a group of young women washing in a stream. They immodestly refused to cover themselves properly in the presence of a stranger. In response to a prayer by Surb Hakob, the stream dried up and the women’s hair turned white. The villagers urged Hakob to allow the stream to flow again, which he did, but the immodest women’s white hair remained.  Hakob urged a Persian judge to reconsider an unfair judgement which he had issued. The judge refused. When Surb Hakob, with a prayer, turned a stone into dust the judge reversed his decision.  Yenidogan village, next to Armenian cemetery on Mt. Ararat, at or near site of destroyed Akori village  Following the death of Byzantine Emperor Constantine in 337, the Persian Sassanid King Shapur II saw an opportunity to recapture territory Persia had previously lost to Rome. He attacked Roman held territories in upper Mesopotamia, Armenia, and in 338 attacked Nisibis. Hakob mounted Nisibis’ defensive walls and, praying, caused a swarm of insects to attack the large invading army which included war machines and elephants. The insects so irritated the soldiers and elephants that they caused the army to retreat. The Persian general, eyeing the tower upon which Surb Hakob stood, claimed he saw Emperor Constantine, who had previously died, leading the defense. The Persian assault failed.  Troubled by the weakening faith of his people, Surb Hakob desired to find Noah’s “redeeming Ark”. He determined that if he could retrieve and display a piece of the Ark from Mt. Ararat[1], this would bolster his people’s faith.  One variant of Sp. Hakob’s jourrney up Mt. Ararat is described by Pavstos Buzand[2], a 5th century Armenian historian. Other accounts differ slightly:  Sign, Hakobavank / Metsaranits Monastery, 7 to 8th c, Kolotak village, Artsakh  As Surb Hakob ascended the parched slope of Mt. Ararat, he with his colleagues grew tired and in need of water. They fell to the ground and prayed. A spring then gushed forth near Hakob’s head. According to Pavstos Buzand, “the spring, called Hakob’s spring, remains to this day”. Proceeding further up Mt. Ararat, near the summit, Hakob grew tired and fell asleep. An angel descended, left a piece of wood from the Ark near his head, and indicated that Hakob must search no further. As he descended the people around Ararat rejoiced at the presence of such a holy man who brought a gift of wood from the Ark. Surb Hakob then proceeded to visit the “great servant of the Armenian king”, Prince Manachir, near Lake Van whom he had heard was a merciless and unjust man. But Hakob hoped to soften Manachir’s heart and install in him fear of God. Instead, Prince Mananchir scorned Surb Hakob, throwing 800 innocent prisoners into the sea. Hakob, with his colleagues grieving for the innocent victims, journeyed to the base of a nearby mountain. Again, he prayed and a spring came forth from the ground. Climbing to the summit of the mountain, he cursed the realm of the prince causing the death of Prince Manachir, his wife, and his seven sons. According to another source, though, one of Manachir’s sons repented and thus survived.  View of Hakobavank, Metsaranits Monastery, Kolotak village, Artsakh. Photo supplied courtesy of Hakobavank Revival Foundation View, Hakobavank, Metsariantz Monastery, Kolotak village, Artsakh  Surb Hakob Monastery, on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat, was built in 341 AD at the place where Hakob received the wood from the Ark. There may have been a church, St. James, in the nearby village of Akori[3]. The monastery was said to be of a cruciform plan with a central dome. In 1829 Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot, with Armenian writer Khachatur Abovian, were the first people known to summit Mt. Ararat. On the way to the summit, they visited Surb Hakob monastery which had engraved inscriptions dating to the 13th and 14th centuries. In the summer of 1840, an earthquake or volcanic explosion destroyed Surb Hakob monastery and the village of Akori. Many of the residents subsequently settled in Kamaris, a town in Kotayk province in the present Republic of Armenian. Currently the small Kurdish village of Yenidogan (“New Village”) is situated on or near the site of Akori. The monastery no longer exists, though there remain remnants of an Armenian cemetery with Armenian tombstones.  A number of Armenian churches and chapels named “Surp Hakob,” or equivalently “St. James of Nisibus” or “Saint James of Mtsbin”, exist. The history of some of these churches remains obscure.  Floor plan for Surb Hakob Monastery, Kolotak, Martakert region, Artsakh, from Հայկական Համառոտ Հանրագիտարան (Armenian Concise Encyclopedia), Yerevan, 1999. Monastery contains two churches  About a mile outside the village of Kolotak, Martakert Province, in Artsakh (Nagorno Karabagh) is Hakobavank, founded in the 5th to 7th centuries, which underwent modifications until the 12th c. In the 14th century the monastery became an important center of the region of Mets Arank, acquiring the name of Metsaranits Monastery. Between the 9th and 18th centuries the buildings were modified and maintained, with relics of Sp. Hakob kept until the 19th century. The monastery contains two churches, rooms for clergy, and in the Middle Ages was a pilgrimage site for Armenians in Eastern Armenia.  In 2022 a renovation project was initiated to restore a workable place of worship for the villagers, and refugees settling in Kolotak coming from areas of Artsakh now occupied by Azerbaijan. The monastery is also an archaeological and architectural site, with an inscription dating to 853 and medieval water pipes made of clay and wooden branches on the ground. A description of the completed Hakobavank restoration project can be seen on the reArmenia web page at https://rearmenia.com/en/collaborations/lets-restore-the-hakobavank-monastery?tab=updates .  Surb Hakob died either in 338 or 350 and is buried in the Church of Saint Jacob in Nisibis. A fragment of wood from the Ark resides in the museum at Echmiadzin. In the Armenian Apostolic Church, Surb Hakob of Nisibis’ holiday is celebrated on the Saturday between December 12 to 18.  [1] Early accounts cite the Ark as having landed on Mt. Qardu, southern Turkey, in a region called “Kordukh” in Armenian.  [2] See “The Epic Histories (Buzandaran Patmut’iwnk)” translated by Nina Garsoian, Harvard University Press, 1989 or Robert Bedrosian’s translation at https://archive.org/details/HistoryOfTheArmeniansByPawstosBuzand_569  [3] Akori was an Armenian village on the NE slope of Mt. Ararat at 5,719 feet altitude, near the border with the current Armenian Republic. The earthquake of 1840 destroyed the village and Surb Hakob monastery. In 481 AD a force of 400 Armenians routed a force of 7,000 Persians in the Battle of Akori. Akori was visited by explorers James Brice, Friedrich Parrot with Khachaur Abovian, and H.F.B. Lynch.

I’m a senior intelligence and national security reporter here at The Post, and I’m very pleased to be joined today by three of the people behind Showtime’s new spy drama airing May 19th, “Ghosts of Beirut.” I’m here with the co-creators of the show, Greg Barker and Avi Issacharoff, as well as one of the lead actresses from the series, Dina Shihabi.  Hi, everyone. Welcome. Thanks for being here.  MS. SHIHABI: Hi. Thanks for having us.  MR. BARKER: Hi.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Hi.  MR. HARRIS: It's great to see you, and congratulations on the series, which I've been watching and really enjoying. Greg, I want to start with you. This show centers on, I guess, the ghost of Beirut, a man who many people probably are going to be unfamiliar with, Imad Mughniyeh. Tell us a bit about this individual who notably was responsible for the deaths of more Americans in terrorist attacks than anyone before 9/11. Who is he, and why is he important?  Advertisement  MR. BARKER: Well, he's one of the most fascinating characters I've ever come across. I mean, he is--he was a man who from age 19, 21, outwitted the CIA, the Mossad, and rose to incredible prominence in the Middle East as a key player in the region from nowhere. And he drove the agency and Mossad sort of, kind of crazy because they couldn't find him. They didn't even know what he looked like.  And his story plays out over two-and-a-half decades, and my view is he actually shaped the modern CIA, as we know it, from what happened in the 1980s, which then resonates in the mid-2000s. So he was complicated. He was a guy from a poor--regular family, poor neighborhood, started working as a as a bodyguard to Yasser Arafat in Beirut in the late '70s, early '80s. Kind of when the PLO left Beirut, he sort of found--I think sort of found an opening, was also recruited by Iranian intelligence, and kind of stepped into a void and used that and exploited that to his own ends and became, I think, sort of more powerful and more influential at an extremely young age than he ever imagined.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it's a really--it's a very detailed portrait of how he rises into this, you know, position where he is really present for just an enormous amount of attacks that people remember from history, even if they've forgotten some of the details.  Advertisement  Avi Issacharoff, let me ask you, what was it about Imad's story that drew you to it and why you wanted to tell it visually this way?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, for me, I was kind of longtime reporter, journalist, analyst for Middle East issues working for Haaretz newspaper back in 2006 when the Israeli-Lebanese war--the second war in Lebanon started. And I covered the war as a journalist, of course, and later on, I published a book that was called ""34 Days"" together with Amos Harel. And I researched Hezbollah in Lebanon, and through the research, you know, I got familiar more with a very prominent figure inside Hezbollah, who was the head of the military wing inside Hezbollah, Imad Mughniyeh.  Later on, I wrote my thesis in my master degree in Middle Eastern studies about Hezbollah and Iranian connection, and over there, again, the name of Imad Mughniyeh was mentioned over and over again. Wherever I looked, wherever I researched, Imad Mughniyeh was this kind of a figure. So it became for me a kind of, almost an obsession, a white whale or whatever you want to call it.  Advertisement  And when I understood the personal story behind his life--his wife, his kid, the brother, the brother-in-law, everything that happened with him and the CIA and the Mossad, so you understand that you're dealing with a real dramatic story. It's not only about the terrorist that is operating in the Middle East, but this is someone way, way bigger than what you would expect from someone like that: so young, so ambitious, and still someone who managed to change the face of the Middle East and the terror as we know it, the world of terror as we know it today.  MR. HARRIS: Now, Dina Shihabi, you play a CIA officer named Lena in the series who essentially is a targeter. She's someone who is trying to find Imad Mughniyeh and is really kind of a second generation of CIA officers who've been looking for him. So talk a little bit about how you prepared for that role, and what did you know, if anything, about Mughniyeh and his story before you came to the series?  MS. SHIHABI: Not much. I had met Avi a couple of years ago, and he mentioned this story to me, and I, you know, kind of dug in a little bit. But up until I got the scripts, it wasn't a story I was that familiar with, and I was quite taken by his impact and also by his human story of--you know, his downfall is really him falling in love, and I found that so moving, because it's so easy to look at these stories in a vacuum and to see someone as a monster.  Advertisement  But when you actually go back to the history, you see what was happening in Beirut at the time and the Middle East, there really is a cause-and-effect of why someone like him makes the choices that he does and becomes who he is, and, you know, there's always a hero and a villain, depending on which side of the story you're on. And I think he was a hero to many and to himself, and the CIA was the villain and vice versa. And so I just found that the story itself was actually quite fascinating, like Greg said, an incredibly fascinating person.  When I got the part--when I was offered the part, I told Greg I wanted to be connected with as many people as possible, and he really rose for the occasion and sent me every book and every contact. And there were two women, in particular, that had an immense impact on me--Hanin Ghaddar, who's a journalist, a Shia Lebanese journalist who lives in Washington, D.C.; and then a woman who's an ex-CIA targeter. And I just spoke to them at lengths and asked them, you know, uncomfortable, intimate questions that they were very generous with.  And Hanin, in particular, had an effect on me because of her anger. I think people forget when you're looking at it from a Western perspective that Arabs get affected by someone like Imad Mughniyeh as much as the West does, maybe even more. And her anger towards what's happened in Lebanon and her--how important that was for Lena to channel that anger really stayed with me for the project.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Was there anything you learned from the former CIA officer that really stuck with you as you were trying to think about how to play Lena in this and how to take on the role?  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah. You know, when I first got the scripts, Lena had a--Lena, it stayed with her, had a lot of, like I said, anger, passion. She really follows her instincts. She stood up for herself a lot, and one thing that the CIA targeter told me is there's only so far you can go until you get taken off a project. If you're too obsessed, too passionate, pushing back too much, you'll get fired, or you'll get taken off of that particular mission and put somewhere else.  And so Greg and I met when I first got to Morocco and really found the middle ground of that, found the place where she had the personality, she had had that fuel, that fire, but was smart, good at her job, knew what her boundaries were. And I just--I think that her coming across as someone good at her job was very important to me and important to--as a promise to this woman.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Greg, for those who are, you know, maybe too young to remember, really, some of the--just the awful attacks that occurred in the Middle East in the '80s that Imad Mughniyeh was behind, give us kind of a rundown of some of the more notorious events that he played a role in.  MR. BARKER: It's extraordinary. In fact, if you glean through history books of that era, it's like his work is throughout, even though at the time it wasn't widely known.  So there's an initial suicide bombing on an Israeli base in Tyre, soon followed by an attack, massive attack on the United States embassy in 1983 in Beirut, which killed hundreds of people and wiped out the entire CIA station at the time, including--well, I won't give away--but one of the very, very prominent CIA officers who was on the cusp of what he hoped was a Middle East peace plan, a regional peace plan; TWA bombing attack on the--TWA hijacking, attack on the marine barracks, hostage taking.  Advertisement  You think about Beirut hostage crisis mid-80s, it was all Mughniyeh, including the kidnapping of the CIA station chief, William Buckley, which is portrayed in Episode 2, which really sort of brought the agency to its knees. And the list goes on and on, Argentina, more recent attacks in Hungary on Jewish--which was in [unclear], right, Avi? And then he was a military strategist, so he was the architect of Hezbollah's military strategy. A hundred thousand small missiles, that was all Mughniyeh.  Behind the scenes, there was no--there was no image of him, no photograph of him for decades. All the agency and Mossad had were--was his passport photo from when he was probably 15 years old, because we know he went to Iran with Arafat as a young guy, so--and that was it. And that's part of our story is how do they even--not even know where he is or what does he look like.  And so it's extraordinary, and you sort of can go back and look through that whole period of history and see Mughniyeh's fingerprints all over it, including then against U.S. forces in Iraq, which is how Lena comes into the story and the--and the story--the series begins with an audacious attack on American compound in Iraq in 2007 with a bunch of guides dressed like U.S. soldiers drive into a compound and kidnap American soldiers, hoping to trade them for some Iranian diplomats. And that kicks off everything and, in fact, was what led to the final unraveling of his identity, that one incident in Iraq in 2007.  Advertisement  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. The breadth of his career, really. I mean, it's astonishing, and I mean, it's--for those of us who kind of grew up in that time too, who do remember these things, I mean, these were on the news and featuring very prominently, and they were--kind of became almost sort of a background noise, as I remember it, of these just constant attacks. And it's incredible to think about one person being behind so much of it.  Avi, let me ask you. I mean, part of the compelling part of this narrative is not just that Imad has this hand in all these brutal attacks, but that he is just--he is a ghost. I mean, he is--the ""father of smoke,"" I think is one of the terms that people gave to him. How was he able to outwit the CIA and Mossad for so long and go without being captured?  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Well, I think that if you would talk to Mossad and CIA agents or handlers, officers, you would hear more of the same, like he was the best. I mean, yeah, you had bin Laden, of course, and bin Laden was, in a very twisted way, talented in what he did. But Imad Mughniyeh was one level up, if not two levels up. He was so sophisticated and smart and clever. He was very careful about his identity. He used nicknames all the time. He switched identities. He traveled to Iran. He traveled to Central America. He traveled to Africa. He met Osama bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, using a fake passport, and he was very smart about, you know, the way that he managed to maneuver everyone.  Even when he got into Beirut, even when he got into his own neighborhood, people didn't know who he was, because he stayed an enigma, because he managed to keep his identity as a kind of a--as an organizational secret. No one knew who he was, really, till the later days, of course, that he became more and more strong, popular, and then a very small group knew about his identity and how does he look like.  I think that when you understand that the two agencies needed to collaborate--and they failed when they tried to pull it separately. Over and over, they failed in trying to get to him, but when they managed to collaborate and to go together into this first-ever joint assassination operation of the CIA and the Mossad, this is where the success came from, including finding out about the way that he looks, including about reaching his whereabouts, and of course, executing the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah, it really is a tremendous joint operation, and it took, you know, decades really, didn't it, to pull it off?  And that obsession really of the CIA and of, you know, Mossad to try and find him, it comes through. And, Dina, there's one scene in particular from the first episode where you are interrogating an Iranian official, trying to just extract some information out of him to help put together the puzzle. Let's watch that clip right now, actually.  [Video plays]  MR. HARRIS: It's just a great scene of the cat-and-mouse between the two of you. It's really great, and it--how do you empathize with this and her challenge of trying to find this man who she's been, you know, clearly hunting with her colleagues for so long?  MS. SHIHABI: It goes back to what I was saying about wanting to be--there's a part of her, I think, that just wants to be the best. Obviously, there's a personal--you know, she's Shia. She's Lebanese. She grew up with stories of Lebanon and what happened to it and Hezbollah from her parents. And so there's a really deep part of her that has a connection to this. But beyond that, she is great at her job, and she wants to win.  And something Greg told me about early on is that there was a sort of ruthlessness to people that have her job, that they're after something, and they're going to do whatever it takes to get it. And doing this scene, in particular, was really fun because I wanted to find the ways in which she could connect to him and charm him and make him trust her and make him feel like they had something in common, which was all manipulative.  I don't think she's genuinely having those feelings, but she knows--she knows what her power is in that situation, and she's using it. And I think the guy--you know, plus, the guy playing Asgari is a brilliant actor, and it was really just great to have that back-and-forth with him.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And it really is--I know in talking to CIA officers and the reporting I do, you have to build rapport with people, even with people who you might find, you know, repugnant or dangerous.  MS. SHIHABI: Yeah.  MR. HARRIS: Now, you were born in Saudi Arabia and spent part of your youth, I think, in Beirut. How did those memories and your experience in Lebanon inform how you approached the role? Were you able to draw from that in putting your performance together?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah. I think it just seeps into your body, the fact that I have a connection to the place. I know what it feels like and smells like. I know what the--what it's like to walk down the street and experience the people, and so it just was an inherent part of--it's an inherent part of me, and so it just became an inherent part of what I brought to the character, something I didn't have to work for.  There's a moment in which I'm looking towards where Lebanon would be, and that's a very real moment. I know what it feels like to be there. I love Beirut. If I could live there, I would. I think it's an incredible place.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And the love for Beirut and the kind of the romanticism of it does--is something that comes through in the story really effectively, I think.  Now, Avi, in terms of the narrative of this story, it's told from the perspective of, you know, the Iranians, the Lebanese, the CIA, the Mossad, and you're really moving around from all these perspectives. You know, talk a little bit about how you construct that as a storyteller and why you felt it was important to tell it from, you know, these multiple points of view.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know, there's a kind of a cliché in script writing that says that the better the villain, the better the movie, meaning, you know, you need to make your bad guy, the terrorist, the one that is--that has killed hundreds of people, innocent people--you need to make him more interesting than just a kind of a villain, just a kind of a simple, bad guy.  This is what we did in ""Fauda,"" Lior Raz, the other co-creator of ours and us--and me in ""Fauda,"" and this is what we tried to pull here also with Greg, trying to show the other narrative, trying to show the other side. And one of the things that really struck--struck us is not only the fact that, yes, of course, as every human being, you have kind of a more complicated character than just good and evil. But one of the things that really made us understand that we have a real drama is to understand that the process that the Mossad and the CIA went through in order to reach their obsession, in order to get to the bad guy, they were willing to do horrifying things, including things that we might call as terrorist attacks.  1985, Bir al-Abed, southern suburb of Beirut, there's a car bomb exploding at the entrance to a mosque, a Shiite mosque that is led by Sheikh Fadlallah, in an attempt that was pulled by the CIA and probably some Phalanges in order to kill Sheikh Fadlallah and Imad Mughniyeh himself. Eighty-five people--most of them were innocent--got killed in this explosion. So this is horrible to think about.  Then later on, something that we didn't get into the show, but 1995, the Mossad pulls out a horrifying operation killing the brother of Imad Mughniyeh that wasn't really involved in Hezbollah, just in order to get Imad to the funeral and then to kill him over there. And by the way, Imad didn't get to the funeral. So you understand that the price at both sides, Mossad and the CIA, are paying in what they do is that actually it's eating their moral from the inside. You lose your own morality when you go on a war against the terrorist like Imad Mughniyeh.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Greg--  MR. BARKER: And then for--  MR. HARRIS: Sorry.  MR. BARKER: For Dina's character and her counterpart in the Mossad, they're grappling with that history themselves, and how do we carry out this sort of joint assassination without succumbing to these horrible accidents that their agencies committed in the past? And that's kind of the driving force for the back end of the series, but the history is alive in them and the institutions there within.  MR. HARRIS: Right. And there's even that--  MS. SHIHABI: And the--  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. Sorry. I'm sorry, Dina. Please go ahead.  MS. SHIHABI: No, I was just reiterating what Greg said is that that's something we talked about a lot. You know, you--when you're working for the CIA or the Mossad, you're carrying the mistakes that have been made along--you know, it's part of your history. It's the consequence of what they all come into this moment in time with, and so I think they're--you know, Teddy and Lena are trying to do better, but I think their morality gets in question too. I don't think you get to kill someone without your soul getting destroyed in some way, no matter what.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah. And there--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: I think that's one of the--  MR. HARRIS: The car bomb you mentioned, Avi, one of the CIA officers, in fact, says to his boss, if we do this, we're going to pay a price for it. So he's warning them, isn't he?  MS. SHIHABI: Mm-hmm.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. That's right.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: You know that towards the end, that really happened in reality, according to the research that we did. You know that right before they executed the assassination, there was a kind of a gathering in the headquarters where they pulled the operation, and there was a demand from the people in charge on both sides, from all the people that were around them: After we execute the assassination, no one is going to clap his hands. No one is going to cheer up or anything like that. This is a man, and we're going to take people's life. And this is what happened in reality. People didn't clap their hands or cheer up after the assassination.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, talk a little bit about the research for this show. When the show opens, you point out that this is a story based on deeply--it's a fictional version of ""deeply researched""--I think is the word you use--historical events. So how did you all go about piecing this together and choosing when to insert, you know, fictional characters and then real-life characters? How did you go about that?  MR. BARKER: It was a long and very intellectually stimulating process. Avi and I and our team spent at least six months and longer researching this by talking to people directly. There's really not a book or a series of articles we could just rely on. We did our own research.  And I found that by talking to people who may have been involved and saying, look, we--it was clear they couldn't go on the record, because they're just--they couldn't say anything of substance on the record. But what I said is like, look, we're going to--we're going to fictionalize a lot of this, but we want it to be as authentic as possible, so tell me what you think happened or what might have happened. And then people like opened up, and then we got all this interesting, really amazing details, a lot of which found a way in the scripts and different perspectives. Like the CIA would say we built the bomb and we constructed it, and the Mossad was like, no, we built the bomb. So we kind of had to choose our own path through it.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. BARKER: Choose our own truth. It was--and it was great. I mean, Showtime gave us the time to do this and to really sort of dig in deep, and then constructing it into a narrative was--you know, was challenging because there's so much information, but that's part of the fun as well. And it was--yeah, it was an extremely intellectually, sort of satisfying process.  MR. HARRIS: Yeah.  MR. ISSACHAROFF: And part of the fun was to understand that, you know, what Greg had just mentioned that, you know, Mossad is saying we did it, CIA is saying, no, we did it, and it's a kind of a competition. But even when they pulled this thing together, they had some arguments. They had some, you know, disagreements, including one of the picks of the show, which is the argument about whether to kill Qasem Soleimani, the head of Quds force in the Revolutionary Guard, Iranian Revolutionary Guards, yes or no, because he was walking together with Imad Mughniyeh, and then you come to the question of should we execute the assassination, then kill Qasem Soleimani or not? The Israelis were in favor; the Americans were completely against. And at the end of the day, the Americans--the Israelis followed the Americans, and they did not execute the assassination of both of them.  MR. BARKER: Yeah. It was really satisfying to get into--to try to unpack that intelligence relationship, which is very complicated and has--I mean, it goes all the way back to the '80s in Beirut, and to kind of get inside that was dramatically--was, you know, fun and I think very authentic and will be eye-opening to people.  MR. HARRIS: And, Greg, did you find that people were perhaps--maybe not many on the record, but were willing from the CIA and Mossad to talk about this, and how much do they officially acknowledge publicly today about the role that their services played in ultimately killing Mughniyeh?  MR. BARKER: Officially, at least as far as the CIA, nothing.  Yeah. I mean, I actually came to the story a decade ago by doing a--when I was doing a project on the hunt for bin Laden for HBO, and a number of senior people then were telling me that their true obsession was Mughniyeh and Hezbollah, which dated back to their time in Beirut in the mid-'80s, so--and it goes--I found people willing to talk about it off the record and go into--because it--the wounds, the emotional scars run very, very deep, to the highest levels.  But what was interesting is a lot of the people who were young officers on the ground in the Middle East, often in Beirut in the mid-'80s, after 9/11 are in senior management positions and are making decisions at that time informed by the searing, sort of emotional turmoil that they went through back early in their career.  So they wanted to talk. Officially, we--you know, I sort of knocked on the front door of the agency and was like, ""What can you tell us?"" and the word came back, ""Nothing.""  [Laughter]  MS. SHIHABI: So then we did our own.  MR. HARRIS: I can sympathize with that experience covering the CIA.  MR. BARKER: Yeah  MR. HARRIS: You unearthed a remarkable amount of detail, though. It's really quite extraordinary.  Din, I'll put our last question to you. What do you want people to take away from this series? So much of it is about history, but it's such a deeply emotional and, in many ways, actually quite empathetic story about Imad Mughniyeh, which is really challenging, I think. So what do you want people to walk away from with this story?  MS. SHIHABI: I mean, that's what's--that was so beautiful about the scripts to begin with was that it's a really character-based, character-driven story, and I think you get to spend time with everyone in a way that shows their humanity and also shows their flaws. And that's always going to be the best story that's told when you finish watching something and you feel empathy towards the person that you might have thought was just a monster, and you have complicated feelings towards the people that you thought were just the hero. And you leave, I think, with a more expansive view of people and who they become because of their circumstances and their choices.  And I hope it reflects back on to, you know, the viewers themselves, which we all have parts of ourselves that are--because of generational trauma, because of what we went through in our adolescence or--it's just we are complicated. We're contradictory. We're--no one is simplistic. And I think this show does a really good job in giving you that feeling by the end of it.  MR. HARRIS: And I would think as an actor too, those are really some of the most satisfying kinds of roles to play too, right?  MS. SHIHABI: Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, every role has that in it, and then it takes good writers like Greg, Avi, and Joëlle to really put it on the page and bring it to life. And then I just have to, you know, make sense of it all on the day. [Laughs]  MR. HARRIS: Well, you all did a great job of that, truly, in a very complex and emotional story.  So it's unfortunately all the time we have to talk about it. The series drops on May 19th, ""Ghosts of Beirut."" Thank you to Avi Issacharoff and Greg Barker, the co-creators--  MR. ISSACHAROFF: Thank you.  MR. HARRIS: --and Dina Shihabi, the actor in the role of Lena. Thank you so much for joining us to talk about it today. It was a really great conversation.  MS.

"assassination","2023-05-09","09:00:00","{""FoxChapel"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:35:05","- Advertisement -  Culture War wages within Hernando County School District  May 9, 2023 School Board Meeting  - Advertisement -  In a somewhat unexpected appearance, the Board also heard from Fox Chapel Middle School teacher Fawn Renczkowski. Renczkowski is the wife of transgender teacher Ashlee Belle Renczkowski, who has been the center of the Fox Chapel incident. Renczkowski also serves as the Middle School Director on the executive leadership Board of the Hernando County teacher’s union. Renczkowski said she came to “speak the truth because  so few have decided the truth is worth listening to.” She went on to say that the “far-right extremists and hate groups would prefer fake news and misinformation, halftruths,  and whole lies, hyperbole in anything that promotes us being pawns in their political game.” Quoting John 8:32, in which Jesus said, “The truth will set you free,” Renczkowski said, “Here I am, doing the Lord’s work.” She went on to say:  “The truth is that many people don’t care what happened at Fox Chapel. They don’t care what she (the teacher) did or didn’t say. They only care about pushing a false narrative to further their cause. Many teachers are removed from the classroom, but none make local or national headlines, so why did she?  Because she’s different and doesn’t conform to the status quo. It’s clear in every headline why she was targeted. She found happiness in herself, and she lives her truth, and hate groups can not stand it.  They’d rather she be dead than exist in front of students, and that’s what their goal for the last year has been. To bully her and push her to a breaking point. The truth is we’ve been under attack for the last year by a local hate group that targeted her for being different.  - Advertisement -  Neither of us fits their idea of this emotionless robot of a teacher who doesn’t make connections with their students but only teaches content. So we’re a threat to them, not because of what we’ve done or said, but who we are.  The truth is we’ve been harassed online and in person, bullied, and threatened because of a false claim, because of a lie. The truth is we asked for help from some of the School Board members who are praised and put on a pedestal by these hate groups, and they ignored our pleas. They claim not to support bullying but have promoted our mistreatment, even contributing to it.  The truth is so many we have faithfully served for over a decade betrayed us and turned their backs on us because it was easier to believe the lies than using reading comprehension skills and draw conclusions on their own. They let these hateful people write the narrative and attempt to destroy lives because it was easier to play victim than to look at reality.  The truth is, she never threatened anyone. One person’s word is not fact unless backed up by the evidence, and everyone involved in the investigation said there was no threat. They said this was a mental health report and would be treated as such.  The truth is someone betrayed their badge and promise to serve and protect because it was more important to hurt someone because they’re different.  The truth is, everyone who knows her knows she’d never say or do such a thing, and we are all hurting from the character assassination carried out this last month.  The truth is students feel safe with her. They love her, and miss her, and can not wait for her to come back. They see her differences in love and respect her. They know she’d stand in harm’s way to protect them, and she has her whole career.  The truth is, the few of you who will only believe the lies will hear me tonight. And you haven’t believed for the last month when the truth was the truth was clear and evident.  You’d rather us leave and be gone to stop serving our purpose and caring for our students. But we will not stop. We will continue to fight for our students and love them despite the attacks. Because the truth is we love our students, and they need us now more than ever.  And finally, the truth is, this could happen to anyone. No one is safe in this hateful social-political climate, So please be kind, as you never know what someone is going through. And thank you to those who have supported us and seen the truth. You have held us above water as people have tried to drown us. We’re forever grateful.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJuYW5kb3N1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNy93aWZlLW9mLXN1c3BlbmRlZC10ZWFjaGVyLWFzaGxlZS1iZWxsZS1yZW5jemtvd3NraS1zcGVha3MtYWJvdXQtYWZ0ZXJtYXRoLW9mLWZjbXMtaW5jaWRlbnQv0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhlcm5hbmRvc3VuLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3dpZmUtb2Ytc3VzcGVuZGVkLXRlYWNoZXItYXNobGVlLWJlbGxlLXJlbmN6a293c2tpLXNwZWFrcy1hYm91dC1hZnRlcm1hdGgtb2YtZmNtcy1pbmNpZGVudC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-11","14:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:41:02","(Bloomberg) -- Pakistan’s former premier Imran Khan said the police have surrounded his house in eastern city of Lahore to potentially arrest him again, stoking concerns of a repeat of the violent clashes between his supporters and security forces last week.  A minister in Punjab province claimed Khan was sheltering dozens of people, who allegedly attacked state and military property. The ex-cricket star, who denies the allegations, was given until 2 p.m. local time, Thursday, to hand over the suspects.  This marks a further escalation in the showdown between Khan, 70, and the military that has an outsized influence on security and domestic politics. In recent days, the army has publicly condemned those who they have identified as Khan supporters for instigating last week’s attacks and vowed to try the perpetrators in military courts.  “This is the most unprecedented crackdown,” Khan told the UK’s Channel 4 in an interview posted on Thursday morning. “In 27 years of my party’s existence, we have never indulged in violent protests, now 7,500 people have been arrested in my party. All the senior leadership has been arrested.”  Khan has called for a judicial commission headed by the chief justice to probe the attacks on state and military property. He has warned the government may take the next step of banning his party since it has started calling the group a terrorist organization.  “There are no raid or arrest plans as of now. The deployment is normal and routine,” a Lahore police spokesman said by phone. Khan’s residence already had a heavy police contingent present outside for security but this was also the scene of at least two other attempts to arrest him in March.  Firebrand  The politician, known for his firebrand speeches, was dramatically arrested last Tuesday in the country’s capital Islamabad by paramilitary troops in relation to a corruption case. The Supreme Court later ordered his release calling his detention illegal and Khan’s legal team has obtained protective bail for scores of cases to prevent another arrest.  At least eight people were killed and hundreds injured in the clashes that broke out between Khan’s supporters and security forces following his arrest. The escalating political crisis takes place as Pakistan faces its worst economic distress in decades, including Asia’s fastest inflation, and is struggling to revive a $6.7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout.  Khan was ousted as premier by a no confidence vote in April last year and has since sought to return to power by pushing for early elections. His rival, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, rejected his demands and said the government will complete its term that ends in August.  To force national polls, Khan has pushed for by-elections and his party has dissolved the provincial assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it has majorities. The government has refused to hold those polls, saying there’s inadequate funds and these provincial elections should be held at the same time as the national vote later this year.  Khan remains wildly popular with Pakistanis, with an opinion survey showing that a majority blame the current government for the economic crisis and the tough IMF reforms. His appearance at rallies often draws tens of thousands of people.  It was at one such rally in November that Khan was shot in the leg. He blamed the government and the military for orchestrating an assassination attempt, which they have strongly denied. Things came to a head earlier in May when Khan revived those allegations at a weekend gathering and on social media, prompting the military to have a very public war of words with him before his arrest last week.  Khan’s allegations stem from Pakistan’s own history where no prime minister has served a full five-year term in office. Those who lasted more than two years were either exiled or killed, including Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007 during a campaign stop in an attack similar to the one against Khan in November.  “They are too scared for elections because they are scared I will win,” Khan later told Al Jazeera, referring to the military and the ruling coalition. “They are doing everything to make sure I am out of the election race.”  (Recasts lead, updates throughout)  ©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9pbXJhbi1raGFuLXNheXMtcG9saWNlLWhhdmUtYXJyaXZlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtYXJyZXN0LTEuMTkyMTQyN9IBZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9pbXJhbi1raGFuLXNheXMtcG9saWNlLWhhdmUtYXJyaXZlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtYXJyZXN0LTEuMTkyMTQyNy5hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-28","Not Discerned","{""Turkey"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 11:38:20","Last week, a sex tape purporting to feature Muharrem İnce, a third-party candidate in Turkey’s presidential election, circulated online. İnce said that the tape was a deepfake—“This is not my private life, it’s slander,” he said, according to The Guardian, claiming that the footage had been ripped from an “Israeli porn site”—but he dropped out of the race regardless, citing a longer campaign of character assassination. “What I have seen in these last forty-five days, I have not seen in forty-five years,” he said. The supposed sex tape was not the only occasion on which claims of technological deception had surfaced during the campaign. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the main opposition candidate, accused Russia (without offering specifics) of weaponizing deepfake technology to boost Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the incumbent president. And, at a rally, Erdoğan played footage that had been manipulated to suggest close ties between Kılıçdaroğlu and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which the US and EU have branded a terrorist group.  According to the BBC, İnce also said that he was dropping out to avoid being blamed for splitting the anti-Erdoğan vote. At the time, pundits deemed it a live possibility that, despite İnce’s slender support, his withdrawal could put a nail in Erdoğan’s coffin after twenty years in power—with days to go until the vote, Kılıçdaroğlu was polling just one percentage point shy of the fifty-percent threshold needed to win the election outright. But the results would paint a different picture: as the official count neared completion, it was Erdoğan who sat just shy of that threshold, with Kılıçdaroğlu further back on forty-five percent of the vote. (In confidently predicting Erdoğan’s demise, many pundits, Sinan Ciddi and Steven A. Cook wrote for Foreign Policy, indulged “too much focus on polls” and “too much Twitter navel-gazing.” Sound familiar?) The election is now set for a runoff on May 28. Erdoğan is expected to prevail—despite having overseen an economic crisis, deepening political authoritarianism, and the botched response to the massive earthquake that devastated southern Turkey and neighboring Syria in February.  Among other groups, the stakes of the election have been particularly acute for Turkey’s press, which has seen its freedom to report systematically eroded under Erdoğan. While the election was mostly considered to be free, it was also in many respects unfair—not least due to Turkey’s deeply skewed media environment. After the first round, observers led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe deemed that “continued restrictions on fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression hindered the participation of some opposition politicians and parties, civil society and independent media in the election process.”  As the election unfolded, I spoke with my colleague Pesha Magid, who has covered Turkey, including for CJR; in March, she profiled a reporter who had tracked the aftermath of, and political fallout from, the earthquake. We talked about the context for the vote, the threats that journalists faced in covering it, and what a victory for Erdoğan or Kılıçdaroğlu would respectively mean for press freedom. Our typed conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.    You recently wrote for CJR about Murat Bayram, a reporter in Turkey who covered the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that hit that country and Syria earlier this year. How did the upcoming election play into your—and his—reporting? And how has the earthquake aftermath affected the election—and the coverage of it—since then?  Since the earthquake, I think the election has been lurking at the back of most people who cover Turkey’s minds. The failure of the government’s earthquake response caused a backlash of anger from communities that would normally support Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Many survivors were first-hand witnesses to the government’s fatal mismanagement of the emergency response, waiting days for lifesaving rescue teams to show up. Over fifty thousand people died in the earthquake. Many of those deaths could have been prevented either through a competent rescue effort or through the government enforcing building codes.  Sign up for CJR 's daily email  Murat Bayram witnessed for himself some of the anger on the streets when he was reporting on the earthquake. He spoke about people who were asking where the government and the media were. I don’t think anyone has forgotten the earthquake or the images that spread on social media of people waiting for their loved ones to be rescued from the rubble. There’s an odd symmetry with Erdoğan’s own rise to power, which followed another devastating earthquake in 1999 and a bungled response from the government of the time. One of Erdoğan’s electoral promises back then was to do better on earthquake preparedness.  The coverage of the election in Turkey has been a complicated topic as the vast majority of major news organizations have been co-opted by the government and no longer provide independent or critical reports. Much of the government-affiliated press took the line that the earthquake was an unpreventable disaster and that the government was doing the best it could. They blamed scapegoats for some of the worst failures. Election coverage has followed a similar pattern of most major channels supporting the AKP, while a slim slice of independent media has been providing more critical coverage.  Going into the election, what were the stakes for the Turkish press?  Under Erdoğan, Turkey has become one of the world’s worst jailers of journalists. Journalists are commonly beaten, harassed, or targeted with legal cases. Only a scattered few small outlets remain independent. The stakes were the freedom of the press as a whole.  Did we see any repression of the press linked directly to election coverage? And how did this affect the way in which the first round of the election was conducted?  The short answer is yes. Since May 9, at least four journalists have been found guilty of terrorism charges, while others have faced beatings and harassment during their work.  On May 10, a journalist named Muhammed Yavaş posted a critique of the Grey Wolves, a hypernationalist group, on Facebook, only to then be beaten up by a local leader of the group. In a joint statement on May 10, the monitoring organizations Human Rights Watch and Article 19 warned of the Turkish government’s history of online censorship and throttling of social media ahead of the elections; subsequently, Twitter blocked some posts inside Turkey.  There was also the worry that pro-government media may skew information in favor of the AKP. According to the journalist Amberin Zaman, writing in Al-Monitor, “In April, Erdogan got 32 hours of air time on state TV compared with 32 minutes for Kilicdaroglu.” As the election results began to come in, some expressed fears that the state-run Anadolu agency may preemptively announce an Erdoğan victory before all the results were counted. In the end, both sides claimed to be ahead, with Erdoğan telling his supporters, “Although the final results are not in yet, we are leading by far,” according to the New York Times.  What has the opposition, led by Kılıçdaroğlu, said about press freedom in the country, if anything? And how credible has that sounded?  Kılıçdaroğlu has promised a return to “democracy” and many journalists expressed hope that this would mean that press freedom would again be possible. Many media watchers seem cautiously hopeful that a Kılıçdaroğlu victory would also be the way to open the door to an independent press. “We still would have a press freedom problem if the opposition takes power,” said Kenan Şener, general secretary of the Ankara-based Journalists’ Association, in an interview with the Committee to Protect Journalists. “However, I believe it’s certain that we will be in a better spot than this.”  On the other hand, when Kılıçdaroğlu’s opposition party, the CHP, was in power in the nineties it had a checkered record when it came to freedom of the press. It was known for also jailing journalists that opposed it, although not to the same extent as Erdoğan.  How do you see the Turkish media landscape changing as a result of this election, as it now heads to a runoff?  It truly depends on the results. If the opposition wins then I anticipate that we will see an initial gleeful rush of media freedom as journalists stretch their wings for the first time in years. But it’s unclear how long that would last—as I said, the CHP does not have the best record when it comes to journalists— though it seems unlikely that the crackdown on the press would remain as stringent as it has been under Erdoğan. I am hopeful that journalists who have long been in jail on trumped-up charges might finally be released.  If Erdoğan wins, things will undoubtedly get worse. If nothing else, the closeness of this election shows that the AKP’s grip on power is fraying. That insecurity may cause it to take an even more draconian grip on power. As Barış Altıntaş, the director of Istanbul’s Media and Law Studies Association, said in the same CPJ interview: “If they [the AKP] win by a slim margin, they might lose some of their perceived legitimacy, feel cornered, and become more repressive towards free speech and media freedoms.”    Other notable stories:  ICYMI: What a national-security regulator could mean for media deals  Jon Allsop is a freelance journalist whose work has appeared in the New York Review of Books, Foreign Policy, and The Nation, among other outlets.

One of the biggest questions that have been pestering fans is what happened in Reverie while Luffy and company had their hands full in Wano. With Sabo having a meeting with Monkey D. Dragon and Ivankov, the truth behind Cobra's demise is seemingly preparing to be revealed.  Warning. If you have yet to read the latest chapter of One Piece's manga, Chapter 1083, you might want to steer clear as we'll be diving into some serious spoiler territory. There have been many rumors swirling as to what took place on Reverie for the past few years in our world, as mysteries have been surrounding how Cobra died and what role Sabo had in the assassination. In the Grand Line, most swashbucklers and denizens believe that Luffy's brother was the one responsible for the benevolent ruler's demise, but it would seem that this might not be the case as Sabo has been hinting otherwise.  (Photo: Shueisha)  What Happened To Cobra?  To begin, Monkey D. Dragon seems to hint that the general public's thoughts on the event aren't exactly the truth, ""Regardless of the truth behind it, the assassination of King Cobra has turned you into a hero in the people's eyes. From the perspective of the rebellious, anyone affiliated with the world government is an enemy. Of course, there are many wicked kings who oppress their people but there are also wise and just kings who are capable rulers. King Cobra of Alabasta was known far and wide as a noble leader, a man of great character, but new does not always spread accurately.""  Sabo then added to this thought, putting gas on the fire as to the truth behind Cobra's murder, ""Well I'm sorry to King Cobra, but this way suits me just fine. Anything that gets the flames of revolution burning."" The chapter itself then proceeds to take us back to the Reverie event, as readers are able to witness Cobra being moved to the Five Elders in a wheelchair. While the truth has yet to be revealed, it certainly seems as though Sabo wasn't the one who delivered the killing blow to Cobra.  How do you think King Cobra died? Do you see Sabo and his revolutionaries playing a major role in this final arc?

"assassination","2025-12-16","Not Discerned","{""TaipeiCity"", ""TaipeiCity"", ""Taiwan""}","Thu 18 May 2023 05:17:10","In Taiwan, the main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has announced that Hou You-yi is its candidate for the 2024 presidential election. The decision comes after a very public campaign for the candidacy by Terry Guo, the billionaire founder and chairman of the Foxconn electronics manufacturing group. The KMT declined to hold a vote of its membership and instead party chairman Chu Li-lun chose the party’s candidate directly.  Hou You-yi is mayor of New Taipei City (known as Taipei County until it was upgraded to city status in 2010). Before that, Hou had a long and storied career as a police officer, rising to head Taiwan’s Criminal Investigation Bureau in 2003.  He was involved in the attempt to arrest democracy activist Deng Nan-jung in 1989 at the offices of the dissident magazine Freedom Era Weekly, and several months later Deng self-immolated to protest authoritarianism in Taiwan. Hou was also placed in command of the investigation into the attempted assassination of former president Chen Shui-bian during the 2004 presidential election.  Hou’s rival is Lai Ching-te from the incumbent Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Lai is currently vice president of Taiwan and unsuccessfully challenged President Tsai Ing-wen in a DPP presidential primary in 2019. Tsai went on to score a crushing win against the KMT in the 2020 election. However, Tsai can’t run for a third term, and Lai faced no challengers in the DPP for 2024.  Lai has a background in public health and a master’s from Harvard University. He began his political career as a legislator in the 1990s before serving as a very popular mayor of Tainan, a DPP stronghold, in the 2010s. He joined the Tsai government as premier in 2017.  The third candidate in the election is the former mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je. Ko has a celebrated medical background in critical and emergency care and transplant surgery. He was first elected mayor in 2014, against the KMT and other independents, and re-elected in 2018.  In 2019, Ko founded his own political party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), which shares its name but not its politics with the party founded in 1927 by Chiang Wei-shui, Cai Pei-huo and other leading figures of the time. In a very divisive political landscape, the TPP aims to occupy the centre ground with an emphasis on non-partisan governance, but Ko is also known for his public gaffes and political naivety.  Polling has Hou and Lai in a close race with around 30% support each, with Lai generally a few points ahead. Ko sits in third at around 20%. These numbers are hardly predictive this far out from the vote in January, but with each party having chosen its candidate, onlookers can expect a very different presidential campaign and a shift in tone in Taiwan’s politics.  As the DPP candidate, Lai has emphasised continuity with Tsai, but he is still a very different style of politician. Tsai casts herself as disciplined, resolute and technocratic, even somewhat above the fray. Lai, although he couldn’t be called a populist, has built a more hands-on career through local politics in the south.  The KMT’s Hou offers his no-nonsense and pragmatic style to a party that wrestles with its authoritarian legacy and its close links with Taiwan’s business interests. Although Hou and Lai are stridently critical of each other, they occupy some of the same space as political personas.  Ko, for his part, will take votes away from both major parties but may prove more damaging for the KMT in its traditional stronghold of Taipei.  As candidates, both Hou and Lai have given voice to issues in Taiwanese politics that are too often subsumed by cross-strait relations, especially the north–south divide and gender and class politics. But neither candidate has a straightforward story to tell on those issues yet, and that could make for a bruising campaign.  Across the strait, Beijing would be deeply unhappy with Lai as president, seeing him as more explicitly Taiwanese nationalist than Tsai, however careful he might be in the campaign. Hou has stayed in line with the KMT’s position. He has already ruled out Beijing’s formula of ‘one country, two systems’ for unification and doesn’t represent the factions of the KMT for whom Chinese identity is central to their politics.  Whether it be Lai Ching-te or Hou You-yi, understanding the next president of Taiwan will require some work from an international community that has grown comfortable with and sympathetic to Tsai. Her progressive politics are accessible and familiar to interested international observers.  Hou and Lai, however, practise a politics steeped in community life and the social divides of Taiwan. While they are each compelling, the world will require deeper familiarity with the Taiwanese story to fully understand them as politicians.  As Beijing continues its threatening military activity around Taiwan, developing that familiarity will be a good starting point for policymakers around the world as they prepare for the 2024 election outcome.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzcGlzdHJhdGVnaXN0Lm9yZy5hdS9nZXQtcmVhZHktdG8tbWVldC10aGUtbmV4dC1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtdGFpd2FuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This is especially true if you are a soldier or a civilian who gets in the way – but it is not true for everyone.  Not for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at least not this time.  When Palestinian Islamic Jihad began firing rockets to avenge the May 2 death of one of their own, resulting from his 86-day hunger strike, Netanyahu’s ultra-hawkish coalition partners demanded a brutal response. They would have preferred carpet bombing Gaza with B-52s but appeared to be mollified by a highly focused assassination campaign that killed six top PIJ leaders.  The risk-averse Israeli prime minister went to war with PIJ and emerged victorious on all fronts. He got to burnish his “Mr. Security” credentials without a major land war and – at least for the time being – saved his coalition and stopped the plunge in his polling numbers.  By firing more than 1,400 rockets and mortars across the southern half of Israel – even targeting Tel Aviv – PIJ gave Netanyahu a temporary respite from the massive public demonstrations against his attempted overthrow of the nation’s independent judiciary. Only tens of thousands of protesters, instead of the usual hundreds of thousands, turned out last weekend.  The Iron Dome air defense missile systems is seen during operational trials conducted following the conclusion Operation Shield and Arrow on May 14, 2023 (credit: DEFENSE MINISTRY)  This latest conflict may also have dealt a body blow to the Israeli far Right’s judicial coup. Former senior Mossad official Yossi Alpha pointed out that “the fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’”  “The fight against PIJ was led by the very IAF pilots and IDF Unit 8200 cyber experts who have spearheaded the public protest and been labeled by the far Right as ‘traitors.’” Yossi Alpha  With the international media focused on the spectacular footage of Israel’s anti-missile systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, Finland expressed an interest in these defensive weapons.  Finland joins Singapore, Canada, South Korea, India, Slovakia and the Czech Republic in wishing to acquire the life-saving Iron Dome and David’s Sling. Israel’s new friends in the Gulf are also interested, as they face threats from Iran.  The US helped finance their development, and US defense contractor Raytheon partnered with the Israeli developer, Rafael, to build the systems.  War is good for business and for Netanyahu  War is good for business. Just look at the defense plants across the US and Western Europe working overtime to keep the Russian bear from restoring its old empire.  There is, however, a country that wants and needs Israel’s advanced missile defense, but is off limits – Ukraine – because Bibi doesn’t want to anger Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless, Israel and Ukraine have a common enemy, Iran, which provides most of PIJ’s missiles aimed at Israel, and Russia’s drones targeting Ukraine.  The IDF reported that Iron Dome intercepted 95% of PIJ rockets targeting populated areas. Hundreds more landed in open fields. An estimated 290 PIJ rockets launched toward Israel landed in Gaza, killing at least four Palestinians, including children.  PIJ rockets killed an 82-year-old Jewish Israeli woman in Rehovot and wounded five people. Another PIJ rocket killed a Palestinian man from Gaza working legally in Israel on Moshav Shokeda, while his brother and a Bedouin Israeli were wounded in the strike, i24 News reported.  Many of Israel’s critics point to the disproportionate casualty rate on the two sides. Not enough dead Jews, apparently. Health officials in Gaza said 33 people were killed in the latest round, including 18 terrorists and six children. At least four uninvolved Gazans were killed in failed rocket launches, Times of Israel reported.  PIJ, it turns out, killed more Gaza civilians than it did Israelis, and it wasn’t for lack of trying. PIJ, like Hamas, fires its rockets, missiles and mortars indiscriminately toward populated areas in Israel for the undeniable purpose of creating terror and death. PIJ and Hamas are both US State Department-designated Foreign Terror Organizations and the EU terror organizations list. Hamas dominates Gaza but decided to sit out this round of fighting.  The Israeli Air Force insists its aim is precise and targeted only terrorists, to avoid civilian casualties – but terrorist leadership headquarters and many launch sites are intentionally located in populated urban areas.  There’s a brief respite in the latest round of war – thanks once again to an Egyptian-negotiated ceasefire – while Iran rearms its proxies (and arms Russia as well). PIJ brags about the damage it inflicted on Israel, and vows new revenge for the six martyred leaders lost to the hated Zionists. Meanwhile, Rafael and Raytheon are taking orders for Iron Domes and David’s Slings. And Netanyahu has appeased his uber-hawks.  And just as sure as God made little green apples, there will be another round of killing because the leaders on both sides seem to know of no other way to settle their differences.  If there is one thing today’s Israeli and Palestinian leaders appear to have in common, it is a lack of interest in finding a political solution.  There will be more Shield and Arrow-type operations, each a bit longer and more lethal until there is new leadership that does not see peaceful coexistence as an existential threat.  Until then, you can dust off that old Vietnam-era poster with the slogan, “War is not healthy for children and other living things” and add: “except for politicians’ poll numbers and arms makers’ order books.”  The writer is a Washington-based journalist, consultant and lobbyist, and the former American Israel Public Affairs Committee legislative director.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUtNzQzMzY10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The French company didn't achieve good results last year with some of its releases. Titles like Skull and Bones are taking longer than expected while others like Beyond Good and Evil 2 have completely disappeared from the radar. In such a scenario, Ubisoft is betting on one of its most popular series to save 2024. We are talking about Assassin's Creed, of course.  After the success of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the developer seems to be taking a slightly different direction with Assassin's Creed: Mirage. The upcoming game will offer a smaller and more intimate experience, more character-driven, and much closer to the first installments in the series.  The new game will be a return to the origins of the series with a story set in Baghdad during the height of the Persian Empire. It will star Basim, a young street thief seeking justice who enters a secret organization that will change his life and the story forever. Ubisoft aims to deliver gameplay more focused on stealth and assassination with Assassin's Creed Mirage, which is something that the fans of the series have been requesting for a while.  More resources for the series  Ubisoft has recently revealed plans to expand the team working on Assassin's Creed by 40% in the coming years, raising their numbers from 2.000 to 2.800, which shows its commitment to the series. Assassin's Creed Mirage will be the first game to benefit from such an improvement. Meanwhile, there are reports pointing at an October release for the game, but nothing has been officially confirmed so far.  We will surely know more about Assassin's Creed Mirage in the upcoming Ubisoft Forward, which is scheduled for June 12.

"assassination","2022-12-27","Not Discerned","{""Turkey"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 20:37:27","The Islamic Republic’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) have made a criminal Iran’s leading drug lord, Iran International can reveal.  Information obtained by Iran International shows how Naji Sharifi-Zindashti and his cartel now dominate the narcotics trade thanks to the support of the government militia.  His extraordinary rise comes despite his having killed a prison guard in Iran and fleeing abroad, only to return with impunity.  Investigative reporter Mojtaba Pourmohsen has uncovered how a recent rise in the number of executions of convicts sentenced to death on drug-related charges is the result of infighting between rival drug cartels with connections within the ranks of the IRGC.  Naji Sharifi-Zindashti  Emerging triumphant from this criminal war, Sharifi-Zindashti and his accomplices – dubbed “The Friends’ Club” – have used the IRGC’s vast reach and control over transit routes and logistics to gain the upper hand in Iran's drug market, according to sources.  The Club comprises senior IRGC officials and high-ranking members of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council as well as managers from Tehran Municipality and members of parliament.  Sharifi-Zindashti not only pays bribes but also supplies opium and heroin for the personal consumption of many of these senior officials.  According to the sources, Sharifi-Zindashti’s gangs traffic more than 20 percent of drugs distributed across Iran and about 35 percent of the drugs pushed in the capital Tehran.  The narcotics that are confiscated and destroyed as part of the Islamic Republic’s regular war on drugs mostly belong to rival gangs.  Iranian police arrested Zindashti in 1996 for a drug deal. Sentenced to death on drug-related charges, Zindashti along with an accomplice killed a guard during transfer to the court to testify in another case. Zindashti fled to Turkey, where he established a drug and human trafficking cartel.  Zindashti's villa in Istanbul with expensive cars and personalized license plates  He has since been cooperating with the Islamic Republic’s intelligence agencies in numerous cases, including the abduction in 2020 of Swedish-Iranian Habib Chaab (Asyud), a political activist and former leader of the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA) who was executed earlier in the month.  In December 2020, the Turkish Police arrested 13 members of the Zindashti Cartel on charges of collaboration with Iranian intelligence. According to Turkey's official government news agency, Anatoli, the Iranian Intelligence Ministry had been using the gang to assassinate or abduct Iranian dissidents in Turkey at least since 2015.  Zindashti is also suspected to have been behind the assassination of Iranian dissident Masoud Molavi Vardanjani in Istanbul in November 2019. Molavi-Vardanjani, a former Iranian intelligence operative and a civil engineer by education, fled to Turkey in 2018 and launched a Telegram channel, called Black Box, focused on corruption allegations against Iran’s extraterritorial Qods Force, top officials in the office of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, judges and other senior figures.  In 2018 some of the members of the group and Zindashti himself were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of assassinating Saeed Karimian, the founder and head of Gem TV, and other killings related to drug trafficking. They were eventually freed, reportedly as a result of lobbying, bribery and lack of adequate evidence.  After his release Zindashti returned to Iran and despite his convictions for drug trafficking and the killing of a prison guard in the past, Zindashti leads a free life in Iran. In December 2022, he was honored during a ceremony by Iran’s Education Ministry as one of the members of the Charity for School Constructions. He is a benefactor and CEO of Zindashti Star Charitable Institute, constructing shopping malls and schools, yet also a drug lord with links to regime insiders.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyYW5pbnRsLmNvbS9lbi8yMDIzMDUxNzE4MzjSAShodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmFuaW50bC5jb20vZW4vMjAyMzA1MTcxODM4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

He’s done with one. But not the other.  “The franchise is not done. I’m done,” Schwarzenegger tells THR when speaking about the long-running Terminator franchise that he recently returned to for 2019’s Dark Fate.  The actor continues, “I got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to The Terminator. Someone has to come up with a great idea. The Terminator was largely responsible for my success, so I always would look at it very fondly. The first three movies were great. Number four [Salvation] I was not in because I was governor. Then five [Genisys] and six [Dark Fate] didn’t close the deal as far as I’m concerned. We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written.”  In regards to Conan, Schwarzenegger is a whole lot more hopeful.  He tells THR, “It’s been pending for the last 10 years. [Fredrik] Malmberg owns the rights. He comes to me and says, ‘Oh, I have a deal with Netflix,’ and when we ask Netflix, they don’t know anything about it. It’s one of those crazy things. I hope he figures it out.  “I think you do it like Unforgiven, where you play the age. There’s a great script out there that John Milius wrote, and others have written one. The story is there. There are directors who want to do it. But [Malmberg] has the rights, and until he sells the rights for one or two movies, or for the franchise, there’s nothing you can do about it.”  Schwarzenegger of course played Conan in the 1980s feature films Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer, and he has been vocal about trying to get a new Conan movie off the ground for a while now. At one point in time, The Legend of Conan was intended to be a direct sequel to the 1982 movie, with Schwarzenegger returning as an older Conan.  Will it ever happen?

However, he did less well for his relations with Congress, managing only 78.9/100.  The historians praised his public persuasion abilities, which helped him rally support for his policies. However, they criticized his administrative skills, citing his lack of experience in government.

"assassination","2021-07-01","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:28:37","UN official warns violence shows ‘no sign of ending’ as frustrated Haitians go after gang members themselves.  Haitians are “taking the law into their own hands” with a wave of vigilantism that risks worsening the country’s already skyrocketing levels of violence, a United Nations official has warned.  Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that suspected Haitian gang members have been killed and lynched in the streets amid the recent rise of “vigilante justice”.  “We’re seeing a cycle of violence that’s showing no sign of ending,” Shamdasani said in an interview with Al Jazeera this week. “It’s incredibly worrying.”  “People are living in a nightmarish scenario and there’s very little hope, so they’re taking the law into their own hands, which of course is not going to help long term.”  Shamdasani added that nearly 1,500 gang-related killings were reported between January 1 and the end of April, with 49 more taking place between May 10 and 15 alone. “This is a situation that’s akin to an armed conflict situation,” she said.      Widespread gang violence has plagued Haiti for nearly two years, as armed groups vie for control after the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum.  Haiti’s de facto leader, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, whom Moise chose for the post just days before he was killed, has faced a crisis of legitimacy — and attempts to chart a political transition for Haiti have failed as well.  The violence has impeded access to healthcare facilities, forced the closure of schools and clinics, and worsened already dire food insecurity by cutting residents of gang-controlled areas off from critical supplies.  The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned this month that more than 115,600 Haitian children in 2023 were expected to suffer from “severe acute malnutrition”, also known as “severe wasting”, as a result of the instability.  Police under-equipped  The Haitian National Police have pledged to combat the gangs, saying in a statement posted to Facebook on Tuesday that the force “does not intend to give up and renews its pledge to continue to protect lives and property of the population”.  But observers have said the Haitian police are ill-equipped and understaffed and cannot adequately respond to the crisis.  “The Haitian police is not managing the situation well,” the UN’s Shamdasani said. “They cannot manage this on their own, and the people realise this, which is why they’re taking the law into their own hands.”  In recent weeks, a vigilante movement called Bwa Kale — “peeled wood” in Haitian Creole — has emerged, with Haitians arming themselves with sticks, machetes and other weapons to go after the gangs.  In late April, residents in the capital Port-au-Prince lynched suspected gang members and set their bodies on fire. Images shared online and by news agencies showed a crowd of people standing near a pile of burned human remains in a street.  The Bwa Kale movement is “a vaccination campaign against gang violence”, Jean Baptist Kenley, a social leader in the Port-au-Prince area of Solino, recently told Al Jazeera. “The Bwa Kale will continue to eradicate the kidnapping violence in the country.”  ‘Short-term solution’  Garry Pierre-Pierre, a Haitian-American journalist and founder of The Haitian Times, recently told NPR that the Haitian population has also “enlisted the police” to help in efforts to stop gang violence.  In some cases, Pierre-Pierre explained, community members will identify gang members and take law enforcement officers directly to them to make arrests.  “It’s not totally the population taking things into their own hands,” Pierre-Pierre said. “It’s not totally like vigilante[s]. It’s working hand-in-glove with the police … to give the police now the upper hand as they fight these gangs.”  Vigilantism “is not the answer” to Haiti’s problems, Pierre-Pierre also wrote recently.  “It is a short-term solution the police must take a hold of immediately, to seize the advantage it affords to rid Port-au-Prince of this menace that has brought the capital city, and by extension the country, to its knees over the last two years,” he said.  “The police can continue their operations alongside the people to credibly identify alleged gang members. These suspects should be treated as innocent until proven guilty, facing the fullest extent of the law — as feeble as Haiti’s justice system may be right now.”  Meanwhile, the UN continues to urge the international community to launch a multilateral mission to help Haiti respond to the violence.  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who discussed the situation in Haiti during a meeting with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in Kingston this week, said the crisis requires “a much stronger commitment by the international community”.

Instead, they have urged foreign nations to provide more support to the Haitian police, stem the flow of weapons to Haiti — particularly those coming from the United States — and sanction officials and others profiting off the violence.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvaGFpdGktc2Vlcy1yaXNlLW9mLXZpZ2lsYW50ZS1qdXN0aWNlLWFzLWdhbmctdmlvbGVuY2Utc29hcnPSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy9oYWl0aS1zZWVzLXJpc2Utb2YtdmlnaWxhbnRlLWp1c3RpY2UtYXMtZ2FuZy12aW9sZW5jZS1zb2Fycw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Baku"", ""Baki"", ""Azerbaijan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 12:08:50","Welcome back to The Farda Briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter that tracks the key issues in Iran and explains why they matter. To subscribe, click here.  I'm RFE/RL correspondent Golnaz Esfandiari. Here's what I've been following during the past week and what I'm watching for in the days ahead.  The Big Issue  Dozens of independent Iranian lawyers were imprisoned during the monthslong antiestablishment protests that erupted last September. Most had represented jailed protesters or been critical of the authorities on social media.  Many of the lawyers were later freed under an amnesty announced by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in February.  But in recent days, around 20 lawyers across the country have been summoned. It was not clear if they were facing new charges or had been called in for questioning.  ""The amnesty gave me hope but these actions that are taking place are frustrating,"" lawyer Ali Mojtahedzadeh said on Twitter on May 11, adding that he did not know why he had been summoned.  ""The lawyers who have been summoned are lawyers who were [defending protesters] or those who have been active on social media,"" said Mojtahedzadeh.  Mitra Izadifard, a lawyer from the northeastern city of Mashhad, told the reformist daily Etemad that she and several other lawyers had been called in to appear before a court in Tehran on May 22. Izadifard said she was summoned due to some of her ""tweets and previous legal activities.""  Why It Matters: The authorities appear to be renewing pressure on independent lawyers who have taken on sensitive political cases or criticized the clerical establishment.  Independent lawyers have been under systematic pressure and harassment for decades in the Islamic republic. Many have been forced into exile or ended up in jail, including prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh.  What's Next: It is unclear if the authorities are trying to intimidate or imprison again those lawyers who have continued to criticize the clerical regime since their release.  Since the antiestablishment protests subsided, lawyers have been vocal in their criticism of the authorities, including their new attempts to enforce the hijab law.  Several lawyers, including Mohsen Borhani, have said publicly that the measures are a violation of the Islamic republic's laws.  Stories You Might Have Missed  Nearly eight months ago, 21-year-old Erfan Rezai was killed during Iran's brutal crackdown on protests. Despite threats and pressure, his mother has waged a social media campaign to demand justice. In an interview, Farzaneh Barzekar said she holds little hope that real justice will be served.  Afghan migrants in Iran are finding it difficult to carry out the most routine transactions because they cannot obtain the bank cards they need to access mobile phone services, metro tickets, and even their daily bread. They say the restrictions, which affect long-term immigrants and undocumented arrivals alike, are making life increasingly difficult.  What We're Watching  Azerbaijan said on May 16 that it arrested at least seven men who were allegedly recruited by Iran to destabilize the Caucasus nation.  In a statement, Baku said the men were plotting a ""violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials.""  The arrests were the latest in a series of detentions of people the Azerbaijani government says were working for Iran.  Why It Matters: Relations between the two neighbors have become increasingly strained in recent months, particularly since an attack on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran.  In January, a lone gunman stormed the embassy, killing one person. Azerbaijan blamed Tehran for the incident, which it described as a terrorist attack. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the gunman had personal motives.  Tensions were further heightened in March following a failed assassination attempt in Baku on a parliamentarian in Azerbaijan who has been critical of Iran.  Last month, Azerbaijan expelled four Iranian diplomats in Baku. In response, Iran expelled the Azerbaijani ambassador in Tehran.  Baku has accused Iran of backing Armenia in a long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Iran has long blamed Azerbaijan for fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. Tehran has also been critical of Baku's deepening relations with Israel, Iran's archenemy.

Last year, Gauri won the “Best Human Rights Film” award at the Toronto Women’s Film Festival.  In a March 2022 interview with The Federal, Lankesh spoke about why she decided to make the film. “To make a film on Gauri is a really tough decision because she was more than a sister to me. She was my friend, mentor, conscience keeper. I am still struggling to come to terms with her exit from this mortal world.”  “But I decided to do the film just because she is a model to thousands of women and journalists in this country … The world knew more about her only after her assassination,” the poet-filmmaker said.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 02:27:00","Alleged Pentagon documents leaker Jack Teixeira was warned twice to stop taking notes on classified information — and bragged about breaking the rules to his friends, prosecutors said.  In court papers filed Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers claimed the Massachusetts Air National Guardsman jotted down top-secret information during confidential meetings that he would then spread across a social media channel dedicated to video games and guns.  “It is clear that the dissemination of the classified national defense information that the Defendant unlawfully posted was even more widespread and diverse than previously known,” the documents state.  “It is also clear that the Defendant publicly exalted in the breadth and sensitivity of the information that he was disclosing … The Defendant boasted about the wide swath of classified information he had access to by virtue of his position.”  Teixeira, who worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, was arrested last month and charged under the Espionage Act with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information for allegedly sharing hundreds of highly classified Pentagon documents concerning national security and the war in Ukraine on the gaming platform Discord over the course of several months.  According to the Wednesday filing, one of the social media platforms servers had at least 150 users — including overseas individuals — at the time Teixeira allegedly shared confidential information, though prosecutors believe “many more” users have since flocked to the channel since his arrest.  Jack Teixeira was allegedly warned twice to stop taking notes on top-secret information. via REUTERS  In one chat, the 21-year-old told his friends that he would post “a f–ck ton of information” about US intelligence in Israel, Palestine, Syria, Iran, China and more, the filing shows.  “Idgaf what they say I can or can’t share … [a]ll of the s–t I’ve told you guys I’m not supposed to,” he allegedly told other users, implying he understood the unlawfulness of his disclosures.  Teixeira was admonished by his superiors in September 2022 for reportedly scribbling down notes during a confidential meeting and slipping the piece of paper into his pocket.  Teixeira is charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of classified national defense information. AP  He was given a cease-and-desist order preventing him from conducting “any deep dives into classified  intelligence information,” but Teixeira was caught taking notes a second time just one month later.  In February 2023, Teixeira was again observed “viewing content that was not related to his duties,” prosecutors said.  The federal filing also claimed that Teixeira’s secret history as a potentially violent person proves that he was acting maliciously when he allegedly shared secret information on Discord.  Teixeira was arrested April 13 by heavily armed federal agents clad in armor at his mother’s home in North Dighton, Mass. New York Post  Prosecutors pointed to a video published by the Washington Post of Teixeira using racial and ethnic slurs while “emptying the magazine of bullets” at a target.  He also allegedly said online that he wanted to murder a “ton of people” in the name of “culling the weak-minded” and talked about rigging an “assassination van.”  “There is every indication that the Defendant is skilled and experienced at hiding these unsavory aspects of his character,” the filing states.  Teixeira, who has not yet entered a plea, claimed he never intended for any of the information he shared to be “widely disseminated.”  A ruling on Teixeira’s pre-trial detention is expected Friday.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3BlbnRhZ29uLWxlYWtlci1qYWNrLXRlaXhlcmlhLWJyYWdnZWQtb24tZGlzY29yZC1hYm91dC1icmVha2luZy1ydWxlcy1kb2NzL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L3BlbnRhZ29uLWxlYWtlci1qYWNrLXRlaXhlcmlhLWJyYWdnZWQtb24tZGlzY29yZC1hYm91dC1icmVha2luZy1ydWxlcy1kb2NzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eighty-eight-year-old Nebraskan Beverly Deepe Keever knows that war better than most Americans. She was America’s longest-serving Vietnam War correspondent.  Born in Hebron, Nebraska, Beverly Deepe Keever earned her journalism degree from University of Nebraska and a master’s from New York’s Columbia University. At age 26, she bought a one-way ticket to Asia to teach English and sell freelance stories to the Associated Press.  “I went into journalism because I wanted to understand people and culture in other countries,” Deepe Keever said.  Author, journalist and scholar Brooke Kroeger said Deepe Keever had something special as a reporter.  ""This is someone who's got a halo, you know,” he said. “There's something really marvelous about her in her sense of herself, even coming from a small Nebraska town.”  A year after arriving in Asia, Deepe Keever came to Saigon as fighting began heating up between South Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong guerrillas backed by Communist North Vietnam. The U.S. government sent 500 military advisors to help South Vietnam, and more U.S. troops began pouring in. In 1962, Deepe Keever sent a letter to her friend in Nebraska describing her experience.  “I am undergoing a shock treatment here,” she wrote. “All those professional and personal ideals which had never been shattered until I reached here seem to be under constant bombardment. The things that happen in the country would be a bombshell to the American public.”  Friends and family read Deepe Keever’s newspaper reports about all the fighting in Vietnam from 8,600 miles away.  “Paul would call up Dad,” she said. “’Get that girl out of there. Get that girl out of there.’ And Dad said, ‘We don’t even know how to contact her.’”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL25lYnJhc2thcHVibGljbWVkaWEub3JnL2VuL25ld3MvbmV3cy1hcnRpY2xlcy9zZXZlbi15ZWFycy1hLWNvcnJlc3BvbmRlbnQtdGhlLXN0b3J5LW9mLWEtbmVicmFza2Etam91cm5hbGlzdC1jb3ZlcmluZy10aGUtdmlldG5hbS13YXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

From playing a woman, a dwarf, and an elderly man to ten roles in one film, he has done it all. Apart from his different avatars in films, Kamal Haasan is also known to make movies on social issues that are often deemed sensitive. This has caused trouble for many of his films, with calls for a ban on them. Here, we are listing some of Kamal Haasan’s most controversial films that created a lot of buzz.  Vishwaroopam  Vishwaroopam was dogged by numerous controversies. Due to concerns over communal violence, the movie was banned in Tamil Nadu. The film, according to the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, indicated that all Muslims were terrorists. Later, the High Court removed the ban. Tamil Nadu theatre owners challenged Kamal Haasan’s decision to show the movie via satellite. A week after its first theatrical run, the movie was made available via DTH.  Dasavatharam  This movie was famous for Kamal Haasan enacting 10 different roles, something never attempted before in Indian cinema. However, during the early portion of the film which was set during the Chola empire, certain scenes depicted the clash and hostility between followers of Vaishnavism and Shaivism, which resulted in protests. In the meantime, assistant director Senthil Kumar claimed that his script was used as inspiration for the movie’s narrative. The film was temporarily banned when the matter was heard by the Madras High Court. But the court ultimately decided to dismiss the lawsuit.  Vasool Raja MBBS  This movie was a remake of the highly successful Hindi film Munnabhai MBBS. The title of the movie was alleged to denigrate doctors by the Indian Medical Association of Erode. The makers of the film later assured that the film was not critical of doctors.  Thevar Magan  This movie was believed to have targeted the Mukkulalthor or Thevar community and protests were held against the film when it released  top videos  Hey Ram  Probably, one of Kamal Haasan’s most controversial but critically acclaimed films, the movie explored everything from Hindu-Muslim riots to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vbW92aWVzL2Zyb20tcmVsaWdpb24tdG8tZ2FuZGhpcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLXRvcGljcy1leHBsb3JlZC1ieS1rYW1hbC1oYWFzYW4taW4taGlzLWZpbG1zLTc4NDA4NjcuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC9tb3ZpZXMvZnJvbS1yZWxpZ2lvbi10by1nYW5kaGlzLWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb24tdG9waWNzLWV4cGxvcmVkLWJ5LWthbWFsLWhhYXNhbi1pbi1oaXMtZmlsbXMtNzg0MDg2Ny5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A joint statement issued by the Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, and the Prosecutor General's Office on May 16 revealed that the suspects ""were working for Iranian secret services.""  They are accused of seeking to ""disrupt stability"" in the South Caucasus country by disseminating ""religious propaganda.""  The statement said that Ruhollah Akhundzadeh and his son Al-Morsel Akhundzadeh, in collaboration with the Iranian special services, plotted ""to forcefully change the constitutional structure of the Republic of Azerbaijan and orchestrate armed rebellions with the objective to establish the ""Karima"" state, and to organize assassination attempts on prominent personalities and senior officials,"" the statement reads.  The two men formed clandestine groups on WhatsApp, Telegram and other instant messaging systems, and provided members of the group with a list of government officials and prominent figures, along with their residential and workplace addresses, in order to organize their assassinations.  Azerbaijani media reported that Akhundzadeh intended to send members of the group to Iran, under the guise of religious education, to receive military training.  Last month, Azerbaijani news agencies reported the alleged arrest of the leaders of a group called ""Hosseiniun"" in the Iranian city of Qom.  Tohid Ebrahim Beigli and Orkhan Mamedov are accused by Azerbaijani authorities of planning to establish the ""Karima"" state in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade"" (Hosseinchiler) with 14 Azerbaijani students who were studying in Qom and Mashhad.  The aim of the group was to fight against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  In late 2015, Ebrahim Beigli, along with 14 students from the Republic of Azerbaijan who were studying in Qom and Mashhad, formed the ""Hosseiniun Brigade,"" with the stated objective of fighting against the ISIS extremist group in Syria and prepare for an armed conflict in Azerbaijan.  Who is Ruhollah Akhundzadeh?  Ruhollah Akhundzadeh, the deputy of the Islamic Party of Azerbaijan, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011. Following his release, he traveled to Iran in 2020 where he has been actively involved in organizing religious extremist groups closely associated with the Islamic Republic.  The State Security Service of Azerbaijan issued a statement in November last year saying it had conducted an operation against an illegal armed group which operated under the guidance of the Iranian intelligence services. Akhundzadeh was apprehended during the operation.  In the past year alone, Akhundzadeh, with the support of the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic, has reportedly made two attempts to establish an armed group aimed at carrying out acts of sabotage and terrorism in Azerbaijan.  According to the newspaper Mosavat, the intelligence agencies of the Islamic Republic are secretly promoting religious extremist ideas in Azerbaijan to encourage citizens to participate in military exercises abroad and finance their activities.  Lasting Tensions Between the Two Neighbors  Baku and Tehran have often had strained relations, with Azerbaijan accusing the Islamic Republic of trying to destabilize the country. Azerbaijan also criticizes Iran for allegedly backing Armenia in the long-standing conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region.  According to the Baku Post, Iranian intelligence agencies attempted to use Azerbaijani citizens to act against Azerbaijan's interests and in favor of Armenia during the 44-day war between the two countries over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020.  In turn, Tehran has long accused Baku of fueling separatist sentiments among its sizeable ethnic Azeri minority. The Islamic Republic also fears that Azerbaijani territory could be used for a possible attack against Iran by Israel.  The Azerbaijani authorities strongly reacted to military maneuvers conducted by the Islamic Republic along the Azerbaijan border, calling them provocative and unacceptable.  Tensions between the two neighbors escalated over the past months following a ""terrorist attack"" on the Azerbaijani Embassy in Tehran, the arrest of individuals affiliated with Iranian intelligence services on charges of espionage, the assassination attempt on a member of an Azerbaijani lawmaker, the expulsion of diplomats from both nations, and the opening of an Azerbaijani embassy in Israel.  ""Iran Seeks to Regain Influence"" in the South Caucasus  ""Over the past 30 years, Iran has consistently sought to interfere in Azerbaijan's internal affairs,"" university professor and political analyst Nazem Jafar Soy tells IranWire.  ""This has included sending mullahs to Azerbaijan, influencing the youth of the country through religious teachings in Iran, engaging in espionage, and exploiting the religious sentiments of the Azerbaijani people,"" he added.  But Jafar Soy says that Iran's ""once relatively prominent role in the Caucasus region has diminished"" since the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, with Turkey taking its place.  ""As a result, Iran seeks to regain influence in the region by using threats and creating espionage groups to portray the area as unsafe and reclaim its position in the Caucasus,"" he adds.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaXJhbndpcmUuY29tL2VuL3BvbGl0aWNzLzExNjYyNC1jb3VwLXBsb3QtYmxhbWVkLW9uLWlyYW4td2hhdC1kb2VzLXRoZS1pc2xhbWljLXJlcHVibGljLXdhbnQtaW4tYXplcmJhaWphbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If involved, they should be brought to justice as soon as possible. As the saying goes ‘blood leaves its trail,’” AAC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Zaki said.  The statement came a day after the J&K Police’s special wing, State Investigation Agency (SIA), claimed to have arrested two militants, Javaid Bhat and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat, who were involved in the assassination.  The police said Hizbul Mujahideen commander Abdullah Bangroo had hatched the conspiracy to kill the ex-Mirwaiz.  The AAC has described the killing as “a very painful and tragic part of our lives as well as in the history of Kashmir”. “A visionary leader, who espoused dialogue, tolerance and people’s will as his ideology. The message was carried forward by his son Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who took over under tragic circumstances,” the AAC spokesman said.  He said the assassinated leader “was a great Islamic preacher, a social reformer and an excellent human being”. His brutal assassination is unpardonable. We feel his absence more with each passing day. As Muslims it’s our faith that those who take human life in such a manner are damned in this world and damned in the hereafter in the court of the supreme being who is the best judge,” the AAC said.  The AAC demanded that those involved in the Hawal massacre, where 70 people participating in the funeral procession were fired upon and killed, “should also be brought to book as soon as possible for complete justice”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9vdGhlci1zdGF0ZXMvdGhvc2UtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1leC1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1zaG91bGQtYmUtYnJvdWdodC10by1qdXN0aWNlLWF3YW1pLWFjdGlvbi1jb21taXR0ZWUvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyNzA0LmVjZdIBrwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9vdGhlci1zdGF0ZXMvdGhvc2UtaW52b2x2ZWQtaW4ta2lsbGluZy1vZi1leC1taXJ3YWl6LWZhcm9vcS1zaG91bGQtYmUtYnJvdWdodC10by1qdXN0aWNlLWF3YW1pLWFjdGlvbi1jb21taXR0ZWUvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyNzA0LmVjZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Patrolling police have been visible in the city’s Peace Park, while security personnel are monitoring the river alongside the Atomic Bomb Dome. Helicopters have also been conducting regular patrols overhead. The heightened security measures have extended to other areas, including Tokyo, with messages on the train system warning of increased security for the summit.  Public areas in major cities across Japan have seen rubbish bins sealed off, coin lockers at train stations put out of operation, and vending machines on subway platforms unplugged and taped off. In Hiroshima, signs throughout the city and hotels inform residents and tourists of the summit-related disruptions, including street closures and restricted access to the island of Miyajima, reported Channel News Asia.

In a recorded lecture, the pro-Iranian Shiite cleric repeatedly blamed ""the Jews"" for killing Ali Ibn Abi Talib.  Ali was in fact assassinated, by another Muslim working for a political rival in 661 CE. His son, Hassan, who succeeded his father, was then assassinated nine years later - cementing the schism between the Muslim faithful.  Since Shiites venerate Ali and his son as the rightful successors to their Prophet Mohammad, the death of the two Imam caliphs led to the current division between Sunni and Shiite Islam.  But Iraqi cleric Qais al-Khazali has came up with a new theory: The deaths of Ali and Hassan were at the hands of ""the Jews,"" in particular, the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. First for Ali's death, and then for the deaths of Hassan and his brother Hussein.  ""The Jews! The Jews! The Jews! They murdered Hassan, Ali's son, and they did it using a woman,"" said al-Khazali, claiming that the Mossad used a prostitute for the assassination.  ""The Umayyads were mere collaborators with the Jews. They then assassinated Imam Hussein.

At its heart sits a grand mansion in Federal style. Inspired by Roman design, the architectural discipline emerged out of the American Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s, and is defined by its simple square or rectangular design, understated facades and simplified columns and mouldings.  The entrance to the main house, which features a poster of its famous former resident. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  In addition to Kennedy, several other prominent Americans have called the mansion at 3017 N Street home, including Georgetown mayor Thomas Beall and former Miss America, Yolande Fox. As a result, the estate has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.  The property was also referenced in the 1933 book, A Portrait of Old Georgetown, by local author Grace Dunlop Ecker, who noted how it had contributed to “the character of Georgetown” for generations.  While many of its original features, including a grand main reception hall, original fireplace surrounds and elegant mouldings, have been maintained, the property’s interiors have been entirely renovated. A spacious primary suite is located on the second floor and is fitted with parquet flooring, a private balcony overlooking the rear gardens and a spa-quality bathroom. The third floor is home to four additional en suite bedrooms, as well as a lofted observation deck.  The property at 3003 N St NW was built in 1880 and has five bedrooms, as well as herringbone oak floors. Photo: Sotheby’s International Realty  Kennedy purchased the home at 3017 N Street in December 1963, one week after officially moving out of the White House following the assassination of her husband, John F Kennedy. She and her children moved in on February 1, 1964, with local newspapers providing a play-by-play account of the family’s movements and belongings, accompanied by photographs of her arriving at her new home with the family’s dog, Brumus. A crowd of onlookers gathered outside in the hope of catching a glimpse of her.  She already had a close association with Georgetown, having arrived in Washington from New York at the age of 10. She went on to attend George Washington University and met then-senator John while she was working as a photographer at the Washington Times-Herald. Their courtship largely took place in and around Georgetown.  The master bedroom in the main house.

A 1964 article in The Washington Post referred to the residence as a “foremost tourist attraction”, with large groups of sightseers lining the street outside the property each weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of the former first lady. They left rubbish strewn all over the pavement, while heavy traffic, including tour buses, clogged the streets.  In September 1964, she decided to move back to New York.

Arnolfo Teves Jr. (Negros Oriental) over the brazen assassination of Governor Roel Degamo that also left nine others dead and more than a dozen injured.  NBI director Medardo de Lemos and other agency officials filed the case before the Department of Justice.  Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said that Teves was charged with multiple murder, multiple frustrated murder and multiple attempted murder. A prosecution panel was convened yesterday to receive the complaint.  With the complaint now filed, Teves will be given an opportunity to file his counter-affidavit. But Remulla stressed that this cannot be filed while he is not in the country. Teves, who has been refusing to come back to Manila, also cannot subscribe before Philippine embassies abroad, the justice secretary said.  ""He has to come home or they will file the case in court and the warrant will be issued in absentia,"" Remulla said.  Earlier, Teves was also charged with multiple murder over a spate of killings in Negros Oriental in 2019 and illegal possession of firearms and explosives. Process to designate him as a terrorist has also started.  Remulla had long named Teves as the alleged mastermind behind the killing of Degamo but he stressed that investigators were being thorough in their case-building.  The filing, which came more than two months since the incident, was also delayed by two days after witness-suspects under government custody clammed up and refused to cooperate with authorities.  Remulla said the suspects “lawyered up” after initially being represented by the Public Attorney's Office. The justice secretary stressed that investigators already secured testimonies significant to the case before the suspects stopped cooperating.  Teves has yet to return to Manila despite criminal allegations against him and a warning of further disciplinary action for his continued absence at the House of Representatives. — Philstar.com (FREEMAN)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS90aGUtZnJlZW1hbi9jZWJ1LW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC8yMjY3MjA5L3JhcHMtZmlsZWQtdnMtdGV2ZXMtb3Zlci1kZWdhbW8tYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbtIBdGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS90aGUtZnJlZW1hbi9jZWJ1LW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xOC8yMjY3MjA5L3JhcHMtZmlsZWQtdnMtdGV2ZXMtb3Zlci1kZWdhbW8tYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But the human rights NGOs won’t say anything about it; they only protect the rights of criminals,” stated the president on Twitter.  The National Civil Police (PNC) reported that the officer died after being “attacked” by gang members “while patrolling with other police officers” in Nueva Concepción, Chalatenango, about 85 km north of San Salvador.  This is the fourth Salvadoran police officer killed since Bukele launched his “war” against the gangs 14 months ago and the first one this year, according to Deputy Guillermo Gallegos.  After the incident, a suspected gang member was arrested at the scene.  “Let all the human rights NGOs know that we will devastate these damn killers and their collaborators, we will put them in prison and they will never get out,” emphasized Bukele.  Human rights groups and the Catholic Church have criticized Bukele’s methods for combating the gangs, but his crusade has the support of nine out of ten Salvadorans, according to surveys.  Hours after the officer’s death, the Legislative Assembly approved, with 67 votes out of a total of 84, the extension of the current state of exception, which allows arrests without judicial order, the main tool in Bukele’s “war” against the gangs, which has restored a sense of security on Salvadoran streets.  With this extension, the state of exception will be in effect until June 15.  “Do you see why we must continue with the State of Exception until we completely eradicate this plague? This cowardly murder will not go unpunished. We will make them pay dearly for what they did,” wrote Bukele.  The state of exception was originally declared by the parliament, at Bukele’s request, in response to a surge in homicides that claimed the lives of 87 people from March 25 to 27, 2022.  Since then, 68,720 suspected gang members have been arrested, although about 5,000 have been released for not being linked to these gangs, said the Minister of Justice and Security, Gustavo Villatoro, on Tuesday.  Regarding the alleged deaths of innocent people in prisons reported by human rights organizations, Villatoro said that there is a task force investigating the cases.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGljb3RpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2J1a2VsZS12b3dzLXRvLWVsaW1pbmF0ZS1nYW5ncy1pbi1lbC1zYWx2YWRvci1hZnRlci1vZmZpY2Vycy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1945-07-02","12:15:00","{""Tehran"", ""Tehran"", ""Iran""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:16:01","The United States was a relative newcomer to the world of intelligence gathering by the time the country entered World War II. President George Washington knew the value of intelligence, but subsequent administrations had other concerns, and creating a spymaster wasn't one of them.  Until the Civil War, U.S. intelligence was virtually nonexistent, and after that, it wasn't very extensive. Lucky for the World War II Allies, the Soviet Union's dedication to spies and intelligence could best be described as paranoia in action.  Gevork Vartanian was a Soviet intelligence officer from Armenia who, at age 19, discovered the Nazis' plan to kill the Allied leadership in Tehran. His team systematically captured and eliminated the assassins' threat.  Soviet-Armenian spy Gevork Vartanian. (Russian Embassy in the United States)  American intelligence before World War II was often as-needed and ad hoc. It could claim some critical successes, but it was far from the global network of informants used by the Soviet Union.  During the war, the USSR housed all its intelligence operations under SMERSH, an umbrella organization composed of hundreds, maybe thousands of operatives.  SMERSH had spies and agents everywhere. As any American Cold Warrior will tell you, Soviet spies were some of the best. They not only spied on the enemy, they were embedded with their own units on the front lines and infiltrated Soviet allies at the highest levels.  The Soviets were so adept at spycraft, Joseph Stalin knew about the development of an atomic bomb before Vice President Harry Truman. So it's no surprise they learned about Operation Long Jump, an assassination plot against Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt -- also known as ""The Big Three.""  Vartanian had been working as an agent in Tehran since before Nazi Germany invaded the USSR. He already had a team of agents called the ""Light Cavalry"" in place and cleared the city of more than 400 Nazi agents before 1943. It made sense to put them in charge of security for the 1943 Tehran Conference between the Big Three, where the leaders would discuss opening a second European front.  The previous year, German Wehrmacht Oberleutnant Paul Siebert, stationed in occupied Ukraine, split a bottle of brandy with his friend. That friend was SS officer Ulrich von Ortel. As the two drank the night away, von Ortel told Siebert that Germany had broken a U.S. Navy radio code and learned about the Tehran Conference.  He then told Siebert about Operation Long Jump and that notorious SS Obersturmbannfuehrer Otto Skorzeny, a saboteur and special operations expert, would lead the assassination squad. Unfortunately for the Germans, Siebert was really Soviet master spy Nikolai Kuznetsov.  Austrian-born Otto Skorzeny during World War II  Word of the plot quickly got to Vartanian in Tehran. The Light Cavalry captured six Nazi radio operators in Iran and tracked the first team of German commandos after they parachuted in near the city of Qom. His team intercepted and arrested the Germans as they traveled on camelback toward the Iranian capital, loaded with weapons.  They then forced the radio operators to report the mission while under Soviet supervision, but one of the radio operators managed to inform Berlin they'd been caught. As a result, Skorzeny's team was never deployed to Iran.  Vartanian spent the next 30 years working as an intelligence officer for the Soviet Union, eventually receiving the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the highest award the country could give. His involvement in preventing Operation Long Jump was kept a secret until 2000, and Vartanian died in 2012 after a very long, very secret career.  -- Blake Stilwell can be reached at blake.stilwell@military.com.

"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Bogota"", ""DistritoCapital"", ""Colombia""}","Wed 17 May 2023 21:03:55","Salvatore Mancuso, former commander of right-wing paramilitary groups, has offered four days of tribunal testimony.  Bogotá, Colombia – A former strongman has wrapped up testimony before Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal this week, offering a harrowing look into paramilitary assassination programmes orchestrated during the country’s decades-long internal conflict.  Salvatore Mancuso, who used the nom de guerre “Triple Zero”, was one of the primary leaders of paramilitary forces in the country in the late ’90s and early 2000s.  Over four days of testimony, ending Tuesday, Mancuso offered insight into groups that Colombia’s Peace Commission has since described as “death squads”.  As the erstwhile commander of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a coalition of right-wing paramilitary groups, Mancuso described the murder and forced disappearances of political activists and other individuals seen as sympathetic to left-wing groups and causes.  “These were assassinations,” he said on the first day of testimony, May 10. “There is no other word for it.”  Mancuso has previously admitted to thousands of counts of various crimes before the JEP, in an attempt to earn leniency and avoid further legal proceedings in Colombia. He gave this week’s testimony by video from the United States, where he previously served 12 years on drug trafficking charges.  “We weren’t told just to kill. We were told to hide the bodies and ensure they were never found,” Mancuso said from a screen before the court.  To cover up their crimes, Mancuso explained his forces built crematoriums to burn the bodies of those killed. Other victims were disposed of in the Catatumbo River, which separates Colombia and Venezuela in the Catatumbo region.  His testimony also corroborated longstanding accusations that paramilitary groups planned their attacks in direct coordination with the Colombian government, as well as the private sector.  A child of state ‘parapolitics’  Mancuso has claimed he worked directly with the Colombian army and police, as well as with the Administrative Security Department (DAS), the country’s disgraced former intelligence agency.  The DAS was disbanded in 2011 amid accusations of human rights violations and the wiretapping of journalists and judges.  Together with the paramilitary forces, those agencies coordinated “kill lists” identifying individuals the government wanted silenced, Mancuso alleged.  “In my capacity as a hinge between public forces and self-defence groups, I ordered the assassination of hundreds of people. I’m a legitimate child of state ‘parapolitics’,” he said on Tuesday, using a term for the intersection of “paramilitary” and “politics”.  According to Mancuso, one of the targets that DAS ordered for assassination was Gustavo Petro, Colombia’s current president and a former rebel fighter who was, at the time, a congressman.  Mancuso also indicated that major private companies helped finance the paramilitary operations through a programme called “Convivir”, in part to protect their domestic infrastructure. The JEP tribunal, however, has yet to verify the claims made in Mancuso’s testimony.  Mancuso left his position as commander in 2005 as part of a controversial peace process with Colombia’s paramilitary forces.  Critics divided over testimony  Observers were split over the revelations from Mancuso’s testimony this week — and how much they would help advance JEP’s mission to investigate the crimes and abuses committed over Colombia’s nearly six-decade-long internal conflict.  Claudia Julieta Duque, a journalist who had been tortured by the DAS, was less than impressed by the four-day judicial hearing.  It was a “victimiser reaffirming what victims have been saying for more than 20 years”, she told Al Jazeera. “He said many things that were already known.”      Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior policy analyst in Colombia for the International Crisis Group, was nevertheless intrigued by some of the insight Mancuso offered.  “One of the most striking and new points of the testimony was Mancuso’s discussion of a period in the late ‘90s when Colombia was receiving increased scrutiny in over rising civilian casualties,” she said.  “And the order, in response, from security forces to the paramilitaries was: Keep doing what you’re doing with these scorched-earth tactics. But instead of leaving evidence of this violence, you need to start disappearing people.”  She said it was “shockingly nefarious” that the government’s response was to allegedly double down on state-sponsored violence rather than re-evaluate its actions.  What’s next for Colombia’s peace process?  When asked what Mancuso’s testimony means for the present day, Dickinson explained that the phenomenon of paying criminal groups for protection — whether willingly or through coercion — is an “ongoing” problem in Colombia.  “The JEP is looking specifically for more information about this. That’s why Mancuso is testifying,” she said. Colombia’s Peace Commission has repeatedly stated that impunity for crimes committed during the internal conflict is a barrier to contemporary peace-building.  Ginna Morelo, an investigative reporter, has written a book, The Voice of the Pencils, that describes an assault that paramilitary forces launched on Colombia’s University of Cordoba — an attack Mancuso addressed in his testimony this week.  She explained that his testimony “contributes to the reconstruction of the truth. Although it hurts so much time has passed without knowing the truth.”  She told Al Jazeera that several victims had told her afterwards that “they had never heard that the DAS was behind the crimes inflicted on them”.  She hoped new information could bring closure to those who suffered during the civil war. The victims, she said, “live in an endless transition in search of clarification and reconciliation that has so far been elusive”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvMTcvZXgtcGFyYW1pbGl0YXJ5LWxlYWRlci10ZXN0aWZpZXMtYWJvdXQtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbnMtaW4tY29sb21iaWHSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMjMvNS8xNy9leC1wYXJhbWlsaXRhcnktbGVhZGVyLXRlc3RpZmllcy1hYm91dC1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9ucy1pbi1jb2xvbWJpYQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:17:01","The ground seems to be shifting with respect to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Displaying little or no fear of either the national-security establishment or of being labeled a “conspiracy theorist,” an increasing number of people are now openly and publicly acknowledging what has increasingly become obvious: that the U.S. national-security establishment orchestrated and carried out Kennedy’s assassination as part of a national-security regime-change operation.  This is a positive and healthy sign. Getting America back on the right track requires confronting this dark legacy of America as a national-security state. That includes confronting all of the Pentagon’s and CIA’s state-sponsored assassinations, but especially the Kennedy assassination. Libertarians can help lead the way out of this darkness by openly and publicly acknowledging and addressing what happened on November 22, 1963, and bringing the light of truth to the American people about this sordid event.  That’s the purpose of my new video series “The JFK Assassination: Sixty Years Later,” which so far consists of six 30-minute episodes.  In the immediate aftermath of the assassination, there was no reasonable possibility that anyone was going to be able to prove that the military-intelligence establishment was behind the assassination. There were lots of anomalies and unusual occurrences that were enough to raise eyebrows, but they certainly weren’t enough to convict the national-security establishment beyond a reasonable doubt.  For example, immediately after the shooting, there were men on the “grassy knoll” who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. They diverted people away from that particular area, which was located in front of the president’s limousine when the shots rang out. The Secret Service later stated that it had no agents in that area.  If the assassination was really committed by a “lone nut” who purportedly shot from the president’s rear, who were those men on the grassy knoll who falsely identified themselves as Secret Service agents? Is that enough to convict the national-security establishment of having orchestrated the assassination? Of course not. But it is certainly enough to raise eyebrows.  At that time, assassinating a president was not a federal crime. That means that this was a straight murder case under Texas state law. The entity that had sole jurisdiction over the crime was Dallas County.  The possibility that Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade, a conservative Democrat, would even consider targeting the military-intelligence establishment with the crime was non-existent. As an establishment public official, his mind would have never moved in that direction. In fact, he immediately concluded that the assassination had been carried out as part of an international communist conspiracy. But displaying a classic mindset of deference to authority, Wade quickly acceded to President Lyndon Johnson’s demand to abandon the communist-conspiracy allegation and settle for a lone-nut theory of the assassination.  Moreover, there was never any reasonable possibility that any of the orchestrators of the assassination or any of the shooters would talk. These were professionals. All of them understood the need for absolute secrecy, especially given that this was the assassination of a U.S. president. In fact, from the inception of the CIA, the policy had always been to never put any reference to any state-sponsored assassination in writing.  However, as I am demonstrating in my new video series, the Achilles heel of the assassination was always the autopsy that the national-security establishment conducted on President Kennedy’s body after the assassination. That’s because the people who participated in the autopsy were not part of the assassination itself. Therefore, they didn’t have the same incentive to keep silent as those who orchestrated and carried out the assassination itself.  This is why the military’s autopsy was “classified” and why participants in the autopsy were sworn to secrecy and forced to sign written secrecy oaths. Enlisted personnel who participated in the autopsy were severely threatened with court-martial and criminal prosecution if they ever revealed what they had seen or done during the autopsy.  Among the most unusual — and revealing — aspects of the military autopsy was the response of the mainstream press. No one questioned that it was the military-intelligence establishment that was carrying out the autopsy. It was considered to be perfectly normal. The acquiescence of the mainstream press revealed the extent to which the press had come to accept that America had become a military nation — that is, one in which the federal government was now controlled by the military-intelligence establishment.  The secrecy surrounding the assassination was extremely successful. To this day, while we can identify likely suspects in the CIA and the military who orchestrated the assassination, there is still insufficient evidence to convict any of them beyond a reasonable doubt. We also do not know — and will never know — the identities of the people who actually did the shooting.  That, however, is irrelevant. What matters is that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that this was, in fact, a national-security regime-change operation, one no different in principle than the ones carried out against political leaders in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), and Congo (1961) and that would later be carried out against the democratically elected president of Chile (1973).  To what evidence of guilt am I referring? The evidence surrounding the autopsy. While the plotters were highly successful in maintaining strict secrecy surrounding the autopsy for a very long period of time, ultimately the dam of secrecy cracked open, especially during the term of the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.  But that was 30 years after the assassination! That is a very long time. That’s a very effective cover-up, especially because by that time, the mainstream press had fallen under the complete control of the national-security establishment and, therefore, was not permitted to investigate the evidence of fraud in the autopsy that was uncovered by the ARRB. (I’ll be covering such fraud in my new video series. In the meantime, see my books The Kennedy Autopsy, The Kennedy Autopsy 2, and An Encounter with Evil: The Abraham Zapruder Story.)  For example, as I detail in the early episodes of my new series, the evidence is overwhelming that military-intelligence personnel sneaked President Kennedy’s body into the Bethesda, Maryland, military morgue almost 1 and 1/2 hours before the official entry time of 8 pm on the evening of the assassination. Why would they do that? And why would they lie about that? Why would they cover it up? What did they do to JFK’s body during that 1 and 1/2 hours? Alas, not one investigative reporter for any mainstream newspaper investigated the matter. By the 1990s, the national-security establishment’s control over the mainstream press had become complete.  The most important part of the Kennedy assassination is the “why” of the assassination. By understanding why the national-security establishment deemed it necessary to orchestrate one of its patented regime-change operations on American soil, we can gain an understanding of why America is mired in perpetual war, strife, conflict, militarism, out-of-control spending, monetary debauchery, a national police state, and empire. (See FFF’s book JFK’s War with the National Security Establishment: Why Kennedy Was Assassinated by Douglas Horne. Also, see JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters by James W.

Explaining what growing up on Saginaw was like for him, the veteran coach touched upon a tragic incident that occurred to him when he was just 14.  “Coming up during that crack era in the 80s, I saw that. Yeah like born in 73. growing up with a strong community and seeing that community turn into a wonderful neighborhood. Um and then just take the neighbors off and now it’s just hood. Got Shot 14 years old April 5th 1988,” Ham said.  “When you go through an experience like that bro, it really stays with you,” he added.  Darvin Ham further explained the details of the tragic incident.  As the 49-year-old recollected, the incident happened on the 20th Anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. That particular day, Ham and his older brother went out to buy things. While getting back home, Ham heard the sound of shots and looked towards the shooting.

Reacting over the ugly situation, through a press statement by the Organization, the Facilitator/Director General of the Grow Orlu Project, Prince Nixon Okwara described the incident as most unfortunate and barbaric.  Captain Tony Enoch was gunned down by assailants late hours of Tuesday, May 9, 2023 on his way coming back from an APC Stakeholders meeting held in his Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State.  Against this backdrop, Prince Nixon Okwara who couldn’t contain his tears stated that it has become so worrisome why people could condescend so low and inhuman as to taking another person’s life.  He regretted that Captain Tony Enoch’s assassination was still a rude shock to the Grow Orlu family, the Kpakpando political family, to Oru East, Imo State and Nigeria at large, especially those who encountered him while he lived.  The Director General recalled that due to his outstanding nature and Leadership dexterity, the murdered Tony Enoch was entrusted with the position of Coordinator of all the Coordinators at the inauguration of the Grow Orlu Project held on July 9, 2022.  Alas, when it was almost time to enjoy his Labour, his life was cut short by yet-to-be identified killers.  Prince Nixon Okwara who also doubles as a member of the Presidential Campaign Council for Bola Ahmed Tinubu/Kashim Shettima passionately enthused, “Quite a horrible Tuesday!! Our hearts are heavy with grief, sadness, and pain.  “Capt. Enoch was a great and exceptional member and the general Coordinator of our team, “The Grow Orlu Project” who made significant contributions to our group. His smart disposition, intellect, tireless work ethic, and unwavering commitment to the victory of our party and candidates were made manifest in that successful outing on the 25th of February elections.  “This is one but many losses to us, “The Grow Orlu Project”, the Kpakpando family, and the entire APC family. We condemn in strong terms this dastardly act and senseless act of violence in our region and call for justice. Capt. will not die in vain.  “To his immediate family, we share in their grief at this difficult time. Capt. will be missed by all who know him, both for his professionalism and dedication to the assignments. His killers will never know peace both here on Earth and beyond”.  The sober Facilitator of the Grow Orlu Project however called of the State Government, the security agencies to as a matter of urgent State importance fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime so as to save the State from further tragedy.  He submitted that the Grow Orlu Project as part of its cardinal duties is aimed at ensuring a transparent and effective governance.  He fervently prayed for the peaceful repose of the fallen icon, Capt. Tony Enoch.  Until his death, the late Captain Tony Enoch held sway as the Oru East APC Campaign Council which saw to the landslide victory of all the APC Candidates in the recently held Presidential, National Assembly and State Assembly polls where Oru East LGA recorded tremendous victories in each.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmltb3RydW1wZXRhLmNvbS8_cD00MDEwONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2022-04-05","Not Discerned","{""Tehran"", ""Tehran"", ""Iran""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:54:02","New Delhi: Russia’s largest airline Aeroflot has sent an Airbus A330 for maintenance to Iran’s largest airline Mahan Air, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Monday.  In a two-minute video filmed at Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar in the Imam Khomeini International Airport outside Tehran and released on IRNA’s social media platforms, a reporter can be heard saying that repair work on the Aeroflot aircraft, originally built in 2011, has commenced.  “The market for commercial aircraft repair and maintenance services is as valuable and extensive as the commercial aircraft’s sales market itself. Accordingly, for years, we have been witnessing the achievements and capabilities of [Iran] to localise the needs of this industry,” the IRNA reporter says, labelling Mahan Air’s maintenance hangar as “one of the most well-known and strategic centres” serving Iranian and foreign customers.  According to aviation news platform Simply Flying, the Airbus A330 had departed Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport on 5 April and arrived at the Imam Khomeini International Airport the following morning.  This development comes amid US-led sanctions on both Aeroflot and Mahan Air due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and an alleged plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to America in 2011.  The engagement between Aeroflot and Mahan Air also serves as an example of the strengthening of relations between Iran and Russia, following such sanctions.  In August 2022, Simply Flying reported that the two nations had signed a cooperation agreement for Iranian-made equipment and aircraft parts as well as carrying out “repair and maintenance services and technical support” of Russian aircraft.  This year has seen the relationship between Iran and Russia evolve further, with Tehran inking a deal to buy Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Moscow in March. The two countries also linked their interbank communication and transfer systems to facilitate trade and transactions in the light of US sanctions.

His release brought an uneasy calm, but the stage is set for a more serious clash.  Security escort a vehicle carrying Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi after their court appearance, in Lahore, Pakistan, May 15, 2023.  Advertisement  Pakistanis could be forgiven for waking up on Tuesday morning and questioning whether the previous week’s events were an unnerving nightmare.  The world’s fifth most populous country is no stranger to political unrest. No prime minister has ever completed their tenure in Pakistan’s history, but never before has a politician challenging the country’s all-powerful military and intelligence services, known as the establishment, enjoyed such public support.  One week ago, on May 9, former Prime Minister Imran Khan was violently beaten and then detained by the country’s paramilitary. This led to several days of rioting across Pakistan.  While he has since been released – after Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled that his detention on an alleged land fraud charge was “invalid” and “unlawful” – the current stalemate will be temporary, not permanent.

Ousted from power in April 2022 in a no confidence vote after falling out with the country’s establishment, Khan’s popularity is now at an all-time high. There is little doubt that if free elections are held, as planned, in the autumn, he will return as prime minister. The Pakistani people are seemingly prepared to take on the country’s establishment, for the first time in history, in an attempt to ensure that happens.  With neither side backing down, what comes next is likely to involve serious unrest. Things are sure to get worse before they get better in Pakistan, which is also already enduring the gravest economic crisis in the country’s history.  It was unsurprising to see Khan in the dock last week. Pakistan’s establishment and the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party – headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – seeks to disqualify Khan from politics.  Advertisement  The former international cricket captain is facing more than 140 criminal cases. In the latest, it was alleged that Khan and his wife, the Sufi mystic Bushra Wattoo, secured lucrative real estate in exchange for carrying out favors for Malik Riaz Hussain, one of Pakistan’s wealthiest businessmen, while Khan was prime minister.  Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said the case was politically motivated. The PML-N said Khan should face trial. On Friday, after the country’s Supreme Court sided with the former premier, Khan was released and returned to his home in Lahore.  It seems certain, though, that Khan will be arrested again. He has only been granted bail until Wednesday and Sharif and his allies have suggested he will be detained again this week.  On Sunday, Khan himself suggested he would be jailed for 10 years for sedition after his supporters had rioted following his arrest.  “Absolutely, Mr. Khan will be arrested again. We are looking at a judiciary in Pakistan which is fragmented and can be influenced,” argued Dr. Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).  “The ruling [on Friday] was made by pro-Khan judges within the Supreme Court and now the Army will try to fix that. It will 100 percent happen at some point that he will be behind bars and charges will be brought against him that no court can overrule.”  In many ways, Khan, a populist politician, is a victim of his own success. Since his ousting, in April 2022, which directly followed a spectacular falling out with the military, his popularity has surged.  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  Khan has been able to successfully exploit growing frustration among the Pakistani public towards Sharif for his inability to address the country’s economic woes and the Army’s continued meddling in public policy.  Food inflation is running at 40 percent, the highest in Asia, and approximately 70 million Pakistanis are going hungry, as per a March study by the Wilson Center, a leading U.S. think tank.  Hospitals have run out of many life-saving medicines, including those used in diabetes, heart and kidney disease treatment, while a lack of funding meant Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of Pakistan’s four provinces, suspended free medical care on May 2.  Advertisement  Relief does not seem imminent, either. Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for over $1.1 billion in funding have broken down – in part due to Sharif’s reluctance to impose further unpopular austerity measures on the population as an election draws near.  Certainly, there have been decades of economic mismanagement in Pakistan. The country has consistently borrowed beyond its means and failed to diversify its tax base. And Khan’s detractors argue that he engaged in corruption, as have the Sharifs and Pakistan’s other political dynasty, the Bhuttos.  Nevertheless, Khan has carefully crafted a victim narrative since he was removed from power and has convinced a significant majority of Pakistanis that only he can reform the country’s stagnant political and economic apparatus.  His approval rating in February was 61 percent, according to a Gallup Pakistan survey, with Shehbaz Sharif trailing far behind at 32 percent.  “Imran Khan, politically, has captured the imagination of most of the country, certainly in Punjab and that is not going to go down. The people’s power is with him,” said Paliwal.  “He wants an early election and if the authorities give him an honest vote, then he will win.”  The establishment will do anything they can to stop him. Khan would fail to do their bidding; he could strip them of their power and even seek to jail senior military or political figures in revenge.  Khan has accused Major General Faisal Naseer, a senior military figure and Sharif of being behind an assassination attempt in November in which he was shot in the legs four times. While on his release from prison, he accused the country’s new chief of army staff, General Asim Munir, of being behind his arrest.  Khan and Munir have a long-standing feud. While he was prime minister, Khan removed Munir as the head of Pakistan’s intelligence services after the latter began allegedly investigating his third wife, Wattoo, for corruption.  We are now likely to see Sharif and his establishment allies take further action against the judiciary and the PTI’s leadership to weaken protection of Khan.  On Monday, hundreds of members of the PML-N, armed with sticks, broke into the country’s Supreme Court to threaten its judges.  Pakistan’s parliament further announced it would set up a committee to prepare a case against the judge, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who had ordered Khan’s release.  Advertisement  Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.  Following Khan’s arrest, the PTI called on Pakistanis to take to the streets and it is certain to do so again if Khan is re-arrested. The violence that followed was unprecedented in the country’s history, as large swathes of angry protesters torched military buildings, including the army’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.  Only when Khan was released on Friday did unrest subside. The PTI claims at least 47 of its supporters were killed by the military; the latter puts the death toll at nine.  Khan says 7,000 PTI workers – including much of the party’s senior leadership – have been jailed. Claims of torture are widespread. The elderly relatives and minor children of PTI members have also been arrested in an attempt to lure their relatives out of hiding.  Sharif has said he will come down with an “iron fist” against the protesters and mass arrests will now follow. The ability of Sharif and the establishment to incite fear among Pakistanis is perhaps their best chance of holding onto power.  “To me, it is clear that only one – either Mr. Khan or the army chief – can survive this crisis, politically,” argued Uzair Younus, director of the Pakistan Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a U.S.-based think tank.  “Over the next few weeks, how this situation plays out will come down to General Munir and the armed forces ability to assert themselves and then Mr. Khan and the PTI’s ability to maintain public protests and the momentum.”  Several further variables could influence events in Pakistan. First, there appear to be fractures among the country’s senior military leaders, although it is unclear as to their severity.  Many commanders remain pro-Khan from his time as premier, and it was notable that during the recent violence former army figureheads, many now living abroad, directed protesters. Several acting military commanders also refused to take a heavy-handed approach against PTI supporters.  During previous crises, foreign powers, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, have also intervened to mediate. This has not occurred this time around, at least openly. But it is unlikely that China, which has invested around $65 billion in Pakistan as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or India, which has fought four wars with its neighbor, will continue to watch on if law and order deteriorates.  One victor from the crisis is likely to be the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an Islamic militant group allied with the Afghan Taliban, who called off their ceasefire with the Pakistani state in November.  The TTP has since launched daily attacks against the police and military. January 2023 was the deadliest month for the country’s security forces in a decade, with one such suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar killing 83 people.  A united front will have to be presented against the emboldened TTP – otherwise Pakistan risks descending into total anarchy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZGlwbG9tYXQuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvcGFraXN0YW4taW4tdGhlLWV5ZS1vZi10aGUtcG9saXRpY2FsLXN0b3JtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Ganjam"", ""Orissa"", ""India""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:01:56","Mudslinging is not a new phenomenon in world of politics since it is said to have appeared in some form or the other in electoral battle since 1828 in the US Presidential election; 2008 Senate race in North Carolina and the political race between the then incumbent President John Quincy Adams and challenger Andrew Jackson in 1828.  The practice of mudslinging, smear campaigning, or forming conspiracy by any political leader against his opponent with sole intention to defame a leader with probity in public life and/or to tarnish his image to take political mileage, however, can hardly succeed as ultimately truth prevails, sooner or later. Most of the politicians in India often use ‘mudslinging’ as the most powerful weapon or tool against their opponents.  Since times immemorial, it has been believed that, truth always triumphs and this dictum has been rightly emphasised by Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi who brought freedom for the country used to define political course to remain “without malice and in a strictly non violent manner,” but now malice is deeply rooted in politics of all shades in which mudslinging has substantially grown as a culture, breeding various connotations, namely, smear campaign, character assassination, dirty politics, negative campaign, defamation, outracing each other which are disastrous for the health of democracy. No political party seems to be an exception from such Machiavellian culture.  In the year 2000, a Congress worker of Poirashi GP of Ganjam block had filed a false affidavit against the then Deputy Speaker of Assembly Rama Chandra Panda, willfully dragging his name to an incident of a crime perpetuated by local Leftist elements, notwithstanding the soaring relationship Panda had with the local Leftists, which was used to orchestrate a political campaign in the Chhatrapur Assembly constituency against Panda.  As a result, Panda had informed the then Speaker of the Assembly not to chair Assembly proceedings till his name was cleared in the Crime Branch inquiry. It was also then whispered in the town that, some Congress leaders eventually had met the then DIG inquiring the matter at the IRE Guest House to raise a complaint against Panda on the basis of the false affidavit.  The catchphrase the ""Truth always triumphs"" has come true though little late. In the last week of January 2023, Panda was felicitated on completion of 50 years of his political journey from the tiny industrial town Ganjam, where he had laid country’s first and historic farmers’ movement (1970-71) against water and air pollution in which he and 400 farmers and youths were imprisoned causing visit of Parliamentary Committee headed by late MP Brahmananda Panda to the area to study the environmental problems which eventually submitted its report to the Parliament suggesting remedial measures. This impressive felicitation programme in which thousands of local people attended is understood to be a sequel to non-invitation to Panda by the local MLA earlier on the party’s foundation day held at village Kushapalli.  The success of this gathering, however, not only sent ripples to various quarters but also produced multiple side effects and one such fallout was that, the then Congress youth leader Khalli Reddy who himself participated in the ‘show of strength’ cum felicitation meeting, later called on Panda at his residence at Brahmapur in the presence of a former Councilor of Ganjam NAC Lakshmi Padhi and advocate Pramod Panda and apologised to Rama Chandra Panda for his 2000 bogus affidavit candidly confessing that he filed the same at the behest of a prominent Congress leader of Brahmapur who eventually is now in BJD. This sensitive exposure of Reddy has proved how some new breed and ambitious politicians can settle political scores against their rivals or political opponents to satisfy their political interests and can go to any extent even to defame a honest leader having probity in public life.  This writer was present during Reddy’s disclosure. In his quest for truth, the writer contacted one of the outspoken and vibrant Congress leaders of Ganjam advocate Pitabas Panda, who too expressed his regret while further attributing the incident to the invisible hand of a former Congress MLA of a neighboring district in the incident. When this writer sought reaction from former Deputy Speaker Panda he said he had already forgotten the incident and wished almighty to bless the indulgent not to repeat such act in future against any one.  There may not always be legal repercussions for mudslinging, but there can be social backfiring. If miscalculated, mudslinging often can make the mudslinger cut a sorry figure.  Now, one might ask: Shouldn't politicians or public figures, face repercussions for mudslinging? According to Joseph Comunale, it is in fact a crime to make false public accusations with knowledge that the claims are indeed false.  Such a crime can lead to libel or defamation lawsuits in the eyes of law. However, proving such a crime can be extremely difficult. i.e., it is difficult to verify that someone may have been aware that he was making a false claim and, therefore, deduce he was knowingly lying with an intent to harm.  There are a number of such incidents of political mudslinging and conspiracy, allegation and counter allegation against each other in Indian politics. Take the example of Telangana Welfare and Civil Supplies Minister, Gangula Kamalakar’s allegation against BJP State president Bandi Sanjay Kumar alleging his hand in a recent question paper leaking incident reportedly with an attempt to malign and defame the BRS Government in Telangana.

Parhar writes that over the past 40 to 50 years, Sikhs have earned a highly respected position in foreign countries through their hard work and talent. Unfortunately, these achievements are now being overshadowed by the actions of those who are intent on sowing discord.  The stain of terrorism on Sikhs associated with the Air India plane incident in June 1985 has not yet been washed away, and daily fights over money boxes and control in gurudwaras, international students’ hooliganism, Sikh youths being caught in drug smuggling, killings in gang wars, unscrupulous and unconstitutional entrances into politics, and immigration fraud are bringing shame to the entire community.  These people have been suppressing the voice of the general public in the name of freedom of speech for some time now. Threats on social media, obscene language, slurs, and character assassination are being used to stop people from speaking their minds, according to Parhar in the Khalsa Vox article.  Sikh scholar Ajmer Singh in one of his videos mentioned that Amritpal Singh was involved in a troll army, which harasses people with the aforementioned actions.  “We could indeed scrutinize the violent actions and hooliganism being committed by this small section of our community in India and abroad, but how will you counter the impact it’s having on the perception of all Sikhs,” asks Parhar.

"assassination","1986-11-23","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:30:00","Watch more News on iWantTFC  Actors of the musical “Here Lies Love” have stressed the need for a retelling of the country’s Martial Law period and the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution.  The musical by David Byrne is based on the rise and fall of former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos.  David Byrne's Imelda Marcos musical is coming to Broadway in June  Jose Llana, who plays the role of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., said the musical is a cautionary tale for the world to see.  ""[It’s] showing people what happens when you elect popular candidates in a very popular election,” he said. “Then they have a party for 20 years. But what’s even more important is we show what happens after. Hangover comes and the lights turn on, and it’s called the People Power Revolution.”  Disney Princess Arielle Jacobs, known for her role as Princess Jasmine in Aladdin on Broadway, will step into the shoes of Imelda.  She believes this part of Philippine history is a story that needs to be told to a new generation.  “There's so many democracies at stake all around the world,” she said. “And there are countries all around the world that [want] to rewrite history.”  Jacobs added: “I think “Here Lies Love” shines a light on our history and it really shines a light more specifically on the people who led the revolution, the people who fought for democracy.”  “Here Lies Love” takes the audience back to the 70’s and the 80’s disco club scene in New York.  Bryne said the disco-driven musical brings to life Imelda’s lavish lifestyle in New York, and her endless parties with the Big Apple’s elite.  It will feature an all-Filipino cast for the first time on Broadway.  Conrad Ricamora plays the late senator Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino III, whose assassination in 1983, led to the bloodless revolt three years later.  “There’s never been an all-Filipino cast on Broadway,” he said. “We’re all energized and extra excited to tell our story in a revolutionary way.”  Playing the role of Ninoy’s mother Aurora is award-winning singer and actress Lea Salonga.  Lea Salonga joins cast of 'Here Lies Love' on Broadway  “On one level, the song is gorgeous but on a whole other level, it’s heartbreaking because this character is talking about her son,” she said.  “Here Lies Love” previews start on June 17 and opens on July 20 at the Broadway Theater in New York City.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hYnMtY2JuLmNvbS9saWZlLzA1LzE2LzIzL2hlcmUtbGllcy1sb3ZlLWNhc3Qtb24tcmV0ZWxsaW5nLW1hcnRpYWwtbGF30gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFicy1jYm4uY29tL2FtcC9saWZlLzA1LzE2LzIzL2hlcmUtbGllcy1sb3ZlLWNhc3Qtb24tcmV0ZWxsaW5nLW1hcnRpYWwtbGF3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:30:08","Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at The Baltimore Sun.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen, left, and Sen. Ben Cardin often appear together to draw attention to federal projects in Maryland but, in their roles as U.S. senators, pursue global causes, including human rights and press freedom. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun)  Human rights tops Ben Cardin’s list of accomplishments as a senator — specifically, his sponsorship of the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, a law imposing economic sanctions on bad actors in Russia and around the world.  There are other items on Cardin’s list: Subsidies for small business; federal funds for the Chesapeake Bay; improving ways for Americans to save for retirement; addressing health disparities.  Advertisement  But the Magnitsky Act sits at the top.  That says something not only about Cardin but about the scope of the work of a serious U.S. senator, something often lost in the political antics and demagoguery inflicted on us daily by buffoons and nascent fascists in the House of Representatives and the capitals of red states.  Advertisement  Cardin, at 79 the senior of Maryland’s two Democratic senators, has decided not to run for reelection in 2024. The person who wins his seat will not only have to be responsive to the needs of Marylanders but have a grasp of the far-reaching and complex issues that affect the nation and the world. A senator has to paint the big picture and stand up for freedom and human rights at home and abroad.  That too often goes without saying, so I’ll cite two examples — global causes Cardin and Sen. Chris Van Hollen pursue when they’re not, as they were Monday in Baltimore, addressing issues immediate to the state they represent.  The Magnitsky Act is named for the late Sergei Magnitsky, the Ukraine-born tax adviser who exposed multimillion-dollar fraud and corruption in Vladimir Putin’s regime and Russia’s state-owned businesses. Magnitsky was arrested on dubious charges and imprisoned for 11 months without a trial and without the medical attention he badly needed. He died in his cell in November 2009 at age 37. His untreated ailments or a beating, or both, caused Magnitsky’s death.  Cardin and the late Arizona Republican, John McCain, sponsored the Magnitsky Act in the Senate. It passed overwhelmingly in 2012, barring Russians and other human rights violators from entering the U.S. and freezing any assets they held in American banks. The law makes an important connection between trade agreements and human rights.  “America’s strength is in our values,” Cardin has said. “We must defend human rights and hold abusers accountable.”  These days, we don’t hear enough of that kind of high-minded talk, delivered with sober sincerity.  Magnitsky sanctions came to the forefront again in 2018, after the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist. While U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered an assassination team to kill Khashoggi, the Trump administration refused to enact Magnitsky sanctions against him. And while President Joe Biden called Saudi Arabia “a pariah state” during the 2020 campaign and later applied Magnitzky to more than a dozen individuals connected with Khashoggi’s murder, his administration concluded the Crown Prince had head of state immunity.  Cardin still disagrees.  Advertisement  “I was disappointed,” he says, “to see that the Biden administration did not directly sanction Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, especially since we know from our intelligence community that the crown prince approved the killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, Turkey. I was pleased to see the administration applying Global Magnitsky sanctions on 17 individuals for their roles in the brutal murder, but I do believe we remain far from delivering justice for Mr. Khashoggi and his family.”  Still, based on the latest report published in the Federal Register, there’s good reason to see human rights as Cardin’s crowning achievement: Magnitsky sanctions have been applied against 450 corrupt actors so far, and at least 12 other nations have adopted a Magnitsky-style apparatus for punishing human rights violators.  Van Hollen, meanwhile, has taken up press freedom, at home and abroad.  Among his current efforts is a push for an independent investigation of the death of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American and longtime television reporter for Al-Jazeera. She was fatally shot in the head a year ago this month while covering an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank.  Palestinian authorities claim Abu Akleh, who was wearing a helmet and press vest, had been killed by an armor-piercing bullet fired by an Israeli soldier. Israel said the source of the bullet could not be determined. A team of New York Times journalists used satellite imagery and video taken on the ground to conclude that the fatal bullet probably came from an Israeli military convoy and was most likely fired by a soldier from an elite unit.  Last week, on the anniversary of Abu Akleh’s death, Van Hollen renewed his call for an independent investigation.  Advertisement  “Protecting journalists is essential to protecting facts and the truth,” he said Monday. “We need to do more than talk about it, we need to insist on accountability.”  Van Hollen had just come from a walking tour of retail businesses in downtown Baltimore, with a focus on those owned by Black entrepreneurs. Cardin, Rep. Kwiesi Mfume and Isabella Casillas Guzman, administrator of the Small Business Administration, were with him.  “That, obviously, is a major focus,” Van Hollen said, “trying to make sure that we invest in Baltimore, make sure that the city can grow and prosper and deal with the many challenges that it faces.”  Then the senator said the thing that too often goes without saying:  “But it’s also important that we remember America’s role in the world. We have to support democracy and freedom of the press and human rights.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYWx0aW1vcmVzdW4uY29tL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1uaXN0cy9kYW4tcm9kcmlja3MvYnMtZWQtcm9kcmlja3MtMDUxNy1nbG9iYWwtc2VuYXRvcnMtMjAyMzA1MTYtd2dlb21qam95cmV2bmpqd29yemN1cTNrdm0tc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-12-06","21:30:00","{""Madrid"", ""Colima"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 23:31:02","In a letter published on her website and social media, Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has confirmed that she will not be running for president, or any other office. Kirchner accused the judiciary and the Supreme Court of imposing a “political ban” not only against her but the Peronist party as a whole.  “I’ve already said this on December 6, 2022. I am not going to be the mascota del poder (puppet for the powerful) for any candidacy,” she said. That day, she was handed a six-year prison sentence and a prospective lifetime ban from holding public office in the Vialidad case in which she was found guilty of fraudulently awarding public works contracts during her terms as president. She is still legally allowed to run for office until all instances of appeal have been exhausted.  “The conviction and ban, in this case, has only one political and electoral translation: a political ban.”  Kirchner contends in the letter that the Supreme Court is purposefully persecuting Peronism, dubbing it the “Judicial Party.” She drew parallels between her potential candidacy and the recent fallout over the Court suspending elections in San Juan and Tucumán.  “Just as three people [the justices of the Supreme Court] did it with the provinces of Tucumán and San Juan,” she said. “I have no doubt that they will do it against me in order to prevent Peronism from participating in the democratic process, or to weaken it, leading us to a dead end.”  Last week, the Supreme Court published preliminary rulings which declared the ineligibility of Tucumán and San Juan’s governors to run for reelection, suspending the provincial elections via precautionary measures in response to complaints filed by the opposition.  You may also be interested in: Supreme Court lifts Tucumán election suspension  Kirchner also said in the letter that since 2016, the so-called “Judicial Party […] works as a task force for Juntos por el Cambio [the main opposition coalition].” She also accused the Clarín newspaper of being “the main source for spreading hatred towards me and my family,” of lamenting the failed assassination attempt against her, and of anticipating the Vialidad case ruling.  “We must be intelligent in order to get out of this labyrinth and break the trap into which they want to lead us: that we have a candidacy forbidden by the Judicial Party,” she wrote.  Kirchner also deemed it “essential” to draw up a “government program that will enamor Argentine men and women again and convince them that a better country is not only possible but also desirable. A government program that is necessary not only for Peronism but for the democratic system as a whole.”  She also spoke about the country’s economic turmoil –including the “bimonetary” nature of the economy, record-high inflation, and exchange runs against the peso-, and the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF.)  “This makes it impossible for any government to reasonably manage the natural distributive struggle for income and turns inflation into the most phenomenal instrument for the transfer of resources from society as a whole to the richest and most concentrated sectors of the economy,” she wrote.  “It is no coincidence that neither of the two Presidents who accepted the IMF program [referring to former President Mauricio Macri and incumbent Alberto Fernández] retains electoral aptitude,” she added, referring to her own political partner.  The current government and the IMF signed an Extended Fund Facility agreement in 2022 after renegotiating the US$44 billion debt former President Mauricio Macri acquired in 2018. The deal includes an economic program that Argentina must comply with in order to receive disbursements every three months, which are used to pay for the previous debt with the IMF.  Kirchner also said that “democracy lost in the economic arena, it degraded itself in social matters, and started to break down politically and institutionally.”  “An important part of the citizenship does not feel that democracy contains themselves or their aspirations,” she wrote.  — Reporting by Facu Iglesia and Valen Iricibar","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYnVlbm9zYWlyZXNoZXJhbGQuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2luLWNoYXJnZWQtbGV0dGVyLWNmay1zYXlzLXNoZS13aWxsLW5vdC1ydW4tZm9yLWFueS1jYW5kaWRhY3nSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 08:12:28","WWE Night of Champions is scheduled for May 27, 2023, at the Jeddah Super Dome in Saudi Arabia. The event has been revived after almost eight years and will be the company's latest event in Saudi Arabia. The previous Night of Champions was held on September 20, 2015, at Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.  Speaking of events in Saudi Arabia, it so happens that certain WWE Superstars have decided to forgo a good payday by refusing to perform at events that happen in the country. On the other hand, certain superstars weren't allowed to perform in Saudi.  Here is the list of WWE Superstars who refused or weren't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia:  #5. John Cena (Refused)  When WWE signed a ten-year contract with Saudi Arabia in 2018, it was the beginning of ensuring the product was being broadcasted to a global audience. To promote the new relationship, the event featured a singles tournament. In that tournament, one of the advertised superstars was John Cena.  However, when Bobby Lashley was announced as Cena's replacement, it raised eyebrows, given The All Mighty never qualified in the first place. Turns out, The Champ had refused to be a part of the 2018 Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia as a result of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi's alleged assassination.  During the time when Cena refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, he was one of the most heavily advertised superstars for the event.  #4. Sami Zayn (Wasn't allowed)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has never performed in Saudi Arabia. It so happens that Sami Zayn is of Syrian descent, and the relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia used to be in a state of constant unrest.  While speaking on Blindboy podcast in 2020, Zayn discussed his stance on the company's partnership with Saudi Arabia.  ""WWE did a thing, a partnership sort of or signed some sort of deal to put on these shows in Saudi Arabia for I don’t know, what, 10 years or something like that. And I just wasn’t invited to go and I never really dug into it too much because I wasn’t keen on going to begin with, but I would like to discuss that”  However, recent improvements in Saudi Arabia and Syria's diplomatic relations may have convinced the company to include Sami Zayn in the event. Since he is one of the most over superstars among fans, his inclusion should fetch positive results for WWE.  #3. Kevin Owens (Refused)  The current Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champion has previously refused to perform in Saudi Arabia, even though he is scheduled for Night of Champions on May 27, 2023.  It's well-known that Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn are extremely close friends and have been together since their time in the independent wrestling circuit. Therefore, Owens refused to work in Saudi Arabia as a gesture of support towards Sami Zayn, who was not allowed (or never asked) to perform at previous events in Saudi Arabia.  However, Kevin Owens' stance may have changed, given Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa are supposed to battle Zayn and him at Night of Champions for the Undisputed Tag Team Title. Owens' decision to perform at Night of Champions could be attributed to WWE, including Sami Zayn.  #2. Aleister Black (Wasn't allowed)  Former WWE Superstar Aleister Black did not perform or rather wasn't allowed to perform in Saudi Arabia because of his tattoos that are related to religion.  Black has tattoos that portray Lilith, the demonic figure who stole babies at night, and Yama. Given that Saudi Arabia's stance on religion is rather strict, Black's tattoos will not go down well with the country.  As a result, the promotion never showed any major interest in booking him for Saudi Arabia events, regardless of his talents.  #1. Daniel Bryan (Refused) to work WWE Night of Champions  Former WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan has refused to perform in Saudi Arabia for more than one reason.  Bryan did not want to be a part of Crown Jewel in 2018 because of the same reason as John Cena, i.e., due to the alleged assassination of former Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Furthermore, the inaugural Greatest Royal Rumble event was held on April 27, 2018, in Saudi Arabia, but women weren't allowed to perform. This left a poor impression of Saudi Arabia events in Daniel Bryan's mind.  Finally, another reason why Daniel Bryan refused to perform in Saudi Arabia was due to the country's treatment of the LGBTQ community. In fact, during his time with the company, he directly spoke to Vince McMahon about the situation and his refusal to perform.

The monument was made by the eminent Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure (1862-1947), who is known for his neoclassic public monuments in Madrid and elsewhere that make even a clerk like Fergusson into a heroic figure.  It is a reunion of sorts to have this Benlliure work in the National Museum because the Spanish sculptor met a number of Filipino artists who were affiliated with the Spanish Academy in Rome like Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo and Miguel Zaragoza.  The monument has been loaned by the US Embassy to the National Museum, and it now stands in the main hall of the National Gallery of Art— between Juan Luna’s iconic “Spoliarium” and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo’s equally violent “Assassination of Governor Bustamante,” previously known under the more controversial title “La iglesia contra el estado”  The extension will last through 2025. The previous agreement expired last year.  Meanwhile, US Ambassador Marykay Carlson said that the state visit to the US by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was a successful one.  “President Marcos had a series of really important engagements and i think coming out of the visit I think US-Philippines (relations) catapulted up to an even better level than before which was even harder to imagine because we are already in a great trajectory. But he had great engagements with members of our cabinet of course in the Oval Office with the President, the Vice President,” Carlson said.

"assassination","2023-02-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 13:30:00","The National Portrait Gallery in February unveiled a rare portrait of President Abraham Lincoln. The nine-foot-tall portrait, painted by W.F.K. Travers in 1865, is one of only three known full-length renderings of the 16th president and will be on loan to the Smithsonian gallery in Washington, D.C., for the next five years.  The painting, which hung for decades in a municipal building in a small New Jersey town, has been restored and is now part of the “America’s Presidents” gallery.  Lincoln sat for Travers in 1864 and Travers completed the oil painting in Germany shortly after Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865. Travers then sold the painting to an American diplomat living in Frankfurt. In 1876, the painting was displayed at an exposition in Philadelphia, where Mary Todd Lincoln was reportedly, “so overcome by its lifelike appearance that she fainted and was carried out of the hall.”  Rare painting of President Abraham Lincoln. (National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution)  For years, it hung in the U.S. Capitol while Congress considered whether to purchase it, but it was ultimately sold to the Rockefeller family. In the 1930s, Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge—daughter of William Jr. and niece of John D.—built the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building in memory of her deceased son and filled it with art, including the Lincoln portrait.  In 2017, an archivist discovered that a marble bust of Napoleon sitting in the corner of the council room of the Hartley Dodge Memorial Building had been sculpted by Auguste Rodin, prompting the foundation to reassess all of the art in its collection. The loan of the Lincoln portrait to the National Portrait Gallery is part of that reassessment.  In addition to Lincoln’s likeness, the painting is filled with symbols noting the president’s place in history. He stands in front of a bust of George Washington and a rendering of the painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware” by Emanuel Leutze. Lincoln’s hand rests on a bound copy of the Constitution, next to a scroll bearing a draft of the 13th Amendment. Behind the scroll is a small statue of an African American man rising as he pulls the chains from his body.

"assassination","2014-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Tue 16 May 2023 09:23:54","In a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood of Gaza City there hangs a poster paying tribute to “the martyrs,” as those who die in the conflict with Israel are typically called. The youngest members of the group are distributing the usual dates and coffee with cardamom to people who come to offer their condolences.  On a poster showing the faces of Jamal Khaswan and his son Yousef, there are no emblems of Palestinian militias, and no photos of well-known Palestinian leaders such as Yasser Arafat, Ahmed Yasin or Mohammed Dahlan. Instead, there are only three logos: one from the city’s Al Wafa hospital — where the deceased had served as chairman of the board —, another one from a charitable association and a third from a nursing home.  Khaswan’s relationship with Palestine’s armed groups came down to living in the apartment unit right above Tariq Ibrahim Ezzedin, one of three leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad against whose homes Israel’s military aviation launched a missile in a series of synchronized selective assassinations, triggering a new escalation of violence and five days of fighting that ended this past Saturday with a ceasefire after 33 deaths in Gaza and two in Israel.  One of the homes targeted by Israeli aviation in Gaza City. Antonio Pita  It was 2:00 a.m. when the ceiling collapsed on the bed in which Jamal and his wife, Mervat, were sleeping. Both died, as did their 20-year-old son Yousef, who was sleeping in an adjoining room. Another son, Yasem, who is five years younger, did not find out until the next day, at the hospital, that he had lost three members of his family. The youngest child, a nine-year-old girl, still believes that her parents and one of her brothers “are traveling,” explains Musa Saber Khaswan, Jamal’s brother. They are three of the 14 civilians whose lives were claimed by Israel’s Operation Shield and Arrow, defined this Sunday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “perfect” for having killed ”dozens of terrorists” — including six leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad — and doing so “with total surprise and continuing initiative.”  “I was sleeping and suddenly things fell on my bed. It took me a few minutes to react,” Yasem, who a visible limp from the injuries caused by the falling debris, explains about the moment the missile hit the house. “We live in Gaza and we know that it is a dangerous place, but we never thought it could happen to us, because we know that my family is not a target for Israel,” he says with an absent look in his eyes.  Jamal Khaswan, 53, was a respected figure in Gaza, says his brother Musa Saber, who is four years older. In the 1990s, he studied dentistry and earned a doctoral degree in Russia, and had dual nationality. He was part of the family business of dental prosthetics, which currently employs 10 people and has been run by Musa since his graduation from Tel Aviv University (back when studying in Israel was not a pipe dream for a resident of Gaza). All the children in the family have gone on to study dentistry at college.  Musa Saber Khaswan stands next to two posters paying tribute to his brother Jamal, one of the victims of Israeli airstrikes against Gaza. Antonio Pita  Musa had visited his brother, who also headed the Gaza Dental Association, shortly before the latter’s death. Two hours later, he received a call that the building had been bombed. “It’s a good neighborhood. No one had moved away, no one expected anything to happen. If everyone in Gaza who has a neighbor from Hamas or from Islamic Jihad had to get out, the Israelis would have to start building lots of apartments for us,” he says ironically in one of the rare moments in which his voice does not tremble. “The pain of losing a brother is impossible to explain, but beyond that, the question is: why did he have to die? And I would say the same if I were a Jew or a Christian. And another question, how long will it go on like this?”  Three goals  The gaping holes in the buildings attest to the accuracy of both the impact (the buildings are still standing and, generally, with a single burnt-out apartment) and of Israel’s intelligence information regarding the location of the targets. The missiles were launched at dawn against three bedrooms in three different houses where the leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad were resting with their wives and children. Of the 13 deaths caused by that first wave of selective assassinations, on May 9, there were 10 civilians. One of them was five-year-old Hajar, who had snuggled in with her parents in their bed. Her father was Jalil Bahitini, a top commander of the Islamic Jihad.  Another daughter, 10-year-old Nada, has a black eye. That night, she was sleeping on the couch in the family home, just a few meters from the room where the projectile hit. At first, she says, she thought it was a dream. Then she saw a small fire. “I started screaming and realized that no one could hear me because I was under rubble,” she recalls, standing next to her sister Sara, 14. “I was expecting that something might happen to my father. At first, they told me that he had died, but that my mother and sister were only injured,” says Nada, before a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking further.  “My father used to tell us: ‘I could die at any moment,’” says his son Abdelaziz, 17, who was sleeping on the top floor of the two that make up the family home. “Yes, we were worried about him, because we knew he was part of the resistance and because what he said was true. But we thought it could happen in the middle of the street, or in a training field. What I could not imagine is that they would also take my mother and my sister,” he says, standing under the funeral tent where the Islamic Jihad is honoring his father. A group of hooded armed militiamen, the Al-Quds Brigades, are posing while loudspeakers blast nationalist and religious music against the “Zionist enemy.”  A poster paying tribute to Yihad Shaker Al Ghanam, secretary general of the military council of the Al Quds Brigades, killed on Monday in Israeli airstrikes in Rafah, a city in the south of the Gaza Strip.

"assassination","2023-05-01","10:30:00","{""Islamabad"", ""FederalCapitalArea"", ""Pakistan""}","Tue 16 May 2023 08:58:44","Islamabad:  Pakistan witnessed one of its worst violence, clashes and chaos on May 9 following former Prime Minister Imran Khan’s arrest at the Islamabad High Court, which prompted his followers to vandalise and damage sensitive army installations across the country.  The violence that went on for at least 72 hours saw mob attacks on General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Core Commander house in Lahore, Jinnah House Lahore, Radio Pakistan’s Peshawar office, and other government and state institution offices and buildings across the country.  The chaos targeted at state institutions, and the anger among Imran Khan’s supporters against the military, has now been linked to the former premier’s anti-military stance, open accusation and name calling of senior serving military officials of being behind attempts of assassination on his life.  The Pakistan Army has now decided to show zero tolerance against elements behind these attacks, terming them as a blatant attempt to not only target the institution but also to create a division between the people and the army.  During a special session of the Core Commanders Conference held at GHQ Rawalpindi, Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir was given a comprehensive briefing about incidents of violence and mob attacks on 9th May onwards as commanders expressed their anguish over the condemnable incidents.  The Core Commanders Conference mutually agreed to not show any restraint if such an attempts like that of 9th May are repeated in the future.  It also decided to show zero tolerance against all culprits behind the attacks, which the armed forces termed as “foreign supported and internally instigated, promoted and provoked against military installations and public/private properties”.  The army, without naming Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its chief Imran Khan, has hinted towards arresting all of its supporters, instigated and provoked by him, which has lead to the attacks against the military installations, and initiating trial against them under the anti-terrorism laws of the country.  The army has also decided to initiate the Army Act and the Official Secret Act in some cases as well going forward.  It claimed that it has irrefutable evidence to establish that the attacks were part of a pre-planned strategy, implemented immediately after Khan’s arrest.  “The forum was briefed that a well coordinated arson plan involving desecration of Shuhada pictures, monuments, burning down of historical buildings and vandalism of military installations was executed to malign the institution and provoke it towards giving an impulsive reaction,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.  “These attacks and attempts were made to create distortions in this regard are absolutely futile,” the ISPR added.  It is a known fact that Imran Khan has been very vocal about naming and shaming the army chief as well as other senior serving army and intelligence officials.  In his statement on May 9 before leaving for Islamabad from his Zaman Park residence in Lahore, he had lashed out at the military establishment yet again warning them of being ready for the consequences if any attempts to arrest him are made.  Now, with the army geared up to not spare the narrative and respond it with legal cases, Imran Khan’s coming days may just be numbered and he may be booked and trialed under the same references.  Under any of the references, if a case against Imran Khan is lodged and he is put to trial under any of the Acts, he may face life imprisonment or capital punishment.

"assassination","1969-07-01","Not Discerned","{""Brazil"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:59:50","When Robert Garland becomes artistic director of Dance Theatre of Harlem on July 1, he follows in the footsteps of founder Arthur Mitchell and retiring artistic director Virginia Johnson. He’s stepping into an important role: In addition to being a leading classical company that’s toured worldwide, DTH has had a significant impact on the field of dance and the larger American cultural landscape.  Arthur Mitchell created Dance Theatre of Harlem in New York City in 1969. Mitchell had made history as the first Black principal dancer at New York City Ballet, where he danced from 1956–69, with Balanchine creating ballets on him, notably roles in Agon and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. When Mitchell heard of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the radio while in Brazil in 1968, he decided to return home to start a dance school in Harlem. He enlisted the mentorship of Balanchine and the partnership of dance teacher Karel Shook.  Mitchell started the DTH School in a converted garage in Harlem, followed by the touring company, of which Virginia Johnson was a founding member. Mitchell created a haven for dancers of all colors who craved training, performance experience, and an opportunity to excel in classical ballet.  Though DTH began touring in 1969, it had its official New York City debut in 1971 at the Guggenheim Museum, with chamber ballets choreographed by Mitchell. With Mitchell’s­ vision,­ the guidance of Balanchine, who gave Mitchell­ access­ and rights to perform his ballets, and the partnership of Shook, the foundation of the company was laid. In addition to commis­sion­ing works from Black choreographers (he named Robert Garland as DTH’s first resident choreographer in 1995), Mitchell­ updated classical ballets, such as with Creole Giselle, staged by Frederic Franklin and set in 19th-century­ Louisiana, and John Taras’ Firebird, set in a lush jungle.  In its more than 50-year history, DTH has received international acclaim, performing in 44 states, 250 cities in North America, and in 40 countries on 6 continents. DTH’s pioneering efforts to integrate stages and spread the art of ballet through outreach programs at home and abroad made it a beacon for Black dancers worldwide. In 2004, the company went on hiatus because of financial challenges, and in 2009, Mitchell asked Johnson to bring the company back. Over the past 13 years, Johnson has led the company’s renaissance.  Watching DTH today, the impact of this trailblazing organization is clear. From its diverse international dancers to the dynamic classical and contemporary repertory, the many stars who began their careers with DTH now dancing in ballet companies around the world, and its reemergence in the global ballet scene, the company reflects today what Johnson exalts as “the prevailing sense of self-affirmation behind DTH” that was integral to Mitchell’s vision.  The impact of Dance Theatre of Harlem extends far beyond the stage. The company represents the amalgamation of culture present in evolving art forms and what it looks like when the reality of a diverse country is in fact exalted in its most expressive art form. Art, like that of DTH, is indeed the resistance to the facade of elitism representing only a portion of the population and culture. As Virginia Johnson passes the torch to Robert Garland to become the third artistic director in the company’s 54-year history, she leaves the organization poised to expand upon Arthur Mitchell’s extraordinary vision.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbmNlbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2RhbmNlLXRoZWF0cmUtb2YtaGFybGVtLWltcGFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-03-01","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:27:58","LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed the British government at the end of a whirlwind European tour Monday to join a ""fighter jet coalition"" that would help strengthen his country's aerial capabilities, but instead secured a commitment for attack drones and hundreds more missiles.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak greeted Zelenskyy with a handshake and hug after the president's helicopter landed at Chequers, the British leader's official country retreat. It was Zelenskyy's second trip to the U.K. since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and the fifth European country he's visited in three days.  He is seeking more military aid as Ukraine prepares a long-anticipated spring offensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. The Ukrainian leader also visited Italy, the Vatican, Germany and France.  Russia reacted to the U.K.'s new pledge ""extremely negatively,"" but also doubts that the missiles and drones would drastically change the course of the war, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday.  ""Britain aspires to be at the forefront among countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,"" Peskov said. ""We repeat once again: It cannot yield any drastic and fundamental influence on the way the special military operation (in Ukraine) is unfolding. But definitely it leads to further destruction. ... It makes this whole story for Ukraine much more complicated.""  Zelenskyy said one of the missions of his European travels that started Saturday was to build a ""fighter jet coalition"" to provide Ukraine with vital military power in the air. He said more work was needed on that front.  While the U.K. will not provide the planes, the prime minister said the country would join the coalition and begin a previously announced training program for Ukrainian fighter pilots as soon as this summer.  The U.K., one of Ukraine's major military allies, has provided short-range missiles, Challenger tanks and trained 15,000 Ukrainian troops on British soil. Last week, the government announced it had sent Ukraine Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which have a range of more than 150 miles. The British missiles were the first known shipment of longer-range weaponry that Kyiv has long sought from its allies.  Sunak's office said it was giving Ukraine hundreds more air defense missiles, as well as ""long-range attack drones"" with a reach of more than 120 miles.  ""This is a crucial moment in Ukraine's resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke,"" Sunak said. ""They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.  ""We must not let them down,"" the prime minister added.  Sunak plans to push allies at a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders in Japan later this week to deliver more support to Ukraine, his representative said.  As Zelenskyy visited European capitals, Russia increased its attacks across Ukraine with drones and missiles. Russia shelled two communities Sunday in the northern border province of Sumy, regional officials said on Telegram. They said 109 explosions were recorded.  Zelenskyy's office said Monday that Russian attacks had killed nine civilians and injured 19 in the past day. Six of the deaths were in southern Ukraine's Kherson province. Two civilians were killed in Chuhuiv in Kharkiv province, and one in Prymorsk, on the Azov Sea coast about 12 miles from Russian-occupied Berdyansk.  The presidential office also reported that Marhanets, which lies across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, was shelled.  Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported that an acting regional interior minister appointed by Moscow, Igor Kornet, was injured in an explosion at a barbershop in the Russian-occupied city of Luhansk. The leader of the Luhansk People's Republic, a separatist-held region of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed, was quoted as saying a bomb caused the explosion.  Assassination attempts and sabotage attacks have increased in Russian-occupied territory as well as Russia proper. Russian authorities often blame Ukrainian forces, but Kyiv rarely acknowledges such attacks.  Zelenskyy traveled to Britain from Paris, where he met Sunday with French President Emmanuel Macron and secured a pledge of light tanks, armored vehicles and air defense systems.      About 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers will receive training in France this year and nearly 4,000 others in Poland, Macron's office said.  Speaking Monday on the French television network TF1, Macron said training on French fighter jets such as the Mirage 2000 ""can start now"" but rejected the idea of France delivering warplanes to Ukraine.  Zelenskyy also met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday. It was his first visit to Berlin since the start of the invasion and came a day after the German government announced military aid for Ukraine worth more than $3 billion.  Modern Western hardware is considered crucial if Ukraine is to succeed in its planned counteroffensive. During his European trip, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would aim to liberate Russian-occupied areas within Ukraine's internationally recognized borders and would not attack Russian territory.  Among areas Russia still occupies are the Crimean Peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine with mainly Russian-speaking populations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL21heS8xNi96ZWxlbnNreXktcHVzaGVzLWZvci1maWdodGVyLWpldC1jb2FsaXRpb24vP25ld3Mtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:13:05","Hey everybody,  Today is the feast of St. Simon Stock, the 13th-century Carmelite who, by tradition, received from the Blessed Virgin the brown scapular which forms part of the Carmelite habit, and which — in smaller form — is worn daily by non-Carmelite Catholics around the world (including me!).  The scapular represents the filial piety of Catholics who have entrusted themselves to the protection of Our Lady — it is a sign of receiving Mary as a mother, and asking for her intercessory prayers.  It became a popular devotion beyond the Carmelites in the 16th and 17th centuries, and remains one today — and it probably helped that Pope John Paul was devoted to the scapular sacramental, reportedly asking in 1981, after an assassination attempt, that doctors leave his scapular around his neck while they operated on his body.  Of course, there are people who criticize the scapular as a kind of talismanic devotion — taking the so-called scapular promise (“whoever dies clothed in this scapular shall not suffer the fires of hell”) literalistically, instead of understanding it as a way of talking about persevering in the spiritual life.  It would be a mistake to imagine that one can die very far from God, in a pile of sin and depravity, and be taken up to heaven because one has worn the right wool squares around one’s neck. But I don’t know too many people who actually think that’s what their scapular is about.  Taken properly, as a sign of consecration to Christ through the maternal intercession of the Blessed Mother, the scapular can be a physical sign of the way in which, as John Paul II put it, “devotion to [Mary] cannot be limited to prayers and tributes in her honor on certain occasions, but must become a ‘habit,’ that is, a permanent orientation of one's own Christian conduct, woven of prayer and interior life, through frequent reception of the sacraments and the concrete practice of the spiritual and corporal works of mercy.”  JPII added: “In this way the scapular becomes a sign of the ‘covenant’ and reciprocal communion between Mary and the faithful: indeed, it concretely translates the gift of his Mother, which Jesus gave on the Cross to John and, through him, to all of us, and the entrustment of the beloved Apostle and of us to her, who became our spiritual mother.""  Whether you’re a scapular wearer or not, let the feast of St. Simon Stock remind us to make our devotion to Mary a “habit,” a “permanent orientation of … Christian conduct,” through the sacraments and the works of mercy.  St. Simon Stock, pray for us.  Subscribe now  The news  The bishops of France announced May 5 a kind of clerical ID card for bishops, priests, and deacons in the country, which replaces the customary celebret, and which includes a QR code, linking to a website which gives (reportedly) updated information on whether the cleric has faculties, and whether he labors under any ecclesiastical sanctions or ministerial restrictions.  Bishop Jean-Marc Eychenne of Grenoble-Vienne, France, shows his identity card. Screenshot from Église catholique en France YouTube account.  The ID card system has gotten some pushback in France, with some victim advocacy groups calling it a publicity stunt, and saying that it’s been rolled out in place of more systematic safeguarding policies needed in France.  I don’t know about all that.  But I do know that in the U.S., there exists a cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive (in terms of personnel) back-and-forth process between dioceses for checking to see whether a cleric is a priest in good standing, who has faculties, and who has completed the safe environment trainings and background checks required for ministry.  When priests go out of town for weddings, retreats, vacations, or to fill in for a friend, there is a lot of paperwork going on between curias to make sure things are in order. A digitized system that would simplify that process would save priests a lot of headaches, and save chanceries a lot of time and money.  Of course, much like the current “letter of suitability” system, the digital ID card system is only as good as its users — if chanceries weren’t honest about a priest’s status, the card system wouldn’t fix that. And if chanceries didn’t update statuses in their databases, well, the card system wouldn’t be especially useful. But there are “user error” problems with the current approach as well, and sometimes they’re caused by the sheer volume of letters being handled in a vicar for clergy’s office — a volume that would be considerably reduced by this system.  It would be foolish to think that this system could replace other needed safeguarding reforms — as the victims’ advocates in France pointed out. But while it can’t solve all problems, it could solve some problems — and I know a lot of clerics hoping the bishops of the U.S. will take up a similar system soon.  Read all about France’s efforts, right here.  —  While the German “synodal way” formally concluded back in March, the powerful lay Central Committee of German Catholics says its battle to change the Church in Germany is just getting started.  “We are witnessing in recent weeks a Church in which leading men are cementing their power, refusing developments, and further deepening the rifts between the Church and the world,” the Zdk’s Irme Stetter-Karp said earlier this month, complaining about the Vatican’s refusal to endorse a resolution calling for lay preaching at Masses.  “I am angry and shocked,” Stetter-Karp declared. “But today more than ever it is clear: This Church as an absolutist system of power must come to an end.”  In an analysis last week, Luke Coppen broke down the ZdK’s efforts to obtain a permanent share of decision-making power within the Catholic Church in Germany — and its escalation of confrontational rhetoric after the Vatican didn’t endorse synodal way proposals.  Interesting, of course, is that German bishops have to date seemed to fall into line with whatever Stetter-Karp pushes for in Germany. But as they’re forced into a corner, it’s not clear they’ll continue “accompanying” the ZdK — and their pushback would mark a major sea change for ecclesiastical dynamics in Germany.  Read all about that, right here.  —  The Vatican City State got on a Saturday a new constitution, promulgated by Pope Francis, and making a number of interesting reforms. Most headlines about the new law have focused on the fact that lay people can now serve on the city-state's governing commission.  But most striking at The Pillar is that the new constitution talks about the exercise of authority in a very unusual way — removing all references to ordinary governance power, and focusing on governance “functions,” exercised in cooperation with the pontiff.  That might seem like pedantic semantics.  But amid a major Vatican debate about lay people and the “power of governance” in the Church, this revised rhetoric in the fundamental law of Vatican City is a big deal. But — what exactly does it mean?  In an incisive analysis, Ed Condon breaks things down. And he says it may be too soon to tell what the Vatican is working at here — but it’s something worth noting.  Read about a big, and cryptic, change, coming amid a ferocious debate about holy orders and governance.  —  Pope Francis has told journalists in recent months that he’s hoping to go to his native Argentina next year.  In 10 years of papacy, the pontiff has not yet been home to his country — and the reasons why are pretty complicated, actually. And, in fact, 2024 isn’t chosen at random: there’s a pretty good set of reasons why that might be the most sensible year for the pope to return home.  But to understand much of that, you’ve got to understand something about Argentine politics, and the pope’s long-standing tensions with various politicians, of various parties.  So our Latin American correspondent, Edgar Beltran, took a very deep dive into some of Francis’ history in Argentina — talking with a number of experts on the subject — to explain why the pontiff has delayed his homecoming.  This is a history of Francis with which you might not be especially familiar. And you should read it, because you’ll probably learn something. I learned a lot.  Give a gift subscription  —  We reported on Friday that the Vatican will ask Bishop Rick Stika to resign as Bishop of Knoxville, after more than two years of scandal over the bishop’s leadership of his eastern Tennessee diocese.  Sources close to the Dicastery for Bishops confirmed that Pope Francis decided last month to request Stika’s resignation, after reviewing the results of a Vatican-ordered investigation into the bishop’s management.  Of course, the Knoxville diocese has not commented on our reporting, and it remains to be seen whether Stika will actually tender his resignation. If he doesn’t, it could take some time for a difficult situation in Tennessee to resolve. But our reporting indicates that a long saga in the diocese is coming to its end game.  My suspicion is that Bishop Mark Spalding of Nashville will be appointed to temporarily lead the diocese if, and when, Stika makes his exit.  Things aren’t over in Knoxville, but this is a very serious development in a story we’ve covered now for more than two years.  And, if you’ve forgotten how exactly it started, you can read our lengthy May 2021 profile of Stika — which gives a rather comprehensive view of the man himself, even while we’ve uncovered considerably more about his leadership since its publication.  Leave a comment  Did +Strickland do a schism?  Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, attracted some attention this weekend, when on Friday night he tweeted that “I believe Pope Francis is the Pope but it is time for me to say that I reject his program of undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  There is a backstory to the tweet, which involves Strickland signing on to participate as a lecturer in a kind of online course organized by a sedevacantist named Patrick Coffin, and then pulling out once he learned it was a sedevacantist affair.  But the backstory isn’t important right now, or at all, actually.  To many people, though, it does seem important that a sitting diocesan bishop accused the pope of advancing a “program undermining the Deposit of Faith.”  The “deposit of faith” constitutes the whole of sacred revelation, as contained in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition, to be interpreted by the Church’s magisterium — so it’s no small potatoes for a sitting diocesan bishop to say the pope opposes that sacred deposit.  I was reminded by the tweet, to be honest, of some of the more fiery columns written decades ago by Milwaukee’s Archbishop Rembert Weakland in opposition to Pope St. John Paul II’s Curia, with whom Weakland disagreed on just about everything.  I don’t think +Strickland would appreciate being compared to +Weakland, but I can’t think of another American bishop who has so openly and directly expressed such vehement opposition to a pope’s leadership in a public context.  Now, let’s be real for a minute, OK? Really real.  There are a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who think that Pope Francis’ approach to governance and teaching in the life of the Church is counterproductive, theologically flawed, or inimical to the flourishing of the Gospel. There were a lot of Catholics, bishops among them, who thought that about JPII or Benedict XVI’s leadership, or about that of Paul VI and John XXIII before them.  The pope is a sign and agent of unity in the Church, but he fosters that unity through faith, sacraments, and governance, not his own personal priorities or opinions.  This is a big Church, and we’re not all going to agree — so it shouldn’t be a source of scandal that some bishops think the Church’s pastoral life should be going in a very different direction than the pope is taking it. Especially in the modern era, when the personality of the pope looms so large, and seems to shape an office which once dwarfed its occupants, it can hardly be a surprise that a cadre of bishops disagree with the rhetoric, policies, or priorities of the Roman Pontiff. There’s no sin in that, so far as I can tell.  And there are probably a fair number of bishops today who basically agree with what Strickland had to say, even if they think he said it inelegantly, at best.  But a bishop has the responsibility of both leading his own people, and of building up unity in the life of the entire Church — of encouraging filial piety toward the pope as a universal shepherd and the principle of unity, and of encouraging obedience to him.  A bishop also has a responsibility to assure Catholics of the unique charism of the pope to teach, and of the Lord’s promise to protect the Church from error or apostasy, even if not to protect the Church from the imprudent choices of her leaders, or of the consequences of those choices.  While Strickland didn’t expressly encourage disobedience to the pope, you’d be hard-pressed to argue that language about “rejecting” and “undermining” is going to help Catholics who feel discouraged or confused at the moment to find their footing — or remind them about the charismatic infallibility of the papacy which acts as a kind of safeguard for the deposit of faith itself.  In that sense, it is a scandal if a sitting diocesan bishop made it harder for Catholics to find the proper disposition at a difficult moment in the Church’s life, or if he enflamed the passions of Catholics, undermining their ability to accept the primacy of the pope as an article of both faith and practice.  Now, the bishop might say there’s a reason for his rhetoric. I asked him for an interview on Monday to explain himself, but he declined to give that interview — so we’re left without his elaboration.  I have noted before that Strickland seems to speak before he thinks at crucial moments, and that while he’s sometimes revered as a straight-shooting hero, there are consequences to that kind of thing, and they often lead to confusion.  Still, while I’ve seen commentators and reporters suggest that Strickland’s tweet on Friday constitutes a kind of schism, I don’t think that’s so.  Schism is the “refusal of submission to the Roman Pontiff, or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.”  It generally means a formal act of rejection - excluding the pontiff from the Eucharistic prayer, for example - or an act of disobedience to an actual directive from the pope. So while people might argue Strickland is in the proximate occasion of schism, I can’t see how he’s actually committed the canonical crime.  There is another canonical crime, though, that might be applied to Strickland’s rhetoric:  Canon 1373 establishes that “a person who publicly incites hatred or animosity against the Apostolic See or the Ordinary because of some act of ecclesiastical office or duty, or who provokes disobedience against them, is to be punished by interdict or other just penalties.”  It could be plausibly argued, I think, that Strickland’s tweet might well provoke disobedience against the Apostolic See, given that it talks about a kind of rejection of the pope’s leadership — or suggests as much.  We discussed c. 1373 at The Pillar yesterday, with Ed of the opinion that the Holy See might very well sanction Strickland, in light of the canon, for the scandal of his tweet.  Ed argued that bishops have been removed for less — pointing out that the bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, was removed from his office last year for, effectively, some disagreements with his brother Puerto Rican bishops.  But that bishop was reportedly removed after considerable lobbying by influential churchmen who didn’t like his influence on the Church in Puerto Rico. And I don’t think the Holy See will have much response to Strickland’s tweet.  In the first place, the Vatican is still enough of the old school that while a magazine or journal article might rank as important, a tweet seems to many officials like some ephemeral bit of noise on the internet, unimportant, because it’s not understood.  But more than that, Pope Francis’ approach to overt criticisms of his leadership — whether from left, right, or center, is to ignore them — to deprive his critics of the oxygen they’d gain from his attention. Whether a particular criticism is valid or not is immaterial to him — the pope has demonstrated that he prefers to freeze out his critics, as he’s done in Germany, rather than respond with defenses or overt sanctions.  While I am certain the Holy See will make life difficult for the bishop of Tyler, by a thousand kinds of administrative and bureaucratic coldness, I think Strickland was probably already on the list for that kind of treatment in Rome.  Furthermore, I don’t think there’s anyone to lobby for his removal, or for any kind of sanction against him, for that matter.  If the American churchmen influential in Rome are asked their opinions, I suspect they’ll say they see Strickland’s rhetoric as a problem. But I don’t think they’ll stick their necks out too far over the issue.  I suspect those influential American churchmen in Rome realize they only have so much political capital for these kinds of things, and they don’t perceive Strickland as a major obstacle to achieving their goals for the life of the Church.  They might be bothered by his impertinence, sure, but I don’t think anyone in ecclesiastical leadership takes him seriously enough to push to get this on the pontiff’s desk.  In the Church, there is a certain kind of latitude extended to people perceived as harmless-seeming zealots, especially if they lack very much influence on their brother bishops. I suspect that’s how Strickland will be perceived in Rome, unless American cardinals push the issue.  In short, I’ll be very surprised if the pope makes any move regarding Strickland.  Again, I’m not saying I’ve got an opinion on what should be done about him — I know I’ll soon get emails about why my opinion is wrong on Strickland — it’s just my read of the situation itself.  Marshall Matters  In a surprise move last week, Catholic YouTube celebrity and internet provocateur Taylor Marshall announced that he was running for president.  Of the United States of America.  Now, in our little corner of the world, Marshall is not an unknown commodity. The guy has some half-a-million subscribers on YouTube, wrote a book hypothesizing about various infiltrations of the Vatican, developed a friendship with Archbishop Viganò, and paid the expenses of the guy who threw “the statue” in the River Tiber during the 2019 Amazon Synod.  He’s also the guy who said just a few months ago that the U.S. government is running an elaborate psyop on the American people to distract us from the possibility of demonic extraterrestrial aliens — or something very close to that.  Marshall is a former Anglican curate who became a Catholic, who once had a little apostolate selling catechetical materials, and whose messaging gradually became more provocative, and less connected to reality, as his YouTube audience grew.  He built an audience while rejecting at various times the legitimacy of the Church hierarchy and Vatican Council II, and, when the moment struck, allied himself with the political conspiracy theorism and biblically apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding the “Stop the Steal” movement.  He is, to my mind, best understood as a kind of religious entertainer, a performance artist, floating often outlandish conspiracy theories and provocative opinions, while managing to connect, in some down-to-earth way, to the real neuralgia about Church and state experienced by a real-life swath of Catholics.  He’s not unlike alt-right polemicist and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, actually — and as it happens, Marshall’s been interviewed as a Vatican “expert” on Jones’ Infowars.  If you’re not down with that kind of thing, let me say Marshall shouldn’t be written off entirely, because, the fact is, he has an audience, and makes a very nice living giving hot takes on the Church, selling books about freemasons and invented conspiracy theories, and portending some coming doom for America and the Church.  It is easy to make fun of Marshall’s schtick. But I think his audience deserves more careful consideration. They matter to me. They’re people who practice the faith, and have concerns and anxieties — people who went looking to make sense of things, and found this dude on YouTube promising he’s got all the answers.  That audience, by the way, exists in real life — when I speak at parishes, seminaries, or diocesan events, I’m often asked what I think of Marshall’s book, or encouraged to check out his YouTube channel — and often enough, by clerics.  And I promise you — this week we’ll see canceled subscriptions, and we’ll get nasty emails, from people who think I fail to appreciate Marshall’s prophetic genius.  While I don’t think Marshall evinces a firm or cogent grasp on issues in the Church, or talks about them sincerely or responsibly, his popularity says something about the unease many Catholics feel about the state of the Church, and about their place in a rapidly changing world — “not an epoch of change,” Pope Francis says, “but a change of epoch.”  And in a certain way, Marshall’s place in the U.S. Church is not all that unlike that of Fr. James Martin — and the popularity of both of those men is instructive.  Like Fr. Martin, the fact that Marshall has a (big) audience tells us some important things about what different swathes of Catholics value, what they fear, and what they’re looking for — even if both men take advantage of that audience, or exploit it to pursue their own (radically different) agendas.  Marshall’s popularity, like Martin’s, strikes me as a kind of funhouse mirror, through which something can be gleaned — with enough filters to straighten the image — about the state of the Church. And it seems to me we should be willing to look.  In fact, if we really want to learn what disenfranchised Catholics think about the Church, we might learn more from the comments in Taylor Marshall’s YouTube videos than we can from all the synods on synodality that every synoded synodally.  And I, for one, think that’s useful.  But Taylor Marshall is not a known commodity outside our small corner of the world.  And let’s just be clear about something.  Taylor Marshall is not going to be the president.  Taylor Marshall will not be president.  He won’t be.  I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t even want to be president.  With that out of the way, I should say that I’m an admirer of third parties and the role they play in American political life, and I think it can be perfectly legitimate to vote for them. I think democracies are healthier without a duopoly locked in enduring combat, when small parties can play key roles in forming coalition governments, and when new ideas have room to move forward.  I think the Democrats and Republicans have done well enough in this country at capturing the whole of our political imagination, and the perpetuity of binary power transfers, such that most of us believe there are only two meaningful options for voting.  The guidance of the Church affirms the legitimacy of choosing the candidate who you think would be the best, even if he won’t win — or even of not voting in a particular race. But when election year rolls around, I hear a lot of well-meaning Catholics say that anything but a vote for Candidate X is really a vote for Candidate Y — or vice versa.  We even hear that from a swath of well-meaning pulpits.  I don’t think the mathematical or moral assessment on that actually checks out, but you hear it in election years, pretty often — “If you don’t vote for Our Guy, you’re voting for the Other Guy. And the Other Guy is pure evil, so you’ve got to vote for Our Guy. And this is the most important election of our lifetime. Again.”  The Church teaches clearly that voting for certain candidates, with inhuman policy agendas, is morally abhorrent, or that one needs rather significant “proportionate reasons” to overcome the monstrosity of their agendas. And it teaches that when all candidates have morally abhorrent agendas, you can choose one who “deemed less likely to advance such a morally flawed position and more likely to pursue other authentic human goods.”  The Church doesn’t teach that if you don’t vote for one of the frontrunners, you’re somehow voting for the other frontrunner. But come election time, you’ll hear a lot of that, with fervent conviction, from lots of Catholics.  And, in fact, in elections past, it was the kind of the thing you’d hear from Marshall’s audience, or from the man himself, as when, for example, he served in 2020 as a prominent member of Catholics for Trump.  So I’m interested to see whether Marshall’s presence as a “candidate” — he is not, as of yet, among the 727 Americans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission declaring their candidacy for president — will change that discussion for some Catholics.  Of course, I can’t speculate about why Marshall is running for president. Or, I can, but it wouldn’t be charitable.  But I will say, sincerely, that if the candidacy of a polemicist YouTuber and “Infiltration” expert opens up discussion about breaking free from a consequentialist moral calculus, one mandating people vote for a candidate they just can’t stomach — well, I’m glad for the conversation, at least.  And did you know that 727 Americans have filed paperwork to declare themselves candidates for 2024?  This is one hell of a country, guys.  Subscribe now  It’s not the celibacy  Finally, we covered last week the scandal of Fr. Alfonso Pedrajas, a Spanish Jesuit who served in Bolivia, and whose posthumously discovered journals revealed that he had committed serial abuse of minors, and that his ecclesiastical superiors had seemingly covered it up.  Pedrajas’ journals are sobering and sickening reading, by any standard.  Well, as the Bolivian bishops respond to the scandal, one took to the radio last week, to say that as “changes have to be made,” one of them is for the Church to ordain married men to the priesthood.  According to Bolivian radio network Erbol, Bishop Eugenio Coter argued that allowing married men to be ordained priests could be part of the solution to the problem of sexual abuse in the Church, since, he reportedly argued, marriage helps a person to develop an integrated sexuality, and provides companionship.  Please allow me to editorialize for a moment: Bishop Coter seemingly has rather profoundly misunderstood the dynamics of pederastic and pedophilac child abuse in any context. Marriage would not stop pederastic child abusers from committing abuse. In fact, as data from other public institutions shows us repeatedly, it doesn’t. And indeed, the most typical place for a child to be abused is in his extended family or among family friends, most of whom are not likely celibate.  Of course, I’ve seen it argued that there is a greater likelihood that married men will have a mature, integrated, and chaste sexuality than celibate men. I don’t see any reason to think that’s true — in fact, I don’t think it’s true. But even if it were, allowing for the possibility of married men wouldn’t, by itself, screen out from the priesthood men with the propensity or disposition to be abusers. Better screening, scrutiny, evaluation, and formation processes would do that, with the knowledge that sacred ordination, or admission to religious life, shouldn’t be offered to everyone who seeks it.  It is a demeaning view of marriage — and of women — to suggest that if only priests could be married, abuse would not happen. There is no evidence to suggest this, as experts in abuse and safeguarding have often argued.  Clerical celibacy has a long and rich theological and spiritual history in the West. It is not absolute, of course — deacons can be married men, as can members of the Church’s Anglican ordinariate. But celibacy is a disciplinary, not a doctrinal matter, and the Church could allow for more married men to become priests in the West. Certainly, there are prelates who think that’s a good idea.  But whatever their reasons, the notion that ending clerical celibacy would eradicate abuse is a red herring. At least as far as I can tell — If you think otherwise, let me know in the comments. I’d be interested to read your view.

"assassination","1981-05-30","Not Discerned","{""Chittagong"", ""Chittagong"", ""Bangladesh""}","Tue 16 May 2023 15:07:02","The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has announced a 13-day program to commemorate the 42nd death anniversary of General Ziaur Rahman, the party's founder and former president of the country.  The observance will commence on May 29 and conclude on June 10. These programs were finalized during a joint meeting at the party's Naya Paltan central office yesterday, presided over by Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.  Fakhrul announced a series of activities that will take place during this period. These activities include engaging in discussions, hosting seminars, organizing photo exhibitions, wearing black badges as a symbol of mourning for Zia, as well as distributing food and relief materials to the needy, according to a report by UNB.  As part of the commemoration, black flags will be raised and party flags will be lowered to half-mast at all party offices, including the Nayapaltan headquarters, at 6 am on May 30.  Ziaur Rahman gained prominence for his role in reading out the Declaration of Independence from Kalurghat Betar Kendra on March 27, 1971, and for his active participation in the war. Following liberation, he was appointed deputy chief of staff of the army. After the assassination of the Father of the Nation and President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on August 15, 1975, Zia assumed the position of army chief. In November of the year, following a series of coups and counter-coups, with President ASM Sayem as chief martial law administrator, Zia became one of the three deputy chief martial law administrators. He eventually became president of the country in April 1977 in succession to Justice ASM Sayem, who had become president in early November 1975.  In 1978, Zia founded the BNP and conducted parliamentary elections in 1979 to end martial law rule, which had imposed restrictions on political activities and freedom of the press.  General Zia was assassinated by a group of army officers in a putsch at the Chittagong Circuit House on May 30, 1981, where he had traveled from Dhaka to resolve a conflict within the party.  Following Zia's death, General HM Ershad, who had been appointed army chief by Zia, oversaw the process of a controversial military trial that resulted in the hanging of a dozen army officers on charges of conspiring to assassinate the president. Another courageous army officer, Maj Gen M Abul Manzur, who had knowledge of the conspiracy against Zia, was extrajudicially killed allegedly on Ershad's orders, with him being falsely accused of being behind the president's assassination.  Four days before the assassination, Ershad met with Lt Col Motiur Rahman at the Chittagong cantonment. Motiur shot the president, leading to his demise.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC8yMDIzLzA1LzE2L2JucC1hbm5vdW5jZXMtemlhcy00Mm5kLWRlYXRoLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXByb2dyYW1z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When I announced my decision not to run for office again, I cited the increased vitriol, hateful rhetoric, and lack of civility in our public discourse. It is hard to look at a situation such as today, or reflect on the events of Jan. 6, 2021, and not see some correlation between the divisive politics of hate which depersonalize our political foes into caricatures of villains and the acts of violence.  According to her Congressional Testimony on March 31, 2022, Rachel Kleinfeld, a Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, there was an acceleration of political violence between 2016 and 2020 and the level of acceptance and support for political violence has also increased by members of both political parties. Justifications are steeped in the importance of protecting the traditional American way of life, validity of elections, and other false or misleading narratives. Threats against members of Congress have almost doubled, and hate crimes are increasing, with rates higher in 2021 than in the year following 9/11.  More disturbing than even historic numbers is the broader base of individuals who are involved in these acts of aggression. Acts of aggression like what happened today at Connolly’s office are no longer contained to extremist groups, but have spread to lone actors reacting to the rhetoric they are hearing or seeing online, in public meetings and feeling compelled to take aggressive action.  We do not know the motivation of the intruder in Connolly’s office. There have been moments and periods of time, as an elected school board member, where I worried about my colleagues, our staff, and my own safety during official proceedings when emotionally charged issues came before the board.  We do know that each of us can do our part to mitigate these acts. Collectively, we must tone down the divisive rhetoric, vilifying name calling, and character assassination. The issues before our Federal, State legislatures, and local governments are too important to trivialize with destructive and non-productive behavior. We must focus on the issues before our policy making bodies that affect the everyday lives of our community members.  We can realize that there are policy areas where groups or individuals may align on individual issues and others where the makeup of a group supporting an issue may be different. However, this is only possible if the discourse focuses on the content of the policy issues and does not cast aspersions on the character of individuals in a group.  Together we can achieve the American dream of a more perfect union by reenforcing our foundations of civil discourse.

"assassination","2023-10-12","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:00:00","U.N. Secretary General António Guterres warned Monday that Haiti’s “tragic situation” is threatening the security of the Caribbean region and beyond as he pressed the international community for a response.  Guterres spoke after meeting behind closed doors with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness in his first visit to the island, which comes more than three months after Holness announced that his government was willing to send soldiers and police officers to Haiti as part of a proposed international armed forces deployment.  Guterres noted that no other country has stepped forward despite the plea from Haiti’s prime minister and other top officials last October for the immediate deployment of an international force to fight a surge in gang violence.  “We are kind of in a stalemate right now,” he said, adding that it’s been difficult to mobilize the will of countries who could best lead such an operation.  Holness, who visited Haiti in February as part of a regional push to help mediate the country's crisis, said countries that would support such a deployment want to first see political consensus in Haiti and a timeframe for ending the proposed deployment.  “It is not that our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” he said. “It is being heard to and listened to. The question is the pace of action.”  Haiti’s capital and surrounding areas have largely succumbed to warring gangs that have invaded neighborhoods and killed people in a fight to control more territory, with the U.N. estimating that they now control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince.  The violence has worsened since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. More than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, in addition to more than 600 people slain in the month of April alone, according to the U.N. More than 400 people also have been kidnapped so far this year.  “You have dramatic humanitarian needs. You have a political system that is paralyzed, and you have levels of violence by gangs that are absolutely appalling,” Guterres said.  He previously said that insecurity in Haiti had reached “levels comparable to countries in armed conflict.”  The deaths have prompted a growing number of angry and frustrated Haitians to unleash gruesome vigilante justice, lynching at least 164 alleged gang members last month, according to the U.N.  Frantz Elbé, director of Haiti’s National Police, said in a video posted on social media Saturday that officers are fighting gangs, seizing weapons and releasing hostages, but he did not provide any figures.  The U.N. has noted that just over 13,000 officers are on active duty in a country of more than 11 million people, with at least 21 police officers reported killed in the first three months of this year.  “I want to once again ask the international community to understand that an effective solidarity with Haiti is not only a matter of generosity,” Guterres said. “It’s essentially a matter of enlightened self-interest because the present situation in Haiti reflects a threat, a threat to the security of the whole region and further afield.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndscm4ub3JnL2FtZXJpY2FzLzIwMjMtMDUtMTYvdW4tY2hpZWYtaW4tamFtYWljYS11cmdlcy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXJlc3BvbnNlLXRvLWhhaXRpcy1zcGlyYWxpbmctY3Jpc2lz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-04-06","Not Discerned","{""Tennessee"", ""Illinois"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 12:39:47","Tennessee Rep. Justin Jones raises a fist to the legislative gallery, as fellow Rep. Justin Pearson, left, looks on. Seth Herald/Getty Images  Mississippi legislators have enacted a law that would create a new judicial system covering the state’s capital city, Jackson, in place of the current county court system.  Set to take effect July 1, 2023, the move by a Republican-dominated legislature has been criticized by opponents as creating a “separate and unequal” court system that is not answerable to the majority-Black community it would seek to govern.  The law was justified by supporters as an effort to curb the city’s crime level, which includes one of the highest murder rates in the nation. But the move is the second time in as many months that state legislatures have taken highly visible actions to effectively disenfranchise Black voters: On April 6, the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Black members who represented mostly Black districts.  As a sociologist who studies race and ethnicity, I have closely followed these moves by the states. Throughout U.S. history, I see three main periods of legislative disenfranchisement in which legislative bodies have voted to expel members. These events have been shown to be a form of “white backlash” working to keep Black officeholders out of power and their constituents powerless without representation.  Reconstruction and legislative disenfranchisement  After the Civil War, the United States engaged in a brief period known as Reconstruction, which lasted from 1865 to 1877. It was a deliberate attempt to reverse the negative effects and legacies of slavery by enacting economic, political and social policies that directly benefited the formerly enslaved Black people of the South.  The efforts included formally abolishing slavery nationwide, guaranteeing equal protection of the laws to everyone regardless of race, and allowing formerly enslaved people to vote. In addition, formerly Confederate land was set aside for newly freed Black families, and former Confederate soldiers were not allowed to vote.  But after Tennessee politician Andrew Johnson, who had been Abraham Lincoln’s running mate in 1864, took office upon Lincoln’s assassination, many of those provisions of Reconstruction were reversed. Former Confederate combatants were allowed to vote, and confiscated Confederate property was returned to its prewar owners.  Story continues  In addition, Johnson and Congress made it easier for defeated Confederate states to rejoin the Union, which allowed former Confederate leaders to regain their previous positions of power in local and national governments.  Georgia was originally readmitted to the Union in July 1868. But just two months later, in September, the Democratically controlled Georgia Assembly, with a total of 196 members, voted to expel all 33 of its Black elected officials.  Immediately upon making themselves into an all-white legislature, the remaining assembly members enacted the infamous Black Codes. These codes created a unique set of laws specific to the newly freed Blacks, including limiting the types of work they could do.  Collectively, the legislative expulsion of the Black officials and the imposition of the Black Codes served to effectively disenfranchise the Black voters of Georgia. Senator Henry McNeal Turner, one of those expelled, defiantly asked: “Am I a man? If I am such, I claim the rights of a man.”  Under the Black Codes, which were restrictive laws in the post-Reconstruction South, a Black person could be sold into what was effectively a new version of slavery if they could not repay fines or debts. Interim Archives/Getty Images  The civil rights era  Another major effort to disenfranchise Black Americans came during their next major push to achieve political, social and economic equality: the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Opponents targeted two prominent civil rights activists who had been elected to represent their communities: Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Julian Bond.  Bond was elected as a Democrat to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965, but on Jan. 10, 1966, the Democratically controlled House voted not to seat him, citing his criticism of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and support of students who were protesting the war. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Bond’s First Amendment rights had been violated and ordered that he be seated. But for that intervening year, his constituents had no voice in their state legislature. Bond ultimately served in the Georgia legislature for another two decades, before turning to teaching and activism.  Powell’s situation was different. He was the first African American to be elected to Congress from New York and from any state in the Northeast. Starting in 1945, he represented the district that included the majority-Black Harlem neighborhood of New York City. He became one of the most important Democrats in the House, but in the mid-1960s, he found himself embroiled in personal and financial scandals.  After the election of 1966, the House created a committee to investigate Powell’s actions and refused to seat him until the committee’s report was complete. The report found fault, but committee members were split on the proper discipline for Powell. Ultimately the whole House voted to keep him out.  Powell sued to reclaim his seat, saying the House had excluded him unconstitutionally. He also won the special election in April 1967 created by the vacancy but didn’t take his seat because of the lawsuit. The removal of Powell meant that Harlem was the only congressional district in the nation without a representative from 1967 to 1969.  In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the House had acted unconstitutionally by refusing to seat Powell. By then, Powell had also won the 1968 regularly scheduled election and had been seated, though without the seniority and committee positions that would normally have been given to someone who had continuously been a House member.  Black Lives Matter movement  In the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, a new social movement emerged across the United States. With this new activism came another “white backlash” in the form of legislative disenfranchisement.  In May 2022, Tiara Young Hudson, a long-serving Black public defender, won the Democratic primary for a judgeship in Jefferson County, Alabama. More than half of the county’s population is nonwhite. Facing no opposition in the general election, she was expected to win and take office.  But two weeks after the primary, a state judicial commission, divided along racial lines, eliminated the position she was a candidate for and created a new judgeship in the majority-white Madison County.  Hudson immediately sued to block the shift, saying it violated the Alabama Constitution and only the state legislature had the authority to reallocate judgeships. In March 2023, the state supreme court dismissed Hudson’s complaint, effectively stripping the Black people of Jefferson County of a representative they had elected to be their voice on the state’s roster of judges.  And on April 6, 2023, the Republican majority of the Tennessee House of Representatives voted to expel two Black legislators – Justin Pearson and Justin Jones – for participating in a protest calling for gun legislation following yet another mass shooting.  Within days, both Pearson and Jones had been temporarily reinstated by processes for filling vacant seats, but still face special elections to fully reclaim their seats. Their alleged violation was participating in a protest against the legislature’s rules – but their real violation, I believe, was that they were Black, outspoken and pushed for change.

The State is churning out statements and proposing ways and means of teaching a lesson to the opposition and its supporters in the public. Taking the cue, much is being written in print and electronic media to further suggest ways to suppress opposition and any dissenting voices, even if they are of the ordinary public. However, beating the drums of war, the politicians are not realizing that their words and actions may later come back to haunt them.  Hundreds of opposition activists have been arrested along with their first and second-tier leadership by the state, which is simply unprecedented in the recent political history of Pakistan. However, would such violent actions of arbitrary arrests, and baton charging, and tear gassing the protestors help to ease the charged atmosphere in the country? Similarly, houses of opposition leaders are being raided, thus setting another dangerous precedent in politics. Also, protesting families are manhandled in front of cameras with impunity, without realizing that local media may be influenced but not the foreign media which is continuously beaming ground realities to the international viewers.  Further, taking the State’s cue and molding public opinion, ideas are being floated in the print and media to repress the opposition—an essential ingredient of democracy. It has been suggested to set up ‘rioter courts’ to punish the rioters, giving the example of the UK, which is the cradle of democracy and citizens’ rights are jealously guarded and the judiciary is independent and impermeable to any influence-hostile or condescending. To try the demonstrators, words like ‘terrorism’ and ‘terrorists’ are being thrown around like spaghetti, and everything is being painted as black or white: you are either with us or against us. In the UK, judges of the ‘rioter courts’ handed sentences for vandalism, theft and arson only upon the provision of solid evidence provided by the law enforcement agencies, not at the whims and egos of a few. Similarly, it is being suggested to conduct trials by army courts. Such undemocratic steps would only weaken the institutions and democracy.  Among the political parties, PPP and its workers have suffered the most for democracy: the execution of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (BB), the incarceration of former Pres Zardari and the flogging of PPP activists. BB was subjected to misogynistic slurs and faced a slew of cases. There are still iconic pictures of BB visiting her incarcerated husband with young children in tow. Therefore, PPP was always at the forefront to save democracy and give space to opposition. However, the torch of leadership has passed to a new generation: which, probably, has neither the experience nor memories of past political victimization, because of this no fire control measures are being initiated by the most mature political party in Pakistan.  There is a general glee over the victimization and abuse of the protesting public. However, keeping in view the political history of Pakistan, what goes around, comes around. Therefore, the petty and brutal tactics might come back to haunt everyone. The egos of a few have put the entire country in a spin and suddenly personal vendettas over the country’s interests have taken center stage. Political parties have probably forgotten the slogan: Democracy is the best revenge. So let sanity and saner minds prevail, lest everybody will lose what was hard won by BB—democracy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbi5jb20ucGsvMTctTWF5LTIwMjMvdGhlLWRvZ3Mtb2Ytd2Fy0gFBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0aW9uLmNvbS5way8xNy1NYXktMjAyMy90aGUtZG9ncy1vZi13YXI_dmVyc2lvbj1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interview with Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu said Israel conveyed a message not only to terror factions in Gaza but also to those in other hostile countries.  “We have changed the deterrence equation,” he said. “I cannot say that we will never return to attacks nor when exactly that will happen, but there is no doubt that we have strengthened Israeli deterrence.”  “We have dealt an extremely powerful blow to the Islamic Jihad and I estimate that this was registered properly,” he continued.  “And it was not only registered with them, it was registered with others. Anyone that has eyes understood that Israel is not ready to tolerate attacks on its citizens, its soldiers, and its cities, and that we will take direct and very painful measures against those who direct the fire and those who send the terror,” referring to Iran.  Shortly after Israel launched its campaign against PIJ, a senior Israeli official told i24NEWS that Iran was “directing” actions in Gaza to inflame tensions.  In response to a question about targeted assassinations, Netanyahu said: “We carry out assassinations in other arenas, but I can’t go into detail. We've raised it to a higher level – first of all, we did it out of calmness, and we did it with wholesale targeted assassinations. This changes the balance of deterrence in the region.""

The invitation-only festival is going to take place between 16 May to 27 May at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès, France. Unlike the previous glorious years, surprisingly no Indian film has made it to the Cannes 2023 nominations list including the prestigious Palme d’Or category this year.  While we might have missed making a mark nomination-wise, many Indian films are going to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival 2023. Anurag Kashyap’s film, Kennedy, will be screened at the film festival under its midnight screening section. Nehemich by FTII student Yudhajit Basu has been selected for a screening under the Cinéfondation section. The 1990 film titled The Chosen One (Ishanou), helmed by Aribam Syam Sharma, will be screened under the Cannes Classics section. Agra by Kanu Behl has been selected to be screened under the Directors’ Fortnight section. Meenakshi Shedde, Indian journalist and festival programmer of Berlinale, is also a part of the International Critics’ Week jury for Cannes 2023.  While it certainly is crushing to know that there will be no Palme d’Or winners from India this year, our rich history suggests that we are very much capable of achieving it in the coming future. The Palme d’Or, introduced in 1955, is the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival, and Indian movies have often emerged as winners in the past. From Neecha Nagar (1946) to Kharij (1982), many Indian movies have either won or have been nominated for the prestigious Palme d’Or award. Let’s take a look at the films that represented India under this category.  Indian films that won or were nominated for Palme d’Or  Indian cinema has garnered immense recognition at the Cannes Film Festival ever since its inception. The 1946 social-realistic film by Chetan Anand titled Neecha Nagar became the first Indian film to gain recognition at Cannes. It was awarded Palme d’Or at the first Cannes Film Festival.

"assassination","1908-01-30","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:30:00","Some visitors to the main hall of the National Museum of Fine Arts are surprised to find an impressive monument of marble and bronze standing between Juan Luna’s “Spoliarium” and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo’s “Assassination of Governor Bustamante.” If they do not care to act on their surprise by reading the wall texts or asking Google, they will not know that the monument commemorates Arthur Fergusson (1859-1908), an American colonial official whose statue once stood on Plaza Fergusson in front of Ermita Church.  The monument by Spanish sculptor Mariano Benlliure shares space in the hall that celebrates the two greatest Filipino painters of the 19th century because they were classmates at the Spanish Academy in Rome. All three were awarded medals in the 1884 Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in Madrid: Luna, First Class or Gold medal for “Spoliarium”; Resurreccion Hidalgo, Second Class or Silver Medal for “Jovenes cristianas expuestas al populacho” (Christian maidens exposed to the mob); Benlliure, Second Class (Silver) medal for “Accidente.”  ADVERTISEMENT  These medals placed Luna and Hidalgo, indios from Filipinas, at par with or even greater than their Spanish peers. They had become world-class. Then as now, we take pride in Luna and Hidalgo in the same way that we share in Lea Salonga’s triumph on the West End and Broadway, Manny Pacquiao’s conquest of world boxing, and, last but not least, weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz bringing home the first Olympic gold to a proud and grateful nation. They made us proud.A photograph taken in Rome, circa 1881, shows Juan Luna, Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Miguel Zaragoza, and Pedro Alejandro Paterno with the Benlliure brothers Mariano and Juan of Valencia, Spain. Who would have known these art students would later become famous? Not in the photo is Jose Benlliure who made a copy of Luna’s “Spoliarium” that used to hang in the prewar National Museum before it was destroyed in the 1945 Battle for Manila. The Fergusson monument is one of only three known works by Benlliure in the Philippines today. The other two are a portrait of Juan Luna in the University of Santo Tomas Museum and a portrait of Pedro Paterno in a private collection.  After four months at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I look at Fergusson differently, in the context of the ongoing revision of museum and library records and catalog entries that situate the past in political correctness. Any and all racist or derogatory language is deleted or reworded. Deirdre de la Cruz and Ricky Punzalan co-direct the Recollect-Reconnect project that seeks to decolonize the University of Michigan Philippine collections to bring out their true worth.  Fergusson was said to have died of a heart attack while walking home from his office in the Ayuntamiento in Intramuros to the suburb of San Miguel on Jan. 30, 1908. As a testament to their loss, Fergusson Memorial Association commissioned the Benlliure monument that was completed in Spain in 1912 and shipped to Manila for its unveiling on Nov. 15, 1913. If you go around the monument, you will find a lot of pockmarks left by bullets and shelling during the 1945 Battle for Manila. My friend Tina Cuyugan related that when her father and uncles were boys, they created a small bomb from toy gun gunpowder and exploded it on the monument one night in 1920. Their homemade bomb is supposed to have blasted away one of Fergusson’s ears. Since Fergusson’s ears are intact, I presume it must have been restored or the boys over-imagined the damage they caused.  The decolonization of Plaza Fergusson came about when the City of Manila commissioned an atrocious image of the Virgin of Ermita (Nuestra Señora de Guia or Our Lady of Guidance) from the late Eduardo Castrillo. The plaza in front of Ermita Church was renamed in her honor. Fergusson was then given to the United States Embassy where it was preserved on the grounds facing Manila Bay until its loan, six years ago, to the National Museum. The plaza was further decolonized by being renamed Plaza Guerrero in honor of the poet Fernando Ma. Guerrero and by extension the other Guerrero writers from Ermita: National Artist Wilfrido Ma., diplomat Leon Ma., and essayist Carmen Guerrero Nakpil. Monuments are erected to boost memory, but when memories are conflicted, monuments with contested histories are removed or relocated just like Fergusson’s.

While the CIDG described Police Staff Sgt. Noel Santa Ana Alabata, Jr. as an alleged hitman of the Teveses, he was arrested using two arrest warrants for cases of attempted murder and attempted homicide issued by two courts in Dumaguete City.  “The accused was formerly assigned to PDEG (Philippine National Police-Drug Enforcement Group) R6 (Region 6) and allegedly used by the Teves as a hitman for a certain ‘Ong’, a rival of the Teves in their business,” the CIDG said quoting its director Police Brig.

"assassination","1974-01-30","Not Discerned","{""Belfast"", ""Belfast"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:34:46","A man whose father was killed by loyalist paramilitaries 50 years ago says he has secured the answers his family searched for – from the group which carried out the murder.  John Crawford, a father of nine, was killed in January 1974 at his furniture workshop in west Belfast.  It was unclear for many years who had killed him, with the Official IRA initially blamed as well as false allegations he had been behind two murders.  His son Paul has emphasised the importance of clearing his father’s name both in a Historical Enquiries Team report and an acknowledgement by the UVF that their information had been flawed.  The UVF’s involvement became clear in 1977 when Raymond Glover, a man with UVF connections, confessed his involvement in the killing and was jailed.  The Crawford family went through an inquest, a criminal trial, a Police Ombudsman report and an HET report.  Advertisement  However, Mr Crawford’s son Paul said he secured the answers his family wanted by talking to the UVF via interlocuter Winston Irvine.  The process started in 2016, and Mr Crawford worked with Mr Irvine to ask questions and receive answers as well as verifying what he was told.  One of those questions was around the family’s long-held belief that there had been collusion in the killing.  The report from the UVF said there had not been collusion in terms of there having been no joint enterprise involving other groups or agencies.  However, they said they now accept that the information they acted on was flawed.  'A first' for loyalism  The process, described by Queen’s University academic Professor Kieran McEvoy as “a first” for loyalism, is the subject of a new report.  Professor McEvoy said the closest comparison to the process is the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims’ Remains (ICLVR), through which the IRA and INLA have provided information to help try to find the remains of the ‘disappeared’.  Mr Crawford said the process with the UVF delivered “absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking”.  “My father was an innocent man who was brutally murdered in a sectarian assassination for which no organisation ever claimed responsibility,” he said.  Advertisement  “My mother Eileen, now deceased, told journalists immediately after the murder in 1974, ‘we want to know who did this and why it should happen to him’. Like many families who lost loved ones, that has remained our quest in the ensuing five decades.”  Paul blasted the original investigation as “poor” and that the brief inquest in 1974 merely confirmed the cause of death.  “One man, James Glover, was convicted in 1978 of the murder after he was arrested for something else and confessed to being involved in my father’s killing and several others.  “However, because he pleaded guilty at trial there was no cross-examination and opportunity to learn anything further,” he said.  “A subsequent Police Ombudsman investigation, during the tenure of Al Hutchinson as ombudsman, was a complete waste of time.  Commissioner for Victims and Survivors Ian Jeffers at Queens University Belfast, following the launch of a report into the murder of John Crawford by the UVF in 1974. Photo: PA Images  “A Historical Enquiries Team report confirmed that my father was an innocent man but that determination was undermined by the fact that one of the original investigating RUC officers was dead and another refused to cooperate.  “After all of these processes, we still had many questions and I concluded that those questions could only be answered by the group responsible, the UVF.  “The process took a long time as it involved agreeing a set of ground rules, with me setting out clearly the information that I was seeking, including that I was not looking for the names of those involved, and then the information being relayed back and forward over many scores of meetings via the interlocutor.  “Ultimately, my family and I received answers to the questions we were seeking and a formal written acknowledgement of responsibility for the murder from the UVF.  “I do not believe in closure – my father was brutally and unjustifiably taken from us and that is a wound that will never heal – but as far as I am concerned this process has delivered absolutely full answers and full resolution of what I was seeking.”  Victims Commissioner Ian Jeffers commended what Mr Crawford has done as “tremendously brave”.  “From my point of view, it shows that with the right tenacity and the right approach you can get information – but the reality is leaving that up to the victim to do seems very, very cruel and that’s something we must address as a civil society,” he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbmV3cy5pZS9pcmVsYW5kL3V2Zi1wcm92aWRlLWFuc3dlcnMtdG8tYmVyZWF2ZWQtZmFtaWx5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLXdlc3QtYmVsZmFzdC1tdXJkZXItMTQ3NjQxNi5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlYWtpbmduZXdzLmllL2FtcC9pcmVsYW5kL3V2Zi1wcm92aWRlLWFuc3dlcnMtdG8tYmVyZWF2ZWQtZmFtaWx5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLXdlc3QtYmVsZmFzdC1tdXJkZXItMTQ3NjQxNi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Win McNamee/Getty Images  The Secret Service has launched an investigation into how a man was able to make his way into the Washington, D.C., home of President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, without the agents on guard noticing, three government officials told The Washington Post.  The incident took place one night in late April, at about 3 a.m. After realizing the man was in his home, Sullivan approached him and told him to leave, two of the officials said. Sullivan has a round-the-clock Secret Service detail, but the agents weren't aware of the intruder until Sullivan went outside and notified them. By that time, the unknown man had left, two officials told the Post.  There were no signs of forced entry, the Post reported, and the intruder seemed to be intoxicated and confused about his whereabouts. The government officials said there is no evidence that the man knew Sullivan or wanted to hurt him. Under normal protocol, the intruder would have been detained by the Secret Service for questioning, and most likely arrested and charged with trespassing.  In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency is ""taking this matter seriously"" and opened a ""comprehensive mission assurance investigation to review all facets of what occurred. Any deviation from our protective protocols is unacceptable and if discovered, personnel will be held accountable.""

For the latest headlines, follow our Google News channel online or via the app.  Advertisement  “Those involved in these heinous crimes against the military installations and personal/equipment will be brought to justice through trials under relevant laws of Pakistan including Pakistan Army Act and Official Secret Act.”  The military’s sharp reaction marks another escalation in an ongoing showdown between Pakistan’s most powerful institution and Khan, who was arrested by an anti-graft agency and later released by the Supreme Court. His detention sparked widespread anger among his supporters and some groups breached the military headquarters while others set fire to a military commander’s official residence.  At least eight people were killed and scores more arrested, including close aides and political associates of Khan.  The increasingly public defiance against the military signals a shift in attitudes in Pakistan which has been directly ruled by the army for almost half of its history since its creation in 1947. Most prime ministers have depended on the institution’s support to stay in power, including Khan himself, but his ties worsened during his time in power.  Khan attempted to control military promotions, opposing the army chief at the time in an incident that sowed the seeds for his ouster in April last year. He accused the army of conspiring with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the US to oust him, which all three denied. But his campaign to turn public opinion against the military continued.  No direct reference was made to Khan in Monday’s statement but in the days leading to his arrest by paramilitary troops, the army criticized him for accusing the institution of being behind at least two assassination attempts, including a shooting incident in November. The military has consistently denied the allegations.  Khan’s party denied its supporters vandalized army property.  “We also believe that those involved in terrorism against the state must be punished but it is very important that they should be correctly identified,” Shafqat Mahmood, a senior leader in Khan’s Tehreek-e-Insaf party said by phone. “There were people in the crowd who were not our supporters.

Echoing the phrase from anti-Mafia activists in Italy and elsewhere, Zammit warned that unless people take action immediately the situation can only get worse.  “If you won’t listen to the shouts of the living, then you must listen to the screams of Daphne Caruana Galizia who was stalked, harassed, and vilified, before she was brutally assassinated because she knew too much,” she said.  “If you truly want justice for her stories, then why have you consistently failed to implement the recommendations of the inquiry?” Zammit asked in reference to the recommendations put forward by the public inquiry into the murder of the journalist.  She went on to ask why the authorities have so far failed to reopen the Egrant Inquiry as requested by Magistrate Ian Farrugia.  “Have you learnt nothing since Daphne’s assassination about the need to protect those who fight for truth and justice? To protect them from threats and physical harm? What are you waiting for? More deaths?” Zammit said in clear reference to Repubblika president Robert Aquilina’s recent request for protection.  In her speech, Zammit said that Malta is “a corrupt country, and a mafia state,” adding that people fall in three camps; those who endorse corruption, those who turn a blind eye to corruption, and those who actually see the full picture.  “However we’re all experiencing the full picture, whether we like it or not,” she said, as she warned that the end result of greed and corruption is more deaths caused by the unregulated construction industry and road accidents.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state means that shoddy unplanned construction will continue The end result of living in a Mafia State means that more people will die in traffic accidents because of badly planned roads or because of lack of enforcement of the law,” Zammit said.  “The end result of living in a Mafia state is more victims of domestic violence because our institutions can’t pull their fingers out of their collective backsides and protect women.”  ‘We will get there’ – Josef Lauri  Tonight’s vigil was also addressed by academic Josef Lauri who said Daphne Caruana Galizia’s assassination “was a result of a sense of impunity that we saw fostered among those who are surprised by corruption and in love with crime.”  He added that corruption contains the seeds of its own destruction and the system will eventually implode.  “This seed of destruction is growing into a tree. We must continue striving to ensure that we will be here to see the fruits of this tree.”  Lauri said that while people might not have the time and energy to be on the frontline in the fight against corruption, he said the last they can do is remind activists such as those form Repubblika and Occupy Justice, that they are not alone.  “I believe that the phrase that Robert Aquilina likes to repeat, ‘We will get there’ (Sa Naslu!), is true. It will happen if we don’t give up. It will happen if those who fight for change stop the infighting. It will happen if bridges are built between those who disagree with this corrupt government instead of throwing stones at each other.”  Lauri said that while the pessimist in him “tells me that we will get there too slowly, or tells me that I will at least be here to see it, the developments that are happening around us make me hope that we will get there much sooner.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2Jvb2suY29tLm10L2VuL3RoZS1lbmQtcmVzdWx0LW9mLWxpdmluZy1pbi1hLW1hZmlhLXN0YXRlLWlzLWRlYXRoLXBpYS16YW1taXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Following publication of Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked opinion raping Roe v. Wade, Pulitzer honoree Linda Greenhouse kernelized the only cogent reason for assassination of a precedent which most of the little legal lightweights had told the U.S. Senate that they considered settled law.  “They did it because they could,” Greenhouse lamented, echoing sentiments which have warmed the Humpty cockles of the rocky hearts of dictators since time immemorial.  In last Sunday’s fake news New York Times, the best commentator in the country, Maureen Dowd, concluded her killer screed stating “Even though I’ve been writing since Bush v. Gore (2000) that the court is full of hacks and the bloom is off the robes, it is still disorienting to see the murk of this Supreme Court.”  Actually, it goes back much further. Control of Black Robe Land by today’s corrupt and self-absorbed majority was fore-ordained more than half a century ago. Just after I invaded these parts from Gomorrah South in 1971, I remember the chill that went down my spine at the announcement that Nevada Republican Party operatives had started a young conservatives club at UNR.  It started paying off just a few years later when a small-government advocate was elected president by promising to clean up the muck of murky Washington. He advocated eroding FDR’s big government welfare state and opposed busing to end school segregation while preaching family values, moral righteousness and religion.  It must have been Ronald Reagan, right? After all, Ronnie the Vague told a Moral Majority gathering that “I know you can’t endorse me but I can endorse you.”  If you guessed that it was the B-movie actor who won the White House playing a perversion of his idol Franklin Roosevelt, you’d be wrong. It was Reagan’s predecessor Jimmy Carter, a master campaigner with slim presidential qualifications, the worst of which was his lack of Washington experience. So he made his thin credentials the centerpiece of his campaign, touting the virtues of being an outsider. Like so many before him, he was hoist from his own petard when Reagan campaigned against him by saying the same thing. “Drain the swamp” still works for dinosaurs posing as alligator hunters.  Fast-forward almost half a century and Dumptyite wolves not only inhabit the henhouse, they’re selling the eggs. Cock-a-doodle-do.  “Americans do not want democracy, they want theocracy,” a French observer noted a few decades back.  The formerly sacrosanct and prestigious Supreme Court is now the appointed-for-life government of the United States. Remember all those moonhowler complaints about an “activist court” and “judge-made law”?  No? Understandable because moonhowler-installed judges are now doing just that.  They have been handsomely rewarded with lucrative deals both aboveboard and under the table. There is no effective remedy. They won and can do whatever they damn well please.  Four decades ago, former Tribunite and legendary talk show icon Travus T. Hipp warned of “softshoe fascism” loose in the land.  Fascism is typified by an authoritarian government which does the bidding of narrow, wealthy, privately-owned interests. As with all dictatorships spawned not by guns but by gushy words enchanting the gullible among the great unwashed, once in power they pull the ladder up behind them.  Said ladder stands on the shredded social safety net of a besieged electorate increasingly unable to elect leaders reflecting their needs — if they are allowed to vote at all.  Corrupt Clarence and his fellow dwarves now have before them a Roe-ing of the 1984 unanimous decision in Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council. Repeal or revision would resemble Alito’s rape of Roe or Neal Gorsuch’s evisceration of the Environmental Protection Agency. (“Poison Annie’s Revenge Executed” Barbwire 7-7-2022; “Happy Co-Dependence Day” 7-3-2005)  I was criticized by the left and right when I asserted that nominee Gorsuch would work to destroy the EPA from which his Mommy Dearest had resigned under a cloud of incompetence, corruption and illegality.  Sometimes I hate it when I’m right. I hope I am proven wrong about the miasma of near-hopelessness enveloping the formerly United States of America.  MEA CULPA DEPT. When I’m wrong, I eat the barbecued crow. A few weeks ago, I praised Reno Gazette-Journal higherups for appointing veteran journalist Peggy Santoro as the second woman executive editor of the paper after Barbara Henry in 1982. Pardon my brain fade. Santoro is the fourth. Like Ms. Henry, Ms. Santoro rose thru the ranks as did Tonia Cunning who became the second. More recently came Kelly Scott, the only one of the four imported from elsewhere into the top job. No matter the numbers game, the principal news dissemination source in northern Nevada has very noticeably improved under Ms. Santoro’s leadership.

"assassination","2016-11-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 16:04:00","Read this in The Manila Times digital edition.  THE efforts of the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to find its voice and a steady footing in global affairs are dragged down by doubts pertaining to a critical domestic issue — the fairness of his administration's justice system. An innocent woman, former senator Leila de Lima, has been in detention for six long years. Meanwhile, the hard men, Teves, Bantag, Zulueta et al., are making a mockery of the justice system. Come and get us ... if you can. How can the outside world not take note of the open defiance, the braggadocio and the taunting? We don't even have a clue as to who masterminded the assassination of a Cagayan vice mayor and the ambush of Lanao del Sur Gov. Mamintal Adiong.  The audacity of Mr. Teves to ask for a Zoom link so he can participate in a Senate inquiry on a Negros Oriental massacre of which he is the prime suspect is the kind of perverted audacity to be found only in the political and judicial systems of banana republics, not in functional democracies committed to the rule of law. Nine people gunned down in cold blood in broad daylight, one of them the provincial governor, and the primary suspect is asking for a Zoom link? It cannot get more surreal than this: the audacity of perversity.  As the world watches this mockery of the judicial system unfold, the contrasting optics of a jailed innocent woman silently bearing her many burdens but keeping her faith in the justice system and the hard men mocking the justice system, uncomfortable questions are raised. The House is even conflicted on what to do with Mr. Teves — kid gloves one day, stern warnings the next. Are not parliaments and congresses of true democracies mandated to stand on the right side of history? And grow a spine whenever tough decisions have to be made?  The giddy malevolence to detain an innocent woman and the feckless indecision on the hard men indicted based on overwhelming evidence.  So, it all comes down to this. The judge righting the terrible wrongs on the case of former senator de Lima — which hopefully will soon lead to her release from detention — is doing a yeoman's job in restoring the credibility and fairness of the Philippine justice system. It is the case of Ms. de Lima and her forthcoming clearance from three trumped-up drug charges — the irony is inescapable — which is now saving the blemished judicial system from its horrific failings.  Get the latest news  delivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times’ daily newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy  As the nation ponders on the next chapter in Ms. de Lima's life after her certain release from detention and the end of her nightmarish six years, what comes to mind are words from biblical times and the US civil rights movement. Words that offer comfort and reassurance, balm to the souls of a nation anguished by the long detention of an innocent woman.  First are the words of Martin Luther King Jr. That the arc of the moral universe — the other version is the arc of history — may be long but it bends toward justice. Indeed, it has been a long, grueling six years — about a third of the years that Nelson Mandela spent at Robben Island — but justice will be finally served on former senator de Lima. Two of the three drug charges have been dropped, the last and final charge has no legs to stand on. The coerced witnesses have recanted. She will soon breathe the air of freedom, then reap the recompense due a victim of political vendetta and a vengeful justice system.  What failed to crush the spirit of former senator de Lima definitely made her stronger. Post-detention, the future is full of possibilities. She can run for Senate, on the back of that familiar Filipino sentiment: unqualified sympathy and support for the victims of injustice. She can help energize — she can even lead — the directionless political opposition. She can go back to defending those languishing in prison without cause, the prisoners of conscience and lead an NGO dedicated to the issues of human rights. Her prison years attracted the attention of political leaders from the major democracies, who gave support and encouragement. That group of powerful people vests her with international connections.  What is the guarantee, the certainty, that she would be at the receiving end of glorious and generous recompense? Read the Sermon on the Mount, the greatest speech every written. It says, ""Blessed are the persecuted."" No prominent Filipino in the 21st century has gone through and endured more persecution and vindictiveness than former senator de Lima. Yet, she took everything with equanimity and grit and grace. On the scale of the recompense, the answer is itself biblical — double for your trouble. After the persecution, she will be able to write her future story.  The persecuted, along with the weak and the meek and the humble, have from time immemorial held on to the Beatitudes as their only article of faith toward the path of redemption and liberation. (The same case with us, farmers and workers, because there is no other article of faith to hold on to.) Because no other document in the entire human history is as clear, as explicit, about the blessed status of those in dire straits. Indeed, blessed is Leila de Lima, the persecuted.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbmlsYXRpbWVzLm5ldC8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9sZWlsYS1kZS1saW1hLXNlcm1vbi1vbi10aGUtbW91bnQtYW5kLW1hcnRpbi1sdXRoZXIta2luZy1qci8xODkxODI20gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFuaWxhdGltZXMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvb3Bpbmlvbi9jb2x1bW5zL2xlaWxhLWRlLWxpbWEtc2VybW9uLW9uLXRoZS1tb3VudC1hbmQtbWFydGluLWx1dGhlci1raW5nLWpyLzE4OTE4MjYvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kennedy Jr., who is running in second place to incumbent President Biden in the 2024 primary sweeps, told Fox News that his once antiwar party has made a 180-degree turn as middle-class Americans struggle to live with a hurting economy.  Kennedy, who is the son of former New York senator and U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, and nephew of former President John Kennedy and ex-Sen. Edward Kennedy, said the party his family once embodied has changed much in recent years.  ""The Democratic Party at this point has become the party of war, which we've never been before. We've sent $113 billion Ukraine and the entire budget of EPA is $12 billion, and the budget at the CDC is $12 billion,"" he said Tuesday on ""Special Report.""  Kennedy argued 57% of Americans could not ""put their hands on $1,000 if they have an emergency.""  RFK JR DOUBLES DOWN ON ALLEGATION CIA INVOLVED IN UNCLE'S ASSASSINATION  ""I think a lot of Americans are feeling like they're tired of the forever-wars,"" he said. ""They're tired of this being a warfare state abroad and a surveillance state at home. And they want to get rid of the surveillance here [and] the wars abroad.""  Kennedy contrasted the trillions in military spending with what some of those funds could do for domestic infrastructure, employment and education.  ""Our real national strength is going to come from economic power and a robust economy and a robust middle class and not from projecting military power abroad,"" he said.  Kennedy also said he has no personal animus against Biden, and has been friends with him for some time, as ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier cited a recent poll showing him the closest to the president with 19% support.  ""I have a long kind of friendship and relationship with President Biden, so I'm not criticizing him or attacking him personally. But I think people want to see him out of the White House and actually talking to Americans; going to town halls,"" he said.  ABC NEWS ADMITS EDITING RFK JR'S VAX CLAIMS  ""[He] says that the economy is humming along, but that's not what I hear when I'm out in western Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Florida. I see people really living in a state of desperation that I never thought I would see in the United States of America,"" Kennedy added.  Kennedy compared purported statistics that showed a steep decline in middle-class power and wealth between the 1970s and 2020s, claiming 62% of U.S. income in 1978 was among the middle class, while that figure has dropped to 40%.  ""In 1978, 29% of income went to the super rich. [Now] it's 50%. And that was aggravated, of course, by the pandemic,"" he said, adding that some of that dearth was a product of what he called ""Donald Trump's pandemic lockdown – which created 500 new billionaires.""

""His name is Kennedy. His campaign is pure Trump,"" Baier read of the headline from the paper, which also wrote that Kennedy is offering a ""variation"" on Trumpian criticisms of government and science while ""stoking fear and resentment,"" claiming the 2nd place Democrat's campaign sounds somewhat like Trump's own ""America First"" bid.  Kennedy responded that Trump's tenure saw $4 trillion in wealth shifted to the ""super-rich"" and that there have been millions of business closures under the Republican's administration that have also followed into Biden's tenure.  ""I think a lot of Americans want somebody who's really going to start listening to the middle class, understanding the desperation that so many Americans feel, and that is going to do something about it,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hiYW5nb3IuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwvcmZrLWpyLXNheXMtZGVtcy1oYXZlLWJlY29tZS1wYXJ0eS1vZi13YXItYW1lcmljYW5zLWNhbnQtYWZmb3JkLWEtMS0wMDAvYXJ0aWNsZV8zYzUwNTA0Ni1jN2RmLTU2MjUtYmJlZi0wNTdlYzYxOTcwNTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1994-07-23","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 04:40:45","Azerbaijan arrested at least nine of its nationals, suspected of being linked to Iranian secret services and of plotting a coup and assassinations, officials said on Tuesday.  The latest round in tensions between Baku and Tehran, whose relations have traditionally been strained, came after the expulsion of diplomats from both countries.  On Tuesday, Azerbaijan’s law enforcement forces arrested people who “were working for Iranian secret services,” the interior ministry, security service, and the office of prosecutor general said in a joint statement.  The statement gave nine names and said several other people had been arrested.  The group was plotting a “violent overthrow of the government and the assassinations of prominent personalities and senior officials,” the statement said.  The wave of arrests follows the detention of six Azerbaijani nationals in a different case in April. They were accused of being “recruited by Iranian secret services to destabilize the situation in the country.”  Azerbaijan is a close ally of Iran’s historical rival, Turkey.  Tehran also fears that Israel – a major weapons supplier to Azerbaijan – could use Azerbaijani territory for an offensive against Iran.  Ties between neighbors Azerbaijan and Iran further soured in January when a gunman stormed into Baku’s embassy in Tehran.  He killed a diplomat and wounded two embassy security guards.  The Azerbaijani foreign ministry blamed Iran for the shooting, a claim that the Iranian foreign ministry has rejected.  Earlier in May, Iran expelled four Azerbaijani diplomats. The foreign ministry said the move was “in response” to Baku’s expulsion of Iranian embassy staff in April.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2F6ZXJiYWlqYW4tY291cC1wbG90LWlyYW4v0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZGVmZW5zZXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvYXplcmJhaWphbi1jb3VwLXBsb3QtaXJhbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""Ashqelon"", ""Hadarom"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:26","A man in a prayer shawl stands by a structure in Ashkelon, Israel, that was destroyed by a rocket fired by Palestinian militants on Wednesday. (Ariel Schalit / Associated Press)  Now that there’s an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire in place this week, brokered with the help of Egypt, it’s critical that the two sides not stop with this short-term agreement.  For this cease-fire — in fact, any cease-fire — to become permanent, we need a political process to begin immediately. The alternative is to keep seeing Israelis and Palestinians traumatized and killed as militants and politicians practice one-upmanship against each other.  It would be easy to place blame on this or that side. It’s possible to list the number of Palestinian rockets that were launched at Israel and the number of targets that Israel attacked. But what good would that do?  The Palestinian-Israeli cycle of violence has become so normalized that it no longer elicits serious interest from the world community. Whether one side uses precision rockets that kill children and women or the other uses indiscriminate rockets that cause injury, death and destruction, the resulting carnage is the same.  Those on each side scream that there is no partner on the other side, when what they mean is that there is no partner that fits their own perception of a good counterpart. But peace is made with enemies.  Resorting to violence, whether it is extrajudicial assassination or indiscriminate shelling, is not the answer. Both are war crimes and perpetrators must be held accountable. But the conflict is not symmetrical, and so solutions might require more from one side than the other. Anyone who really wants to end this conflict must invest time and effort into forcing everyone back to the negotiating table.  In all cases, some fundamental principles need to be established. Self-determination is a right for all people, and the application of this right cannot be limited to one side of the conflict. It is impossible to talk about Israel’s political rights without equally respecting Palestinian political rights.  A solution to the conflict requires an end to occupation, allowing Palestinians to live in freedom whether this is in their own sovereign and contiguous state or in a single state where all citizens have equal rights. The current discriminatory situation with one side occupying the lands of the other side must stop.  Story continues  All sides have to commit to refraining from actions that can affect the outcome of negotiations. This includes stopping Israeli settlement expansion, and both sides must ensure that civilians are protected from violence — from the Israeli army and settlers as well as from Palestinian paramilitary organizations.  There has to be a commitment to discussing in good faith the future of Jerusalem, settlements, refugees and borders. And there needs to be a Palestinian commitment to security coordination, conditional on Israel respecting Palestinian sovereignty in major cities. Something as basic a right as a free passage between Gaza and the West Bank must be respected.  No one is naïve enough to think that these commitments will happen overnight. Any political process — even to begin a process — will need the support of the people of the region and the international community. Staying away from a conflict in which one side is powerful and the other side weak (but not willing to surrender) will not produce any kind of solution.  We cannot afford to accept the idea that we’re doomed to a never-ending conflict. This would be a cop-out. But we need to go beyond politically correct statements and positions if we’re to find a way out.  Despite all the problems and the decades of war, there is still a genuine yearning for peace. While in the middle of a cycle of violence, all sides are polarized, and everyone returns to their known positions and embraces the policies of their tribe, right or wrong. This cannot go on.  Palestinians and Israelis have been unable to find a comprehensive solution. Right now, everyone is taking sides while living in the middle of the bloodshed. What is needed is help from outside to get us out of the mess we are in.  For the sake of our children, the international community has to resume a role in helping to break this cycle of violence. Yes, it will take sustained effort. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot do it alone.

"assassination","1994-07-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 14:41:35","A new court case on Genocide against Tutsi is going on in France which is meant to last at least two months full of strong revelations in the tragedy that befell Rwanda and cost more than one million innocent lives in three consecutive months of April, May, June and early July 1994.  The case involves a suspect Philippe Hategekimana 67, Rwandan naturalized French (since 2005) under the name of Philippe Manier and the prosecution at the French Court of Assise.  This former chief warrant officer at the Gendarmerie of Nyanza, in the prefecture of Butare (southern Rwanda) during the Genocide, was famously known under the name Biguma.  He was arrested in March 2018 in Yaoundé-Cameroon and extradited to France, then indicted and placed in pre-trial detention the following year.  He is accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and participation in a group for the preparation of Genocide crimes.  More precisely, Hategekimana is accused to have participated in the erection of two roadblocks which intended to control and assassinate Tutsi civilians. Hundreds of Tutsi indeed were assassinated at these spots, according to the prosecution.  He is further accused of assassination of the burgomaster of Ntyazo, Narcisse Nyagasaza and the massacre of Tutsi who had taken refuge at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills of Rwabicuma and Muyira sectors of Nyanza district respectively.  This is on top of an alleged participation in several meetings aimed at preparing or coordinating the crimes.  In a press release before the trial, the French national anti-terrorist prosecutor’s office (Pnat) indicated that the massacre cost lives of 300 Tutsi and 10,000 Tutsi at Nyabubare and Nyamure hills respectively.  At the meeting to prepare the trial on May 10, already, the prosecution, the defense and even the presiding judge promised that the case will involve strong emotions, thus a warning to parties in the trial, especially the witnesses to get ready and to know to control their emotions because “violent scenarios will most likely be described.”  I am not the person you are looking for  As in any court case, at the trial kick off, the defence and their client played the first card, that of identity, alleging that the person in front of the court, was not the same person the prosecution was talking about.  The defence played around the name of the alias of their clients, arguing that “Biguma was found guilty, of Genocide offenses, but Phlippe Hategekimana was acquitted by Gacaca Court.”  However, the defendant later on admitted to being Biguma, a name he got while in military training back in Rwanda.  After this, the other big question was around his naturalisation which he obtained after giving a wrong name of Philippe Manier, instead of Philippe Hategekimana.  The wrong identity, he said, he invented while still in a refugee camp in Kashusha-South Kivu of  “You used a wrong identity to get the nationality of France while taking the name Manier?” asked the presiding judge, to which he responded: “Yes. At first, to obtain refugee status, we needed a convincing document.”  Audition of Testimonies  In this trial where more than 90 witnesses could be heard, already the witnesses of the context are being heard, and as earlier promised, they are sharing strong testimonies.  They even include Western Citizens and Rwandan citizen who were in Rwanda during the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi. Even the foreigners, can share the places where Interahamwe militia were the most brutal with mutilation of women, rape among others.  Several witnesses include researchers, historians among other people who did not just see one incident of Genocide, but many, and also did more research on the background that led to the Genocide tragedy in Rwanda.  The list also includes former leaders in the Rwanda military and gendarmerie and officials under the Juvenal Habyarimana’s regime  One of the witnesses, Hélène Dumas 41, a Doctor in social sciences and specialist on Genocide against Tutsi went as far as sharing a story of a girl who was obliged to feed on blood after starving.  Hélène understands quite everything in the Genocide, and even, Rwanda’s reconciliation’s home-grown solutions and recovery efforts, to an extent that she is even able to explain ‘Gacaca jurdictions’ from its etymology.  Of all things that were said, some witnesses were direct to mention the name Philippe Hategekimana as a person who was involved in the Genocide, and yesterday, as the presiding judge asked the defendant what he would add, he was prompt to say.  “Everything they said is false.”  Hategekimana’s defence include Me Emmanuel Altit, Alexis Guedj and Fabio Lhote.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0cHJlc3MucncvMjAyMy8wNS9uZXctdHJpYWwtaW4tZnJhbmNlLXByb21pc2VzLXRvLXNoZWQtbW9yZS1saWdodC1vbi1nZW5vY2lkZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXR1dHNpLWF0cm9jaXRpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The independent Russian portal Agentstwo claims that former US ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst is among these Moscow's would-be victims.  The diplomat complained of mysterious health problems similar to symptoms of poisoning back in 2021, a few months before Russia had invaded Ukraine. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has launched an investigation into the case, the website reported, citing its informants who remain anonymous.    Herbst was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine between 2003-2006 and headed the U.S. diplomatic mission in Uzbekistan.    The head of the Free Russia Foundation, Natalia Arno, was another target of the Russian secret services. The activist, while visiting the Czech Republic on business at the beginning of May 2023, had suddenly started feeling numbness and pain in various parts of her body. Shortly before these symptoms appeared, Arno had discovered a break-in into her hotel room.    She also reported a strange smell in the room resembling “the smell of cheap perfume”. Following the incident Arno immediately returned to the United States, where she lives. The FBI has also launched an investigation into the matter, since the Free Russia Foundation, headed by Arno, is based in Washington.    The independent portal claims that the head of investigative portal Bellingcat, Christo Grozev, has also fallen victim to the Kremlin’s agents. In the summer of 2022, during a journalistic conference in Montenegro, unknown perpetrators broke into his hotel room stealing several items, including his smartphone.    A few months later Grozev decided to move from Austria to the USA after he received warnings of an assassination attempt.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdHZwd29ybGQuY29tLzY5ODgyNDU2L3J1c3NpYS1oYWQtYXR0ZW1wdGVkLXRvLXBvaXNvbi1wcm9taW5lbnQtb3Bwb25lbnRzLXNvdXJjZXMtc2F50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2019-05-12","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:53:54","Due to the mass struggle, white ex-Marine Daniel Penny, whose 15-minutes-long chokehold led to the death of Jordan Neely — a 30-year-old African American houseless and mentally ill man — was charged with second-degree manslaughter. If convicted — and that is a very big IF — he could face anywhere between 5-to-15 years in prison. Penny had at least two accomplices who held Neely’s arms and legs as he was being slowly asphyxiated; the two have not been charged.  When Penny was brought in for questioning by the New York Police Department May 1 — the day that the murder took place on a F subway train, he was released without being charged with anything.  Starting on May 2, spontaneous and planned demonstrations took place for days, including one that blocked a subway track, demanding that Penny be charged. That demand wasn’t realized until May 12, when Penny turned himself in after the District Attorney announced the manslaughter charges. Jordan Neely’s family and their attorneys, while saying they were “pleased” with the charges, had asked that Penny be charged with second-degree murder, which would have amounted to a harsher sentence if convicted.  Penny was immediately released on $100,000 bail. How did such a large sum get raised so fast? A white supremacist-based crowd fundraising site, under the guise of being “Christian,” GiveSendGo, has raised over $1 million to date to support Penny’s legal expenses. The fundraising was organized by his lawyers; within just 24 hours of Penny being charged, $600,000 was raised for his defense.  This same site raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for white-supremacist Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two anti-racist Black Lives Matter protesters in Wisconsin in 2020; the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump U.S. Capitol riot defendants; and the so-called “Freedom Convoy” — a group of truckers in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, who in 2022 protested a rule requiring cross-border drivers to be vaccinated.  Extreme right-wing Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Twitter owner and billionaire Elon Musk and Fox News pundits all praised Penny for the killing. Their comments condoning Neely’s death are too disgusting to mention here.  Once again, the character of the victim — in this case Jordan Neely — a houseless, hungry, mentally ill and desperate man, who happened to be Black, is being put on trial in public. Penny’s lawyers will use character assassination as a major defense to justify this killing by a white vigilante.  And this kind of heinous reaction is not isolated to just one individual. It is part of a racist war to justify such murders by the police and racist vigilantes like Penny by demonizing the victims, especially young Black men like Neely, Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Trayvon Martin in Florida and even 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio, who were all falsely and cruelly labeled a danger and a menace to society.  And the fact that a sector of the ruling class supports the actions of Penny illustrates that he has a lot of big-business support to attempt to exonerate him of this terrible crime.  This is another reason why a united political classwide struggle should abolish this horrendous capitalist system — to guarantee all the human needs that the Jordan Neelys of the world cry out for and deserve.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmtlcnMub3JnLzIwMjMvMDUvNzA5Mjcv0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ya2Vycy5vcmcvMjAyMy8wNS83MDkyNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-11-01","15:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:11:15","Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks are coming thick and fast ahead of June’s Ubisoft Forward showcase and – if what we’re hearing is true – it looks like Assassin’s Creed fans have quite a lot to look forward to when it comes to the upcoming release Assassin’s Creed Mirage. In fact, this is shaping up to be one of the best Assassin’s Creed games yet. We have known that this title is going to be a return to the series’ roots for a while now, but a content creator with a history of AC Mirage leaks has further teased a myriad of features that suggest we could be in for an investigative gameplay experience more similar to what we would see in IO Interactive’s Hitman series – and that’s very exciting.  Discussing leaked information about Assassin’s Creed Mirage in French, which was initially translated by fans on this Assassin’s Creed subreddit post and then double-checked by The Loadout using YouTube’s translation tool, renowned leaker ‘j0nathon’ has shared that this game will feature fewer assassination targets than recent Assassin’s Creed games that players will need to spend time investigating before attempting to eliminate – with options opening up as you continue to uncover more information about each target.  At a basic level, before looking into the details, this is something that echoes the gameplay structure presented to players in the immensely-popular stealth-action series Hitman World of Assassination. You’re thrown into an environemnt where you must investigate to find out where your target is, or will be, and how you can eliminate them. We know that is a little reductive, but that’s the bare bones of the gameplay structure – and that sounds like what we’re getting in Assassin’s Creed Mirage.  Fuelling comparisons further, while also further reinforcing claims that this game will see the reintroduction of a notoriety system to the Assassin’s Creed series, ‘j0nathan’ has also expressed that Basim will have “very little life” – dying after just a couple of hits. This will encourage stealth-based gameplay and – once again – echoes the Hitman series. Those of you who have played this game will know it’s not as easy as it looks to shoot your way out of a sticky situation if you’ve been spotted.  While this information, like these recent Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks, will be welcome news to fans who don’t particularly like the RPG-heavy focus the series has taken with recent entries, it does suggest that we might be met with some rather out-dated gameplay experiences when the Assassin’s Creed Mirage release date rolls around. Missions structured around tailing targets and eavesdropping conversations are dated, but this is where Ubisoft could draw on Hitman to save Assassin’s Creed from these mediocre moments.  IO Interactive leans into these sorts of gameplay sequences in the Hitman series, but they’re presented to players as optional objectives – and always situated in a largely unguided mission overflowing with options when it comes to how you approach the main objective: eliminating your target.  At the moment, though, we don’t know how much freedom Assassin’s Creed players will enjoy when it comes to undertaking these investigations. But, we’re hopeful – it just remains to be seen whether that hope was misplaced, or not. As you can see below, though, the leaker sharing this information compares a lot of this to the original Assassin’s Creed game – which is somewhat worrying. However, like us, they also suggest that the “black box missions” – where you actually assassinate your target – will draw inspiration from the Hitman series.  We know it’s important to take every leak with a pinch or two of salt, as there’s no telling how true this all is, but ‘j0nathan’ has a good track record when it comes to Assassin’s Creed Mirage leaks that corroborate with others and all the information he’s shared seems to line up with what we know officially about the game so far. GamesRadar’s interview with creative director Stéphane Boudon is packed with information about the scope and scale of this title – and where Ubisoft is drawing inspiration (although Hitman isn’t mentioned).  Will it be one of the best games of all time? We’re not so sure about that, as there’s some stiff competition there, but a Basim-based Assassin’s Creed game is bound to be interesting. So, while we wait for more information on all the Assassin’s Creed multiplayer games Ubisoft is supposedly working on, we can’t think of anyone better to lead the next chapter in this series.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWxvYWRvdXQuY29tL2Fzc2Fzc2lucy1jcmVlZC1taXJhZ2UvbGVha3MtZ2FtZXBsYXktZmVhdHVyZXMtaGl0bWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Photos / Getty Images, AP  Celebrities fool us with their jaw-dropping film stunts so often it feels like they are superhuman. But it turns out some of their near-death experiences would leave even Hollywood shocked.  A prime example came earlier in the year when Marvel star Jeremy Renner narrowly escaped death trying to stop his seven-tonne Pistenbully snowplough from running over his nephew. After breaking more than 30 broken bones and a punctured lung, the actor has undergone intensive rehab and is finally back on his feet.  Jamie Foxx also suffered a close call recently when he was rushed to hospital with an unknown medical emergency. One month later, the star is reportedly still in hospital and little has been revealed about his condition.  But Renner and Foxx aren’t the only famous faces who have escaped death in their lifetime. Ozzy Osbourne has experienced a few near-death scenarios, Emilia Clarke survived two brain aneurysms and Kanye West was involved in a terrifying car accident.  From house fires to plane accidents and strokes, here are nine celebrities who cheated death:  Drew Barrymore  Drew Barrymore. Photo / Getty Images  She’s a Hollywood sweetheart with a slew of successful films behind her and a talk show that makes other celebrities feel at home - but all that could have been quite different for the actress if it weren’t for her labrador, Flossie.  In 2001, Barrymore and her then-fiance Tom Green almost died in a fire when their five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills caught fire. Asleep and unaware of the flames engulfing their estate, the couple narrowly escaped thanks to their dog.  A spokesperson told the New York Post at the time, “Flossie barked and literally banged on their bedroom door. She was really the main alert that there was a fire.” Still groggy from sleep, Barrymore then smelt smoke and woke up Green before calling emergency services, however the fast-moving blaze cut into the telephone wires and the line went dead.  Thankfully the dispatchers located the address and Barrymore, Green, Flossie and her two other dogs, Highla Flopsy and Templeton, escaped through heavy smoke.  Mark Wahlberg  Mark Wahlberg. Photo / AP  The heartbreaking terrorist attack that killed 3002 people on September 11, 2001 almost saw a very famous casualty.  Wahlberg was initially booked on American Airlines Flight 11 - the plane which crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Centre - but he changed his flight to a different one a few days earlier.  Wahlberg narrowly cheating death was all thanks to a friend who had asked him to change his plans and fly up to Toronto to watch his film at the Toronto Film Festival.  Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane also had a ticket for the same flight but his agent told him the wrong departure time, which saw the star miss boarding by a few minutes. He ultimately took another flight and survived.  Sharon Stone  Sharon Stone. Photo / Getty Images  At 65 years old, Sharon Stone has done a lot in her lifetime including winning a Golden Globe. But there were moments she wasn’t sure she was going to see the future, let alone the next day.  Speaking to The Sun in 2020, the actress revealed she has cheated death three times, once after being struck by lightning, another after suffering a stroke, and once when she almost cut her jugular open.  She told the news outlet: “I’ve had a lot of things, it’s crazy. I had my neck cut to a sixteenth of an inch from my jugular vein when I was 14 on a clothesline.  “I’ve been hit by lightning and, wow, that was really intense,” she said, adding, “I was at home, we had our own well. I was filling up the iron with water and I had my hand on the tap.  “The well got hit by lightning and it came up through the water. I was indoors and I got picked up and thrown across the kitchen and hit the refrigerator. Thankfully my mum belted me round the face and brought me to.”  As if that wasn’t enough, the Pennsylvania-born actress also suffered a stroke in 2001 and was hospitalised for nine days as a result. Despite her 1 per cent chance of survival, the mother-of-three is alive and well, reflecting on how “tremendously lucky” she is to be alive.  Speaking to Harpers Bazaar, she said, “I felt like I had been shot in the head. I remember laying there thinking, ‘I’m having a stroke’.”  Following the stroke, the actress underwent a seven-hour surgery and had 22 coils inserted into her brain.  Leonardo DiCaprio  Leonardo DiCaprio. Photo / AP  While the encounters were quite different, much like Stone, DiCaprio has cheated death three times.  The Hollywood alum told Wired magazine in 2015 that he has escaped death three times - one of those times being when a great white shark “jumped into my cage when I was diving in South Africa”.  “Half its body was in the cage, and it was snapping at me,” DiCaprio recalled. “They leave the tops open and you have a regulator line running to the surface. Then they chum the water with tuna. A wave came and the tuna sort of flipped up into the air. A shark jumped up and grabbed the tuna, and half its body landed inside the cage with me. I sort of fell down to the bottom and tried to lie flat.  “The great white took about five or six snaps an arm’s length away from my head. The guys there said that has never happened in the 30 years they’d been doing it.”  Other near-death experiences the star survived included his plane engine exploding mid-air and a skydiving mishap when both of his parachutes had issues and almost didn’t open. The first chute was tangled and so was the second, but thankfully the instructor untangled it in time and they landed injury-free.  Queen Elizabeth  Queen Elizabeth II. Photo / AP  In 1981, Queen Elizabeth’s reign almost came to an end when a New Zealand man conducted an assassination attempt.  On October 14 that year, 17-year-old Christopher Lewis tracked the royal tour to the Otago Museum in Dunedin where he concealed a .22 (5.6mm) calibre rifle in an old pair of jeans and hid in a toilet cubical at the Adams Building. Out of sight from the general public, Lewis pointed the gun out of the window and shot at the Queen as she exited a car.  Thankfully, the shot did not hit the Queen or anyone else but it did create a loud noise and police told journalists that it was from a sign falling down.  Jackie Chan  Jackie Chan.  He’s one of the greatest stuntmen in the world and is known for performing all of his own film stunts but one performance almost changed everything for Jackie Chan.  While filming a stunt for the 1986 film Armour of God, Chan’s character chugs from a freshly opened beer can and leaps off a ledge before swinging from a tree. The first stunt went smoothly but when he attempted it again things took a scary turn.  Chan made it to the tree but unfortunately slipped and plummeted to the ground where he hit his head on a rock and cracked his skull. The injury left him with internal bleeding and blood dripping out of his ear. The film crew didn’t have a medical professional onsite and had to carry him down the mountain they were filming on to the hospital where “surgeons tended to his cracked skull and the bone that had penetrated his brain as a result of the fall”, reports said.  Other injuries the actor has sustained include a pelvis dislocation, spinal damage, broken bones - and he has even been electrocuted.  Isla Fisher  Isla Fisher. Photo / Getty Images  Actress Isla Fisher revealed on Chelsea Lately in 2013 that while shooting a scene for the hit film Now You See Me, she was stuck underwater for almost three minutes.

Wanting the scene to look as realistic as possible, the star recalled the moment telling UK comedy show, There’s Something About Movies, “I remember the camera came around, and I thought, ‘I’m gonna make this look really good,’ so I sort of took a few deep breaths and kind of barred down. Then I realized I was on the balls of my feet and the rope was going up and I had nowhere to go. Then the world kind of dialled down.”  The star passed out and was thankfully okay but woke up to the film’s stunt co-ordinator clapping in his face. “He goes, ‘Hey. Congratulations.

"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","{""Dallas"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 15:02:30","Howard Hunt is definitely one of the most mysterious personalities in the history of the United States. His story has been recently covered by the HBO series White House Plumbers, and through that show, we get some hints about his involvement in some of the most significant milestones in American history, from the Bay of Pigs invasion to the Watergate scandal, up to his famous deathbed confession where he revealed classified information related to the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. His true story can become a book, but in this article, we will summarize the main points of his life.  Before the White House Plumbers and Watergate: The Bay of Pigs invasion  E. Howard Hunt joined the CIA in 1949. He was immediately assigned to political action and influence, in the department that later became the CIA’s Special Activities Division. As part of that role, he actively participated in the United States’ operation in Cuba in 1961, culminating in the Bay of Pigs invasion.  That operation intended to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government in Cuba as part of the broader Cold War of those years. The Bay of Pigs invasion was supposed to be a military operation secretly supported by the United States. The plan was to land a force of Cuban exiles, trained and supported by the CIA, at the Bay of Pigs on the southern coast of Cuba. The hope was that a popular uprising would follow, leading to the downfall of Castro.  The operation was planned and approved during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, but it was carried out under President John F. Kennedy. The CIA trained and equipped around 1,400 Cuban exiles for the invasion. Howard Hunt was among those who were preparing the exiles for the government they were supposed to form after the invasion, under the direct influence of the United States. However, the Bay of Pigs invasion failed: John F. Kennedy decided to withhold air support after the international community became aware of the operation, which became the decisive factor for the failure.  That’s why the Bay of Pigs invasion is mentioned so often in the HBO series White House Plumbers: it’s considered an emblematic example of how operations fail if those who order them step back in the middle of the action. For Howard Hunt, the failure of the Cuban operation became a crucial turning point for his career: after that scandal, Kennedy’s administration publicly reacted against the CIA’s covert operations. From this point of view, Howard Hunt became one of those officers who needed to be blamed as a bad guy, although he was just executing orders. This detail of Howard Hunt’s perspective will come back soon.  The Watergate scandal  When Howard Hunt was assigned as one of the heads of the White House Plumbers, his task was (again) to execute an order: his team had to bug the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. However, on June 17, 1972, the burglars who broke into the Watergate complex were arrested, and quite soon, the connection with Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy became clear.  In the beginning, after the arrests, Nixon’s administration put its best effort into covering up the White House Plumbers operation, in an attempt to avoid a reputation problem for the U.S. President. As we know, the attempt failed: thanks to the efforts of newspapers like The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times, with the help of the infamous deep throat in contact with the reporters, it was revealed that the White House deposited considerable sums of money in the bank accounts of the burglars, trying to cover the operation’s costs and motivate them to hide precious information during the trial.  Once again, Howard Hunt was first asked to execute the orders, then became a public problem for the United States government. As reported by the New York Times in this article, during the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt declared in front of the Senate committee:  “I am crushed by the failure of my government to protect me and my family as in the past it has always done for its clandestine agents. I cannot escape feeling that the country I have served for my entire life and which directed me to carry out the Watergate entry is punishing me for doing the very things it trained and directed me to do.”  In December 1972, in the middle of the Watergate investigations, Howard Hunt’s wife Dorothy died in a mysterious plane crash. According to their son Saint John Hunt, who years later disclosed important information he knew from his father, the crash was orchestrated to put pressure on his dad. As reported in this article, he said: “A day after my mom died, my dad pled guilty. The day after the plane crash, Nixon appointed one of his closest advisers to head the crash investigation.”  Howard Hunt served 33 months in prison for the Watergate scandal. After he was released, he will spend the rest of his life as a book writer. But before dying, he had the chance to reveal some secret information that became famous as the “deathbed confession of Howard Hunt.”  The deathbed confession of Howard Hunt  The deathbed confession is a series of tapes recorded by Howard Hunt in 2004 and sent to his son Saint John Hunt. The content of these tapes was first revealed in 2007 on RollingStone and then became part of the book Saint John published in 2012, Bond of Secrecy: My Life with CIA Spy and Watergate Conspirator E. Howard Hunt. You can hear part of the content of that tapes in the video below, inside an interview Saint John had with Coast to Coast Live.  Deathbed Confession of E Howard Hunt Watch this video on YouTube.  It’s important to note that the accusations in Howard Hunt’s deathbed confession have never been proven, and many consider them just a conspiracy theory. The content, after all, is explosive: in that tape, Hunt explains that there was a direct connection between the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and key figures of the United States government, implying that the murder was ordered by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted to become President (he succeeded Kennedy in 1963).  It’s the last element that gives an aura of mystery to the life of Howard Hunt. The rest can be discovered in books, movies, and TV shows, as we are seeing in HBO’s White House Plumbers.

"assassination","2023-05-15","Not Discerned","{""PortAuPrince"", ""Ouest"", ""Haiti""}","Wed 17 May 2023 05:01:39","News emerging on Monday that the Haitian Government has now turned to Africa and Latin America for help to deal with the security crisis there is further indication of that Caribbean nation's dire need for assistance.  A Caribbean Media Corporation story reports Haiti's Foreign Affairs Minister Mr Jean Généus as saying that Prime Minister Ariel Henry recently spoke with Senegalese President Macky Sall, and talks are being held with other African and Latin American countries.  The Haitian Government has apparently come to the conclusion that there is a lack of interest on the part of Western states to provide military assistance to Haiti, which has been gripped by political and economic crises since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.  Rival gangs have taken control of up to 80 per cent of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have continued a deadly fight for more territory.  The UN reports that more than 840 people were killed in the first three months of this year, while over 600 people have been slain in April alone. Also, more than 400 people have been kidnapped so far this year.  And, if that were not bad enough, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has reported that the gang violence has placed more than 115,000 children at the risk of starving to death this year, an increase from the near 86,000 last year.  Adding to the Haitian people's woes is the more than 41,000 suspected cases of cholera reported since the resurgence of the acute diarrhoeal illness in October, with children under the age of 14 making up almost half of the cases, UNICEF has told us.  The UN agency says it urgently needs US$17 million to help detect malnutrition and purchase food and medicine. If that support does not become available, more children will die.  There are people in Haiti who are strongly opposed to the international community sending help in the form of police or military personnel. At the same time, as we have pointed out in this space before the obvious hesitance by some countries to offer help is most likely fuelled by the fact that Haiti hasn't been able to shake instability, and previous attempts at military aid in the form of boots on the ground have not gone well.  However, the situation there, correctly described as ""tragic"" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres during a joint news conference with Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness on Monday at Jamaica House is untenable and has the potential of spilling over into the wider region.  Mr Holness also explained that it's not that the pleas from the UN and the Caribbean for help have fallen on deaf ears. ""The question,"" he said, ""is the pace of action, and countries who would want to support would also want to be assured that there is a political process in place that could yield an end result in a time frame that makes sense.""  That is not an unreasonable position.  A possible solution, we believe, is for a mediation team to get all players in the political conflict in Haiti involved in talks aimed at holding elections to install a legitimate Government. Naturally, those polls would require international observers to ensure transparency and acceptance of the results.  Additionally, a strategy to confront and dismantle the gangs is necessary.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsL3RoaXMtZGlyZS1zaXR1YXRpb24taW4taGFpdGktaXMtdW50ZW5hYmxlL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsL3RoaXMtZGlyZS1zaXR1YXRpb24taW4taGFpdGktaXMtdW50ZW5hYmxlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"assassination","2023-05-13","22:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 21:15:24","Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs says despite the great wounds as a result of the Israeli aggression, Gazans decided to maintain steadfastness.  On Saturday at 10 pm Al-Quds time, an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire between the Palestinian Resistance and the Israeli occupation took effect following a five-day Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, which led to the martyrdom of 33 Palestinian and the injury of 100, in addition to huge material losses.  Immediately after the ceasefire was announced and took effect, Gazans took to the streets to celebrate victory in Operation Avenging the Free, which the Palestinian Resistance launched against the Israeli occupation in response to the latter's assassination of commanders and the brutal killing of civilians.  In conjunction with the celebrations, the Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian Resistance Factions in Gaza said Operation Avenging the Free is a new chapter of glory that the Resistance fought as a unified structure, warning that although the operation has ended, the banners of Resistance will not and shall not be lowered and the will to fight will not and shall not ever dwindle.  On his part, the Secretary-General of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement, Ziad Al-Nakhalah, said the Palestinian people, despite the pain, came out with their heads held high everywhere, in Gaza, the West Bank, and across the world, in support of the Resistance, describing these days as ""days of honor and dignity for our people, who, with simple resources, are facing all this aggression.""  One might wonder how the Palestinian Resistance and Gazans claimed a victory over the Israeli aggression, despite all the assassinations, killings, and destruction caused by the occupation.  Touching on the matter, Al Mayadeen analyst for Arab and regional affairs, Abdelrahman Nassar, pointed out that the main idea is to break the Israeli dictates, because ""Israel's"" goal behind the assassinations was to break the morale of the people.  Nassar explained that when Gazans witnessed the Resistance continuously bombing Israeli military sites, settlements, and cities and causing casualties among the Israelis until the last moment before the ceasefire entered into force, they considered the ceasefire a victory, steadfastness, and perseverance.  ""Simply rejecting Israeli dictates in this way is a victory,"" Nassar told Al Mayadeen English.  The Palestinian analyst indicated that despite the great wounds, Gazans decided to remain steadfast for many reasons, the most important of which is that they do not like to display their suffering in front of the Israeli occupation, considering all the difficult circumstances they have been under as part of the ongoing 15-year blockade on the Strip.  An upcoming assassination at any moment  Asked about the reason why “Israel” launched its heinous aggression against Gaza at this particular time, Nassar considered that the decision on the timing of the aggression was taken in 2022. He cited an Israeli Channel 14 report as saying that the security establishment confirmed the aggression on Gaza was not a response to the firing of 104 rockets toward ""Sderot"" in retaliation to Sheikh Khader Adnan’s martyrdom in Israeli occupation prisons, but rather a settling of accounts with the PIJ for each rocket launched since the beginning of the year and the movement’s role in Resistance operations in the occupied West Bank.  Nassar considered that ""Israel's"" concern is not the rocket firing from Gaza, since this matter is still unsolvable to the occupation, nor is it the PIJ's influential commanders, as there are similar influential leaders in other Palestinian factions. Rather, according to Nassar, ""Israel's"" problem is that the PIJ is at the forefront of the Resistance’s acts in the West Bank, and hence, the occupation tried to pressure the PIJ to prevent it from pursuing this progress. Therefore, the timing is just a factor related to field conditions and is mainly linked to the occupied West Bank, he noted.  Nassar cited another reason for the aggression -- a political factor related to the internal Israeli crisis over the judicial overhaul.  According to Nassar, ""Israel"" also tried to create a rift between the Palestinian Resistance factions and failed miserably as coordination between the factions was apparent during the aggression, and this is another aspect that boosted the morale of the people.  However, Nassar believed that from the present moment, ""Israel"" will continue to focus on the PIJ, predicting an upcoming assassination at any moment or a coming battle this year or the following.

Nevertheless, he pointed out that were it not for the Resistance's rockets, ""the media would have broadcast the images of our martyrs, wounded, and destroyed homes from one side only, just as the situation was in 2010 and before.""  ""After 2012, when the Resistance began to put Israel under constant anxiety, the situation changed.""  He added that despite the Resistance not being able to inflict huge casualties, Israeli settlers assert that they ""love life"" and disrupting their daily lives and spreading fear among them through rocket firing is enough in the meantime.  According to Nassar, the Israelis are infamous for keeping secret their casualties in all confrontations against Lebanon and Palestine, be they military or not.  Read more: PIJ can manage the battle for long days: Israeli media  Israeli media admits no solution to Gaza challenge  Touching on the Israeli media's feedback on the recent aggression, Nassar pointed out that the media will not attack the occupation army directly. He mentioned that the Israeli media praised the army's performance but criticized that of the political establishment. However, he noted that the media admitted that ""Israel"" has not been able to find a solution to the Gaza challenge.  Nassar had previously touched on the path that was followed to reach a ceasefire. He asserted that the Palestinian Resistance's position was clear from the beginning, which is that it will not end this round unless it forces the Israeli occupation to stop the assassinations and targeting of its leaders and the bombing of homes and civilians.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Washington"", ""DistrictOfColumbia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 17:37:00","Film celebrates 50th anniversary of the first graduating class of the University’s Partnership Program  Washington, D. C., May 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A documentary has been released telling the stories of Catholic University’s efforts to recruit and welcome Black students, especially from the Washington, D.C. area through its “Partnership Program.” Fifty years after the University’s first graduates of the Partnership Program — created in the wake of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — the documentary examines its founding, its struggles, and the progress being made to create a more diverse campus community.  Catholic University admitted 30 Black students mainly from the local area through the Partnership Program. To mark its success and the work that has been done, the University bestowed honorary doctoral degrees to the program's first directors, Leon LeBuffe and Thaddeus Aubry at the University-wide Commencement ceremony on May 13.  The documentary, No Longer Out of Reach, was directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker and journalist Chris Jenkins. The documentary features four of the program’s first participants along with Aubry and LeBuffe, both alumni, telling their stories. Additional voices from former students and archival footage complete the narrative about how Black students first faced significant struggles to get an education and how the University has been supporting the program since its founding in 1969. To screen the documentary, visit here .  “I can think of no better way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Partnership Program than to shine a light on its history, celebrate its accomplishments, and award honorary degrees to the program’s first directors, Leon LeBuffe and Thaddeus Aubry,” said Dr. Peter K. Kilpatrick, president of Catholic University. “Both of these extraordinary gentlemen offered their offices, homes, and time to students and were dedicated and welcoming.”  The Partnership Program has helped scores of Black students from the Washington metropolitan area attend Catholic University. In 1968, the year before the program started, there were seven Black undergraduates on campus. Now total undergraduate and graduate enrollment of Black students accounts for approximately 10% of the total student body.  Story continues  During LeBuffe and Aubry’s tenure, they personally mentored every matriculating program student — from their first days on campus through graduation. Even the few who ultimately did not complete the program benefited from their attention. This impact was felt so strongly and had such a profound impact on program graduates that the group established an endowed scholarship — the Thaddeus F. Aubry Jr. and Leon LeBuffe Scholarship — to honor their legacy and help current and future Black students at Catholic University through financial grants.  No Longer Out of Reach features four of the original 30 Black students admitted in 1969: Elvira Wise Smith, Ronny B. Lancaster, Andrea Cullins, and Kenneth Walker. The partners recount their experiences and journeys as Black students on Catholic University’s campus in the 70s. LeBuffe and Aubry discuss the role they played to bridge the gap and help students acclimate to the almost entirely white, and frequently unwelcoming, environment in which they found themselves.  ABOUT: The Catholic University of America is the national university of the Catholic Church and the only higher education institution founded by the U.S. bishops.

"assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Wed 17 May 2023 06:18:00","In a message released on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Nakba Day, the Iranian president called it one of the most painful tragedies in human history.  The text of the message is as follows:  In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful  May 14, 1948 is a reminder of one of the most painful tragedies in human history. This ominous phenomenon caused the longest and saddest political and human crisis in the last one hundred years in the world and widespread insecurity in the West Asian region, the organized occupation and cruel usurpation of the Palestinian land, the killing of the oppressed Palestinians and the violation of the most obvious human rights of the original inhabitants of this holy land in 75 years.  Since the day that has been rightly named ""Nakba Day"", the Zionist regime has caused the displacement of millions of Palestinians, the targeted assassinations of Palestinian activists and ordinary people, the destruction of their homes, farms, and places of business and the violation of fundamental principles of international law, and it is obvious that the western supporters of this regime, especially the United States of America, are complicit in its crimes.  The Zionist regime continues its extreme and inhumane actions against the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the desecration of Islamic sanctities in the holy Quds in recent months, and in recent days, with a large-scale attack on various areas of the Gaza Strip, especially residential buildings, and targeted assassination of Palestinian citizens to escape from increasing and multi-layered internal crises.  These crimes, which have led to the martyrdom of dozens of civilians, including Palestinian women and children, are the concrete manifestation of state terrorism and mass murder, which has been the constant approach of this regime for the past 75 years.  For more than 18 years, the residents of the Gaza Strip have been living in the world's largest natural prison under cruel siege in a major humanitarian crisis. The continuation of the illegal and inhumane siege of the Gaza Strip and the ongoing crimes of the Zionist regime against the people of this region is a gross and obvious violation of the fundamental principles of international law, human rights and humanitarian rights, and unfortunately, the silence and inaction of the self-proclaimed human rights activists only lead to the arrogance of more than apartheid regime has been done before.  While strongly condemning the crimes of the Zionist apartheid regime against the Palestinian nation and the nations of the region, and while emphasizing the need for immediate, effective and deterrent action by the responsible international institutions, led by the United Nations, to stop the crimes of the Zionist regime and support the Palestinian nation, the Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its solidity with this oppressed nation and emphasizes on supporting the cause and legitimate resistance of the Palestinian people in the path of liberating the occupied territories and forming an independent and unified government in the entire historical land of Palestine with the capital of the holy Quds.  At the end, I re-emphasize the Islamic Republic of Iran's democratic plan for the political solution of the Palestinian occupation crisis based on holding a public referendum with the participation of all the main inhabitants of the Palestinian land, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in order to exercise the right to self-determination and to determine the type of political system.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc25pbW5ld3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy8yODk1OTY0L2lyYW4tcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYnJhbmRzLW5ha2JhLWRheS1hLXRyYWdlZHktaW4taGlzdG9yedIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc25pbW5ld3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNS8xNy8yODk1OTY0L2lyYW4tcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYnJhbmRzLW5ha2JhLWRheS1hLXRyYWdlZHktaW4taGlzdG9yeS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1963-11-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 01:43:38","Children of the '60s were very different from children in the '60s.  Flower children of the '60s on campus were changing the world with long hair and free spirits. They were the populous, rebellious Baby Boomers, born in post-World War II security and prosperity. The sun shone brightly on this huge wave, and they got all the attention.  As for us, born in the '60s, we were not so blessed. Even those born during President John F. Kennedy's Thousand Days don't remember the charmed ""Camelot"" era of culture and grace. That was a short chapter of history.  So, we didn't march on the streets as a way of life. We missed dancing on the streets in the Summer of Love. More soberly, youths coming of age were not drafted to fight in Vietnam as the war raged.  ""Gen X"" was too young to remember the crushing assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, the central crack in the canyon of American memory.  There are differing definitions of the end of the Boomers; that is my lived experience of the gulf separating the earlier generation and mine.  Unifying experiences, sweet and bitter, shape the character of any generation.  As little kids, we didn't go to Woodstock. It was past our bedtime. The man landing on the moon seemed like a fairy tale, a perfect end to a turbulent time of our lives.  Every new day seemed exhilarating or tragic in that eventful decade. American children could not seek shelter from the storms of the '60s.  How I remember the ride's ups and downs: the rock 'n' roll of the Beatles, the folk protest songs of Bob Dylan and the shattering assassinations in 1968, 55 springs ago.  And I remember crying myself to sleep as a small child when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was slain in cold blood. Listening to the civil rights leader's resonant voice on the radio that cruel April fourth, how wrong it was that it would be heard no more.  I remember my father frozen in grief at the June murder of Bobby Kennedy that same spring. A young girl realizes, from reading older faces, that a calamity has happened — again.  There was no nursery rhyme or reason, Mommy and Daddy. They were helpers, I said.  The '60s had many moments like these as the Vietnam War went on... and on. Truly, it was all the adults talked and argued about. In Madison, Wisconsin, we bundled up for an anti-war protest or two. We sang a civil rights anthem or two.  I loved those songs and still know them by heart. Where have all the flowers gone?  As a family, we got caught up in the spirit of the '60s. We watched and trusted Walter Cronkite as the nation's storyteller. When Cronkite turned against President Lyndon B. Johnson's Vietnam War, here was one more trusted grown-up who doubted official Washington's words and actions on the war.  They could not all be wrong, right?  The end of the era gave us children in the '60s a badge as the first generation to watch and bear witness to a culture revolution against the government and social conventions.  The Baby Boomers, who grew up in the safe, conformist Eisenhower '50s, defied traditional authority as children of the '60s. They had all the fun, sometimes it seemed, and those were the days.  That generation gave us three presidents: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and, um, Donald Trump. Two out of three Baby Bummers.  We children in the '60s have had one president, Barack Obama, born the summer of '61 during Kennedy's Thousand Days. He was better at brilliant campaigning in soaring speeches than governing, playing the card game of politics.  Obama felt getting knee deep in political bargains and compromises was slumming. He shunned the usual suspects — like House Democrats — in socializing at the White House. He did not ask citizens to do more for the country, as Kennedy did.  When we were getting braces, a president was forced to resign in 1974 after a corrupt cover-up. Our faith in government was further shaken.  I'd say Obama didn't meet great expectations. But then there's this: We lost our illusions and innocence young, even before we could vote.  Jamie Stiehm may be reached at JamieStiehm.com. Follow her on Twitter @JamieStiehm.

The groundbreaking commemorated a historic past and a future to become the dream today and tomorrow. The turn of the shovel is for the museum’s new Legacy Building and Founders Park renovations.  “Today is a momentous day at the National Civil Rights Museum for Memphis and for the state of Tennessee and for this country,” said Russ Wigginton, President of the National Civil Right Museum. “The renovations at Founders Park and the Legacy Building sets us up to be much more powerful in our messaging, many more educational opportunities for our visitors, and an opportunity for people to come to the National Civil Rights Museum and be inspired.”  The two-year project will focus on the museum’s campus west of Mulberry Street. It will expand the first floor of the historic boarding house including digital exhibitions and exhibits on Dr. King’s Poor People’s Campaign and the Freedom Award.  “We’ve (Blue Cross Blue Shield) invested 9.6 million dollars to reimagine this space for people to be able to come and reflect after visiting the museum. It’ll be an amazing space not just for Memphians, but people across the country,” said Kevin Woods, Blue Cross Blue Shield Vice President for the Memphis market.  The second-floor exhibitions will explore the Civil Rights Movement since Dr. King’s assassination and what has happened since those days.  “The legacy building will help address that. It will be thematic. It will talk about social justice issues that were central to Dr. King’s last “Where Do We Go From Here (book),” said Wigginton.  The third-floor exhibitions will examine how today’s activism impacts our communities and policies around poverty, education, jobs, housing, criminal justice, and gender equality as the National Civil Rights Museum looks back at the issues of the past and today.  “This museum will continue its critical role to tell our history, to inspire positive social change, and to give us all that special space,” said Blue Cross Blue Shield Board Chair Emily Reynolds.  The National Civil Rights Museum opened in 1991. It’s had more than 300,000 visitors and now expects the expansion in 2025 will mean half a million people visiting the museum every year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3JlZy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9uYXRpb25hbC1jaXZpbC1yaWdodHMtbXVzZXVtLWJyZWFrcy1ncm91bmQtb24tdHdvLXllYXItZXhwYW5zaW9uLXByb2plY3Qv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93cmVnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL25hdGlvbmFsLWNpdmlsLXJpZ2h0cy1tdXNldW0tYnJlYWtzLWdyb3VuZC1vbi10d28teWVhci1leHBhbnNpb24tcHJvamVjdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 10:16:20","In an interview with Channel 14 on Monday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Israel would assassinate anybody who poses a threat to the upcoming flag march in occupied Jerusalem this week.  “We carried out assassinations not only in the Gaza Strip, but also in other places,” the prime minister told the Hebrew outlet, adding that “whoever provokes us on Jerusalem Day – his blood will be spilled.”  “We carried out assassinations in several arenas. All I can say is that we will not back down from this policy, but we will implement it at the appropriate time,” he added.  Netanyahu’s comments come despite the fact that Israel was said to have agreed to the resistance’s main term for the ceasefire announced on Saturday evening, an end to the Israeli ‘assassination policy’ against leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) movement and other groups.  However, contradicting the alleged Egyptian, Qatari, and UN-drafted truce document – Israeli officials continue to claim that they made no such agreement.  “We will have zero tolerance for those who launch attacks against [us] … we will take direct and very painful measures directly against the heads of all organizations,” Netanyahu said.  Earlier on Monday, a member of Netanyahu’s government, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz, said: “The march of the flags will take place, as usual, every year without change, and that any organization that tries to harm it and fire missiles at us to prevent it, all its leaders will be on the elimination table, as we did with Islamic Jihad.”  This came after Palestinian sources told Al-Akhbar daily that – while a change in the course of the flag march was not included in the ceasefire terms as the PIJ had initially announced – the resistance would be keeping a watchful eye over Jerusalem and would respond appropriately to any provocation by “the occupation government and its extremists” during the flag march.  A journalist with close ties to Hamas, Mustafa al-Sawwaf, told Al-Akhbar that “things will turn upside down” if Israel goes ahead with Thursday’s ultra-nationalist march as planned.  Every year, the flag march falls on ‘Jerusalem Day,’ during which Israelis commemorate the illegal annexation of east Jerusalem during the 1967 war. The march is highly provocative given that it passes through the Muslim quarters of Jerusalem’s Old City where Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is located – with Israelis carrying their flags and chanting racist and derogatory slogans.  Acts of violence against Palestinians by settlers and accompanying Israeli troops are highly common throughout the annual flag march. During last year’s flag march, over 160 Palestinians were injured by Israeli troops and settlers.  Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir – known for storming Al-Aqsa Mosque and aiming pistols at Palestinians in the street – will be attending the flag march.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3JhZGxlLmNvL2FydGljbGUtdmlldy8yNDg1My9pc3JhZWwtdGhyZWF0ZW5zLXZpb2xlbmNlLWlmLWZsYWctbWFyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

May 16, 2023  People hold a banner during a sit-in, in the memory of Emanuela Orlandi, a teenager who disappeared in 1983 in one of Italy's darkest mysteries, behind St Peter's Square in the Vatican in Rome on Jan. 14. (Photo AFP)    ROME: Rome prosecutors have opened a fresh investigation into the disappearance of a teenager 40 years ago, and are calling for full collaboration from the Vatican, Italian media reported Monday.    Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee, was last seen leaving a music class in Rome on June 22, 1983.    Decades of speculation followed over what happened to her, with suggestions that mobsters, the secret services or a Vatican conspiracy were to blame, theories which sparked a hit Netflix series.    The Orlandi family's lawyer Laura Sgro told AFP Monday she had learned of the fresh probe through Italian media reports, and ""it would certainly be welcome news"".    The family has campaigned tirelessly for the truth, and it was their demands which led in part to the Vatican launching an inquiry into its most famous cold case in January.    Following that, ""Rome Public Prosecutor's Office is now also formally returning to investigate the Orlandi case,"" Italy's Corriere della Sera said.    It will be the third investigation by the Rome office, following ones from 1983-1997, and 2008- 2015.    'Seek the truth together'  The Vatican has been accused of obstructing investigation efforts over the decades.    But now its chief prosecutor Alessandro Diddi and Rome prosecutors led by Francesco Lo Voi ""are cooperating on the case"", the Repubblica daily said.    The Corriere said ""the hope is for 'full cooperation' -- an exchange of documents, depositions etc"".    The Vatican has interviewed clerics in recent weeks as part of its investigation, the paper added.    It would be ""the first time Italian and Vatican prosecutors work together to seek the truth"", Sgro said.    The fresh Italian investigation was driven in part by former prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo's claims that he had spoken during the last probe to two representatives at the Vatican who had promised to reveal the whereabouts of Orlandi's body, the Corriere said.    One of the most widely circulated theories claims Orlandi was snatched by mobsters to put pressure on the Vatican to recover a loan.    Enrico De Pedis, head of the Magliana gang, was suspected of involvement in her kidnapping.    Another claim often repeated in the Italian media was that she was taken to force the release from prison of Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turk who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981.    The twists and turns of the case were documented in a 2022 TV series by Netflix, ""Vatican Girl"".    In it, a friend also claimed the teen confided the week before she disappeared to having been harassed in the Vatican gardens by a figure close to then pope John Paul II.--ucanews.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG1hbGF5c2lhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JvbWUtc3RhcnRzLWZyZXNoLXByb2JlLWludG8tbWlzc2luZy12YXRpY2FuLXRlZW4vNzExMjcvMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1983-06-22","18:00:00","{""Rome"", ""Lazio"", ""Italy""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:46:24","FILE – Undated picture of Italian teenager Emanuela Orlandi, the daughter of a Vatican employee, believed to have been kidnapped after a music lesson in Rome on June 22, 1983 when she was 15-years-old. (Credit: AP Photo.)  Listen to this story:  ROME – After the Vatican opened an investigation last December and the Italian parliament is currently considering its own probe, the city of Rome too has announced a new inquest into the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, at the time the 15-year-old daughter of an employee of the Prefecture of the Papal Household whose family lived in a Vatican apartment.  Orlandi’s case recently was popularized by the Netflix series “Vatican Girl,” and most observers credit the flurry of new investigations, at least in part, to the heightened public interest created by the documentary.  The chief prosecutor of Rome, roughly equivalent to a district attorney in the United States, announced the new investigation this week. It will be the third such probe by the Roman procurator’s office in the 40 years since Orlandi disappeared. The first unfolded between 1983 and 1997, and the second from 2008 to 2015.  That second investigation was closed in 2015 by the chief prosecutor of Rome at the time, a veteran Italian jurist named Giuseppe Pignatone, who today serves as the president of the civil tribunal of the Vatican City State.  The Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that the Vatican’s Promoter of Justice, Alessandro Diddi, has turned over files from his investigation to Stefano Luciani, the official in the Rome procurator’s office now responsible for the new Orlandi review.  Pietro Orlandi, the brother of Emanuela who’s devoted his life to the search for the truth about his sister’s disappearance, told reporters the Vatican’s cooperation with the Roman probe is a departure from the past.  “It’s positive that the Roman procurator has acquired the acts from the Vatican, because for the first time there will be collaboration, always denied in the past, between the Holy See and the [Italian justice system],” he said.  That’s a charge recently echoed by Giancarlo Capaldo, a retired Roman official who led the last investigation of the Orlandi case that was closed in 2015. In April, Capaldo told an Italian television program that in his experience there had been “no cooperation by Vatican with investigations of Italian magistrates.”  Among other things, Capaldo has claimed that in 2012 officials of the Vatican gendarmes offered to help identify Orlandi’s remains in exchange for assistance with removing the body of a mob boss who’d been entombed in a Roman basilica. Both officials involved have denied that claim, suggesting Capaldo misunderstood their intent.  The Vatican has always rejected charges of stonewalling investigations into the Orlandi case. In a 2012 statement from then-Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi, he insisted the Vatican has cooperated with Italian authorities from the start.  The 40th anniversary of Orlandi’s disappearance will fall next month, on June 22.  Veteran Italian journalist Fabrizio Peronaci, writing in Corriere della Sera, has suggested that the new probe of the Orlandi case by the procurator’s office could be combined with one already underway into the January 1984 murder of Katy Skerl, a 17-year-old girl at the time whose body was discovered in the countryside outside Grottaferrata, a small community southeast of Rome.  Over the years, some theorists have linked Skerl’s murder to the Orlandi case, noting, among other things, that Skerl was a classmate in a Roman high school of Snejna Vassilev, the daughter of one of three Bulgarian functionaries in Rome initially accused of complicity in the 1981 assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.  Marco Accetti, a 67-year-old Roman photographer whose claims to have played a key role in the Orlandi affair have generated both interest and skepticism over the years, has asserted Skerl was killed on the order of a faction in the Vatican, opposed to the group which orchestrated the kidnapping of Orlandi, as part of an internal power struggle. To date, however, he’s offered no proof.  The Italian Chamber of Deputies voted overwhelmingly in March to authorize an inquest on behalf of parliament, and it seemed at the time the Senate would follow suit. Momentum stalled, however, after Pietro Orlandi went on Italian TV to play an audio recording of an ex-Roman mobster accusing the late Pope John Paul II of conniving in a pedophile ring in the Vatican, and suggesting that Emanuela Orlandi might have been killed to cover it up.  Those suggestions caused a furor, with Pope Francis twice publicly rejecting the charges against his predecessor. Key members of the senate have either withdrawn or modified their support for a probe in the wake of the controversy, with a vote now not expected until June at the earliest, and possibly after the summer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vdmF0aWNhbi8yMDIzLzA1L3ZhdGljYW4tY29vcGVyYXRlcy13aXRoLW5ldy1yb21lLXByb2JlLW9mLXZhdGljYW4tZ2lybC1jYXNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Truman Moore/Getty Images  May 2023 marks 98 years since the birth of civil rights leader Malcolm X, formerly Malcolm Little.  Malcolm X was a spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, or NOI, and helped to lead the organization until he left in 1964 – the year before his assassination.  The NOI, whose role in civil rights movements is a focus of my research, included leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, who along with Malcolm X are known for their fiery rhetoric and teachings on race.  The NOI, which teaches a Black supremacist message and advocates for racial separatism, has also been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  While the organization once boasted half a million members, the group is now relatively small. Currently it has an estimated membership of roughly 35,000 – but prominent NOI members, such as boxer and onetime Malcolm X friend Muhammad Ali, attracted wide public interest in the movement. Today, its influence continues to extend well beyond its membership.  Although Malcolm X – and other prominent members like Ali – left the NOI, thousands of students each year learn about the group from Malcolm X’s “Autobiography,” originally published in 1965.  Malcolm X’s influence on popular culture also remains significant. He inspired a Hollywood biopic and is referenced in the work of artists such as Beyoncé, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, who was briefly associated with NOI.  Thanks largely to Malcolm X, the NOI is now a household name, but its teachings remain controversial, particularly among Muslims.  A radical alternative to Christianity?  W.D. Fard, a peddler by day and preacher by night, established the NOI in 1931 in Detroit, Michigan.  He taught that God was a Black man who taught the first human beings Islam. Accordingly, Fard framed Islam as “the natural faith” for people whose ancestors came from Africa, before colonization and slavery had forced Christianity onto them. He argued that Black people should abandon Christianity in favor of Islam as their ancestral religion.  Story continues  Fard also taught that Christianity was “the white man’s” religion and a corrupted form of Islam used to promote white supremacy. The message appealed to Black migrants from the South, who were sometimes looked down upon by Northern Black Protestants. Fard disappeared from the historical record in the mid-1930s.  Malcolm X and the NOI  Malcolm X joined the NOI while incarcerated in 1952. He became an international spokesman for the group, using his fierce wit and sense of humor to debate Black and white leaders on matters of race, religion and politics.  Malcolm X was suspended from the NOI in 1963 for his comments about President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. The following year, he renounced the NOI, converted to Sunni Islam, completed the hajj and formed a Black civil rights organization called the Organization of Afro-American Unit, or OAAU. This group sought to unite all Black people across the globe and conditionally accepted help from white people committed to Black freedom. The NOI, on the other hand, focused on the U.S. and refused all help from white Americans.  Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, during an OAAU event in New York. The identity of his killers remains a mystery.  A new era  When Elijah Muhammad died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, transformed the NOI into the “World Community of al-Islam in the West.” He downplayed previous teachings about Black supremacy and aligned the movement closer to Sunni Islam. In 1977, however, a protégé of Elijah Muhammad’s and Malcolm X’s named Louis Farrakhan “restored” Elijah Muhammad’s Nation of Islam. Farrakhan assumed leadership of the group and emphasized Elijah’s teachings on race.  W.D. Fard, the NOI’s founder, and his successor Elijah Muhammad did not seem to know much about Sunni or Shiite Islam’s teachings. Fard did not cite the Quran to his followers, and Elijah Muhammad did not read the book until after assuming the NOI’s leadership.  As the group grew after World War II, Muhammad and other leaders became more familiar with mainstream Islamic tenets. They changed the name of their meeting places from “temples” to “mosques” and incorporated the Quran and Arabic phrases into their teachings and community organizing.  While the movement has changed its practices to align more closely with global expressions of Islam, many Muslims do not consider the NOI part of the Ummah, the global community of Muslims.  Not universally considered Muslim  The NOI’s unique theology is one of the reasons the group is not accepted into the Ummah.  Other forms of Islam maintain that God is eternal, nonhuman and singularly divine. The NOI, however, teaches that W.D. Fard was “God in person” who called Elijah Muhammad as his prophet.  Despite this significant deviation from mainstream forms of Islam, the NOI follows four of the five pillars of Islam: five daily prayers (salat), giving alms to the poor (zakat), pilgrimage to Mecca (hajj) and a month of fasting during Ramadan.  NOI Muslims did not practice Ramadan until 1988, when Farrakhan instructed members to fast “with the entire Islamic world.”  Changing attitudes?  That change led to opportunities for intra-Muslim cooperation but also underscored the limited acceptance of the NOI that continues among many other Muslim groups.  For example, in 2000, NOI members prayed with Houston Muslims during Ramadan, allowing the NOI to connect with other American Muslims.  However, these cross-Muslim events have not continued in Houston. Nor are they common elsewhere. The lack of sustained pan-Muslim events might suggest that, even when religious practice aligns, there remain obstacles to the building of relationships between mainstream and NOI Muslims.  While both the NOI and Malcolm X remain controversial, for many admirers X’s work has taken on new significance for today’s racial justice movements.

Shri Rajinder kaul premi, with his eyes moist said that his illustrious father ,& beloved younger married brother verinder(27) were first kidnapped from their residence in the late night of April 28,1990 & latter on assassined ,when their bodies were recovered. Rajinder said that the militant kidnappers looted & ransacked their entire house ,after forcing their entry in their house, on the pretext of asking some questions from the learned teacher, who was so popular in the area, as they meant no harm to this lone pandit, family living in that area ,who according to these militants was helping their muslim neighbours in their hour of need. These terrorist had the sworen in the name of Allah, Quran, Mohamad, Haj, Roza etc only to trap their prey. The promised their family that they will bring back both the father & son duo safely , tomorrow & will love to take tea ,as our commander waiting outside the house has instructed us. On this promise both father & son duo were take with them, along with the looted property viz cash, jewellery watches, precious clothing, pashmina shawals, besides rare books& manuscripts, after packing these in emptied bags & suit case.  Rajinder further said that after painful wait of two days they were informed of the sad occurrences.  Although an FIR 45/90 was registered in police station Doru Anantnag, but this case was closed as untraced after after a brief period, as no effective & expeditious investigation was done, although this case was first of its kind in the area & special case , investigation as expected was not taken up.  This was a severe blow to the belief of the family stood far & only in this back drop the family  migrated from the valley much against their wishes.  A press note issued by the Govt: then said ,”Eight arrests have been made ,suspected to be involved in this case” but latter was closed as untraced, which has further shocked & wrecked the family.  Not only this their ancestral local temple was demolished & desecrated in 1992.  Their native residential houses & cow shed torched in 1998.  Although the family had approached the authorities with the request of handing this famous & unique case to CiB for an expeditious & effective investigations ,but due to unknown reasons was not allowed by the J&K Govt then.  The family said that despite the directions of our own state Human Rights Commission (SHRC) in its DB Judgement of 22.2.2012,inter alia, recommended for reopening of this case for a logical conclusion.  Rajinder further informed that even directions from NHRC, have also gone unheard.  The family once again has urged & impressed upon the UT J&K LG as well GOI, MHA, reiterating its long pending demand for not only reopening of this case but also handling over this case to a logical conclusion, so as bring the culprits of this whole conspiy to justice.

Play Video  Teves had been the focus of the government’s joint task force investigating the March 4 assassination of the Negros Oriental governor.    Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said the NBI filed murder, frustrated murder, and attempted murder complaints against the fugitive congressman.  The 11 other suspects – almost all former members of the military – are in the custody of the NBI.  The filing of the complaint was delayed by two days, after six of the 11 suspects became uncooperative when they were given new lawyers. (READ: Filing of murder complaints vs Teves delayed as suspects get new lawyers)  Teves, who left the country purportedly for medical reasons prior to the assassination, has yet to return to the Philippines long after the March 20 deadline set by House Speaker Martin Romualdez.  Separate from the multiple murder complaint, the Department of Justice earlier said it was in the process of proscribing Teves as a terrorist.  Play Video  Remulla previously said the DOJ received intel that Teves was supposed to return home on Wednesday.  Teves told News 5 earlier on Wednesday that this was “fake news.”  The justice secretary said that if Teves refused to return home, it would be an indication of guilt. “Flight is an indication of guilt, by any language, jurisdiction,” Remulla said.  Whether or not Teves returns home, the preliminary investigation will continue, the secretary explained.  Teves cannot file his counter-affidavit in absentia, but he can be charged in absentia.  “He has to come home, or they will file the case in court, and a warrant will be issued in absentia,” Remulla said.  In reaction to the filing of cases against Teves, his lawyer Ferdie Topacio told CNN Philippines, “it’s about time.”  “Kung ang sinasabi ni Secretary Remulla gusto niyang airtight, lalo hindi naging airtight. Kasi, nabalitaan ko nga through various news outlets, meron recantation ang thrust ng ilang sinasabi nilang testigo nung March 31 pa. Sinasabi nila 99.9% solved. Pagdating ng April 4, sabi nila solid daw ang testimonial evidence against Congressman Teves, ayan, may mga recantations pala,” Topacio said, casting doubt on the DOJ’s case build-up.  (If Secretary Remulla is saying they waited so long to make the case airtight, the more it isn’t airtight. Because we found out through various news outlets, there was a thrust toward recantations, from witnesses they said who testified last March 31. They said it is 99.9% solved. Then came April 4, they said the testimonial evidence against them was solid, but there are recantations.)  Why it matters  While political killings continue to happen in the Philippines, it’s rare that a sitting governor is assassinated in broad daylight in his own home by what appears to be highly trained gunmen.  Aside from the method in Degamo’s killing, there were nine others killed and 16 injured that day – all civilians. Another civilian died on May 6, bringing the death toll to 10.  Degamo’s killing also brought national attention to the long-running problem of unsolved killings in Negros Island. It has stirred conversations on ending impunity and protecting human rights in Negros Oriental, issues that were rarely talked about in the province.  The Senate committee on dangerous drugs and public order held marathon hearings to investigate the Degamo assassination and other killings in Negros Oriental from April 17 to 19, and from May 10 to 11. They heard dozens of families of victims of unsolved killings, survivors, and cops who were used to be assigned to or currently serving in Negros Oriental.  The Senate investigation concluded on May 11 after five sessions. – Rappler.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhcHBsZXIuY29tL25hdGlvbi9uYmktZmlsZXMtbXVyZGVyLWNvbXBsYWludHMtYXJuaWUtdGV2ZXMtcm9lbC1kZWdhbW8ta2lsbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Advertising Read more  Some 24,000 security personnel are reportedly being deployed to Hiroshima during the summit, most dispatched from other parts of the country.  Well ahead of the May 19-21 talks, patrolling police have been weaving between tour groups in the western city's famed Peace Park.  Security personnel were also motoring up and down the river that runs alongside sites like the Atomic Bomb Dome, with helicopters regularly buzzing overhead.  The measures have extended far beyond the city, including to the capital Tokyo, where messages on the train system warn of heightened security for the summit.  Major cities in Japan do not generally have rubbish bins in public places, but security personnel have been sealing off other places considered to pose a potential threat.  Coin lockers, which are common in many stations, have been put out of operation at major stations as far afield as Tokyo.  Security personnel are even patrolling by boat in Hiroshima before the G7 summit © Richard A. Brooks / AFP  Vending machines on subway platforms have also been unplugged and sealed with tape, along with apologetic signs warning they will be unavailable during the summit for security reasons.  In Hiroshima, signs across the city and in hotels remind locals and tourists alike that the summit will cause disruption, including the closure of streets and access to the island of Miyajima, which leaders are expected to visit.  'Inconvenience understandable'  Dozens of schools and other institutions have simply opted to close during the summit, according to local media.  But Yoshinari Kakei, who was out walking his dog in the Peace Park early Wednesday evening said he was ""grateful"" for the heavy security.  ""Inconvenience and limitations are understandable. We will just live with that during this period,"" the 52-year-old told AFP.  The measures are likely to be closely scrutinised less than a year after a gunman assassinated former prime minister Abe as he campaigned in the city of Nara.  Then in April, a man hurled an explosive device towards Prime Minister Fumio Kishida shortly before he was due to deliver a campaign speech in the city of Wakayama.  Police are patrolling across the city, which is expecting major disruptions while leaders are in town © Philip FONG / AFP  He escaped unharmed, but the fact that an assailant was able to throw the device at such close range so soon after the Abe murder prompted renewed criticism of security arrangements in Japan.  The head of Japan's National Police Agency, and the local police chief, resigned in the wake of Abe's assassination after an investigation confirmed ""shortcomings"" in the security for the former leader.  The investigation slammed a system under which local police were given responsibility for the security of visiting senior officials and argued that with better measures, it was ""highly probable"" the attack could have been prevented.  Kishida has instructed police to step up security around the G7 ""so that guests can visit Japan with peace of mind"".

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""MexicoCity"", ""DistritoFederal"", ""Mexico""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:16:00","Mexico City, Mexico, May 16, 2023 (venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuelan opposition figures reportedly conspired with Colombian paramilitaries to stage a coup d’etat and assassinate President Hugo Chávez.  Former paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso made the revelations during his testimony to Colombia’s Special Jurisdiction for Peace on Thursday.  “At one point a Venezuelan general came along with his son and some Venezuelan politicians to propose Carlos Castaño and I [...] that we carry out a coup d'état with a part of the Venezuelan Armed Forces allied with us to overthrow and assassinate Hugo Chávez,” Mancuso told the tribunal.  Mancuso, together with Carlos Castaño, led the the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC by its Spanish acronym), a former paramilitary group with ties to the Colombian Armed Forces that fought the country’s guerrilla armies, waging a violent campaign in the countryside that claimed thousands of victims.  The paramilitary chief was testifying before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP by its Spanish acronym), a tribunal established as part of a peace agreement between the Colombian state and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. Mancuso delivered his testimony via video from a prison inside the United States after being extradited in 2008 to face drug trafficking charges.  Mancuso, who seeks to return to Colombia, faces a long series of serious charges related to his time as a leader of the AUC. People involved in the country’s decades-long armed conflict who participate in JEP tribunals are eligible to receive special consideration, including reduced sentences, if their testimony is found to be truthful.  The work of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace has grown in prominence as Colombian President Gustavo Petro seeks to implement what his government has termed “Total Peace” in the country after his conservative predecessor deliberately sidelined peace efforts. The AUC itself formally demobilized between 2003 and 2006 as part of a separate deal promoted by former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, which was criticized for being too accommodating to the paramilitary groups and leaders.  In his testimony to the JEP, Mancuso added that Castaño rejected the Venezuelan opposition proposal but nonetheless offered to send AUC troops to train their Venezuelan counterparts to carry out the coup. In 2004, a group of 50 Colombian paramilitaries was caught in an estate outside Caracas with an alleged plot to assassinate Chávez, who was elected in 1998 and served as president until his death from cancer in 2013.  Mancuso’s claim bolsters accusations of collaboration and coordination between Venezuela’s hardline opposition and paramilitary groups on both sides of the border. Self-proclaimed former “interim president” Juan Guaidó and his allies faced heavy criticism after photos emerged of the opposition figure embracing high ranking members of Colombia’s Los Rastrojos after he crossed from Venezuela into Colombia to participate in US-led effort to force “humanitarian aid” across the border in 2019.  Former US National Security Advisor John Bolton later revealed that the so-called aid scheme was indeed an effort to try to embarrass Maduro and trigger a break in the armed forces, as Venezuelan government officials had denounced.  Guaidó again illegally entered Colombia last month as part of an effort to sabotage an international conference on Venezuela hosted by Petro. It was not clear if he relied on the help of armed actors in the border region once more. Guaidó eventually fled Colombia for Miami and subsequently held meetings with US politicians from both sides of the aisle who reiterated their support for him and Venezuela’s hardline opposition.  Petro has similarly denounced a coup plot by former Colombian security officials, mercenaries and paramilitary outfits. Retired state security officials and reservists staged a protest against the Colombian president’s security policies last Wednesday, with some openly calling for his ouster. Human rights activists in Colombia have long denounced the closeness between Colombian state security forces and paramilitary outfits.  Colombian mercenaries are also accused of involvement in the 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, with 18 Colombians, many of them former soldiers, having been arrested in connection with Moïse’s killing. The assassination is suspected of being organized with the help of a Florida-based security firm.  In 2020, Venezuela foiled an effort by a 60-man paramilitary force organized by US special operations veteran Jordan Goudreau and retired Venezuelan Major General Cliver Alcalá to infiltrate the country via Colombia with the aim of assassinating Maduro.  The plot, known as “Operation Gideon”, counted on the support and blessing of high-profile Venezuelan opposition figures, despite denials from Guaidó. Goudreau has produced evidence showing the opposition hired his Florida-based security company Silvercorp and has sued anti-government operators for breach of contract.  Mancuso additionally testified that the AUC buried at least 200 bodies in mass graves inside Venezuelan territory in the early 2000s. The former paramilitary chief said that practice emerged after communities inside Colombia started to speak out against the incineration of victims in crematoriums as part of an effort to disappear bodies. Following Mancuso’s claims, Colombia and Venezuela announced that the two countries had agreed to “immediately” work together to help find the remains.

"assassination","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 12:00:38","KASHMIR NEWS TRUST #KNT  Police claimed to have solved the assassination case of Mirwaiz Molvi Farooq.  Addressing a press conference on Tuesday ADGP R K Swain said that out of 4 accused involved in the assassination of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, two were killed in the encounters and two others on the run were arrested and handed over to CBI who will now face trial.  He identified the two arrested accused as Javaid Ahmed Bhat alias late Habibullah, a resident of Solina, presently living at Azad Basti Natipora and Zahoor Ahmed Bhat son of Muhammad Ramzan, of Dandarkha Batamaloo.  “Four persons were involved in the killing. All the four were run. Two accused Abdullah Bangroo and Rehman Shigan were killed in the encounter. The two other accused Javaid and Zahoor went to Pakistan and then Nepal and were finally arrested and handed over to CBI and now they will face the trial,” he said adding that Zahoor was the main accused.  He said one accused Ayoub Dar has been already facing conviction in this case registered at Police Station Nigeen and then the same case was handed over to CBI. “His conviction was challenged in the Supreme Court but the court upheld the conviction.”  Meanwhile, police have issued a detailed press statement claiming that SIA of J&K Police has tracked & arrested two absconding militants involved in killing of Mirwaiz Farooq and both the militants have been handed over to CBI to face trial.    Police said that 5 militants were involved in the killing. Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan had got killed in encounters and couldn’t face trial. Ayub Dar underwent trial and convicted for life, currently serving sentence in Srinagar central jail. Javaid Bhat & Zahoor Bhat were absconding and hence escaped trial and they both have been apprehended. The duo had gone underground and during all these years were variously hiding in Nepal and Pakistan among other places before surreptitiously returning back to Kashmir a few years ago. Maintaining a low profile, changing addresses and shifting residences, they avoided the gaze of law enforcement agencies.  Accused in CBI case RC0501990S008 (pertaining to killing of Mirwaiz Farooq) they are now liable to immediately face trial in a designated TADA court in Delhi which has already completed the trial in respect of one of the five accused namely Ayub Dar code Ishfaq son of Late Abdul Ahad Dar of Rawalpora of Srinagar who has been convicted and serving a life sentence. Two other absconding accused found guilty in the killing of Mirwaiz, Abdullah Bangroo and Abdul Rehman Shigan, got killed in encounters with security forces in the 1990s.  According to police statement, on 21 May 1990, Mirwaiz Farooq, the head priest of Kashmir was killed by militants of Hizbul Mujahideen accusing him of being a ‘peacenik’ and an ‘Indian agent’.  Case FIR No 61/1990 came to be registered in Police Station Nageen, Srinagar to investigate the crime. Thereafter the government of the day transferred the investigation to CBI on 11 June 1990.  After a long and arduous legal process of investigation and prosecution, the designated TADA court, in 2009, convicted the only arrested accused Ayub Dar for life. The remaining four remained on run. While two (Abdullah Bangroo & Rehman Shigan) died in encounters, Javaid Bhat and Ayub Bhat managed to evade arrest.    Ayub Dar, the convicted militant and one of the killers appealed against his conviction, which however, was upheld by the Division Bench of Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.535 of 2009 on 21 July 2010.  Before killing Mirwaiz, all the five HM militants had gone to Pakistan for militant training in 1990. Back in Srinagar, Abdullah Bangroo received instructions in April 1990 from his ISI handler in Pakistan to eliminate Mirwaiz.    Paraphrased excerpts from Supreme Court order:  In the year 1990 itself, in the month of April, accused Abdullah Bangroo, Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq, who belongs to Hizbul Mujahideen, entered into a criminal conspiracy to eliminate Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Accused Abdulla Bangroo, who was then heading Hizbul Mujahideen, instructed Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan and Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq to plan elimination of Mirwaiz Moulvi Farooq. Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan was then working as an Area Commander of Hizbul-Mujahideen in the downtown area of Srinagar; whereas the Javed was working as a Group Commander in that very area. Later on, Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal also joined the conspiracy. It came out in the investigation that, in the second week of May, 1990, under the instructions of Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan, Mohd. Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq and Abdul Rehman Shigan alias Inayat had visited the residence of Moulvi Farooq at Nageen, Srinagar and had requested him for financial help to their militant organization i.e. Hizbul Mujahideen. Moulvi Farooq had agreed to help them and had asked them to meet after 2/3 days during the morning hours. Thereafter, two accused surveyed the area as per their plan and informed the details to Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Ajmal Khan. It was on 21.05.1990 that the three accused namely Mohd Ayub Dar alias Ishfaq , Abdul Rehman Shingan alias Inayat and Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal alias Jana armed with loaded pistol visited the `Mirwaiz Manzil’ at Nageen. Accused Javed Ahmed Bhat alias Bilal had instructed the appellant that, out of the three accused persons, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal would fire on Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons namely Ayub Dar and Abdul Rehman Shingan were to provide cover to Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal.  As per the plan, they all reached the gate of Mirwaiz Manzil and met Maqbool Shah, the gate-keeper and informed him that they wanted to meet Moulvi Farooq. Maqbool Shah then asked Gulam Qadir Sofi, the gardener, to take them to the Personal Assistant as he himself was going to the market.  Accordingly, the gardener – Ghulam Qadir Sofi took the three to the Personal Assistant namely Saidur Rehman , who asked them about their names and one of them disclosed his fake name as Gulzar Farooq R/o. Batmaloo. That name was written by the Personal Assistant on a slip of paper and the said slip was sent inside the room of Moulvi Farooq through the gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. After sometime, Moulvi Farooq called the three accused inside the Office, on which Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal entered the room of Moulvi Farooq and the remaining two accused persons including Javed Bhat took position in the PA’s room. On entering the room of Moulvi Farooq, Zahoor Ahmed alias Bilal fired several rounds on Moulvi Farooq from his pistol and immediately, accused Inayat also fired from his pistol in the air while coming out of PA’s room, which hit the outside wall of the Office. On hearing the sound of firing, the gardener came inside the Office and tried to catch hold of Ishfaq, who was trying to escape.  However, all the accused persons escaped giving a push to the Gardener Ghulam Qadir Sofi. Accused Bilal also tried to run away, but he was caught by Ghulam Qadir Sofi. There was a scuffle between the two, in which Bilal sustained an injury below his right eye. Later, after firing one round from his pistol, Bilal also managed to escape. The accused persons ran towards Kashmir University, who were followed by Ghulam Qadir Sofi upto the main road and near the University Gate, the assailants ran towards Soura through the University compound and reached Chatargam in the afternoon of 21.05.1990. They then reported killing of Moulvi Farooq to Abdulla Bangroo. All the three accused persons were directed by Abdullah Bangroo, to go underground for sometime.  During trail running for several years, it could be established that the militant who pulled the trigger on Mirwaiz Farooq on the fateful day on the directions of then HM commander Abdullah Bangroo was Zahoor Bhat who ironically succeeded in evading arrest by going into hiding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV0d29ya2tudC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS9wb2xpY2UtaXNzdWVzLXN0YXRlbWVudC1hYm91dC10aGUtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbi1jYXNlLW9mLW1pcndhaXotbW9sdmktZmFyb29xL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kennedy.  “I released a lot, as you know. And I will release everything else,” former Trump said of the JFK files, in an interview Monday with The Messenger.  This comes after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., nephew of the late President Kennedy, blamed the CIA for his uncle’s assassination in 1963.  The Democratic presidential candidate made the controversial remarks during an interview with John Catsimatidis on his WABC 770 AM show Cats Roundtable in early May.  “I think there is overwhelming evidence that the CIA was involved in his murder,” Kennedy said.  “I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt at this point,” he said. “The evidence is overwhelming that the CIA was involved in the murder and in the cover-up.”  The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 states that government records concerning the death of JFK “should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination.”  During Trump’s time in office, he released some documents but not all the records.  In a statement released in 2018, Trump said, “I agree with the Archivist’s recommendation that the continued withholdings are necessary to protect against identifiable harm to national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.”  “I am also ordering agencies to re-review each of those redactions over the next three years,” he said.  About 4,300 records remain redacted, according to the CIA.  When interviewed by The Messenger, Trump was asked about whether the public has anything to worry about if the records harm America’s international reputation.  “Well, I don’t want to comment on that. But I will tell you that I have released a lot. I will release the remaining portion very early in my term,” Trump said.

"assassination","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 17:57:01","May 16, 2023  A member of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq’s parliament said he survived an assassination attempt on Monday, though a Kurdish military commander later disputed the account. The ordeal occurred amid tensions and dialogue between the two main Kurdish parties in northern Iraq.  What happened: Karwan Gaznay, a member of the Kurdistan parliament for the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), said in a tweet on Tuesday that he ""survived an assassination attempt” the night prior. His driver was injured and they are “waiting for the reaction of the government,” per the tweet.  The incident took place in the town of Koya located in Erbil province. It is under investigation, according to the PUK-affiliated Esta news agency.  The Kurdish news outlet NRT, which is affiliated with the opposition New Generation party, reported that the shooting occurred around 10 p.m. local time on Monday at a checkpoint manned by Kurdish internal security forces known as Asayish.    NRT later reported on Wednesday that Zana Khalid, a commander in the region's peshmerga forces, disputed Gaznay's account of the incident. Khalid, an affiliate of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), said the confrontation occurred when Gaznay's vehicle crashed into his own vehicle and Gaznay's driver began hurling insults.  Sulaimaniyah province is controlled by the PUK, while Erbil province is controlled by the KDP. The KDP is the largest party in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), followed by the PUK. Koya, where the shooting occurred, is close to the border separating the two parties’ territories.  Why it matters: The shooting occurred at a time of significant tensions between the KDP and the PUK. Tensions between the two parties are not new but were raised significantly in October when PUK counterterrorism officer Hawkar Jaf was killed in a car bombing in Erbil.  The current tensions have multiple dimensions. One area where the two parties disagree is over energy policy, specifically the KRG’s independent oil exports, according to Aras Masifi, an independent Kurdish blogger.  “The PUK believes it has had little say and involvement in the KRG's oil policy in recent years,” Masifi told Al-Monitor. “That is why the PUK advocates a common uniform energy policy with Baghdad in the hope of being able to have more say and participation in Baghdad.”  The tensions over oil have worsened since the March decision by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce that ruled Turkey had to pay damages to Iraq for accepting unauthorized oil imports from the Kurdistan Region. The decision relates to the Baghdad-based federal government’s efforts to exert its authority over the KRG’s independent oil sector. Much of the region’s oil is in KDP territory.  “Especially after the Paris court decision, the PUK has become louder and clearer in its pro-Baghdad rhetoric,” said Masifi.  The KDP currently holds the positions of prime minister and president in the KRG, while senior PUK member Qubad Talabani is deputy prime minister. The tensions also relate to the division of power within the KRG, according to Masifi.  “(Talabani) believes he has little power to fill government posts. But the PUK would also like more autonomy from the KDP/Erbil when it comes to the budget and procurement law for large construction projects,” he said.  The two parties have also been fighting over the region’s election laws and when to hold parliamentary elections, which are now scheduled to take place in November. PUK officials stopped attending KRG Cabinet meetings last December due to the tensions, according to the KDP-affiliated news outlet Rudaw.  The assassination attempt on Syrian Kurdish leader Mazlum Kobane in Sulaimaniyah last month further exacerbated tensions between the two parties. Kobane blamed Turkey for the attack, though the country denied this. The KDP is historically close to Turkey, while the PUK has good relations with Kobane’s Syrian Democratic Forces, as well as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The PUK blamed the KDP for the attack on Kobane, Amberin Zaman reported for Al-Monitor at the time.  The attack on Gaznay is not the first to occur amid these tensions. NRT reported a “noticeable rise” in shootings, kidnappings and physical assaults during the month of April. The outlet pointed to the assault of Erbil-based lawyer Mohammed Sofi and the killing of KDP official Abdullah Kuekha Mubarak’s son, among other incidents.  “Tensions between the two ruling parties of the Kurdistan Region have provided opportunities for some to settle scores, exploiting the deteriorating security situation,” NRT reported.  A particularly high number of political assassinations have occurred in Sulaimaniyah since 2021.  Know more: The intra-Kurdish tensions in Iraq could dissipate soon. On Sunday, PUK ministers returned to the Cabinet meetings. The Cabinet promptly passed a measure to centralize revenues, expenditures and salaries across the region. This had been a demand of the PUK, according to Rudaw.  On Tuesday, PUK and KDP political leaders met again in Sulaimaniyah to discuss the November elections.  Editor's note: this article was updated on May 17, 2023 to include a dispute of Gaznay's assassination attempt claim.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLW1vbml0b3IuY29tL29yaWdpbmFscy8yMDIzLzA1L2lyYXFpLWt1cmRpc2gtcG9saXRpY2lhbi1zdXJ2aXZlcy1hc3Nhc3NpbmF0aW9uLWF0dGVtcHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","1995-11-05","Not Discerned","{""Jerusalem"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Israel""}","Tue 16 May 2023 21:26:00","The political leaders, defense establishment and much of the public appear to have found a new-old love: targeted assassinations. This is the obvious conclusion from all the pride and boasting about the assassination of six top Islamic Jihad commanders. If this is the main accomplishment of Operation Shield and Arrow, then Israeli policy toward the Palestinians, and on Gaza in particular, is in quite a sorry state.  Once upon a time, the defense establishment – the Mossad, Shin Bet and IDF – held an ambivalent attitude toward the use of assassinations as a tool for fighting the enemy, whether enemy countries or terrorist groups, and the tactic was always considered a last resort.  The first targeted assassination was carried out by Israel in 1956, when Unit 154 (today Unit 504) of army intelligence, which ran agents on Israel’s borders, sent a package bomb into Gaza that killed Colonel Mustafa Hafez, an Egyptian intelligence officer who dispatched fedayeen cells into Israel.  In the 1960s, there were several assassination operations by the Mossad – against German scientists who aided Egypt’s armaments program, and against Herberts Cukurs, a Nazi war criminal known as the “Butcher of Riga.” A Mossad cell assassinated him in 1965 in Montevideo, Uruguay.  After the Six-Day War, the intelligence community resumed using targeted assassinations, but only sparingly. The Mossad sent cells of fighters to assassinate Palestinian terrorists in Europe in response to terror attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets abroad, like the murder of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972.  In the same era, Shin Bet operatives were operating in the West Bank and Gaza, either directly or indirectly through Palestinian agents. In the 1970s, and to a greater degree following the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, Israel also began assassinating Palestinian and Hezbollah militants.  Open gallery view A child carrying a poster of Hezbollah commander Imad Mughniyeh during his Beirut funeral in 2008. Credit: Reuters  But the big change in the targeted assassination policy came in the wake of the second intifada, when Avi Dichter was leading the Shin Bet. The tactic became very widely used. Hundreds of militants were assassinated by a variety of methods, and the latest technologies were incorporated in the effort – such as drones and, later, suicide drones.  Occasionally, radical proposals were suggested during discussions at the highest political and military levels, such as targeting Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein for assassination. This was after the 1991 Gulf War in which 39 Scud missiles were fired at Israeli cities. The preparations for this operation, for which Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin likely would not have given final approval in any case, were halted in the wake of the Tze’elim disaster in which five Sayeret Matkal fighters were killed during training for the operation.  But Israel has never determined whether targeted assassinations are an effective policy that serves a worthy purpose, or merely the result of a desire for vengeance. Fifty years ago, after Mossad agents shot and killed a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway in a case of mistaken identity, there was urgent discussion in the security establishment about whether the assassination tactic should continue to be used. David Kimche, the future deputy Mossad chief, told me at the time that the Mossad should not be in the business of assassinating enemies because “We’re not a mafia, we’re not Murder, Inc.”  The first and only attempt to seriously address this issue was by a subcommittee of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee following the failed assassination attempt of Hamas official Khaled Meshal in Amman in 1997. Members of the subcommittee that investigated the failed operation included Yossi Sarid, Benny Begin, Ori Orr and Uzi Landau. Much of its report, in which it attempted to formulate something like a “targeted assassinations doctrine” – when, under what circumstances, and against whom this tactic should be used – remains classified.  The committee, as well as outside experts, appear to have basically agreed that assassinations, particularly outside of Israel, are only appropriate in exceptional circumstances. The most prominent example of this is the assassination, attributed to the Mossad and CIA, of Hezbollah “defense minister” Imad Mughniyeh by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. Since then, Hezbollah has struggled to find a worthy replacement for Mughniyeh, who was considered especially skilled in devising terrorist operations throughout the Middle East, not only against Israeli targets.  In its concluding remarks, the 1997 subcommittee wrote, “Over the years, Israel’s governments have not clearly formulated a policy for combating terrorist organizations that is based on rigorous thought and consistent logic. In the absence of a clear doctrine for anti-terrorist activity, the component of response to terror attacks has taken on great and damaging weight.” Evidently, none of Israel’s governments over the past quarter-century have read this spot-on assessment, or if they did, they immediately forgot it.  One way this may be seen is in the series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists that are attributed to the Mossad since 2009, the most recent being the 2019 assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s top nuclear scientist.  But it's even more apparent in the policy Israel has employed in recent years in successive operations in Gaza. From one operation to the next, as Israel’s frustration mounts, so does the blind faith and stagnant thinking that targeted assassinations will solve the problem. For some ministers and security chiefs, targeted assassination have become the ultimate method and a substitute for a real strategy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oYWFyZXR6LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMjMtMDUtMTcvdHktYXJ0aWNsZS1vcGluaW9uLy5wcmVtaXVtL2lzcmFlbHMtdGFyZ2V0ZWQtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGlvbnMtYXJlLWEtcG9vci1zdWJzdGl0dXRlLWZvci1hLXN0cmF0ZWd5LzAwMDAwMTg4LTI1YWYtZDE4Yi1hNzlkLTI1ZmZiMTRjMDAwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It was unclear for many years who had killed him, with the Official IRA initially blamed as well as false allegations he had been behind two murders.  His son Paul has emphasised the importance of clearing his father’s name both in a Historical Enquiries Team report and an acknowledgement by the UVF that their information had been flawed.  The UVF’s involvement became clear in 1977 when Raymond Glover, a man with UVF connections, confessed to the killing and was jailed.

Protests against the decision to release him are also planned in Islamabad  Lahore (Pakistan) (AFP) – Several thousand pro-government protesters demanded Monday the resignation of Pakistan's top judge for releasing Imran Khan from arrest last week, as the former prime minister went back to court facing yet more legal cases.  Advertising Read more  Khan, who was ousted from power in April last year, was arrested on corruption charges on Tuesday following months of simmering political crisis, prompting his voters to rampage through cities.  His arrest was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court's chief justice and Khan was later released and granted various protective bail applications.  ""The chief justice and a few of his cronies are disgracing the judiciary like never before. Their justice seems to be serving one leader only,"" said Malik Hassam Mehmood, a 36-year-old trader and supporter of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's party.  ""We are here to protest for the rule of law and a non-partisan judiciary.""  There was a heavy security presence in the capital on Monday as protesters gathered outside the court in the capital's so-called red zone.  The Supreme Court order said Khan's arrest last week as he arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a bail application in the graft case ""violated the petitioner's right of access to justice"".  However, referring to the pro-government protesters, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said on Sunday that ""people want to come in very large numbers because of a deep sense of anger and anguish"".  Analysts say legal hurdles are often used to discourage dissent in Pakistan and Khan dismisses the cases arrayed against him as politically motivated.  Political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi said judges were split down the middle over the political crisis.  ""The judiciary still makes compromises with both civilians and the military, but on many issues judges have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to take a stand and hold their ground,"" he told AFP.  Tussle with military  Former international cricket star Khan returned to the Lahore High Court on Monday, where his lawyers said they were seeking information on fresh cases linking him to the violence that followed his arrest. The case will continue Tuesday.  Khan was accompanied by his wife, Bushra Bibi, who was granted protective bail in the same corruption case that led to the former leader's arrest.  Their team erected a white curtain between their vehicle and the courtroom to shield the couple from the media.  At least nine people were killed, hundreds of police officers injured and more than 7,000 people detained in last week's unrest before Khan was released on bail on Friday, authorities said.  Sanaullah, who has vowed Khan will be rearrested, told reporters on Sunday the ""terrorism and mobbing was all preplanned and this was done by Khan"".  Elections are due no later than October and Khan has held a series of vastly popular marches challenging the authority of the shaky coalition of parties that replaced him.  He has also waged an unprecedented campaign of defiance against Pakistan's army, which has ruled for nearly half of Pakistan's 75-year history and continues to wield massive influence.  When Khan surged into office in 2018, most understood it was with the backing of the generals. Analysts likewise said when he left power it was because he had fallen out of favour with the top brass.  In opposition Khan has made explosive claims about the military's involvement in politics, including that they plotted a November assassination attempt in which he was shot in the leg while campaigning for fresh polls.  His arrest last Tuesday came just hours after he repeated the allegations at a rally.  © 2023 AFP","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTUtcGFraXN0YW4tZXgtcG0ta2hhbi1kdWUtYmFjay1pbi1jb3VydC1hZnRlci13ZWVrLW9mLXVucmVzdNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMzA1MTUtcGFraXN0YW4tZXgtcG0ta2hhbi1kdWUtYmFjay1pbi1jb3VydC1hZnRlci13ZWVrLW9mLXVucmVzdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 06:26:18","Listen to this story:  ROME – In what’s been taken as the latest turning point in Pope Francis’s campaign to empower laity in the Catholic Church, on Saturday the pontiff issued a new fundamental law for the Vatican City State which, for the first time, allows both lay men and women to sit on its governing commission.  Heretofore, that commission had been composed entirely of cardinals. The move complements a similar change Francis made in his new constitution for the Roman Curia last year, which decreed that a lay person, man or woman, can head a curial department. (The Roman Curia assists the pope in governing the universal church, while the Vatican City State administers the pope’s physical territory.)  In that sense, the new fundamental law, which replaces one issued by Pope John Paul II in 2000, is indeed a watershed for the lay role. In this case, however, it’s probably one which should also come with a warning.  As opposed to the Roman Curia, it’s hardly a novelty for laity to have a share in governing the pope’s physical territory. During the era of the Papal States, when popes ruled over a swath of central Italy as a temporal monarch, the head of government nominally was always the Cardinal Secretary of State, but the pope generally would appoint a Minister of the Interior who actually called the shots.  Over the years, sometimes that role was played by a cleric, but often it was a layman.  (As a footnote, it’s often said, erroneously, that popes lost their temporal powers in 1870 with the collapse of the Papal States amid Italian unification. Not so – what popes lost was territory, not power. With regard to the Vatican City State, the pope retains absolute civil authority to this day. Just to make sure no one misses the point, the new fundamental law specifies that the pope possesses “the fullness of the power of governance” as the “sovereign,” including “legislative, executive and judicial power.”)  That background brings us to the tale of the last layperson to exercise civil authority in the name of the pope: Pellegrino Rossi, who fate perhaps should serve as a cautionary tale for whoever his successors may be under Francis’s new scheme.  Born in Tuscany in 1787, Rossi studied law in Pisa and Bologna and became a celebrated professor and political thinker. After periods in Switzerland and France, he ended up as the personal envoy of King Louis Philippe I to the Papal States. After the king abdicated in February 1848, Rossi remained in Rome, and eventually was named the interior minister of the new pontiff Pope Pius IX in September of the same year.  By the time of Rossi’s appointment, revolutionary energies were stirring in Rome. Rossi was a federalist, meaning he believed in a federation of independent states on the Italian peninsula, including the full sovereignty of the Papal States, as opposed to the press for national unification then beginning to gather steam.  Although Rossi began efforts to modernize the pope’s civil administration, including plans for new railway miles and telegraph lines, it wasn’t enough for the revolutionaries, who were still seething over Pius IX’s famous allocution Non Semel, in which he made clear he would not join to military push to drive Austria out of northern Italy on the grounds that a pope could not go to war against a Catholic power.  Thus when Rossi arrived at Rome’s Piazza della Cancelleria at around 1:00 p.m. on November 15, 1848, for the opening of a session of the Chamber of Deputies in the Papal States, an assassin was waiting. As Rossi ascended the steps, a man emerged from the crowd and plunged a dagger into his throat. Eyewitness testimony was confused, as some said the assailant was wearing the uniform of a soldier, others that he was dressed as a parliamentarian. In any event, in chaos that followed, the killer was able to disappear.  Rossi staggered for a few steps, then fell to the ground dead.  His assassination set in motion a series of events which led to Pope Pius IX fleeing Rome to take refuge in Gaeta, a seaside town about 100 miles south, which at the time was part of the Bourbon Kingdom of Two Sicilies and a staunch ally of the papacy. Meanwhile in Rome a new revolutionary republic under Giuseppe Mazzini was declared, which would endure until the short-lived restoration of the pope’s secular authority in 1850.  By all accounts, Rossi was a gentle, urbane man of culture. Camillo Benso, the Count of Cavour, described Rossi in one of his letters as “the wittiest man in Italy, the most flexible genius of the age, perhaps the most practical mind in the universe.”  The great likelihood is that Rossi’s assassin had no real beef with him, but killed him as a blow against the pope he served.  Of course, it’s deeply improbable that restless denizens of the 108 acre territory the pope has left today would ever rise against one of his ministers in quite so violent a fashion. Knives in the back in the Vatican these days tend to be metaphorical, not literal.  Nevertheless, there’s still a sobering moral to this story: Anyone who wields authority in the name of the pope needs to know that sometimes, people upset with the pontiff may turn on you as a softer target.  In that light, perhaps the first lay person to sit on the new-fangled governing commission of the Vatican City State ought to make a trek to Rome’s Basilica of San Lorenzo in Damaso, where Rossi is entombed, and spend a moment in quiet prayer.  Uneasy, indeed, lies the head that wears even a share of the crown … whether that head, as it turns out, be clerical or lay.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY3J1eG5vdy5jb20vbmV3cy1hbmFseXNpcy8yMDIzLzA1L3BvcGVzLWxhdGVzdC13YXRlcnNoZWQtZm9yLWxhaXR5LXByb2JhYmx5LW91Z2h0LXRvLWNvbWUtd2l0aC1hLXdhcm5pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This violent response by the public is a result of the escalating wave of violence perpetrated by armed gangs in the country.  According to local residents cited by Le Nouvelliste, on Friday, two suspected bandits were killed by members of the population while attempting to hijack a cargo truck on the road to Nazón. The suspects were armed, and the residents took matters into their own hands to protect themselves.  On Saturday, police authorities arrested four suspected bandits in possession of ammunition and automatic weapons in Gonaives. However, the situation took a gruesome turn when members of the population forcibly took custody of the suspects, subjecting them to stoning before setting them on fire. This represents the first time such an action has occurred in Gonaives since the emergence of the “Bwa kale” movement.  In a separate incident, on Monday, alleged bandit Abouló, a member of the “Nou se revolisyonè” group operating in the Raboto district, was arrested in Biennac. He was apprehended alongside two others, Ady Gaston and Poristène Byron. The police confiscated firearms and cell phones from them. Abouló faces charges of multiple murders and the burning of the city’s courthouse.  The Bwa kale movement has gained momentum in the capital and various provinces of Haiti. Comprised of members of the population, this movement takes matters into its own hands through acts of lynching against suspected bandits. The rise of such vigilantism reflects the frustration and desperation of the people in the face of rampant gang violence in the country.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RvbWluaWNhbnRvZGF5LmNvbS9kci93b3JsZC8yMDIzLzA1LzE1L3RoZS1yZXZlbmdlLW9mLXRoZS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLXNpeC1hbGxlZ2VkLWJhbmRpdHMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGVkLWFuZC1vbmUtaW1wcmlzb25lZC1pbi1oYWl0aS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9kb21pbmljYW50b2RheS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3M_aWQ9MTkwODQ5JnRpdGxlPXRoZS1yZXZlbmdlLW9mLXRoZS1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLXNpeC1hbGxlZ2VkLWJhbmRpdHMtYXNzYXNzaW5hdGVkLWFuZC1vbmUtaW1wcmlzb25lZC1pbi1oYWl0aQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This unsolved crime has badly impacted the country’s fortunes in press freedom.  The late Suale, a member of investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas’ Tiger Eye PI, and was shot in January 2019.  Many have suggested that the killing may be linked to his work, which has ruffled very powerful feathers, leading to his assassination.  On the back of this, Mr Mahama says “We shall speed up the investigation of the assassination of Ahmed Suale and the perpetrators shall surely be brought to book.”  This came up during the NDC leader’s first official address since winning the flagbearership race in the National Democratic Congress’ just-ended primaries.  Addressing the gathering at the University of Development Studies (UDS) in Tamale he explained that the protection of the media will be a priority for his administration if given the nod in the 2024 elections.  “The media must also be given the conducive and collaborative atmosphere to operate as the fourth power that they ought to be without threats, harassment, and assassinations,” he added on Monday.

"assassination","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Gaza"", ""Gaza"", ""GazaStrip""}","Sun 14 May 2023 18:02:38","Courtesy of: Al-Jarmaq News  A truce agreement mediated by Egypt brought a stop to 10 days of fire between the Gaza Strip and Israel on Saturday night.  During the flare-up in fighting that followed the death of imprisoned Palestinian activist Khader Adnan, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 Palestinians, while rockets from the Gaza Strip killed two civilians in Israeli-occupied territory.  Negotiations on a truce agreement, said two sources close to mediation efforts conducted by Cairo, were rendered complex due to Israel conducting multiple targeted assassinations, killing several senior members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Organization, despite officials in Tel Aviv having previously made pledges to stop the use of targeted assassinations.  At least six members of the Gaza-based organization were killed by the Israeli army in under a week, many of them members of the Islamic Jihad’s senior military council. A seventh official and his aide were also reportedly killed, though the group has yet to officially confirm the additional deaths.  Ten Palestinian civilians were also killed by Israeli airstrikes that were conducted in densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.  Two civilians were killed in Israel by returning fire from the strip, where Al-Quds Brigades, the military arm of Islamic Jihad, said that “the Palestinian resistance launched a concentrated missile strike in two phases towards occupied Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.”    Israel’s prime minister and its national security advisor both thanked Cairo for its efforts to mediate the truce agreement, which came into effect on Saturday night.  But the conflict could be sparked again, said the first source. Israel’s current government — its most right-wing government so far — is subject to the hardline positions of its national security and finance ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, for whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must work hard to keep close. The right-wing Israeli government wanted to start and end the war without any long-term commitments, said the two sources speaking to Mada Masr on condition of anonymity, and there are limits to the pressure that Cairo is able to exert on the Palestinian factions.  Cairo has been working since May 10 toward reaching a ceasefire between the Israeli occupation forces and factions in the Gaza Strip. The talks, they said, were held with Israeli and Palestinian Islamic Jihad representatives in the Egyptian capital, in Gaza with representatives of Hamas and other political groups based in the besieged strip, and finally, in Israel, with political and security officials.  To establish consensus on a ceasefire, they said, Israel needed to clearly pledge in written form to stop pursuing assassinations and hand over the bodies of any assassinated Palestinian figures. Palestinian factions, meanwhile, were obliged to publicly accept a truce — not just a ceasefire — and to accept Egyptian supervision to neutralize rocket launch capabilities from Gaza.  Egypt had to use “clear” language with Israel about the risks of “playing with fire,” said the first source, who was very close to the mediation efforts, given that Israel moved to expand its targeted assassinations. Egypt also requested that the United States and Europe pressure Israel to respond to mediation efforts, the two sources said.  Cairo “intensively moved at high levels” to avoid an escalation, said the first source, especially given the potential for the exchange of fire to take on regional dimensions.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian expressed support for the Palestinian resistance on Friday, announcing that he had made contact with Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas’ political bureau in Gaza. Hamas, the main faction operating armed resistance from the Gaza Strip, did not join the exchange of fire that broke out in May.  Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah also said on Friday that Hezbollah is communicating with groups in Gaza, saying, “We are monitoring the situation and its developments and providing assistance, and at any time we feel responsible to take any steps, we will not hesitate to do so.”  Groups in Gaza launched attacks on Israel following the May 2 death of Khader Adnan, a Palestinian activist jailed in Israel who starved to death following 87 days of hunger strike.  Riyad Mansour, Palestine’s permanent representative to the United Nations, called on Tuesday for serious and rapid measures to be taken to protect the Palestinian people and ensure their security, and to end the illegal Israeli colonial occupation and the apartheid regime that have been causing so much human suffering for decades and prevented the achievement of just and lasting peace and security in the region.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYWRhbWFzci5jb20vZW4vMjAyMy8wNS8xNC9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3NvdXJjZXMtZWd5cHQtbWVkaWF0ZWQtdHJ1Y2UtcmV2b2x2ZWQtYXJvdW5kLWlzcmFlbGktY29tbWl0bWVudC10by1zdG9wLWFzc2Fzc2luYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-14","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 18:56:05","PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti – On Sunday, Haitian politician Werley Nortreus said he will not encourage or advise citizens or investors from African countries to visit or invest in Haiti from now on because of the violence and killings that are happening everywhere in the country.  Haiti is the only country in the Caribbean or the world that the United Nations and other NGO organizations rank as the place with the most crime and gangs. Last week, the Haitian population along with the police killed and burned more than 20 residents who they said were gang members. Not counting other residents across the country who are killed on the pretext that they are gang members.  After the assassination of the former Haitian President in 2021, the U.S. and Canada were among the countries that ordered sanctions against the Haitian elites who sponsored the gangs despite proof that most of the powerful weapons are from the United States. A year later, the Dominican Republic ordered sanctions on former Prime Minister Claude Joseph for having a deep connection with the gangs. Canada’s Prime Minister even called on Europe and other continents to join his sanctions on powerful Haitian elites.  During the Presidency of former President Moise, crimes and kidnappings were very high. President Moise was criticized for not saying anything at all about high crimes and kidnappings during his administration. Since his assassination by Colombians and Haitian-Americans, crimes and kidnapping continued.  Since the killings of some individuals weeks ago, other residents across the country are not free or safe. There are currently allegations or conspiracy of killing unknown residents who come from another area. If the population catches an unknown resident from another area, there is a 98% chance that the population will kill and burn that resident.  According to several sources, there are many residents who are declared innocent by others who died this way. For now, no one in this country is safe because the population is mixed with armed people going around killing anyone they don’t recognize in an area even when they have no proof.  On Sunday, the Haitian politician Nortreus posted a safety alert publication on his Facebook account on the current crimes and assassinations across the country. He said he will not advise any citizens or investors from African countries to visit Haiti right now because there are many acts of violence and assassinations everywhere in the country.  “My concern on the current situation in Haiti. As a young Haitian politician who has friends and associates across the African continent, I will not advise citizens from African countries or investors to visit Haiti or invest right now because of violence and assassinations. Right now, this country is currently not safe to visit or invest in. Wait until the violence and assassinations go away to visit or invest”, Nortreus said on what is currently happening in Haiti in order to save lives.  According to several other reports, among the dead individuals from past weeks to today, there are several innocent residents who died along with the ones that the population and police classified as gang members due to fraudulent identity. Right now, no one is safe and any foreigners can get killed and burned.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL2hhaXRpYW4tcG9saXRpY2lhbi1hZHZpc2VzLWFmcmljYS1jaXRpemVucy1hbmQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW5vdC10by12aXNpdC1oYWl0aS1kdWUtdG8tY3JpbWVzLXRoZXJlL9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vc2ZsY24uY29tL2hhaXRpYW4tcG9saXRpY2lhbi1hZHZpc2VzLWFmcmljYS1jaXRpemVucy1hbmQtaW52ZXN0b3JzLW5vdC10by12aXNpdC1oYWl0aS1kdWUtdG8tY3JpbWVzLXRoZXJlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"assassination","2023-05-08","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 17:28:00","The opening strike of Operation Shield and Arrow that killed three Palestinian Islamic Jihad commanders in Gaza last Monday has reignited the ongoing debate on the legality of targeted killings.  Israel, like other states, is bound to international law. Some of its obligations are due to treaties, but there is also customary IHL -- generally accepted practices by states, who treat the practice as if it were law. Israel has adopted the Geneva Conventions, save for the Additional Protocols, but the High Court of Justice sees them as customary law. This shows how important the repeated practices of other states are in IHL.  Targeted killings are a somewhat ill-defined term. There is no set definition under International Humanitarian Law (IHL). Some sources treat it as merely a softer term than assassination, still others describe it as a military strike against a specific person -- in particular that of terrorists.  The International Committee of the Red Cross says that targeted killing is ""The intentional and premeditated use of lethal force, by a State or organized armed group against a specific individual outside their physical custody.""  This, like other definitions, can be applied to most other applications of military force. It is not exclusive to a particular legal or illegal action.  In Israel, it generally refers to a policy of targeting of the top echelons of terrorist organizations. Yet this can also be seen as a natural military action in the course of war, rather than a distinct category under IHL.  Palestinian rescue workers inspect a house where Islamic Jihad commander Ahmed Abu Daqqa was killed in an Israeli strike, in the southern Gaza Strip May 11, 2023 (credit: REUTERS/IBRAHEEM ABU MUSTAFA)  How does international humanitarian law consider targeted killings?  There do exist tools within the IHL framework to determine the legality of a military strike.  There is little that differentiates the opening blow of Shield and Arrow from strikes conducted later in the operation, save for the ongoing launching of rockets from Gaza. This creates a question of military necessity, one of the main principles of IHL.  The IDF argues that there was an impending threat from the Islamic Jihad commanders, and this created military necessity to strike. Killing the commanders reduced the capabilities of the organization to conduct terrorist attacks.  Yet it could also be argued that it has become customary in IHL for terrorist leaders to demand killing over a more general threat posed to a state. It is disputed whether Osama Bin Laden presented an immediate threat to the United States of America when then-president Barack Obama ordered his killing. The US contended he was still operationally active, but cited no active field operation. There was little to no backlash over this action. The killing of Gazan PIJ leaders could likewise be seen as having degraded terrorist effort in part of a sequential attack, or war, against Israel and its citizens.  In the discussion of targeted killings, sometimes the question is one of distinction. Under this principle of IHL, one differentiate between civilians and combatants in attacks, and take necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties.  The status of Gazan terrorists is a matter of debate. Some argue that terrorists are unlawful combatants, but retain the status of civilians. This means they are only considered combatants when they are directly involved in direct hostilities. In state armed forces, High ranking officers who do not fight and only command and plan far from the battlefield are generally considered legitimate targets. This likely means that the action of ordering and planning could be considered a direct hostile action.  Yet non-state armed groups are also bound by IHL in both international and non-international conflicts. These commanders were part of an organized military force that had a hierarchy, insignias and uniform. Many treat Gaza as a de facto state, and the terrorist organizations as de facto state military forces. Western states targeted leaders of the Islamic State with increasing regularity, treating them as if they were members of an opposing armed force of recognized combatants.  Unlike in the West Bank, it is difficult to argue that Gazans are under occupation, which would mean that they lack that unlawful combatants have the same protections in that state of conflict.  Some are quick to point out that even if there is no debate about whether Islamic Jihad commanders are legitimate targets under IHL as combatants, the Israeli strikes also took the lives of the terrorists' civilian family members.  This is a matter of applying the principle of proportionality. The military advantage of a strike must exceed the potential risk of damage to civilians. This is determined by a reasonable commander using the best information at the time.  It is difficult to determine without full access to the extent of the impending threat, and understanding how the commanders fit into the PIJ hierarchy, to determine if the value of the military degradation was greater than the risk to civilians.  These IHL principles of proportionality, distinction and military necessity should be applied to all such targeted killings -- as they are to all IDF military strikes.  Therein lies the problem with the debate about targeted killings: Despite discussion of premeditation and accuracy, the term is more of a nebulous pejorative used to cast aspersion on a military action rather than carefully explore and weigh the facts of the individual incident.  It has become a label for if one approves of a military strike against a terrorist or not. It is a label that applies to some states, like Israel, and rarely questioned when used by others.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzA0MNIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vaXNyYWVsLW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMwNDAvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Posting on Twitter using one of his accounts, Tinoedza Zvimwe, Charamba claimed Mnangagwa was invited to Charles III’s coronation on 06 May 2023 after he saved the latter from assassination by Rhodesians. He wrote:  Charles, now King Charles III, would have been killed by Rhodesians, except for a tip-off from a Rhodesian intelligence officer to the current President, then as state security minister. That all explains why ED had to be at King Charles’ coronation, and why relations with the UK are fated for a reset under President ED! Enjoy!  Meanwhile, some social media users mocked Mnangagwa saying he was snubbed during King Charles III’s coronation in London on Saturday.  However, ZANU PF spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa said that Mnangagwa was not part of the heads of State and government who had a photo opportunity with King Charles III because Zimbabwe is not a Commonwealth member.  Speaking on the sidelines of the burial of national hero Abraham Kabasa in Harare on Monday, Mutsvangwa said:  We are not a member of the Commonwealth, the President is determined that we should be readmitted into the group of nations.  Mutsvangwa added that Zimbabwe does not have the right to get close and personal with the king as it is not a Commonwealth member. He said:  But as for Zimbabwe, we did not have the right because we are not yet a member of the grouping. When we become a member, we would be part of those who will be close to the king. We want to engage with countries that we have cordial relationships and re-engage those we have had frosty relationships with in the past. Our President always says we are friends to all and enemies to none. We were happy that our President was invited to King Charles III’s coronation. When he was still a prince, he lowered the Union Jack (British flag) and raised the Zimbabwean flag after we had won the liberation struggle in 1980. It’s a person who we like a lot and it was imperative for the President to attend. This shows that the engagement between Harare and London is going in a good direction.

"assassination","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Sun 14 May 2023 15:13:36","Some gunmen suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network, the militant wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra, have reportedly killed two brothers and set their house ablaze in Aba, Abia State, southeast Nigeria.  The two brothers identified as Aaron Onuoha, 41 and Obinechi Samuel Onuoha, 35, were gruesomely assassinated in their family house at Ohanku by Udoka Street/Amucha, off Ngwa Road on Wednesday morning.  SaharaReporters gathered that the assailants who were reportedly numbering over 50 and wore black attire, invaded the house at about 1:20 am. They were said to have surrounded the house and cut off the electricity supply before some of them stormed the compound and killed the brothers.  According to sources, the assailants also burnt the house.  Samuel was a fashion designer based in Aba, while Aaron was a builder and a sculptor, who was based in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.  Aaron had visited his brother on Tuesday evening to discuss family matters.  The hoodlums also allegedly attacked the Chief Security Officer of the area and burnt the security post.  A source told SaharaReporters that the CSO narrowly escaped being killed by the assailants.  A close associate of the late Samuel who spoke to SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, revealed that he was attacked last year by hoodlums suspected to be cultists but survived the attack.  ""In that particular attack, it was in the daytime and he saw the faces of those who tried to kill him,” the source said.  He continued, ""I find it unbelievable because that night when I got information about the incident, I rushed to the scene. And while I was going, I met several local security personnel at their checkpoints.  “So where were they when the brothers were being killed and their house set ablaze?""  According to him, he later heard a report that the assailants accused Samuel of giving out information to police about them and their hideouts.  He said, “I know that he had police friends who were working with the police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Aba.  ""Before his gruesome killing, I had on one occasion asked whether he gave information about bad boys to the police and he said no. According to him, when he was attacked the last time by some cult group, he went to RRS office to see some of his friends, especially his in-law and one of the cult guys that shot at him. He told the in-law that this one was among those that attacked him and that is all.""  The source, however, regretted that no security agent either from the police division around the area or the RSS unit intervened during the attack until the morning when the criminals had gone.  Also speaking to SaharaReporters, a sibling of the deceased brothers, Agbeze Onuoha confirmed the tragic incident and called on security agencies to fish out the perpetrators to ensure that they face justice.  Lamenting the incident, he said his late brothers left behind 10 children – five each. He asked how he would cope with caring for the wives and children left behind.  Narrating the unfortunate incident, Agbeze, an employee of Enugu Electricity Distribution Company in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, said, ""I came back to see my mother on Saturday and I was supposed to go back to my working station on Wednesday. Unfortunately, that early Wednesday morning, my phone rang; it was my nephew. He called to tell me that two of my brothers had been killed.  ""The elder one Aaron is living at Uyo in Akwa Ibom State but came back to see his brother in Aba on Tuesday and they were killed together. That is what I can say, I don't know what transpired. I just came to see our mother in Aba because my family is in Okigwe, Imo State while I am working in Abakaliki.  ""So when I got the report, I went there and saw what happened and reported to the police. They came and carried their corpses to the mortuary.""  He added that Samuel's wife who was present when the assailants killed the brother, said the killers drove her and her five children out of the house before burning it.  He said according to her, the assailants were more than 50 in number and were in black attire.  He added, ""From the information I gathered, their killers said Samuel was giving information to police where they are. Even the children said when they went to fetch water, some people were telling them that their father used to give information to the police about them.""  ""My family is demanding justice; the police should fish out their killers and make them pay for their crimes,"" he said.  Agbeze, however, noted that he had informed Aaron’s wife about the tragic incident, adding that he was “planning to bury them next week"".  When SaharaReporters contacted the spokesperson for the state police command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, for an update, he declined to comment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vc2FoYXJhcmVwb3J0ZXJzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE0L2d1bm1lbi1raWxsLXR3by1icm90aGVycy1hbGxlZ2VkbHktZ2l2aW5nLXBvbGljZS1pbmZvcm1hdGlvbi1hYmEtc291dGhlYXN0LW5pZ2VyaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
